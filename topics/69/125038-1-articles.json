That space station has very little EC initially, so the antenna can\u0027t complete transmission. The new mechanic about Science transmission should prevent data loss and restore Experiments, in case of interrupted transmission (unless partial is allowed). However, with your vessel that doesn\u0027t seem to work correctly (going to report this issue so it can be dealt with in future). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d advise to either wait for enough EC stored with the station, so the transmission can be completed, or to use the \u0022review data\u0022 button from the mobile lab action menu, and transmit data from the menu that appears. I tested and found both the above work correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cramtenahc","CreatedById":25140,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T22:46:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for help I think you\u0027d helped me understand why it didn\u0027t work \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kreutzkevic","CreatedById":146514,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T06:53:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got the same problem on at least two vessels.
