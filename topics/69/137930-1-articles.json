Something I noticed was that my Career save had a significantly better frame rate than a Sandbox save, even when the Career save have multiple ships and the Sandbox save was fresh. (Both stock and modded)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI decided to try test this out and find out if a particular mod was responsible for this, alas I couldn\u0027t find any evidence. I did however come across this and couldn\u0027t come up with any real reason as to why this is a thing:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nWith HUD: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/E0ARY9g\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/E0ARY9g\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWithout HUD (F2): \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/1MuzwkF\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/1MuzwkF\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nToggling between (F2): \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/9VvWOr4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/9VvWOr4\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nVideo showing the FPS drop:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/NFWCOitSov0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://youtu.be/NFWCOitSov0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried taking away the bulkier mods, but as far as I can tell this happens regardless of how many you have installed and only gets worse the more you install. What\u0027s interesting is my peak frame rate (the rate with no HUD) never dips to an unacceptable level, only when I turn the HUD back on does the frame rate take a crap. This problem appear to be cumulative and even happens in stock, hence my posting here.\u00A0As I include\u00A0more and more mods to the game the frame rate gets progressively lower unless I disable the HUD and then my FPS goes back to normal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf any mod creators or even a developer could answer this question I would be grateful as I\u0027m at a loss.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS: Does anyone know of a mod that is compatible with 1.1 that give me a seperate HUD on my second screen? I\u0027d happily gain more frames if it means tilting my head a little, thanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpecs:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWIndows 10\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI7 2600k\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8Gb DDR3 RAM\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInno3D GTX 780\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP: Steam\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-24T03:49:35Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2016 03:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by TheChiefMeat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
