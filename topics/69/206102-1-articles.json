What will happen is that, at seemingly random intervals, my framerate will drop from about 80-100 FPS down to less than 10 FPS. I first noticed this happening a few weeks ago and was a little annoyed by it, but it wasn\u0027t anything game-breaking. However, over time, this has gotten progressively worse, to the point that almost half the time I am pulling less than 10 frames per second. I don\u0027t believe that this has anything to do with my PC not being powerful enough to run KSP, as it exceeds all of the recommended system requirements. Some suggestions on possible courses of action would be appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMy PC specs:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EModel: \u003C/strong\u003EMSI Stealth GS66\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EProcessor: \u003C/strong\u003E10th Gen Intel Core i7- 10750h\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ERAM: \u003C/strong\u003E16 GB DDR4\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EGraphics: \u003C/strong\u003ENvidia RTX 2070 with Max-Q Design\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EVideo Memory: \u003C/strong\u003E8 GB DDR6\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EStorage: \u003C/strong\u003E1 TB SSD (792 GB available space)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steuben","CreatedById":77368,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-26T22:06:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAh alas, if only the solution was better specs.
