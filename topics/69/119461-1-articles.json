My question is simply since the pc I use isn\u0027t on the internet, so it\u0027s impossible to send error reports and as the game crashes so much, is there a way to stop it taking 20 minutes to generate error reports. No point in the game generating them since they can\u0027t be sent.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-27T20:01:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello brjanowich, sorry but this cannot be disabled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if you upload your KSP output_log.txt and dxdiag report we may be able to help you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"brjanowich","CreatedById":98769,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T00:06:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am not having a specifi problem. Just normal hic-cups that are to be expexted with a such a complex, unique, awsome game. It\u0027s just when I have a hic-cup it takes about 15 minutes for the report to genetate and release the game to reload it, since the computer I use it on is standalone, no point in waiting for a report to generate that can\u0027t be sent. No biggie. Awsome game. I play .23 something as I have not updated in a long time. Congrats on all your hard work, thought and time you put into ksp. Best realistic space sim out there. Keep up the good work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T09:59:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah it should never take that long, it shouldn\u0027t even take more than a second to write the crash log, so something must be wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
