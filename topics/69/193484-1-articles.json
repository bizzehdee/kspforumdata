Does this happen with other games? Which version of KSP are you using, and what are the specs of your PC (you can find those at the very top of the KSP.txt log file inside the Kerbal Space Program directory)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile you have the KSP.txt file open, search for crash, exc or err which might help track down the point where it crashes and why.
