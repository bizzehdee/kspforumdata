You can take a screenshot by pressing F1 in the game and then finding that picture in your KSP directory under a folder marked \u0022Screenshots.\u0022 Then upload that picture to a photo sharing site like Imgur.com then paste a link from there into your post here so we can see what these parts look like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat you may be noticing is that the KSP developers have been updating several of the parts recently to modernize their appearance. You could just be seeing the new revamped textures in place of the old models.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr perhaps you are using a mod that replaces some of the models. Mods like Stockalike Station Parts Expansion, Ven\u0027s Revamp, and ReStock will change out the default textures for a new look to many stock parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-01-27T23:48:42Z\u0022 title=\u002201/27/2020 11:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 27, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by HvP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cat12","CreatedById":202504,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-06T01:20:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI restarted my game, it worked thank you though.
