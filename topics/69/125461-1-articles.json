The orbit went smooth, and that portion of the contract ticked off perfectly normally. However, the flyby did not. Even when I left Mun orbit brought the ship all the way back home, the flyby showed unfulfilled. Is there some new aspect to flybys in 1.0.5?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T22:26:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Billygoat_J.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContracts that were accepted in a 1.0.4 save \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/138829-Possible-new-bug-Cannot-complete-orbital-station-contract-%281-0-5%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline\u0022\u003Ecan fail to complete in 1.0.5\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E as the way contracts are tracked has been changed, there was also a small update to 1.0.5 (your buildID.txt will say you have 1028 if you are on the latest version) which fixed a few career contract issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo make sure you\u0027re up to date, and you may have to complete this contract via the debug screen (alt\u002BF12), but later contracts will work fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Billygoat_J","CreatedById":153590,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-15T20:24:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, thanks.
