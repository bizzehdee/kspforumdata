Do some missions have to be manned? If so it seems a bit random which missions can be completed by a probe and doesn\u0027t mention crew in the mission brief."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T17:22:47Z","Content":"I don\u0027t think those contracts are tied to the manned/unmanned status like that. Although the trip log is stored in the pod/core, so I think that part needs to survive.\n\nMaybe you can provide some more details and we can help you narrow it down.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"}]}
