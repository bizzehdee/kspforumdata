If you\u2019re on Steam (I\u2019m guessing you are?) and have selected v1.7.3 then it should download the right versions of the DLCs for your version, I\u2019ve got copies of KSP on versions 1.7.3, 1.8.1, 1.9.1 and 1.10 on my PC,\u00A0all with the DLCs and each got the right version of the DLCs when I downloaded that version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have any problems, try copying your save games somewhere safe (outside steam\u2019s control); update to 1.10 and the DLCs should update as well; then re-select 1.7.3 and it should download the core game and DLCs again; then put your save files back in and fire it up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
