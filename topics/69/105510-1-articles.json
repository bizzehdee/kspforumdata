Audio sounds almost like a split second of the rocket engine firing sound. Happens throughout the game, when landed, when in flight, on EVA. Less when timewarping but still present. Doesn\u0027t occur during loading screens, on map view, at the KSC screen or in the VAB. Redownloaded KSP and the issue persists. Occurs on both saves, career and sandbox. Tends to occur slightly less frequently when engine is firing. \n\nOutput Log: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/aj7c1syrdhkohte/output_log.txt?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/aj7c1syrdhkohte/output_log.txt?dl=0)\n\nSystem Specs:\n\nWindows 7 x64\n\nIntel i5 2410M 2.3GHz Quad Core\n\nNvidia GT525M 1GB\n\n8GB RAM\n\nRealtek ALC269 Sound Card"}]}
