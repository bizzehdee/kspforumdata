Multiple threads makes it harder to keep track of what has been suggested and the original description of the problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can change the game graphics settings by opening the settings.cfg file inside the KSP folder; lower numbers for graphics mean lower graphics settings, try reducing them by one and see what happens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe log files get overwritten every time you start the game, that\u2019s meant to happen. It will be continuously updated in the background even if you open the file in an editor and unless your file explorer auto-refreshes you won\u2019t see the file size change there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry running the game, wait until it crashes, then upload the log file to a file sharing site and post a link to it so someone can look at it and see if there\u2019s an obvious cause. You should also try to find Player.txt (or .log) and/or output_log.txt and upload those too as they have more information than the basic log file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
