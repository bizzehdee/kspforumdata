You can\u0027t tell because it\u0027s a screenshot but it\u0027s actually spinning around and around. I can\u0027t stop it because there\u0027s no power to use the reaction wheel. The solar panels are deployed and in direct sunlight but they use all the power the get trying to track the sun and their constant tracking seems to be causing the damn satellite to keep spinning around and around. I can\u0027t swtich to another craft because this one is \u0022under acceleration\u0022. Previously I\u0027ve recovered from this situation by holding the buttons (W, A, S, or D) as necessary to counter the spin and waiting for it to slowly stop at which point the panels function properly and the battery begins to charge. Would you call this a bug? It\u0027s a pretty stupid situation and if the damn panels would just stop tracking and wait for a moment, I\u0027d collect enough light to power the reaction wheels but there\u0027s no such option to ever stop them tracking.
