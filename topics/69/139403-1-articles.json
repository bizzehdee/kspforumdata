To the best that I can tell so far, it always puts the marker in the wrong place. I haven\u0027t completely mapped it out yet, but it looks to me like the marker is\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eat least\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0200km west of the actual point that you are supposed to maintain line of sight with. There is an item in the contract that gets checked when you are in line of sight. As I came up from behind the marker, it did not turn \u0022checked\u0022 until I was almost exactly overhead (within .1 degrees?). It has remained checked as I have passed the marker by at least 400km so far.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: to the best I can tell, the position\u00A0that was \u0022acceptable\u0022 for line of sight \u003Cstrong\u003Estarted at the marker\u003C/strong\u003E and extended eastward (ahead) of the marker by just about 800km.
