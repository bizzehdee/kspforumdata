Upon removing one mod at a time to find the culprit, I finally reached no\u00A0mods and still had the issue. Since then, I have uninstalled and deleted everything KSP (including remainder files from mods and main KSP folder in Steam) and re-installed from scratch onto my SSD this time to see if the issue persists. It does.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI am also getting extreme stutter whenever I try to do anything like experiments(1-2 seconds after popup), fly, switch hangars, switch vessels, etc. This only happens in my modded game though and is what lead me to this spam.
