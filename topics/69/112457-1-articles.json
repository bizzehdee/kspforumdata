I separated a stage and switched to it and set the throttle to deorbit it. As soon as I reselected the orbiter the deorbiting stage suddenly flew away at very high speed. My craft was stuck in orbit. Not moving and unresponsive.

Also I encountered another bug in orbit around the Mun. I decoupled from a docking port and the thing I decoupled from flew off at high speed and exploded. Left my craft hanging in space and didn\u0027t render the Mun.

Mine where Caused by firing a separated stage for deorbit and another by decoupling from a docking port. It didn\u0027t happen after I reloaded though."}]}
