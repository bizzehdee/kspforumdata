Because all \u0022East Farside Crater\u0022 science data contains the String \u0022Farside Crater\u0022, they are displayed alongside data from \u0022Farside Crater\u0022 when selected in the interface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that makes sense. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Excuse the slight spelling mistake in the title, should be \u0022within\u0022 not \u0022with\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
