As I was flying to orbit for the fifth time or so, apropos of nothing I could discern, my plane disappeared from the orbital view. It was still there in the staging view, and I could see its orbit and orbital features, but no symbol for the craft itself. Mousing over the spot where the craft should have been did not reveal altitude, speed, etc. as it should have. By itself this would have caused me little distress, but I now find that even after quitting and re-launching the game, neither this nor any other ship I might load is visible in the orbital view. To my relief,\u00A0I discovered that the orbital view was not broken in other saves I had, but it appears to be permanently so in the one I was currently playing. I don\u0027t ever think I\u0027ve seen a bug quite like this before, so I\u0027m reporting it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zwieg88","CreatedById":165737,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-25T05:46:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you made sure that \u0027Ships\u0027 are highlighted in the top drop-down bar that appears in map view when you hover on the top of the screen?

I have played this game forever, and I don\u0027t think I was ever even aware of the existence of that drop-down bar. If I was, I had forgotten about it.
