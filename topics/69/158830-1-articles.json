So even with more processing power, the part count will always cause that significant of a drop (100 FPS down to 7 FPS)? The ship I\u0027m using is shown in the video I linked in my post, and it has a part count of 408. It\u0027s the first space station Mark Thrimm lists in his video I linked.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d be fine with using another mod so long as it doesn\u0027t break other mods (I haven\u0027t starting using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, but from the sound of it, part welding may conflict with their functionality). I just want to understand why the FPS drop is this significant even with fairly high end hardware, especially since I\u0027m not seeing the hardware even reaching 100% utilization under load. It really makes me think I\u0027m missing something, and that there\u0027s a setting or two (either within KSP or through Nvidia\u0027s software)\u00A0I\u0027m unaware of that might resolve this.

I was excited to finally reach the point where I could design my own when I decided to check out Mark Thrimm\u0027s design first for inspiration. Little did I know it would cripple my system and temporarily let the wind out of my sails a bit motivation-wise.
