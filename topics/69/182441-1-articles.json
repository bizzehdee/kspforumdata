I made an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E with a Wolfhound rocket and 2 Whiplash engines. My friends and I often share crafts and I removed the Wolfhound for a Poodle as they do not have Making History.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the Poodle equipped, my plane cannot hit 400 m/s at sea level due to huge amounts of drag. With the Wolfhound, it can hit 400 m/s easily. The Poodle weighs less as well, but the red drag line is considerably larger.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI then attached a stack separator and added a nose cone to help remove some drag. While it helped the Wolfhound version, the Poodle version still cannot hit 400 m/s with the Whiplashes even with a nose cone or protective shell. I replaced the Poodle with the Skipper, and it can also hit 400 m/s\u002B at sea level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a problem with the Poodle Engine having too much drag? Or is this old news that I have missed? I am on 1.6.1 stock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have made crafts using the Poodle before, but this is the first time I have noticed that it does have an unusual amount of drag, mainly because I now have access to the Wolfhound which also has 380 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nedit: I removed the main fuel tank and added it back and suddenly I can hit 400 m/s with the poodle equipped (whiplashes are the only engine running). I can hit 400m/s faster and have less drag with the Wolfhound still. Should the Poodle get a drag buff or is it ok for the Wolfhound to have less drag despite it weighing more?
