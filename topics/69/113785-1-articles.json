Yay!\n\nHowever, while I can see that there are aero effects, I\u0027m not seeing any atmospheric effects (i.e. no mach effects, and no re-entry flames) and AFAICT there is no reentry heating happening at all. I did a clean install to check it wasn\u0027t some sort of mod issue, and even with a clean install and firing a rocket straight up past the orbit of Minmus and right back down again it didn\u0027t heat up and didn\u0027t blow up until it hit the ocean going app 2 km/s.\n\nThis cannot be right.\n\nI\u0027m running the 64 bit executable under ubuntu linux. Special points: I have an NVIDIA optimus card and am using bumblebee to switch to the card and load the game. This seems to be working as designed; attempting to load the game without bumblebee results in a non-functioning game, whereas the only issue I seem to be having when I use bumblebee is that re-entry is MIA.\n\nI am willing to do such things as load debug builds etc etc. I\u0027m not a dev, but I am a sysop in a development house and am quite happy to mess around and ship logs back and forth etc.\n\nOh, and FWIW I\u0027ve been running the 64 bit executable from day 1 with basically zero problems.\n\n...and I just tested using the 32 bit executable, and the issue is still there.\n\nHere\u0027s Jeb about to pancake into the ocean: [https://goo.gl/photos/TbHW1MhHV2qc6Hso8](https://goo.gl/photos/TbHW1MhHV2qc6Hso8)"},{"CreatedByName":"stratvox","CreatedById":134498,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T04:33:53Z","Content":"Here\u0027s the stuff:\n\nBuildID.txt\n\n----8\u003C----\n\nbuild id = 00859\n\n2015-06-22\\_13-02-29\n\nBranch: master\n\n----\u003E8----\n\nComputer is a Samsung laptop with an nVidia 710m.\n\nIt has run the game without problems so far.\n\nGame acquired via Steam."},{"CreatedByName":"Daveroski","CreatedById":93896,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T11:36:47Z","Content":"I\u0027m running under Linux Mint - Nvidia 980\n\nGot all the effects that you are lacking.\n\nI built a space plane. got to orbit, brought it back down on a very shallow decent ap@72 pe@1000\n\ngot heat, flames, temp gauges, mach effects, cooling gauges. stable flight, slightly front heavy. got to 2000m at \u003C200ms.

I\u0027d love to figure out why it\u0027s not working for me. If you\u0027re in an unshielded capsule and you\u0027re still going over 2km/s 1800 m above the ocean, well, you should\u0027ve died a few kms up from where you are. When it first hit the atmosphere it was going a LOT faster than that, so the aero is definitely working; it\u0027s both the heating and the actual effects (mach effects and re-entry heating effects) that are missing in this one.\n\nI just took another shot at getting a craft to burn up on re-entry.\n\nHere\u0027s the orbit I set up: [https://goo.gl/photos/pRVcZnRtcyXW85LY9](https://goo.gl/photos/pRVcZnRtcyXW85LY9)\n\nIt didn\u0027t burn up on a completely uncontrolled re-entry. This is pretty absurd.\n\nIt also kind of looks like the aero model is off... with chutes deployed and SAS turned off the craft is inclined to to the direction of travel about 25 degrees or so from where I would expect it to be.\n\nCheers\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Also affected by this.\n\nNice to know I\u0027m not the only one.\n\nLinux?
