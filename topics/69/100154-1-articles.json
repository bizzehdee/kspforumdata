I\u0027m not sure next patch should be 1.0 :P","CreatedByName":"hobbez","CreatedById":138355,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T23:20:04Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"hobbez","CreatedById":138355,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T23:20:04Z","Content":"OOPS! MY BAD! I didn\u0027t realize this problem was already reported. I just saw the stickied thread. Reading it now. \n\nFrom what i\u0027m reading however, it doesn\u0027t relate to my situation, as this is not a career mode save with contracts, but a science mode save. I have \u0022respawn crewmembers\u0022 check on, but \u0022auto hire crewmembers\u0022 checked off. Nevertheless, i tried the solution listed in that thread, with no success.\n\nJust experienced a nasty bug. This is actually the first time i experience a bug in the few years i\u0027ve been playing KSP (unless you count flipping your manned rover over, hit your kerbals head on the ground, falling out of the vehicle, stand up but not able to move a bug...i figure he just got brain damage ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)).\n\n1) I was constructing a vessel in science mode. I had to duplicate a rocket. I alt-click it to copy it. I have the duplicate rocket on my mouse tab, however the game will not let me attach it. It will not even let me release it. While clicking around, i accidentally click one of the stage tabs, and now that\u0027s stuck on my mouse cursor. It will not release that either. I try clicking the exit button, but it doesn\u0027t work. It gets highlighted and makes the clicking sound when pressed, but doesn\u0027t lead me to the main screen. The same thing with the launch button. I bring up the exit screen with ESC but it won\u0027t it\u0027s the same story. I can select settings, i can resume game, but i can\u0027t exit the screen i am currently in. I alt tab and shut down KSP.\n\n2) I restart it and reload my game. Everything works find now. I go to launch the vessel, but i forgot to arrange my stages and the rocket explodes on the launch pad. My crewman survives, so i click recover vessel. It doesn\u0027t work. I click ESC and try to exit that way, but that doesn\u0027t work either. I manage to get my Kerbal out with the EVA icon and try to recover him that way but, again, it doesn\u0027t work. Once again, i have to alt tab, task manager, and shut it down.\n\n3) I open the game again, tab out, start writing this report, tab back in, load my game and click on the rocket assembly facility. I see it being highlighted and it makes the clicking sound, but it won\u0027t enter it. I click the other buildings, same storry. I try double clicking. This time it works while clicking on the science facility. Now i\u0027m in the science facility page. I can click on the tech tree icons and it will show me the unlockables, but when i click on the exit tab or the archives tab, same story as before. Once again, ESC key opens but i can\u0027t exit. However the settings and resume game keys work. Once more, task manager, shut down game. And here i am.\n\nThis has not happened to me before, not in this patch, not in prior patches. This happened just today. I\u0027ve had this science game going for about 10 in game years (human calendar, not kerbal), and started it about a week or 2 ago. It had not given me any problems until now.\n\nI love ksp, i do, but i really don\u0027t think the next update should be 1.0 even if following patches will in fact add updates like multiplayer and such.\n\nIt\u0027s not just about content, but feature quality. For example the trajectory planning node, though easy to use, is a bit annoying when you click away from it and it shrinks back to that little flower icon, sometimes making it hard to click on it when your ship is surrounded by other orbiting objects. Sure, you can temporarily untrack some of those other things, but it\u0027s one of the small things in a game that brings down its overall quality. In short, this just doesn\u0027t feel like a completed game you\u0027d buy off a shelf.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nIt looks like my save is permanently broken. I can\u0027t do anything with it anymore. New careers and sandbox mode work just fine, but i can\u0027t even enter any of the facilities other than the science facility in my saved game. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif) Bummer. It was the first time i found asteroids and captured one.\n\nI also didn\u0027t realize until i read other reports on the forum, but i had the bug that didn\u0027t respawn my crewmembers. It just put them in the MIA tab. When creating the game, i selected to have crewmembers respawn. I noticed this before the game broke itself, but i thought it was something i was doing wrong.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-20T00:48:22Z\u0022 title=\u002202/20/2015 12:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by hobbez**"}]}
