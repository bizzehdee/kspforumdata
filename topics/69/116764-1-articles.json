The odd thing is, it doesn\u0027t freeze like other programs do. It doesn\u0027t say \u0022not responding\u0022, I can click X and it will close, but the whole thing is just completely unresponsive. I don\u0027t know what to do, as this makes the game completely unplayable.

EVGA Precision X 16 is the overclocking utility for my graphics card, and you can get it on steam. It was running each time I ran KSP, just for monitoring.
