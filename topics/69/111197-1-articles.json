Turn on Centre of Mass indicator.\n\n3) Place J-33 \u0022Wheesley\u0022 Basic Jet OR J-X4 \u0022Whiplash\u0022 Turbo Ramjet Engine on either attachment node.\n\n4) Notice CoM moves forward beyond fuel tank to impossible position.\n\nResult: Balancing jet VTOLs is nearly impossible (reason I noticed it). This just doesn\u0027t seem to be working as intended.\n\nCan upload pics if required.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-29T01:38:07Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2015 01:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw**"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T01:37:56Z","Content":"Thanks for submitting a proper bug report. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nUnfortunately, this one is done by design.

KSP\u0027s engineering problems aren\u0027t full-real (thank God!), so as long as there\u0027s a simple set of physical rules/laws that aren\u0027t too tough to get to grips with (i.e. engine is good if fuel and air exist). When I make crafts that look like real life I flatter myself that I\u0027m getting closer to understanding the engineering process that developed the real thing (NASA-STS was a hell of a learning curve), but if I can cut a corner to two and still have something that performs adequately and looks cool, that\u0027s all I\u0027m really after.\n\nThat being said, I do mind when KSP\u0027s \u0027laws of physics\u0027 get drastically altered at the drop of a hat.

Your version would be even less realistic since they would completely ignore how planes are designed (e.g. not as long tubes consisting of single purpose parts). The current way, as well as the engines weight offset, is pretty much an approximation how weight would be distributed in reality.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-30T19:59:10Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2015 07:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Temeter**"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T18:39:36Z","Content":"Just gotta be a bit creative...\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
