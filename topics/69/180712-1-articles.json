The game seems to run smoothly. While testing, I launched a rocket and when I wanted to turn east, instead of moving my ship, I moved the camera!!. How can I change this?\u003Cbr\u003E\nGoogle is not helping me, I seem to be the only one suffering this issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother important matter:\u00A0 I remember trying borderlands (another PC game) in an older notebook (it lagged a lot, to be honest) and I had this problem that if I changed the key bindings, steam would synchronize them to my desktop, so when I played with the desktop PC, controls were wrong again. LOT of rework. If I disable synch, my saves and progress are not synchronized either! Please tell me KSP won\u0027t do the same!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks a regards!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-20T12:53:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt might be a good idea to tell people what button you are actually pressing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd you can change your keybinds from the settings menu on the main menu.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Woodsielord","CreatedById":193211,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-20T14:39:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks, I didn\u0027t realize the keybindings were accessible before loading the savegame.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis was silly of me.
