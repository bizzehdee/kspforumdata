I had a look at my save file and found that one of my Kerbals, Glory Kerman,\u00A0who is on a space station orbiting Kerbin isn\u0027t in the save. The problem started before I had any mods installed, I\u0027ve since installed Kerbal Engineer Redux but this has had no effect on the issue. Any advice would be welcome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xd the great","CreatedById":188222,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-19T00:05:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry loading a backup, where Glory Kerman has not been hired yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr just remove any trace of Glory Kerman in the savegame AFTER BACKUP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Saqu0007","CreatedById":195974,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-21T21:28:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u00A0don\u2019t have an earlier backup, I managed to find Glory as Giory.
