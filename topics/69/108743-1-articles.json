I reccomend you go to the Addon-Releases section of this forum. There is a sticky called Stock Bug Fix Modules. That is a mod that fixes this bug and many others.\n\nSometimes in SPH the symmetry is buggy. It will show 2-times-symmetry but in fact it will clip the same part multiple times on one side. Press Shift\u002BX to reduce symmetry mode until you get no symmetry. then press x to get real 2x-symmetry."},{"CreatedByName":"Apollo22","CreatedById":143733,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T12:02:20Z","Content":"It\u0027s not too heavy because it\u0027s only when I turn.\n\nThank you Chaos\\_Klaus for the Shift\u002BX tip."}]}
