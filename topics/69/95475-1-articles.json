Clicking the load/save icons just fails to do anything, and if I try to sneak a ship into the SPH via the runway/edit craft option, only the stock craft are available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERather than spend eternity attempting to track down that one, I decided to just reinstall KSP from scratch; it was kind of overdue for that anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I can\u0027t even get a new install to open: it crashes during the initial loading screens, 100% of the time, even after scrubbing it and reinstalling from scratch again. There are no mods involved here at all; they were completely fresh clean installs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve run into this before; I have a very dodgy laptop that cannot handle KSP unless the graphics are wound down a bit, and the default settings are enough to crash it. But normally, I can just use the settings option in the Launcher to wind down the graphics to minimum before opening the game for the first time, and then carefully tweak them up to just what my laptop can manage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoing that now isn\u0027t working; even if I set the options in the Launcher to minimal graphics and not full screen, when I try to start the game it opens in full screen and crashes before ever getting to the main menu. I suspect that it\u0027s ignoring the Launcher settings and attempting to start with graphics at a level that my computer can\u0027t handle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea of how to work around this.

Find the line \u0022TEXTURE_QUALITY = \u0022 and set it to \u0022TEXTURE_QUALITY = 3\u0022. That should crank that down all the way. The first run of KSP usually takes a lot of RAM for some reason (I guess because of run time compiling?). You can also manually edit your desired resolution directly in the settings.cfg (SCREEN_RESOLUTION_WIDTH = XXX and SCREEN_RESOLUTION_HEIGHT = XXX).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, get KSP out of your \u0022Documents\u0022 library and install it somewhere else like \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Courier New\u0027;\u0022\u003EC:\\Games\\KSP...\u003C/span\u003E Copy/Paste it (or unzip a fresh copy). Do NOT \u0022move\u0022 it or windows DEP may still mess you up.
