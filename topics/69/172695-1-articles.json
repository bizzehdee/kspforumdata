If it\u2019s on steam, you should do the \u201Ccheck integrity\u201D option when you right click on ksp. This will take a bit, but it goes through and makes sure that nothing is missing or corrupted. If you installed manually, first completely uninstall through your control panel. Then use the installer from the website. I would recommend downloading a fresh file. If you don\u2019t want to do that, do it manually but be very careful to follow its instructions and put it in its own folder preferably in \u201Cmy documents\u201D.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/103873-kandokris/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022103873\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/103873-kandokris/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@KandoKris\u003C/a\u003E, hate to say this, but I am pretty sure\u00A0\u00A0that your computer is just incapable of loading all those parts.
