To put it into simpler terms, when I press a key, the game doesn\u0027t respond for a short time (5 seconds at most) before it registers the input. I think it has something to do with how the game runs calculations, but if there is any way to fix it or at least lessen its effects, please share it with me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow71","CreatedById":210112,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-17T17:40:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObvious question incoming:\u00A0 Are you sure that it\u0027s an actual input latency/lag issue, and not just the craft you are attempting to control being too large and just taking forever to move?\u00A0 For example, I\u0027ve got a craft that is a decent size (100 tons prior to adding payload), and no matter how many reaction wheels I put on the things it turns like a dead whale on roller skates that are missing most of the wheels.\u00A0 If I add \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E or engines dedicated to moving the thing I can get it to move faster, but without them it seems as if I have to hold down the A/D/W/S/Q/E keys forever until it starts spinning in the direction I want it to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond obvious question incoming:\u00A0 Does this happen only when you are providing input, or does it happen even when you select one of the options on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E for a course hold?\u00A0 For example, if you are already pointed prograde but click \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to turn you retrograde, does the ship move quickly...or does it also seem to take forever to move?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stranded Lander","CreatedById":218009,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-17T19:49:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224066636\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206017\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221639762858\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022210112\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scarecrow71\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Scarecrow71 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObvious question incoming:\u00A0 Are you sure that it\u0027s an actual input latency/lag issue, and not just the craft you are attempting to control being too large and just taking forever to move?\u00A0 For example, I\u0027ve got a craft that is a decent size (100 tons prior to adding payload), and no matter how many reaction wheels I put on the things it turns like a dead whale on roller skates that are missing most of the wheels.\u00A0 If I add \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E or engines dedicated to moving the thing I can get it to move faster, but without them it seems as if I have to hold down the A/D/W/S/Q/E keys forever until it starts spinning in the direction I want it to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond obvious question incoming:\u00A0 Does this happen only when you are providing input, or does it happen even when you select one of the options on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E for a course hold?\u00A0 For example, if you are already pointed prograde but click \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E to turn you retrograde, does the ship move quickly...or does it also seem to take forever to move?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not just large spacecraft having poor movement times.
