Use wheels from Kerbal foundries, those will not autostrut by themselfs to anything until you deceide to do so. For stock wheels you have no option to disable autostruting. If you ask me that was very bad decision from very begining, to don\u0027t allow user to deceide, should wheels be or not autostruted anywhere. That was very hacky solution for wheel issue that still does not work well enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
