Normally, at speeds up to 100x warp, everything works mostly fine, and the drill and IRSU use Charge from the craft mostly as expected. The craft uses both Radioactive isotope generators and XL solar arrays to power the rig, and gets only about 2/3 of it\u0027s power from the generators. So when the sun sets, it quickly drains the batteries and the IRSU shuts down, leaving the drill running at reduced capacity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I time warp to 1000x, the craft no longer seems to use charge and runs at full capacity through the entire night with the batteries only loosing 1 charge when the sun sets. Is this intended? Is something not right with my install? I\u0027m trying to speed up the mining process but I don\u0027t really want to \u0022cheat\u0022 like this if it\u0027s not going to use charge to run the operation at 1000x...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-11T23:12:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s intended, RoverDude posted about this recently, at over 100 warp the updates aren\u0027t shown because \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through\u0022\u003Ethere\u0027d be too many\u003C/span\u003E they over run the batteries, and it sorts itself out when you reduce warp again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through\u0022\u003EI\u0027ll have a look for the post.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t find it, it was in IRC, but anyway because of how warp effects e/c drain it\u0027s backgrounded until it\u0027s needed again.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-13T08:59:08Z\u0022 title=\u002210/13/2015 08:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sal_vager\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jakalth","CreatedById":136495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-12T22:32:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlright, I\u0027ll just have to refrain from using high warp when mining. or just accept the feeling of being slightly cheaty if I do so...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clouds","CreatedById":32610,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-14T09:56:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jakalth\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jakalth\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlright, I\u0027ll just have to refrain from using high warp when mining. or just accept the feeling of being slightly cheaty if I do so...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s worse than that...
