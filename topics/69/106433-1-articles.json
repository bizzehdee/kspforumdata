It happens on every occasion, as soon as I start KSP up. The launcher seems to have the same problem. It makes ksp unplayable because I can\u0027t really fly anything when every click I do on the screen makes the game get \u0027stuck up\u0027 for a split-second. I really would like to know if there is a fix or imcompability issues that happened with 1.0, because in 0.90 I ran the game at 30fps and now it is also at 30fps, but with this game-breaking phenomenon that gets the game to hang up foor an isntant. Also when I Tab-out I can\u0027t get the game to show up again, even thought it is on my taskbar. Double-clicking KSP on task manager has no effect.\n\nMy games is fully stock, out of the Installer. I don\u0027t know if installing it makes it do this, but it might be important. The game does not crash at any point, it just hangs up until I force-shutdown the game. I never heard of anyone having this problem either, so I\u0027m at a loss for what to do.\n\nSystem Specs:\n\nWindows 8\n\n6gig RAM (I know ksp can\u0027t use more than 2.5gb or so)\n\nAMD Series Radeon HD 7670M\n\nProcessor : Intel\u00AE Core i3-3120M CPU @ 2.50GHz, 2500 Mhz, 2 Core(s), 4 Logical Processor(s)\n\n[output_log:](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4lZOkLwPTe7WHBhbVRWZmlGcEk/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T19:29:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 07:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SaplingPick**\n  \nSolved!"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T00:25:21Z","Content":"Hmm, okay, the log says you are running KSP from the desktop, unfortunately this is known to be bad as [**DEP**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Execution_Prevention) can prevent KSP from working correctly.\n\nThe copy on the desktop will now be flagged as potentially malicious, so moving it elsewhere won\u0027t help, the OS will still treat the files as a risk.\n\nTo get around this, copy the whole folder to a new place that isn\u0027t protected by DEP, we recommend C:\\Games as you make this file yourself and Windows has no control over it.\n\nThe copy should work, once you\u0027re sure it\u0027s fine you can delete the copy on the desktop, and make a shortcut to the \u0022new\u0022 KSp.exe, the shortcut can be on the desktop and will be fine.\n\nIf the problem persists let us know ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"HazelPine","CreatedById":164526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T00:29:09Z","Content":"I\u0027ll try that, will let you know if problem persists.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T15:26:37Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 03:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SaplingPick**"},{"CreatedByName":"HazelPine","CreatedById":164526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T15:26:16Z","Content":"**UPDATE:**\n\nCopying over KSP to C:/Games didn\u0027t work.
