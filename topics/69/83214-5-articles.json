If you don\u0027t meet that, stick with Catalyst 14.9. I can already tell you\u0027re running a 3.15- kernel with Xorg 1.15, probably Ubuntu 14.04 as well, just by you saying you\u0027re using the 14.9 driver. Without patches, 14.9 only runs up to kernel 3.15 (maybe 3.16) and isn\u0027t or can\u0027t be patched for Xserver 1.16. There is a Catalyst driver for Ubuntu 14.10 based on Catalyst 14.6 that does support 3.16 kernels (3.17 with AUR patches) and Xserver 1.16. That Ubuntu FGLRX is what I\u0027m using with Manjaro (it\u0027s Manjaro\u0027s default Catalyst driver) because it\u0027s the only Catalyst driver that supports bleeding-edge systems. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/catalyst-test/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s a link to Arch\u0027s Catalyst-Test driver\u003C/a\u003E if you feel the need to patch it manually so you can run Catalyst on a bleeding edge system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eiktyrner","CreatedById":127933,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-01T16:02:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the info!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m on a i7 2600k at 4ghz. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will just switch to Arch and patch manually.
