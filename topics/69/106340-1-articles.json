Even going back to my very first quicksave, I still see all the contract I have in my latest quicksave, so basically besides this tourist contract suddenly failing, the contracts you have don\u0027t change between quicksaves.\n\nFurthermore, Wehrkin Kerman is still in my list of astronauts (so not lost at all), but now unusable since I can\u0027t \u0027redo\u0027 the contract (already discarded it for that matter) and unable to be removed.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEDIT: After relaunching the game later I noticed the contract suddenly being back (after it had \u0027failed\u0027 and I had discarded it), so I retried it and now I\u0027ve achieved the contract! Dunno what was going on, but apparently the game fixed itself! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T21:02:21Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 09:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Monkeido**"}]}
