But when I \u00A0tried to open my save files a small window appeared saying: \u00A0 \u00A0 Conformation needed, \u00A0There are\u00A0incompatible/invalid saves on your save folder. What would you like to do? \u00A0 And two buttons saying Delete and Not now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I pressed \u0027Not now\u0027 and both of my save files were gone!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI actually realized later on that even if I made a new save it wouldn\u0027t be there either, so I really need to fix this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve seen the issue with other people but they all had mods or add-ons involved, I\u0027ve never installed one or anything... \u00A0If anyone knows what I could do to fix this, it would be \u003Cem\u003Eextremely\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0helpful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-31T21:29:41Z\u0022 title=\u002203/31/2016 09:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 31, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Viggo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hotel26","CreatedById":139095,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-14T03:18:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve just had this occur.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt popped up asking if I wanted to Delete or Cancel.\u00A0 Because I don\u0027t trust such things, I went to my directory for the world I had been playing and made a copy of the quicksave.sfs and then clicked Delete.\u00A0 The action taken then by KSP was to delete the ENTIRE DIRECTORY containing my world and months of work AND my carefully duplicated quicksave.sfs copy.\u00A0 All gone.\u00A0 This was my mainline, production world; all gone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[I\u0027m on Linux Mint 17.2 64-bit and I run directly rather than through Steam.\u00A0 I have MechJeb, Kerbal Alarm Clock, Docking Port and Haystack installed.\u00A0 The upgrade to 64-bits is relatively recent and as a result my normal system backups are not operational, which is why I can\u0027t just go and get yesterday\u0027s KSP state off another disk.]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis happened after a crash and the crash occurred because I had done an f5 quick save and I began typing ahead before it had finished [\u0027Z\u0027 for max thrust].\u00A0 I\u0027ve noticed in the far past that you can crash KSP by triggering a Quick Save while an Auto Save is in progress which indicates to me that the code around saves[/restores?] is not sufficiently interlocked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the reason I was doing a quicksave during a very long transfer burn is because as of the last couple of months, the nuke engine heat indicators no longer give you a precise warning of when those engines are going to fail.\u00A0 When the red progress bar for overheat gets level with about the \u0027v\u0027 in Overheat [30%?], the engines explode without warning, effectively ruining your day.\u00A0 This happens in a vacuum [alt:150K] with the 12 running nuke engines being the only source of heat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfwiw, the quicksave.sfs looked normal length.\u00A0 guess the moral of the story is that if you are going to back up anything manually, send it outside KSP\u0027s reach.\u00A0 and whenever KSP offers to Delete anything it doesn\u0027t want to deal with, fully expect it to take the whole world down irrecoverably.\u00A0 you will be better off in all cases, attempting to do diagnosis/surgery yourself, if you have that capability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
