I start the game, and it works fine. It loads and the main menu comes up. I go into my sandbox save (my career save might have the same issue, so I haven\u0027t played it in a long time). I can go to the Launchpad perfectly fine, I can fly spaceships perfectly fine. I did a whole Munar mission using a stock craft, and I\u0027ve flown around quite a bit. So, flying vessels isn\u0027t an issue (I think).
