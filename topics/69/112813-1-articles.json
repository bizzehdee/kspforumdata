When I reloaded the game and attempted to Resume a saved game. NOTHING would come up - it was as if the \u0022Resume\u0022 had died completely (clicking resume did NOT bring up the normal load window). I started a new game - saved it - quit the game and came back. Resume button still no longer functioned. I completely uninstalled the game. Reinstalled and resume was still not working. \n\nI went into the folders and moved the entire \u0022Kerbal Space Program\u0022 folder to a new location. Reinstalled from Steam again (no longer having any save games in the rebuilt folder) and the resume started working again.\n\nI moved my saved folder back into the Game folder and it broke the \u0022Resume\u0022 again. After a bit of fiddling around, I renamed persistent.sfs to quicksave.sfs and visa versa.\n\nSuddenly my RESUME GAME started working again and also allowed me to go back into my saved game. Maybe a couple hours behind - but still.\n\nI\u0027m putting this up on the board cause this Broke the game completly.\n\nI still have a copy of the SFS files. I hope someone see\u0027s this and fixes it. if it was the \u0022Persistant.sfs\u0022 file that was broke. maybe an option that works around it to get to the other saved games?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nAxehandler"}]}
