So I\u0027ve got a couple of questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Do you get offered an \u0022Explore Dres\u0022 contract?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. When should you get offered it? My guess is after the Eve/Duna contracts are completed?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. If the answer to Q1 is yes, then is there anything I can do to get the Dres contract to appear? Modify my save file maybe?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-10T19:48:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe you do usually get offered the Explore Dres contract, though it may not show 100% of the time.
