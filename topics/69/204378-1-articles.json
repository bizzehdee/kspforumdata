It appears to work fine until it gets to about \u0022Expansion Loading Complete\u0022 , then it freezes up.

While it\u0027s more common for this to happen with mods installed, you can still get issues in an unmodded copy of KSP if it gets corrupted in some way or some files go missing, so best to check that your installation of KSP is OK or perhaps try reinstalling it fresh; either way backup your save games first!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"severedsolo","CreatedById":80345,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-18T20:36:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt shouldn\u0027t completely lock up your system tbf - sounds like your system might be using\u00A0 up all it\u0027s swap (or your swappiness is set too high) - I\u0027ve seen this before but only in low memory situations.
