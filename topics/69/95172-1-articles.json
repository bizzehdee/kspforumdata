Instead of getting reentry effects, my craft just turns purple. Also, small bodies in the game turn pitch black when I get close to the surface. I\u0027ve noticed this on Minmus, Ike, and Gilly. However, Kerbin, the Mun, Duna, and Eve all keep their regular textures. I\u0027ve updated my drivers and am not sure where to go from here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
