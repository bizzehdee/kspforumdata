Here are its specs:\n\nMacbook Pro 15-inch, Mid 2012 (non-retina)\n\n2.3 GHz Intel Core i7, quad-core\n\nIntel HD Graphics 4000 AND NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M with 512MB of GDDR5 memory\n\n16 GB 1600 DDR3 memory\n\n512 GB SSD\n\nOS X Yosemite 10.10.3\n\nNeedless to say, my setup isn\u0027t bad at all.\n\n**I used to be able to play KSP just fine all the time**\n\n. Now, any time I try to fire up the game, the frame rate is appalling, the game chokes up and it\u0027s just unplayable.\n\nIt\u0027s also interesting to note that if I run KSP on a Virtual Machine (Windows 8.1), it will run just fine with no hiccups.\n\nWhat is this I\u0027m experiencing? Is it a compatibility issue? Please leave some advice- I don\u0027t want to keep playing it on Windows, that eats up the CPU. Thanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T07:44:04Z","Content":"What kind of lag are you getting? Does it increase/decrease depending on looking at the sky/ground? Does it depend on how many parts you use? Does it happen when taking off or in orbit or in re-entry?\n\nSince it\u0027s a laptop, is it possible it\u0027s playing your new KSP install in battery life saving mode instead of high performance mode?"},{"CreatedByName":"scuba_steve","CreatedById":142964,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T18:22:22Z","Content":"Here\u0027s a link to a screen capture demonstrating what I\u0027m talking about (vimeo).

It\u0027s running on the dedicated graphics card, a NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M.\n\nIn the screen capture, I\u0027m attempting to launch a stock Kerbal X unit, a ship with not many parts that ***should*** function normally."},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T23:47:43Z","Content":"That is unusually slow. It sounds like you\u0027re having this trouble since KSP 0.25. Have you tested any further back?\n\nIt looks like an external process is slowing the game down rather than the game slowing itself down, which is what happens when the physics engine is overloaded. For a quick check, open Activity Monitor \u003E View \u003E All Processes, then click on the % CPU header to sort the processes. Are there any that stay consistently above 20%?"},{"CreatedByName":"scuba_steve","CreatedById":142964,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T23:56:30Z","Content":"0.25 doesn\u0027t work, and neither will anything version below it. When I play KSP, it\u0027s typically the only app I have open.\n\nWhen I opened up Activity monitor, there was no process (besides KSP) that was over 5%. And that application using 5% was activity monitor itself."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T00:00:00Z","Content":"We need logs, please see the support stickies, your player.log, KSP.log and settings.cfg might help solve this."},{"CreatedByName":"scuba_steve","CreatedById":142964,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T00:34:13Z","Content":"How can I do this?
