I\u0027ve tried poking around in the Logitech Driver software that comes with the Quadrant, and I\u0027ve tried messing with the settings in KSP, all to no avail. I\u0027ve also double checked in the USB Controller Configuration thing in Windows, and all throttles smoothly display 0-100.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone encountered similar, or have any advice?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-04T19:29:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to Tech Support.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"T-Bouw","CreatedById":21500,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-07T13:16:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs it an old device?
