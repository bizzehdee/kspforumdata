There is a known issue that if there is something too close to the pod hatch there will be some collision forces when you EVA a kerbal. Basically, when the kerbal spawns on the outside of the pod, if there\u0027s something too close then they \u0022hit\u0022 it and get thrown away.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-06T08:10:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes please.
