That save had separate \u0022Fly by Duna\u0022 and \u0022Explore Duna\u0022 contracts that seem to have disappeared after loading the save into 1.3.0.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know the exploration contracts were redone in 1.2.2 and the old contracts were probably omitted as being invalid. Other contracts migrated without loss.\u00A0But this save is part of a story I\u0027m filming. Aside from hacking in a new exploration contract, is there a simpler way to migrate these contracts into a 1.3.0 save, or more sensibly, to merge them into a single exploration contract?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fly-by contract was pretty simple, to put a craft into Duna\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. The explore contract was to orbit Duna, send science from space around it, land on it, and send science from the surface of it. They came from different agencies, the first from KWF and the second from StrutCo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Samssonart","CreatedById":57129,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-01T19:55:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is no in-game save conversion from 1.1.x directly into 1.3.x. If you want to keep using the same save it\u0027s safer to do a stepped update, first update to 1.2.2 and open your save.

But aside from the exploration contracts disappearing, everything else migrated without difficulty. I had to re-extend some antennas and solar panels, but the import had CommNet turned off so I could do that and then turn it on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut OK, I\u0027ll try a 1.1.3 to 1.2.2 conversion first, and see what happens to the exploration contracts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I test-played through the 1.1.3 to 1.3.0 converted save, it re-generated a Duna exploration contract starting with a fly-by.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[Update] Migrating the same save to a 1.2.2 installation also ate the exploration contracts.
