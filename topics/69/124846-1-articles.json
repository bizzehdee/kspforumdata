How did you get the front wing parts producing lift? That is my only problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy problem is that the shuttle only is producing lift in the rear for some reason (occlusion perhaps?) and as a result is too front heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood to see it is still salvageable though. But if the lift was working like it is in your version of the game I wouldn\u0027t need to worry about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you have different results flying the older version? \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/dsf35ho3b1bx9v0/Kerlantis.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/dsf35ho3b1bx9v0/Kerlantis.craft?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-10T00:53:42Z\u0022 title=\u002211/10/2015 12:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jon144\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T00:53:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll i did was put a pair of FL-T400\u0027s with some nosecones on them on the cockpit (radially) then sink them in with the offset tool, you could probably hide your monoprop in there and save some for CoM balancing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other change you can see in the pics, the fuel and oxy were removed, moving the CoM away from the back end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the shuttle better balanced for 1.0.5 it flew beautifully, albeit slowly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDidn\u0027t really need SAS either, just some trim.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jon144","CreatedById":80626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T00:55:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAll i did was put a pair of FL-T400\u0027s with some nosecones on them on the cockpit (radially) then sink them in with the offset tool, you could probably hide your monoprop in there and save some for CoM balancing.\u003Cp\u003EThe other change you can see in the pics, the fuel and oxy were removed, moving the CoM away from the back end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the shuttle better balanced for 1.0.5 it flew beautifully, albeit slowly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDidn\u0027t really need SAS either, just some trim.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain.
