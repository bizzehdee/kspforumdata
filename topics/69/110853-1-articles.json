(You also disable the exit buttons during this scenario).\n\n2) Flight Basics: The map doesn\u0027t show up when you press the \u0027m\u0027 key. All you get is a black screen.\n\nThese were with an unmodded version of the game on a Mac Book Pro.\n\nI also personally experienced a problem with your NASA sample return mission scenario where the fuel lines no longer feed to the nuclear engines requiring you to manually pump fuel around to use them."}]}
