I\u0027ve had this happen before with a couple of other Mk2 craft, but could never figure out what caused it. Every single part was autostrutted to Heaviest Part. I tried re-rooting parts, draining tanks, changing flow priority, moving landing gear positions, changing the autostrut modes, and a whole bunch of other things, but nothing worked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I swapped out the Mk2 Clamp-o-tron for an extra passenger cabin and suddenly there was no floppiness or oscillating whatsoever. I even flew it to the Mun and back with no structural issues. So it seems like the Mk2 port\u0027s nodes are really, really structurally weak.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot1743.png?width=1408\u0026amp;height=792\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002266.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1065151388197326849/1128470553712402452/screenshot1743.png?width=1408\u0026amp;height=792\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a picture of the craft.
