My carreer mode save file that I made prior to the update has all the launch sites already unlocked and available. Which kinda ruins the fun of discovering them yourself. Is there a way to hide them in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E untill discovered? I already looked in the save file and cheat menus but I couldn\u0027t find anything useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iR80","CreatedById":213146,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-28T23:20:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027ve ever flown a spacecraft within a certain area of the location of the launchsite then I think the game automatically unlocks it, but I\u0027m not entirely sure since I don\u0027t play Career mode, only Science mode\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
