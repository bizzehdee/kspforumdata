I thought it would be interesting to fire up KSP with it, but I get problems w/ Windows 10 and OSX.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn OSX, even if I turn the speed all the way down and the threshold nearly all the way up (in the driver manager), the rotation/translation rate is very high, and when the mouse is released, the camera movement doesn\u0027t zero - it just keeps spinning and moving in whatever direction it was going when input was last given.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn Windows 10, the game doesn\u0027t respond to the mouse at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn both machines, the 3d mouse is set up, configured, and working in other software - or, at least, the driver and Fusion 360.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a way to get this input device working in either of these platforms. I\u0027m using a freshly installed 1.8.1.2694 OSXPlayer en-us. In both cases, starting new games from scratch. Oh, and I did notice that the first time or two that I started the game, the regular 2d mouse controls didn\u0027t seem right on OSX. I can\u0027t swear by it, but it does seem to have remedied itself, now that I\u0027ve disconnected the 3d device.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 Thanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
