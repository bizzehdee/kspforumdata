The best way that I think that you can fix the problem is to copy and paste *not move* the entire KSP directory to a place where it has more read-write permissions. One good place is C:/Games. Please tell me if this works since there are many other people out there having similar problems, and I can suggest another route if changing the location of the folder does not work.\n\nAll the best."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T00:04:08Z","Content":"Well, this one is a steam install, which generally does okay with installing itself to the default locations. However, SpaceExplorer is right in that several people have been reporting similar problems.\n\nAdditionally, your log files have several graphics errors in them. Please make sure your graphics drivers and direct X are up to date. That will probably solve some other issues you might encounter, though it might also fix some problems here.\n\nTo answer your other question, this forum is maintained by users (like yourself).

They are not in the first Parts folder that you see. (They used to be there, but moved locations a long time ago.)\n\nIt\u0027s possible you started a career game, where nearly all parts are unavailable. If possible, posting the output\\_log.txt file from the KSPdata folder would help us figure out what else is going on.\n\nNo worries about your reply time.

This can usually be fixed by changing your texture quality. Edit the settings.cfg fileiin the root KSP folder using a plain text editor (like notepad). Search for \u0022TEXTURE\\_QUALITY\u0022 and make it say TEXTURE\\_QUALITY = 1 (or even 2 or 3).\n\nSee if that helps.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"}]}
