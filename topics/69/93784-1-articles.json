Which is weird, because the error seems to originate from an xinput dll. Unusual, for sure -- most crashes tend to originate either from the Mono assemblies, or KSP itself... Well, in the interest of narrowing things down, it is worth installing DirectX 9; the logs seem to point to the error originating from there, after all, as unusual as that is. You can download the runtime from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E. It\u0027s unusual to need to, but although DirectX 11.2 comes hand in hand with windows 8.1, KSP usually uses DX9 (unless you force it to run DX11), and you might need to install the DX9 libraries to get things working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompatibility is weird.

I still got the (almost) exact same crash. However, I looked through the error log again a saw RivaTuner Statistics Server on there. RTSS provides MSI afterburner with screen cap and fps tracking. Apparently RTSS doesn\u0027t play nicely with KSP. I killed all instances of the program (41 instances! now I know where all my ram went) and KSP started up nicely. This also explains why x64 worked while x86 crashed as RivaTuner cant detect x64 software without help. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, thank you for the help!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
