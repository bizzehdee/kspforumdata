I\u0027ve done literally everything to try and fix it, but still, I am stuck in the laggy, broken OSXplayer of KSP 1.2. By everything,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EI really mean everything.\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0I have: 1) Verified the game cache \u003Cstrong\u003Emany\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Etimes\u00A02) Opted out of Beta versions of the game 3) Restarted my Mac 4) Uninstalled and reinstalled KSP 5) Uninstalled and reinstalled Steam itself 6) Adjusted graphical settings 7) Asked about this problem everywhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the game loads up, on the main menu, it says the build number and in brackets, OSXplayer. I assume this is a prerelease player of 1.2, and its not going away no matter what I do. The performance on it is absolutely garbage, and sometimes the textures in game will completely break while giving me an absolutely nonexistent FPS. Given that 1.2 is supposedly have to have helped performance wise, this is exceptionally infuriating because I have literally NEVER had this much lag and game breaking glitches in KSP before. I\u0027m desperate for a fix, could someone please help out because I am completely stumped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-13T04:18:53Z\u0022 title=\u002210/13/2016 04:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 13, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Astrojet\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-14T13:31:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/170185-astrojet/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022170185\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/170185-astrojet/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Astrojet\u003C/a\u003E, the number on the main screen and in the buildID.txt should be 1586 for the 1.2 release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the rest we will need to know more about your system, please see here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83213-stock-support-bug-reporting-guide/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd provide your KSP.log, Player.log, make and model of Mac, and OS version. thank you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
