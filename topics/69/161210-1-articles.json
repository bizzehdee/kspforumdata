I\u00A0am having problems with the latest version of KSP (1.3.0). I am running 32 bit unmodded KSP (on steam) on a 32 bit version of Windows 10. The game just crashes when it completes loading. Would anyone tell me (if you know) if there\u0027s a fix without going to a older version of KSP? Thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
