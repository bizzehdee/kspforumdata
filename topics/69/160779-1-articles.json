Lines 69 and 85 show only device identified as #0 is then recognized.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom the settings.cfg, lines 150 to 153 show again shows which devices are recognized, again only #0. However in the following sections are a number of references to diverse devices (e.g. lines 237, 469, 477 referring to a \u0022Joystick3\u0022; line 1024 referring to \u0022Joystick0\u0022; lines 974, 999, 1099, 1124 referring to \u0022Joystick1\u0022; line 1049 referring to \u0022Joystick2\u0022). One of Unity weirdnesses is about the base used, the first device with buttons is named \u0022Joystick1\u0022; whilst for axes the base is from \u0022Joystick0\u0022; therefore that settings.cfg is effectively showing to have registered input from 3 different devices though only one is recognized!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, the DXDiag (great it is mostly in English!) shows 4 entries under a Logitech G940 name: the throttle (line 251) with a Controller ID: 0x1; Flight System (line 281) with a Controller ID: 0x0; pedals (line 317) with a\u00A0 Controller ID: 0x2; and Joystick (line 347) with (again) Controller ID: 0x0. (of course the ID is Hexadecimal). So, Joystick (or Flight System), Throttle, and Pedals are those 3 input devices shown with output_log.txt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, I can only make a comparison with what KSP shows with my own device (a Saitek X52 pro, so with separate throttle and joystick parts): output_log.txt (at the input devices lines) shows to recognize both parts (as #1 and #0, giving the latter the correct name passed by the OS). Settings.cfg again shows both parts in input devices; clearly input from both are then usable in settings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan\u0027t get why KSP doesn\u0027t recognize all three parts after having found them. No wonder KSP doesn\u0027t bind a command to a unrecognized part (even if the command was detected).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d like if you could make a few tests to further define the issue:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- can you detach independently any of the parts? What shows with e.g. only the joystick, or only the throttle connected? or both joystick and throttle but no pedals? (of course KSP has to be started after having detached what isn\u0027t required, not before).

Some users have reported to have solved input device issues by installing a virtual device driver (e.g. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://vjoystick.sourceforge.net/site/index.php/download-a-install/download\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EvJoy\u003C/a\u003E). Can\u0027t say this would solve your issue too, but if you like to experiment possible fixes, give it a try. While the OS can see all of your G940 suite, and believe other applications do as well, the problem may really lie in how the suite is recognized in Unity: by having Unity recognize a virtual device instead (itself set to properly do with your devices) could be a way to have it usable, before a proper fix is done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"J5gbqp","CreatedById":177881,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-22T08:23:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like something i need to try out!
