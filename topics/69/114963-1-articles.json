I\u0027m still sciencing the other biomes on Kerbin, but so far the Astronaut complex is the only one that doesn\u0027t work. Did something change in the patch?"},{"CreatedByName":"SoWeMeetAgain","CreatedById":145256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T16:52:32Z","Content":"I found that one hard to catch, too. At the very center of the flag out front seems to work. Usually in between the buildings in view also works (on one of those walkways leading to the double doors perhaps)"},{"CreatedByName":"Tricky14","CreatedById":145768,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T17:35:08Z","Content":"Hard to catch? Not from my experience, until now. I\u0027ve tried a lot of different things, something definitely feels wrong. I\u0027ll try a little more I guess, but I\u0027m not optimistic."},{"CreatedByName":"Tricky14","CreatedById":145768,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T18:42:44Z","Content":"Alright, going on the \u0027sidewalk\u0027 next to the lower building seems to work, but I can\u0027t wedge any rovers in there with big things. Still not entirely sure why it was easier to get in the past. I thought I was pretty precise with this sort of thing."}]}
