Below I\u0027ve posted an example craft file, which consists of a rocket that ascends to orbit and then re-enters and lands using parachutes. During the re-entry phase, while between 30 and 40km, the engines invariably explode unless all of the airbrakes are deployed and the ship is constantly rotated to distribute heat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/BSjWxyA\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BSjWxyAm.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022BSjWxyAm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13276416/KSP/%281.0.5%29%20SSL%20WIP.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESSL WIP.craft\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt first I just assumed this was yet another obstacle built into the game, but after one attempted solution after another failed, I got suspicious and looked in the part\u0027s CFG file to see if there was something wrong with its thermal conductivity or emission parameters - and indeed, I found something!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13276416/KSP/liquidEngineLV-T45.cfg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EliquidEngineLV-T45.cfg\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13276416/KSP/SSME.cfg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESSME.cfg\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs visible in these two files (which are unmodified from the original installation of KSP 1.0.5), the LV-T45 \u0022Swivel\u0022 includes a line setting a multiplier for its conduction of skin temperature to interior temperature, while the KS-25 \u0022Vector\u0022 does not. Upon further investigation I found that during re-entry, the Swivel and other engines heat up both on the outside and inside, becoming quite warm but not dangerously so - but the Vector, on the other hand, remains relatively cool on the inside (often below 500K) while the outside rapidly heats up to over 2000K and causes the part to explode. Since radiators and thermal conduction between parts seem to only deal with interior temperatures, adding radiators and adjusting the way the engines are connected is ineffectual.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fix is simple, of course: add the missing line about thermal conduction to the Vector\u0027s CFG file. But of course then my installation wouldn\u0027t technically have the \u0022real\u0022 stock part ;P So I\u0027ve decided this needs to be brought to SQUAD\u0027s attention and hopefully shoehorned in alongside all the other minor fixes in the queue. In the meantime, hopefully this thread will be useful to others sharing this problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTechnical details:\u003Cbr\u003E\nKSP 1.0.5 Build 1028 (verified) with all stock physics\u003Cbr\u003E\nKSP does not crash due to this issue\u003Cbr\u003E\nObviously there isn\u0027t an exception or anything in KSP.log so I left it out \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jellybug","CreatedById":157711,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-27T22:38:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m SO glad this is a game thing and not a pilot error thing.
