If decreased, input response is very abrupt in the middle, and fine grained towards the edges, while on max setting, input becomes linear (as it should be). This obviously makes no sense, and to me is a bug/oversight. If anyone has a solution, feel free to post.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Neutrino.","CreatedById":165242,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-12T15:25:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust posting to confirm that I have this issue too. Have XBox 360 controller on KSP 1.1.2 Win7 x64 and Vegetal is right. Firstly the sensitivity setting slider is reversed with it getting more sensitive as you lower the slider, and secondly even with the sensitivity setting set at the least sensitive position (which due to the first issue is the maximum sensitivity position) the joystick is still uncontrollably sensitive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy joystick works perfectly well in every other game including FSX, but in KSP it\u0027s completely unusable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is majorly game-breaking as it makes the whole spaceplanes side of the game a horrible experience. I\u0027ve seen dozens of posts on the Internet about people trying to work around this issue using virtual joystick proxy configurations and stuff, but I\u0027m rather surprised and very dissapointed not to have come across anything from Squad suggesting they are doing anything to urgently address this crippling issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
