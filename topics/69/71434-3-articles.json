The fix posted here worked on earlier versions, and I\u0027ll be trying it again. From what I\u0027ve seen of it over several versions, this is probably not due to a mod, but is instead some hard-to-find bug introduced with docking ports in 0.18. And the fix is something that could probably be compiled as a dll that is called whenever the \u0022undock\u0022 or \u0022decouple\u0022 button is pressed, just prior to calling the actual decoupling routine. This is one of three nasty game-breaking bugs*, and the fix is probably something one of the devs could whip up in ten minutes by following Claw\u0027s instructions.

A possible solution is immediately after docking to run through the ship\u0027s data and look for and fix missing docker-dockee links.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternately, it could be something related to the two names \u0022undock\u0022 and \u0022decouple\u0022. These are the same function as far as the user is concerned, so presumably the difference is in the way KSP manipulates ship data for those two functions. I\u0027m guessing the dockee\u0027s vessel name and root uid don\u0027t change, and the docker\u0027s name and root uid both change, whereas decoupling works differently. If that is the source of the confusion for KSP, then the solution is to change the way the game renames vessels, tying a name permanently to each control pod and changing the name only if the user changes it. Then use only \u0022undock\u0022 or \u0022decouple\u0022, not both. If the old root uid is not present on an undocked vessel then the vessel\u0027s new root is the first control pod found, and the vessel\u0027s new name is the name tied to that control pod. In the VAB, if a ship is built with multiple control pods on board, each control pod after the root gets its name based on that root (Foo Ship or Foo Rover or Foo Probe etc.), and when the section of spacecraft is decoupled the probe or whatever already has a name ready to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m not sure which \u0022scene changer\u0022 crash you\u0027re referring to, but there is a known bug that prevents quicksave or returning to the space center.

The scene changer crash occurs when going from a ship to the space center to the tracking station to a ship to switching to another ship in the map screen back to the space center... do enough scene changes and there\u0027s a hard crash.

KSP has a hierarchy order for subsuming ships based primarily on ship type and listed order in the save file. For example, a ship docking with a station results in the station being the root of the new vessel. It doesn\u0027t matter which you\u0027re in control of at the time of docking. If you dock two ships together, the one that\u0027s first in the save file will be the root of the new vessel (regardless of size or part count). I made a whole thread about this, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79594-Docking-and-Vessel-Type-Rules-(0-23-5)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eburied somewhere in the tutorial forum\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, you\u0027re right, docking does work differently. But KSP tracks the old root UID and old vessel\u0027s name. When you undock, that information is pulled and used when reconstructing the ship. If I recall correctly without looking, that name/uid is stored in the docking port because that\u0027s the safe place for it once you start docking multiple pieces together. And frankly, it can\u0027t be tied to a control pod because you can build vessels which don\u0027t have a pod or probe core at all (such as an adrift refueling tank).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-21T17:17:40Z\u0022 title=\u002212/21/2014 05:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Claw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Popeholden","CreatedById":93102,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-04T18:46:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eso is there any indication as to what causes this? it seems to be related to one specific build in my save but i\u0027m not sure what about that ship caused it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jirnsum","CreatedById":80795,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-04T19:09:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt appears this issue is still not fixed in 0.90.

This has worked for me everytime when it has been a ship with thrusters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy I think this works:\u003C/strong\u003E I noticed that if I exited to the spaceport after a jam and went back to my ship there would be a split second upon reload when the ships were free of each other, but the game is still loading and you cannot turn your thrusters on in time to move away. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs soon as you can control your ship at all, the ships lock back together (and if you try and undock again, all your shytt explodes, which is awesome)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esooo... by having your thrusters already on before you exit and return, they are already on during that \u003Cem\u003Einitial loading phase\u003C/em\u003E and the ships are able to move free of each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt says to me that the docks are reverting to a *\u003Cem\u003Eready to dock\u003C/em\u003E* phase immediately after undocking, which they shouldn\u0027t do. Somehow that\u0027s causing them to stick, but they aren\u0027t actually stuck, because if you reload, they are free for just that tiny split-second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I think if there was a distance buffer (say 1m) that after undocking the ship would not be *\u003Cem\u003Eready-to-dock\u003C/em\u003E* until after the ship had exited that 1m proximity limit that may fix the problem...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m no coder, and this is all just an observation, I might be way off the mark, but I thought I\u0027d share anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to post this in it\u0027s own thread, in case it helps anyone else.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-12T11:42:18Z\u0022 title=\u002201/12/2015 11:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KerBlam\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-12T12:54:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery interesting observation.
