This is the first time I\u0027ve installed KSP to a Mac and regrettably I\u0027m already running into issues.

Its hard to replicate the issue and know when it will strike, but I was able to retrieve the following crash report: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2i46BjRv4PRVzBlZnpNYzBBams/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2i46BjRv4PRVzBlZnpNYzBBams/view?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mac Pro is a Hackintosh, but everything else about it seems to operate normally except KSP.
