Such as the PluginData, Plugins, Internals, Parts, Resources and Sound folders. I have checked and even after repeated crashes, modded and such uses, they still remain empty. I am curious, since I am running low on space on my computer. Can I delete this files? Or are they essential for Unity to operate properly?
