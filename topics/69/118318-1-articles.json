I cant place a maneuver node sometimes until I click past my Apo/perapsis, and then drag my node where I want it to be, and sometimes I just cant place it at all. It happens when im going in a really straight line, and when im just in standard orbit..\n\nAnyone else have problems like this?"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T19:38:54Z","Content":"I\u0027m running a few mods, but I\u0027ve had this happen in pure stock installs as well. It also seems to consistently happen after I dock my lander\u0027s ascent stage to another craft in orbit of the Mun. (I\u0027ve been making an Apollo/Saturn V type craft and running a bunch of tests)\n\nI\u0027m going to run more tests in the near future to see if this always happens, or if certain parts cause it. (Namely the docking ports. The craft is using Junior size ports.)"},{"CreatedByName":"OddFunction","CreatedById":143805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T20:01:35Z","Content":"This happens to me constantly, so much so that I\u0027ve begun removing mods one by one to test for potential causes. The only way I can fix this is by going to space center and then back into my flight.\n\nIt happens to me when I enter kerbins orbit, it happens when I enter Muns orbit, it happens several times per play session consistantly.\n\nEdit: Nvm ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Green Baron","CreatedById":107381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-07T07:42:21Z","Content":"I\u0027m having the same problem, though it\u0027s linux and (fairly) modded, but in stock it happens as well. And as far i remenber this bug is not new ....\n\nDragging frequently does not work for me, the node-circle turns read, the node disappears or gets messed up.\n\nOften the bug apperars when the trajectory hits another soi, and when the next orbit is close to the current orbit. Then i can only place a node on the next orbit.\n\nI work around this with precisenode, copy and paste the time of temporary node i placed for another ship."}]}
