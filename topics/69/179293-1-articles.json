I don\u0027t know how to mod or anything like that, or handle the files, just an FYI. Anyways. I bought the KSP Making History DLC off steam. After that, I had a problem knowing how to exactly download it. Contacted steam support, they told me to go in the tab in my library, and click \u0022View downloadable content\u0022 and the problem was solved. Now, in my library, it says the state of the DLC is installed, so I ran KSP. Now its stuck on: Loading expansion assets: Making History (1/2), and it\u0027s stuck on it. So I turned off my computer, and I turned it on this morning. Started KSP, and left my house at 10 AM. Got home at 4, AND ITS STILL ON THE SCREEN!! HOW DO I INSTALL THIS?????
