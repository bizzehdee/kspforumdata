Everything just works fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen i plug in the Mouse, before, while or after booting KSP, the Programm freeze instantly, goes in windowsmode and i see the loading (MAC) ball. I then have to force KSP to stop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf i disconect the mouse and restart KSP, then it works just fine again. But a window opens just once, asking me something about reopen its windows again and two possibilitys --- Dont reopen --- reopen. If i push reopen, KSP works fine again until i connect the mouse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didnt had this problem before 0.24. So i assume that its a bug. Not sure if its OSX or KSP???\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny solution? Im more a PC Gamer, so im bad in troubleshooting things in OSX... My bad...
