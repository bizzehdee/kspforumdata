When I tried to exchange some fresh science the whole KSC-scene gets unresponsive and I had to kill the game (that has already worked a couple of times). When I start the game again I can go to the save, even enter some buildings (I tried the VAB and the tracking station) but as soon as I want to enter the science building the game hangs. Now I even can go back to the main menu and exit the game. Going back to main menu and starting the save again directly does not work, I have to exit the whole game.\n\nAny ideas what happened and how to solve it (ah - its Xubuntu 64bit btw).\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nDyson"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T20:08:11Z","Content":"Hi dyson, can you upload your logs and save file please, dropbox is good for this ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"dyson","CreatedById":43009,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T11:19:38Z","Content":"Hello,\n\nsorry for the delay - I had no more time yesterday.\n\nThe link to the save directory\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/tubvxaqnxelbr4k/AABM0Ug0MRU6u62rMd3u95hua?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/tubvxaqnxelbr4k/AABM0Ug0MRU6u62rMd3u95hua?dl=0)\n\nThe link to the KSP.log (is there any more?)\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/nqqm8ld2b730exp/KSP.log?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nqqm8ld2b730exp/KSP.log?dl=0)\n\nI deleted the old log and made a new one - I only did the folllowing things:\n\n- Start game\n\n- Load savegame\n\n- Open VAB\n\n- Go back to KSC\n\n- Click on Science building\n\nThen the game hung again (and the only thing I could do was to go to the main menu back).\n\nMy game Version is 1.02 - Linux 64 bit.\n\nThanks again."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T13:02:52Z","Content":"Okay I have figured it out, the error is with the vessel markers:\n\n    NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object  at AnchoredDialog.setOpacity (Single value) [0x00000] in :0   at KSCVesselMarker.onInputLocksModified (FromToAction\u00602 inputLocks) [0x00000] in :0   at EventData\u00601[GameEvents\u002BFromToAction\u00602[ControlTypes,ControlTypes]].Fire (FromToAction\u00602 data) [0x00000] in :0   at InputLockManager.SetControlLock (ControlTypes locks, System.String lockID) [0x00000] in :0   at RnDBuilding.OnClicked () [0x00000] in :0   at SpaceCenterBuilding.EnterBuilding () [0x00000] in :0   at SpaceCenterBuilding.OnLeftClick () [0x00000] in :0   at SpaceCenterBuilding\u002B.MoveNext () [0x00000] in :0\n\nYou have three flags at the KSC, \u0022Kerbin grasslands\u0022 and \u0022Kerbin Tundra\u0022 are fine but \u0022\u003E\u003E\u003E KSC \u003C\u003C\u003C\u0022 cannot be rendered because of the \u0022\u003E\u0022 and \u0022\u003C\u0022 characters in the name.\n\nLoad your save and go to the tracking station, click your \u0022\u003E\u003E\u003E KSC \u003C\u003C\u003C\u0022 flag and click on its name in the knowledge base, it\u0027s the \u0022i\u0022 button on the right of the tracking center screen, remove \u0022\u003E\u003E\u003E \u0022 and \u0022 \u003C\u003C\u003C\u0022 and your save will be fixed.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-25T15:09:46Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2015 03:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sal\\_vager**"},{"CreatedByName":"dyson","CreatedById":43009,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T17:06:04Z","Content":"That has solved the problem! Thank you very much sal\\_vager!\n\nAnd only because I finally managed to mark my KSC with a flag to find it easily...\n\nIs this worth a bug report or already a known issue? Because it can really cripple a save-file and nothing indicates that using \u0022\u003E\u0022 or \u0022\u003C\u0022 can lead to such problems.
