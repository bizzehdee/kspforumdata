It doesn\u0027t solve the problem but it removes a huge amount of the hassle of having to quit back to the main screen to get into settings to reset the graphics.\u00A0 Having said that, if this happens once, then it is likely to happen again soon so something in the background is definitely amiss.\u00A0 If it happens twice within 30 minutes I\u0027ll generally re-start the game while I take a coffee break.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyRes -\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022129964\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed2743949615\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/170160-190-anyres-continued-change-your-screen-resolution-on-the-fly/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:212px;max-width:500px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-04-20T00:09:48Z\u0022 title=\u002204/20/2020 12:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EApril 20, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by archiebald\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PTNLemay","CreatedById":30142,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-18T05:37:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223767101\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022191867\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221586197933\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022181783\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cavscout74\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 4/6/2020 at 2:32 PM, Cavscout74 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot a fix, but the only time I\u0027ve had KSP reset resolution is if I click the mouse or tap a key while the game is either in a load screen or otherwise hanging while it\u0027s doing something.\u00A0 If I\u0027m very careful about not doing that, it never resets on me.\u00A0 There also was a mod (AnyRes or something like that IIRC) that allowed you to change resolution without going back to the main menu.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI left KSP for quite a while but only just recently came back to it.\u00A0 And then remembered I made this thread.\u00A0 So... better late than never.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI never noticed this, but Cavscout\u0027s comment\u00A0is exactly right.\u00A0 The resolution reset only appears to happen if you \u0022bother\u0022 the game while it\u0027s doing something intensive like working in a loading screen.\u00A0 I do sometimes fiddle with my mouse or keyboard while things load, leading to a reset.\u00A0\u00A0If I\u00A0go completely hands off during loading, the problem doesn\u0027t come up.\u00A0 So thanks Cavscout.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cavscout74","CreatedById":181783,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-18T18:44:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223910760\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022191867\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221610948228\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002230142\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PTNLemay\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 hours ago, PTNLemay said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI left KSP for quite a while but only just recently came back to it.\u00A0 And then remembered I made this thread.\u00A0 So... better late than never.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI never noticed this, but Cavscout\u0027s comment\u00A0is exactly right.\u00A0 The resolution reset only appears to happen if you \u0022bother\u0022 the game while it\u0027s doing something intensive like working in a loading screen.\u00A0 I do sometimes fiddle with my mouse or keyboard while things load, leading to a reset.\u00A0\u00A0If I\u00A0go completely hands off during loading, the problem doesn\u0027t come up.\u00A0 So thanks Cavscout.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s rather amusing that you left KSP for a while \u0026amp; just came back, since I also was off doing other things and just last week starting playing a little KSP again.\u00A0 Glad I could help\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
