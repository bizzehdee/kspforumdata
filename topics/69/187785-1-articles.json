had a stranded capsule.\u00A0 I sent another ship up after it.\u00A0 The original capsule had no dockiing port, so the Kerbals had to EVA from one to the other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI launched, got into orbit.\u00A0 At that point, the ship consisted of a Mk1-3 capsule, TD-25 decoupler, and a little service module with a poodle engine, an X200-8 tank, and FL-R1 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E tank, some \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thruster blocks, and a bunch of ladders for the Kerbals to grab onto.\u00A0 At this point, I locked staging (Mod-L) to avoid unfortunate occcurences.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I get the two stranded kerbals clinging to the ladders on the service module and start one to the the capsule hatch.\u00A0 I\u0027m having trouble getting from the service module to the capsule.\u00A0 So I figure I\u0027ll let go, use my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E to move to the adjacent ladder and grab on.\u00A0\u00A0 At this point, the controls are operating the Kerbal.\u00A0 I have just used W and S to move along a ladder.\u00A0 I hit space to release the ladder and BANG!\u00A0 The decoupler between the capsule and the service module blows at the same time the Kerbal releases!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I watch the service module and capsule drift away in opposite directions, I switch to the capsule using the ] key.\u00A0 Staging is still locked!\u00A0 And yet...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo for some reason the spacebar for the Kerbal triggered the staging on the ship, even though it was ostensibly locked.\u00A0 Is it because the Kerbal was close to the decoupler (I was trying to cross the juncture between the two modules)?\u00A0 I mean it shouldn\u0027t but maybe the software got confused about whether the coupler belonged to the Kerbal or the ship?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there some way to switch the ladder release or the staging to some other key?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Serenity","CreatedById":179192,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-28T18:03:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote

this right, you entered the craft with the first Kerbal and you gained control of the vessel and not the Second Kerbal that was out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo maybe you got confused and
