It will only go left at 1/4 of maximum (you can see this on the bottom left yaw indicator as well as by how the craft moves), however it will yaw to the right as full speed (possibly even higher than full speed). Its almost as though instead of yaw varying between -1 and 1 it varies between -0.25 and 1.75. \n\nThis often results in SAS producing uncontrollable spinning to the right, since it will go to the right very quickly, overshoot the target orientation, the left yaw will kick in but not do much, it will spin 180 degrees, the right yaw will kick in again, it will speed up going right, etc.\n\nDuring this manual yaw control still seems to be working correctly.\n\nI have found this problem will sometimes fix itself, but I\u0027m not sure how / when. It has persisted when shutting down / re-opening KSP. It has happened to me on multiple ships / landers."},{"CreatedByName":"jkool702","CreatedById":146465,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T16:37:34Z","Content":"Here is an image showing what I am talking about. Here the SAS is set to go to maneuver, and the maneuver is directly to the left of my current location. Despite this, SAS will only go left yaw about 1/4 of the way (can be seen in bottom right of the picture).\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/fjDyze8.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/fjDyze8.jpg)\n\nHas anyone else had this problem? and/or have an idea of how to fix it? Having a buggy SAS is annoying..."}]}
