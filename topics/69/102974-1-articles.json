Logitech also doesn\u0027t offer drivers for the mac because they say it should be recognized. When I go to setup my input preferences in ksp nothing happens. I go to move the joystick, and it\u0027s still waiting for input.

I am having joystick problems as well. \n\nI have played KSP for over a year using a Microsoft SideWinder Precision 2 with no trouble. In the past month I have had lots of problems getting KSP to recognize it during game play. Then two days ago it gave up the ghost. I could not get any functions to work and I could not reassign any functions. So I assumed that the stick was dead. I purchased a Logitech Extreme 3D Pro today. Still no go.\n\nNo buttons nor axis were seen by KSP in the assignment attempt. I purchased a test program and both my joysticks and all buttons show up in the test software. \n\nI went back to KSP and continued to try to assigning functions to my new Logitech. Nothing. Then with my Logitech still plugged in, I plugged in my SideWinder. Now KSP would see button presses of the SideWinder. I tried the Logitech, and now KSP can assign those buttons as well. But the axises of both sticks are still not seen. I cannot get KSP to see any axis of either stick. Pitch, Yaw, Roll, Throttle, and strangely, the hat buttons of both sticks cannot be assigned in KSP. \n\nI still have some of the Sidewinder axises assigned from before, but it is not seen during game-play, and non functional. But if I clear the assignment, I have no way to get it back as the stick axises are no longer seen in KSP. And I have tried every version of re-boot and restart the game I can think of. I even removed all my mods (hence me posting here).\n\nNothing I have tried will allow either stick\u0027s axises to be seen by KSP anymore. I have 401 hours playing this game and this issue has never come up for me until recently. It could have crept in in the last update. I have not been able to play much since then and I am just trying to get back to it."},{"CreatedByName":"Illusion","CreatedById":140614,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T23:04:18Z","Content":"Wow! \n\nNew developments! I launched a scenario. I verified that my SideWinder could do functions with the buttons, but the axises were not recognized even though they were still assigned to the Microsoft SideWinder Precision 2. I plugged in my Logitech and verified that buttons would work, and then to test the axises. But they worked!!! Even though the assignment showed to the SideWinder, the Logitech would control the ship where the SideWinder would not. Then I went back to assignments and now KSP takes my Logitech Axis bindings.\n\nMaybe it is seeing the axis, and is binding it, but it has a display bug for us that is corrected when we come back from a mission. More testing to follow. I will post my results."},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T03:36:12Z","Content":"I pulled out my joystick and set it up for KSP 0.90.
