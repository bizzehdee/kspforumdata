I have been to Mun and have accepted contracts for Minmus, Ike and [oneMore].\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn recent times I did wonder as to why the list with offered contracts got shorter and shorter (because I accepted some of them).

The observed behavior pertains the \u0022random\u0022 ones at least.
