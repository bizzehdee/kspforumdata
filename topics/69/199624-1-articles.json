I could see the one on the right jiggle for a moment, but it stayed in the stowed position.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe only way I could get it to work properly was to attach the hinges separately using radial symmetry and setting the hinge on the right side to Min: -90; Max: 0; Target: -90.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat makes a certain amount of sense, I suppose, but wasn\u0027t intuitive (at least to me) given the other behaviors of parts in mirror mode, and I lost a few clumps of hair figuring it out (no, I\u0027m not the hottest engine on the shelf),\u00A0 so\u00A0\u00A0any constructive thoughts are welcome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InfernoSD","CreatedById":208873,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-19T16:43:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not expected behavior. Mirror symmetry is ideally supposed to be a perfect mirror reflection of a part or assembly. It doesn\u0027t always work out that way, especially with robotic parts. Likewise, it\u0027s not intended behavior for anything to behave differently in-flight than it does in construction.
