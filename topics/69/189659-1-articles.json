Between the black screen periods, my monitor will usually return an \u0022input not supported\u0022 message. It makes KSP unfortunately completely impossible to play.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried disabling V-Sync, lowering the resolution and lowering the refresh rate on my monitor. None of this works.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, running KSP in Windowed mode works like a charm, without any of the aforementioned flickering and black screens. I would be OK with this if -popupwindow worked, but that also seems to activate fullscreen mode (tho \u0027\u0027fullscreen\u0022 gets unticked in settings), with all its associated problems.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nDowngrading to 1.7.3 completely alleviates the fullscreen problem.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy specs:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWindows 10, 64 bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n64-bit KSP, installed through steam, version: 1.8.12694 (en-us)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAMD Ryzen 5 2400G, with Radeon Vega 11 GPU.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n16GB RAM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAOC GV2460V Monitor, with default refresh rate of 75hz.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPlayer.log on fullscreen 1.8 can be found \u003Ca href=\u0022https://pastebin.com/GZNwXNJF\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E (expires in a week).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
