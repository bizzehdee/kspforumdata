This could mean you have a corrupt craft file in the folder. Open the VAB or SPH folder with windows explorer, check for any \u00220 kb\u0022 file and delete it. It should do it. If it still does not work do this:\n\n1-in windows explorer empty the contents of VAB and SPH folders (save a copy of the files somewhere else!!!!!)\n\n2-in KSP, create a new ship in the VAB (a simple thing with stock parts only: like Mk1 command pod alone) ; save it and click New.\n\n3-leave VAB, reenter it, click Load and check if you can load the craft correctly: it should work.\n\n4-then in windows explorer, put one of the craft files back in its folder, then in KSP try to load it in the VAB (I don\u0027t think you need to restart KSP for that, just alt-tab between KSP and Windows). If ok, repeat this step with the next craft file.\n\n5-your \u0022not loading\u0022 problem will reappear with the corrupted file... delete it and the problem should be solved. For safety, keep doing step 4 with all the other files, in case there is another corrupted one. Do it too with SPH folder.\n\nHappened to me a few month ago... kudos to whoever found the correction.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-26T16:28:53Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2015 04:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SnakyLeVrai**\n  \ntypos"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T02:22:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hey Claw, while that\u0027s definitely an issue when purchasing the game from the KSP website, it isn\u0027t for Steam installations.\n\nYou are very correct. That\u0027s my fault for jumping the gun and not noticing the word \u0022steam\u0022 in there.\n\nThe real fact of the matter appears that the stock craft folders are not there, rather than any problems in the save directory. Likely, if you manually add those directories, it will work. Also, steam installs have (on occasion) messed up file permission settings.\n\nThanks for the point out.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Peebothuhlu","CreatedById":105537,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T08:44:04Z","Content":"Update; ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nSo.. went through and \u0027backed up\u0027 all my ship files.
