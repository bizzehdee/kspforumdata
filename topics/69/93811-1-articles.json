I am having serious problems since updating to the new Beta.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first problem I noticed was that all of my parts are now showing multiple times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, I just accomplished my first lunar landings. Yesterday, I got a precision landing in the canyons, got some great science, and brought my Kerbals home. When I went to the space center and hit recover, the ship disappeared, the science was not added to my points, and both of my Kerbals were killed. They were sitting safely on the ground waiting for recovery, then just suddenly listed as lost. \u0026gt;:-(\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I decided to start a new game and see if that fixed the problem. All of my parts are STILL showing multiple times. I completely reinstalled, and am having the same problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI figured maybe I need to download the newest version. I can\u0027t even get that! When I try to download, it says \u0022Invalid Token.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m getting very frustrated with this. I was finally making progress in this, and now the new \u0022update\u0022 has totally screwed up all of my progress and I can\u0027t even get the game to run.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sorry, but if you\u0027re going to release an \u0022update\u0022, how about warning people that the entire thing could go straight to hell if you update. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Saturn","CreatedById":132695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-20T04:50:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, just to add insult to injury, I reinstall again to see a message that they are out of the office until 2015.

Was it via Steam? Or a store-bought zip or installer? Did you remove the old KSP installation first? All the part names changed after 0.24, which means if you updated using the patcher or by just overwriting the old game, you will end up with two of a whole bunch of parts in addition to the SP\u002B parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure how your kerbals got killed during recovery, but I did end up with similar multi-part issues myself going from 0.24.2 to 0.25, and a complete deletion-and-reinstall fixed it. 0.90 is the latest version so if you already have that, you shouldn\u0027t need to download any more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can understand you\u0027re probably a bit upset about Squad deciding to leave the office over Christmas, but hopefully all is not lost and we can try and get you back up and running anyway!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-20T05:07:55Z\u0022 title=\u002212/20/2014 05:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by technicalfool\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Saturn","CreatedById":132695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-20T05:14:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks Technicalfool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI upgraded via the Squad Updater.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I reinstalled, I installed to a different folder and got the same results.

It\u0027s a problem for me to try and resolve because I\u0027m a mere moderator: I can bug-spray forums, IRC channels and announcement comments, but there\u0027s about a snowball\u0027s chance in hell of me being let near the Store back-end, so there\u0027s very little I\u0027m going to be able to do about store download errors other than hope to poke Rowsdower or similar about it when they get back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can also see that it seems to be a Linux installation, and I\u0027m not familiar enough with the Linux version of the Squad patcher to know if that\u0027s a copy of rsync installed with the patcher, or a general copy installed in a user\u0027s home directory and compiled from source. From the \u0022/home/lapo/package/rsync-3.0.9-1/src/rsync-3.0.9/main.c\u0022 path name, it looks like it might be. I do know rsync is up to v3.1.1 these days, whether that makes a difference is anybody\u0027s guess though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027ve also seen is some people having to run rsync (and therefore the Squad patcher) as root to avoid an Error 23, however that was for using rsync in other things than Kerbal Space Program. Now I don\u0027t know why the Squad patcher would want root on a Linux box, and that\u0027s definitely an \u0022at your own risk, back everything up first\u0022 option, but depending on what rsync is trying to write to, you may not have permission to do so unless running as root.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, before trying the above with the patcher, remove everything from GameData. Delete the Squad and NASAMission (and any mod) folders and let the patcher re-sync everything. Obviously, keep an old \u003Cem\u003Eworking\u003C/em\u003E copy of the game around in case that doesn\u0027t work out either.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-20T07:13:01Z\u0022 title=\u002212/20/2014 07:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by technicalfool\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
