Load times have significantly increased with version number and of course are much worse with mods, so it\u0027s a really handy thing to be able to do. Similarly, while making any kind of painfully long manoeuvres when I couldn\u0027t time accelerate (like in low orbits) I used to just tab away from the game for a while and it would run in the background. I know this changed quite a while back, but I was wondering if there was anyway to force this behaviour back into the game. I thought the option to \u0022simulate in background\u0022 might do it, but that obviously pertains to something else. Any info on this (how I can get the functionality back, what the reason for the change was, etc) would be appreciated, thanks \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-20T22:49:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s no way to actually disable this feature. You can, however, work around it -- it only does this when the game loses focus, which can only happen in native fullscreen mode. So, you have the option of just running it in windowed mode if you want... but you can leave it in fullscreen and use the \u003Cem\u003E-popupwindow\u003C/em\u003E command to make it run in full-window mode. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis option is available in the KSP Launcher (if you use the Launcher) under the Advanced settings; I believe it\u0027s called \u003Cem\u003EFake full-screen mode\u003C/em\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you use the Steam version, you can add the \u003Cem\u003E-popupwindow\u003C/em\u003E flag as a launch option (right click KSP in the Steam Library, select Properties, then click \u003Cem\u003ESet Launch Options\u003C/em\u003E and type the flag into the textbox that appears).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerBlammo!","CreatedById":63139,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-21T10:33:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vexx32\u0022 data-cite=\u0022vexx32\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eit only does this when the game loses focus, which can only happen in native fullscreen mode.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t understand that statement - If you click in any other window while KSP is in its own window, that still shifts focus away, whether KSP is windowed or not.

Yes, this \u0027stop running when focus is lost\u0027 behaviour does not (at least, as far as I am aware; I\u0027m sure I\u0027d hear about it otherwise) manifest at all in windowed modes (incl. the fake fullscreen mode). Something about how the OS, graphics card drivers, and Unity interact... Not too sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESomething\u003C/em\u003E is a little weird with how Unity and/or Windows itself (and possibly other OSs, I\u0027m not totally sure) handle fullscreen mode applications. When they\u0027re not in-focus, attempting to load graphical assets (and just generally do any actual processing) can quite frequently lead to very odd issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not totally sure of all the technical details myself, but I know for a fact that in the past, simply alt-tabbing out of the game (or any other method of shifting focus away from KSP) when it\u0027s in true fullscreen mode has been the cause of any number of really odd glitches. Most were simple texture glitches that disappear on a game restart, but every now and again something more troubling would turn up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo my knowledge, these oddities are not Unity-specific, but I could be wrong. More than a few fullscreen applications (especially those that are primarily designed as full-screen applications) tend to do much what KSP currently does when they lose focus; they stop processing. The Assassin\u0027s Creed titles are some that spring immediately to mind. I\u0027m not even sure if they \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E a natively supported windowed mode, too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuffice to say, something weird happens, and I\u0027m not fully sure where the faulty code is.

What I find odd is that I USED to be able to alt\u002Btab out of (proper) full screen while the game kept running, sometimes for many hours, without any undue effects. I don\u0027t think I care enough to go back to my old versions to see which one was the last version to allow it. Maybe it changed when Unity was updated. Shame to lose the functionality, though, especially at load up. I\u0027ve actually had very little trouble alt\u002Btabbing away from other true full-screen games.
