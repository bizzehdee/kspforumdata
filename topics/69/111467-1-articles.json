I had hoped that the problems with joysticks had been solved with the final release but I still can\u0027t get mine to work at all. I\u0027ve tried altering sensitivity and deadzone settings to ridiculous extremes yet any craft I attempt to pilot immediately goes into insanely high rates of spin along all axes, even when SAS is enabled.\n\nIs there any way to play this game with a joystick? Any guides on how to set one up to work with this game (apart from installing dodgy VB compilers or PPJoy?)"},{"CreatedByName":"NeoMorph","CreatedById":58200,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T12:58:29Z","Content":"I\u0027m using a HOTAS Warthog and have no probs. Have you calibrated your joystick in Windows itself? I\u0027ve got a SW 2 FF floating around somewhere in my flat and if I can find it I\u0027ll have a go at using it in KSP as well but I think the thing is to get windows calibration working first... In XP the SW2FF didn\u0027t need calibrating IIRC but my Hotas needs recalibrating after every time I pull it apart to do mods."},{"CreatedByName":"volcanicshrimp","CreatedById":139666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T12:32:00Z","Content":"I have this problem with my thrustmaster usb joystick. The dead zones are totally off and don\u0027t have a centre option (being able to centre the dead zone looks like it would fix the pitch and roll). Advanced fly by wire fixed pitch and roll but even that couldn\u0027t fix the throttle which seems to be increasing the further from the middle it is and reaching full throttle at about 25/75% throttle. The joystick is perfectly well calibrated in windows and works fine with flightgear.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-04T12:51:54Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2015 12:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by volcanicshrimp**"}]}
