Running windows 8 64 bit, I\u0027ve seen that this is a conflict, but It\u0027s ran fine for me many times before. I can\u0027t find a crash log, but that may be due to the reinstall.\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/1ddcx4dknz16c50/KSP.log?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1ddcx4dknz16c50/KSP.log?dl=0)\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/cnogjodqoml23ue/output_log.txt?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cnogjodqoml23ue/output_log.txt?dl=0)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-07T00:10:34Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2015 12:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by true659**"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T23:13:42Z","Content":"Hi true659, the KSP.log is in the game folder and output\\_log.txt is in KSPData, also we\u0027ll need your dxdiag log, you can post them on dropbox or pastebin then link them here.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I realized that Nvidia dropped an update yesterday and that\u0027s the only thing that has changed. So I went to the Nvidia folder in my drive and ran the setup.exe. Not sure if it got corrupted along the way through the install or what. But apparently rerunning the setup fixed it. It\u0027s 337.88 so if anyone\u0027s having a similar issue hope it helps. If anyone could give insight on why that caused that it\u0027d be great to hear, I\u0027m assuming it was just a bad install, it caused a few of my games to go down."}]}
