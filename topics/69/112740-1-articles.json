In addition to doing this, it forgets most of the joystick bindings and you have to redo them every time--again, only if you don\u0027t have the joystick connected. If the Joystick is connected, everything is fine.\n\nI can send an example settings.cfg, if someone needs help reproducing this.\n\nWas not a bug (either forgetting the settings or asking about anon data) in .90."},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T05:22:39Z","Content":"This is a known bug - at least known to the user community if not to the devs (hint, hint).\n\nIt triggers when you do these steps:\n\n 1 - Plug in a controller, like a joystick or gamepad.\n\n 2 - In the KSP configuration screen, start setting up bindings for it.\n\n 3 - Then you stop using the controller, so you unplug it.\n\n 4 - From now on KSP refuses to save your settings properly in the settings.cfg file, and forgets your previous config from the last time you ran - this is why you keep getting the \u0022send data?\u0022 question each time - it failed to save the fact that you answered it already because it\u0027s failing to save \\*everything\\* else in the settings too.\n\nIt also messes up your ability to do things like save video settings or audio volume levels.\n\nWhat causes it: Once there exist settings in the file that try to map joystick axes, on each subsequent run as it reads the settings file up front, it ends up running code that \\*unconditionally\\* expects a joystick to be present and doesn\u0027t gracefully handle the case where one is missing. When it gets an exception because the joystick is missing, not only does that make it abort the rest of the joystick setting code, it also ends up aborting the entire process of reading the rest of the settings file and forgets everything else in the settings file after the control mapping section.\n\nThe workaround fix: Use your controller again, or if you really didn\u0027t want to use it anymore, plug your controller back in, temporarily. Then run KSP again. Go to the settings screen and turn off all the controller axis mapping options. Then save the settings and quit KSP. Unplug your controller and try running KSP again. From now on it should read the settings all the way to the end again."}]}
