Sometimes Kerbin is replaced with a giant lense flare, but sometimes there is simply nothing there. I cannot see Kerbin, and I cannot see the path of my ship, and if I hit \u0022M\u0022 again, I cannot return to \u0022ship view\u0022 to control my ship.\n\nIf I return to the launch facility and look at the tracking view, I can see Kerbin, my ship, and the path of my ship, however, I cannot jump in to control the ship. It was tragic that I lost Jeb because of this, and due to autosave, I couldn\u0027t revert and try again.\n\nI don\u0027t think this issue is related to an un-upgraded tracking center, because I also came across this issue in \u0022Science\u0022 mode.\n\nAny ideas?"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T23:03:59Z","Content":"I understand what you are saying, but I don\u0027t have any ideas off hand. I would recommend restarting KSP (you might have just run into a random bug) or maybe trying to starting a new game.\n\nAlso, if you could [have a look at this thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92230-%21%21%21-PLEASE-READ-BEFORE-POSTING-%21%21%21-Stock-Support-Bug-Reporting-Guide), it\u0027ll explain what other information you can provide (like logs and pictures) that might make it easier for us to figure out what\u0027s going on.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"}]}
