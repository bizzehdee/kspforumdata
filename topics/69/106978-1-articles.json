Parts that *are* stowed are intentionally disabled. That\u0027s another topic all together (feedback, and not a bug). There are a lot of these threads, and I want to collect the issues into one place.\n\n**Purpose of this thread:** To consolidate all of the issues with parts that are not able to activate while stowed, despite the fact that they are not stowed.\n\n**What parts:** Stock cargo bays, stock service bays, and stock procedural fairings.\n\n**Details:** Are important. Provide pictures or a craft file of what\u0027s happening. If you don\u0027t know how to do that, [see this thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92230-%21%21%21-PLEASE-READ-BEFORE-POSTING-%21%21%21-Stock-Support-Bug-Reporting-Guide).\n\n**What this thread is not:** Do not use this thread for complaining or general bug reporting. Any such posts will be removed, since this thread is specifically designed to get to the root issues of the \u0022stowing\u0022 process that disables various parts. This thread is also not about the functionality of procedural fairings beyond stowing.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T21:43:21Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 09:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw**"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T22:28:51Z","Content":"Oh...Wow.

I\u0027ve loaded a save prior to lander separation and the Puff engines had the \u0022stowed\u0022 problem. Opening the service bay enabled activation of the Puff engines.
