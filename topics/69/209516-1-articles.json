I purchased a new SSD for my desktop, installed it, and installed Linux Mint 20.3 on it. Shortly later, I installed Kerbal Space Program and both DLC expansions. I configured my game settings and ran the game, performing a test flight of the Aeris 3A around the Space Center. In this flight, I noticed framerate was considerably lower than what I would have expected for my hardware specifications and settings. I proceeded to check framerate with the F12 debug menu, and noted framerate was indeed lower than expected for a Stock install, averaging between 60 and 70 FPS (I have a 144 Hz monitor and a limit set to 160 frames for the game).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI proceeded to do a fresh install on my Windows 10 drive, and copied the config file from the Linux install to the Windows one, to test performance with the same settings. I found it was much higher, often maxing out at or hovering around 160. I was hoping to heavily mod my install, as I\u0027ve done with previous versions in the past, but having a lower framerate right off the bat may make that nonviable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have tried running the game with Feral Gamemode, but I did not notice much of a performance improvement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs the Linux version of the game just that much worse performing than the Windows counterpart, or is there something else going on that I\u0027m not aware of? Any and all help would be greatly appreciated!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESystem Specifications:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOS: Linux Mint 20.3 x86_64\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKernel: 5.15.0-46-generic\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDE: Cinnamon\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWM: Mutter (Muffin)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 7 1700X (16) @ 3.600G\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 (I am using the proprietary NVIDIA 515 driver, not the open source one)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMemory: 16gb DDR4\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDisplay(s): x1 1920x1080 144Hz (primary), x1 1920x1080 60Hz (secondary)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf there is anything I\u0027ve missed please let me know and I\u0027d be happy to provide.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-08-26T18:58:22Z\u0022 title=\u002208/26/2022 06:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 26, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Molthus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EClarified detail\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Curveball Anders","CreatedById":107529,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-08-26T18:52:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo clue when it comes to Mint, but on Ubuntu you can either use the open source driver or install the propriety Nvidia one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m using the nvidia-515 driver pack and getting similar result as under windows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Molthus","CreatedById":222640,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-08-26T18:57:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood thing you mentioned that, I forgot to include that I am using the Nvidia-515 proprietary driver instead of the open source one.
