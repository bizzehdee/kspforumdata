It occurred during a play session, and continued to happen until I restarted the game. So, it may be due simply to my computer f\u0027ing up, but I feel like I might as well post it anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically, I was attempting to send a De-Orbiter unit into LKO (basically, a fuel tank with a bunch of chutes attached to it and a claw on the end). Normally, not a big deal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn most situations, it works without a hitch. However, if I performed any sort of Time Warp while it is in focus, a very strange thing would happen. Something at the end of the ship (maybe the claw, maybe the probe core, who knows) would become kinematic (Unity-speak for \u0022completely immobile in every way). This would cause the bottom of the ship (where the rockets are) to, well, do some strange stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rockets would fire fine, but since the top of the ship refused to move even an inch, the rockets would swing around and eventually snap off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI managed to get into into LKO once, but when I tried to time warp there, the same thing would happen. The ship would come instantly to a halt, and any thrust applied would just throw around the back of the ship, while the front sits perfectly still.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m gonna attempt to re-create this tonight and get some clips of it occurring (if possible).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/jvKMx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
