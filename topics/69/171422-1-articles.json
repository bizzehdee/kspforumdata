As I mentioned in my original post I tried AFBW but it didn\u0027t work, however recently I got the newest AFBW finally working, and that eliminated the input lag for once. Some bad news though, SST isn\u0027t usable anymore in KSP, since it introduces a delay on my emulated inputs and repeats them weirdly, which hasn\u0027t happened before in any other game I\u0027ve used it on. But the AFBW menu makes me able to use key combinations which is enough for KSP, and I can live without the mode selector here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-06-28T08:29:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2018 08:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Hyperion101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chris Solomon","CreatedById":186539,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-30T04:42:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsupposedly the lag issue is was fix or at least reduced in latest version. only problem is, i can not currently figure out how to assign the stick axis from with in KSP. nor can i find this supposed HOTAS generic profile that was supposedly added.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m4ti140","CreatedById":67296,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-16T20:10:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.9 and the issue is still here\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sam Dangit","CreatedById":217193,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-01T20:27:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI managed to fix my input lag issue by turning down all the graphics settings.
