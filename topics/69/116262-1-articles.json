Clicking on the antenna and choosing transmit doesn\u0027t help. This is unfortunate with goo cans and science juniors, as the science part becomes inoperable but science points are not granted.\n\nHere\u0027s [ksp.log](http://pastebin.com/c5k6RACv)\n\nIn science archives, I can see that the said experiment has happened: Materials study from [mun biome] data value 4.00 science 0.00."}]}
