Whenever I step on or into the bay, my kerbal loses its footing and starts ragolling or freezes momentarily and tips over. I tried moving the ladders around, removing stuff from the top of the bay, removing experiments from the bay and rotating the bay itself, but nothing helped. I also tried hacking gravity, RCSing on top of the bay and then unhacking gravity... still the same problem. Strangely enough, on one of my older attempts everything went fine. \n\nPictures here: [http://imgur.com/a/jJy8p](http://imgur.com/a/jJy8p)\n\nSample craft here: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/2ybkdryvm3npcne/Munblaster%202_4.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2ybkdryvm3npcne/Munblaster%202_4.craft?dl=0)"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T16:54:34Z","Content":"Yes, seems service bays have one issue currently that may be the cause of what you reported. That issue is already known. Thanks for the info."},{"CreatedByName":"CanobeansPL","CreatedById":142884,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T17:15:17Z","Content":"All righty!
