It seems to work, I press f5 and it says \u0022quicksaving\u0022, I hold f9 and it says \u0022hold f9 to load a quicksave\u0022. But after holding f9, il lags for a pair of second, and nothing happends, the rocket just flies like i didn\u0027t do anything. The weird thing is that when I go to the main menu i can\u0027t load if I\u00A0tried to load a save, and I have to exit the game and enter again. I can\u0027t do it manualy neither. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game, I deleted cache, I\u0027ve been looking for some answer in the forums... but nothing seems to solve it. It started when I cheated A 600 parts craft to orbit. If you have any slution, please make me know.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd yes, the quicksave option is enabled, my pc runs on windows 10 64bits, and I deleted the 600 parts caft.\u003Cbr\u003E\n(BTW sorry about my bad english)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-06-07T11:48:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2020 11:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Adriajoa21\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
