You can check the flight log any time by pressing F3.\n\nI\u0027m away from the computer right now but I\u0027m pretty sure this has happened to me in normal gameplay, not during a tutorial, and it has to do with the fact that for some reason small parts overheat for no reason in this current version of KSP. It can be avoided by opening the debug menu by pressing alt \u002B 12 and checking the box \u0027Ignore max temperature\u0027.\n\nOf course, having to resort to the debug menu in order to play the game normally is a very bad thing, and I hope Squad fixes it in 1.1. This bug means I can\u0027t use a lot of parts because they overheat for no reason, such as the short adapters that I like to attach docking ports to on my crafts."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T14:56:00Z","Content":"Hi malby, please upload your output\\_log.txt from the KSPData folder to pastebin.com for us, thank you.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-25T19:27:53Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2015 07:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw**\n  \ntypo in link"},{"CreatedByName":"malby","CreatedById":148748,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T22:21:36Z","Content":"I had to do it in two (640kb output log)\n\n[http://pastebin.com/w5cmaT12](http://pastebin.com/w5cmaT12)\n\n[http://pastebin.com/gaT6Rypu](http://pastebin.com/gaT6Rypu)\n\nyorshee, I\u0027ll try, but on the flight basics tutorial you don\u0027t even get a chance, it is a literal explosion on tutorial load, i guess the cheat settings persist"},{"CreatedByName":"malby","CreatedById":148748,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T01:11:42Z","Content":"As an interesting additional piece of info...\n\nI own two copies of the game now, I bought it on Steam a couple of years ago, and I bought it on GOG just then.
