I can run DayZ Standalone (which is known for being optimized horribly as of now) at a solid 60 fps with everything maxed, yet now for some reason KSP can\u0027t run at something playable. I\u0027m wondering if it has to do with it being in 64x bit. I\u0027m downloading the 32x bit as I write, to do some more testing. Regardless, I have no idea why KSP can no longer run to something playable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone know why?
