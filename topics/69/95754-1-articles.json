I searched but didn\u0027t see it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been playing KSP for a few months now (thanks to a mention on XKCD!) and recently decided to try and be a more active \u0022tester\u0022 of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt appears that the Tutorials will adopt the technology progress of the last game you were playing, which can lead to an inability to complete the tutorials. It is not the tech tree progress, but the mission control/tracking station development level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am in version .90. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Build ID in my BuildID.txt file says 00705. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERunning on Windows 7, 32 bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot Steam.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suspect this may be a cross-platform bug, but don\u0027t have the other platforms on which to test! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I load a career game in which I have not yet unlocked maneuver nodes, then quit to the Main Menu and go into training, and select, for Example, To the Mun Part 1 (but it also happens on Asteroid Recovery), the first thing that the tutorial wants you to do is create a maneuver node, however I am unable to do so. I am unable to complete the tutorial and must end the scenario. If I then go load a sandbox or science game, then do the same thing (quit to menu, run the tutorial), I am able to add the nodes. I have recreated this a number of times so it is easily repeatable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor thoroughness, I loaded the career game, the quit KSP altogether, restarted KSP and went to the tutorials. The nodes were available, so it is obviously just an in-memory persistence issue where the availability of the advanced capabilities needs to be reloaded as a part of the Tutorials.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I don\u0027t want to hijack my own thread, but there is now a tutorial for Kethane, which requires the mod. Since the tutorial is being included as stock does that mean that Kethane will also become stock?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELove the game. Keep up the good work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKevin\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-05T20:17:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah you\u0027ve found a definite bug here KiloMike, obviously the tutorials aren\u0027t setting the building levels when run.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not seeing a Kethane tutorial though, I\u0027m guessing you installed Kethane and it comes with its own.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KiloMike","CreatedById":134519,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-05T20:24:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI thought I had installed .90 into a new directory, but I may have accidentally installed it over my previous install, which I did have modded.
