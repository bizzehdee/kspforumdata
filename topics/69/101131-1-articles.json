You know, someone to keep track of the burns while I keep the rocket on heading, or run RCS while I do the mouse clicking stuff.\n\nAnyways I fly with a 360 controller as it\u0027s the closest to a 6dof controller I have kicking around. I used to play Descent with it in 6dof using every single control on the thing simultaneously which makes it occasionally challenging to keep in your hands ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\nWhen I hooked up the second one, I found that KSP cannot distinguish one controller from the other! If you bind a button on one controller, it is bound on the other one too. That makes having 2 controllers fairly useless..."},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T04:18:38Z","Content":"I believe this limitation had something to do with Unity, but judging from the devnotes from a few weeks back, it *should*\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9 be fixed in the next version."},{"CreatedByName":"rectifier","CreatedById":138727,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T04:26:23Z","Content":"Good to know, thanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"rectifier","CreatedById":138727,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T21:01:01Z","Content":"Found a mod that solves this. \u0022Advanced fly by wire\u0022 recognizes multiple devices, and also lets you bind button combinations and switch between presets with a button.\n\nAlso you can review and change bindings INGAME! Yay!\n\n Finally I can easily switch my controls between rockets and spaceplanes! Now if they would stop randomly blowing up on me ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"}]}
