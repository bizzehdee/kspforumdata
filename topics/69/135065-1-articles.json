Only a subset of controller buttons is supported.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGame controllers can have as many as \u003Cu\u003E32 buttons plus an 8-way hat switch\u003C/u\u003E, as exemplified by the Thrustmaster HOTAS Warthog throttle. However, KSP only supports the first 20 buttons of any controller. (Also, it does not support any of the 8-way hat switches on any of my controllers, though I am not sure whether this is due to the 20-button limit or whether KSP doesn\u0027t support 8-way hat switches at all.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E2. Controller #0 buttons are treated special.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny function assigned one of the buttons of controller #0 (\u0022JoystickButton\u003Cem\u003EN\u003C/em\u003E\u0022) will also respond to the corresponding button of \u003Cu\u003Eany\u003C/u\u003E other controller (\u0022Joystick\u003Cem\u003EX\u003C/em\u003EButton\u003Cem\u003EN\u003C/em\u003E\u0022), making the buttons of controller #0 pretty useless in any multi-controller set-up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E3. Controller button assignments are unstable.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the sake of button mappings, KSP identifies the controllers by a numeric ID (as opposed to the controller name, as appears to be the case for axes), which is assigned by Windows in an arbitrary fashion at each system start-up and may be subject to change, even if the set-up is left entirely unchanged. Disconnecting and reconnecting a controller, or a hub with multiple controllers connected, may also mess up the ID assignment. This makes controller-heavy set-ups in KSP a PITA to use, as every once in a while the buttons will fail to work as expected due to a change in the controller IDs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E4. Not all essential functionality can be mapped to game controllers.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor controller-heavy set-ups It would be desirable that all essential in-flight operations can be performed without having to reach for the mouse (or the keyboard for that matter). However, one functionality that I deem essential, namely activating flight controls (including bringing up the artificial horizon) while in map mode, currently seems to be only possible by using the mouse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E5. Primary and secondary axis mappings do not mix well.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPrimary and secondary axis mappings currently work on a \u0022highest amplitude wins\u0022 basis. Although this is good enough for cases where you might want to use one controller at some time and another controller at some other time, \u003Cu\u003Eadding\u003C/u\u003E the amplitudes would work just as well for those cases, while at the same time improving the use of the secondary mapping as a trim input (e.g. using a joystick for pitch control and a slider for pitch trim). As it is now, using the secondary axis as trim input has the negative side effect of introducing a variable deadzone to the primary control input.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ECan we expect the above to be fixed in 1.1?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EEdit:\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI might add that I\u0027m currently using a combo of 5 game controllers, integrated into a homebrew cockpit (originally designed for a different game, but it also works ok for KSP, but it would work a lot better if the aforementioned issues didn\u0027t get into the way):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\na Thrustmaster HOTAS Warthog joystick (19 buttons \u002B one 8-way hat switch \u002B 2 axes)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\na Thrustmaster HOTAS Warthog throttle (32 buttons \u002B one 8-way hat switch \u002B 5 axes)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\na Saitek Pro Flight rudder pedal set (3 axes)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\na custom switch panel hooked to a JoyWarrior24GP32 generic controller IC (up to 32 buttons \u002B 2 axes synthesized from a 4-switch array)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\ntwo gamepad-style mini-joysticks hooked to a JoyWarrior24A8L generic controller IC (up to 16 buttons \u002B 4 axes)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m running Windows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-27T17:38:20Z\u0022 title=\u002203/27/2016 05:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 27, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Christoph Lipka\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded information about my set-up.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SMILIE","CreatedById":72171,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-03T22:38:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m also struggling with #1 and #3 a lot.
