Go to Start, right-click My Computer (or Computer, if you\u0027re on Win7/8) and select Manage. A nice complicated Management screen will pop up with two panes. In the left pane, look for the entry named \u003Cem\u003EDevice Manager\u003C/em\u003E. Click it, and you\u0027ll see a list of all your computer\u0027s devices appear in the right pane. What you\u0027d want to do is work out which USB hub your mouse is on. That\u0027s a little above my knowledge as I\u0027ve never needed to do it myself, but from memory you can open the Properties of the mouse (which you will almost certainly find under the name Human Interface Devices, or sometimes Input Devices) and look through it. In the information there it \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E list which USB hub it\u0027s attached to. If not, you\u0027ll have to compare them all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA little further down the device list, you\u0027re looking for USB Root Hub devices. Depending on how many USB ports your computer has, you may have several. My own computer has three sets of USB ports, and the device listing has something like four to six USB Root Hub devices. Open the Properties windows of each of these, and look through their Resources tabs. If any of them list a Resource Conflict, change their assignment right away. Otherwise, you might have to note down the resources they\u0027re using, and compare them with other devices -- as steve_v said, might be an idea to check the video card, which you\u0027ll find under the Display Adapters category.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I also found this, which seems to be a slightly simpler way of doing it, but essentially the same.
