I\u0027m NOT referring to the initial load time at the start of the game. It\u0027s every loading transition\u00A0after that: \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E overview to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E; \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to launchpad, reverting back to launch/ \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, flying to tracking station, even exiting the game. Every step\u00A0just gets bogged down after an hour of playing and it\u0027s soul crushing after 2 hours. At that point it takes as long to quit\u00A0as it does for the game to initially load! Insanity.\u00A0Otherwise,\u00A0performance seems consistent- frame rates seem\u00A0the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMemory use\u00A0increases with time too, roughly 3 GB up to 8 GB. I originally had 6 GB of ram and this problem was even worse. Game was often crashing after 3 hours. With 12 GB it\u0027s better but not fixed. I ran the game overnight yesterday and then it crashed after another hour of playing (waiting more than playing). It was a stack overflow. I didn\u0027t try to capture that. I just removed all 12\u00A0mods - no change. I did a fresh download of KSP from Steam- no change. I have ran windows memory and drive checks in the last couple months - nothing found. I ran Windows file check a few weeks ago and it found and fixed a file, but that didn\u0027t change this issue. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI checked the KSP file integrity in Steam many times and it always says there is 1 corrupt file after exiting the game. Even with fresh install. Sometimes there are more, worst was 8. Does anybody NOT have 1 corrupt file after exiting the game? Maybe a false positive, wrong hash? Grasping at straws. It says 0 corrupted if I run it twice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo to better quantify this, I loaded my career save (about 50 flights) tested transition time from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to launch pad with a single MK1 command pod. Initially, it\u0027s 26 seconds. Slow but OK. Then reverting to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and going back to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E overview, doing absolutely nothing for 20 minutes and repeating \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E -\u0026gt; pad, it was 33 seconds.\u00A0\u00A0These were the same\u00A0within a second with/ without mods.\u00A0Actively playing seems to accelerate this. Remember the delay happens at EVERY transition. Not fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll come back and try to upload log files later. Just let me know if this is normal for you too.
