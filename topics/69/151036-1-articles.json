However even though I can still play it. My question is, is there a way I can edit my save file o add these new advance settings that were previously not there, or is it to risky? Can I add the new comm font in the upper left corner of the screen with this savefile? Or do I have to start a new game to use all these new features?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://postimg.org/image/3pqpzoq6l/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://postimg.org/image/3pqpzoq6l/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"swjr-swis","CreatedById":152460,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-29T00:42:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222828083\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022151036\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221477692913\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022131178\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ShadowElite\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, ShadowElite said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy question is, is there a way I can edit my save file o add these new advance settings that were previously not there, or is it to risky?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s always risky to move saves between major versions of KSP, so keep a copy of them archived just in case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, and although I don\u0027t move saves myself between versions (it\u0027s easy enough to keep a different version installed to \u0027finish\u0027 those): I have gone into the Difficulty section of the in-game settings plenty of times now to switch most of the settings on and off back and forth in different combinations, and so far I\u0027ve seen no ill effects. It appears the game copes with it well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven that, I would expect that loading an older save and resaving it should make it good to go, and then in-game you can go into the Esc menu, settings, Difficulty, and tweak the new options to your liking, to then continue the save. Just keep in mind that some settings can have very intended adverse effects if you enable them: probes could lose control, or parts in deep sea/Eve\u0027s atmosphere may explode from pressure, etc etc. Nothing a reload of the previous save can\u0027t resolve though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-29T00:51:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou don\u0027t need to hack the save (though you can).
