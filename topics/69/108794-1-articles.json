Placing them so the thrust should vector directly through the CoM while being placed vertically, I discovered the direction of thrust was always angled a few degrees to one side.\n\nThis was in a modded install, so in an effort to troubleshoot, I removed all my mods and started a new sandbox game. \n\nI then took, in the SPH, a command pod, fuel tank, and 2 Twitch engines mounted with symmetry and angle snap along the center line (can be seen in the attached craft file) and sure enough, the thrust is still inexplicably offset a few degrees to one side.\n\nWhat\u0027s going on? Is there anything I can do about this?"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T19:41:42Z","Content":"Hi Wintersdark, I\u0027m not sure I understand, are you saying the thrust is angled or that the thrust is detached from the engines?\n\nIt should look like this.\n\n![8hdrOpe.png](http://i.imgur.com/8hdrOpe.png)\n\nIf it doesn\u0027t, then one of the addons you removed has already modified your parts files, and you will have to replace them."},{"CreatedByName":"Wintersdark","CreatedById":128573,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T19:56:53Z","Content":"![Angled%20Thrust.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/28016101/Angled%20Thrust.png)\n\nThis. This is in the modded install, but the result is exactly the same with all mods removed. Said modded install is very minor (KER, StageRecovery, etc, and all mods that add parts do so via modulemanager. I install things carefully (that is, I always add mod subfolders directly, never just overwriting GameData), and already removed and used Steam to rebuild GameData/Squad to be sure.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nBut even if the engines where somehow modified, and not projecting thrust straight.... as they\u0027re applied with angle snap and symmetry along the midline of the craft, no matter how wonky they were they should \u0022cancel each other out\u0022 so to speak.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nFurther investigation.\n\nIf I add a single Twitch engine w/o symmety, the thrust is angled correctly slightly off center but exactly along the angle of the engine. \n\nSee: ![Aaaah.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/28016101/Aaaah.jpg)\n\nSo it\u0027s angling outboard correctly, I assume, here. However, when a second engine is added on the other side in the opposite position (without symmetry, so I\u0027m not getting 3 engines total), the thrust vector doesn\u0027t center but leans off as in my first pic above."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T20:00:48Z","Content":"Looks like you found a bug in how KSP handles the angled engines, whether they are placed in symmetry or not, this also affects the o-10 puff monoprop engine and any other engines place at an angle.\n\nTo fix this with the Twitch, turn on angle snap, hold left-shift and tap W or use the rotate tool to rotate the engines 5 degrees, they will look like this.\n\n![eDIcwJ5.png](http://i.imgur.com/eDIcwJ5.png)\n\nTwitch engines are 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 off from vertical."},{"CreatedByName":"Wintersdark","CreatedById":128573,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T20:01:18Z","Content":"This \\*may\\* be a vector display issue in the VAB/SPH (the same thing happens in both); as my tests with small vessels off the launchpad seem like they launch straight up.

I\u0027m not sure how to better test that (yeah, I should have done the tests unmodded given the forum, but I get the same display results from unmodded)...
