ALL.\u00A0 2 big things I noticed:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nToggle snap does not appear to work.\u00A0 By default, snap is off (shows the circle) but building still \u0022snaps.\u0022\u00A0 This is even more noticeable when attempting to have the Engineer use the Move Tool to adjust a part location.\u00A0 Whether the circle or the hexagon is showing, it is attempting to snap to parts when building or adjusting.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nParts are not attaching correctly.\u00A0 I\u0027ve trying to build a simple rover.\u00A0 I\u0027ve placed a Rovemate down, and I am trying to attach an M1-F wheel to start building a rover.\u00A0 The wheel always attaches at an incredibly odd angle no matter where you try to place it.\u00A0 Then when you click build, it tries to attach it differently (like it tries to correct and attach flat).\u00A0 Further, 50% of the time when I attach a wheel, it corrects the position and sends the attached wheel and Rovemate flying through the air.\u00A0 You can see in my screenshot below as my Rovemate with 2 wheels attached goes flying by the distant sun.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t see any specific bugs opened for this, but, this just seems like maybe EVA Build on planet surfaces needs another look.\u00A0 Maybe its just me, but it\u0027s not very practical or useable in the current form.\u00A0 I think the big thing is, when you place a root part in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E, the part is initially placed above the surface and stays there.\u00A0 When doing EVA Build on a planet, the part stays a few meters off the ground for about 2 seconds, and then falls to the surface.\u00A0 Maybe a way to make the root part only hover above the ground until the user exits EVA Build mode?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022D378305C7B6C0D15FD9BC00EA4F6C8D13CFCA8A3\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1666861730512638852/D378305C7B6C0D15FD9BC00EA4F6C8D13CFCA8A3/\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
