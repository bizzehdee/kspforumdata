I have a large spaceplane (SC-20 Monarch) that uses a pair of those to angle the front of the plane up for unloading. I\u0027ve been using it for weeks to Minmus and back with no problems. Now, I think since 1.4.2, they blow up all the time no matter where or how easily I use them. I\u0027ve been trying to edit the CFG file for them, but KSP is ignoring the contents of the CFG. I can\u0027t change the description\u00A0 or anything to do with the LT-2, so the game has to be getting that data from somewhere other than the CFG. I even disabled all my mods an tested it just in case it was an Easter Egg or something. It did it even with a stock install.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
