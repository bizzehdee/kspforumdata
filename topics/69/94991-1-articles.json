This is because KSP is built on the Unity 4 engine, which, currently, is 32 bit. The warning is simply telling you the game is prone to crashing, regardless of mods - almost clockwork. However, if the lag when running 32 bit is Unbearable, and you\u0027re comfortable with the regular crashes, then 64 bit is fine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, 64 bit Ksp IS 32 bit KSP, just tweaked a little, so versions should still be up to date.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy rocketeering!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-30T12:07:00Z\u0022 title=\u002212/30/2014 12:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by cantrbe\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"alexio12345","CreatedById":133749,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-30T12:19:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi, Thanks for your quick answer, i played the whole day yesterday with mods, and haven\u0027t experienced a single crash yet!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"alexio12345","CreatedById":133749,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-30T12:29:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually the Windows 64 Bit version is 0.25 ...

You could try running 32 bit KSP in OpenGL instead? It helps it run more smoothly and I saved almost a gig of ram by doing It!
