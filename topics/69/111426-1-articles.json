I launched the plane directly from the runway. After flying over to the island runway (and landing almost successfully), I reverted to launch. I realized I didn\u0027t want to launch again, so I reverted to the SPH. I saw my plane for a second in the SPH, and then the game immediately crashed. That\u0027s about it."}]}
