KSP gets confused by two parts sharing the same name, so every time you buy one of these parts, the game will unlock the new version but it displays the old version instead, which will stay locked/unavailable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe easiest way to fix this, is a clean reinstall of the latest version of the game (or the version you want to run). Create a backup of you savegame, uninstall the game (evtl you have to remove some remaining game files manually), then reinstall it. After restoring the backup of your savegame, you should be able to unlock these parts \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tornado77","CreatedById":198744,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-13T14:06:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just moved my KSP folder somewhere else, re installed the game and I replaced the squad folder now everything work fine !\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
