But have been playing Kerbal for a little over a year (not that that means I\u0027m any good). Anyways, I just got a new laptop and was excited because I expected it to be able to run Kerbal. I can run it on my desktop computer which was new in 2010 with an i7, whatever the 2nd best ATI card was at the time and 12gb of DDR2. My new laptop is an HP envy with i7-4710 the intel integrated 4600 graphics and 16gb of DDR3 and windows 8 64 bit. I started up the game (I have the version I purchased through steam and I just downloaded it to this new computer yesterday) and its running at a pretty slow framerate, somewhere around 15. Graphics are set pretty low and I am not running any background programs or anything. Is the graphics card really not capable of playing this game? I know its not top of the line but I would have expected it to at least come close to matching a card from over four years ago. Anyone have any advice or ideas of how I might be able to get the game running a little smoother? Preferably without sacrificing too much of the graphical integrity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-20T04:51:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBy the looks of it, that Intel integrated GPU is probably what\u0027s killing you. Even the very high end Intel GPUs are going to be only just capable of KSP. As far as trying to make it smoother, I\u0027d say try turning off antialiasing and vsync to see if that helps first. If you\u0027ve already turned texture and terrain detail down, then try running in progressively lower resolutions, though I wouldn\u0027t want to run KSP much lower than 1280x720.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFailing that, you can try forcing OpenGL mode with KSP.exe -force-opengl to see if that makes any difference. Depending on your drivers, you may get better or worse results.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-20T04:54:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you run the OpenGL flags, I also recommend you use the -popupwindow flag. It forces the game into borderless window mode.
