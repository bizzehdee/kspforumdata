Other things to note might be to check whether you have any screen capture/recording programs open while KSP is running, as sometimes Unity is a bit iffy with those kinds of programs. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T10:15:18Z","Content":"Also, do not alt\u002Btab out of KSP, especially while KSP loads, you will break the game.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-18T16:19:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2015 04:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sal\\_vager**"},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T16:16:40Z","Content":"This happens to me occasionally.
