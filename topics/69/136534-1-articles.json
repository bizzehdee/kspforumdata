So my question is, in the .1014 version there\u0027s a bug with the Mk3 Engine Mount, which is that when you try to use the mirror placement option and you try to attach a part the editor simply refuses. It will be green to attach the part, yet it will not. I\u0027ve tried alt click and also enabled the part clipping option. Was this fixed in .1018?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-11T01:37:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHelp?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-12T14:51:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I just loaded up a game, clicked on Mk3 engine mount, enabled mirror symmetry and attached two vectors without any problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-12T15:54:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222509718\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022136534\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221460472700\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022153264\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Plusck\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Plusck said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I just loaded up a game, clicked on Mk3 engine mount, enabled mirror symmetry and attached two vectors without any problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHm ok.
