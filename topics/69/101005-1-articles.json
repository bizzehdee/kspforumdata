My kerbal is on EVA on the Mun. I switched to a nearby vessel, switched back, and he falls through the ground. Possibly the most frustrating way to end an early career mission. Or indeed, a career as a whole, since I can\u0027t revert. Save file editing seems to be my only option.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-01T14:53:22Z\u0022 title=\u002203/01/2015 02:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran**"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T15:57:21Z","Content":"This is often due to terrain detail settings. Having it set low risks kerbals and craft \u0022falling\u0022 through the terrain (although it generally seems worse for kerbals). Try bumping up your terrain detail a little.\n\nAs far as saving your kerbal, his status will depend on what difficulty settings you have. If kerbals are set to respawn, then your kerbal will reappear back at KSC after some time. If respawn if off, then you will indeed need to edit the save. Let us know if you need help with that.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T13:16:54Z","Content":"That\u0027s a good idea, but all my settings are at full. I just edited his altitude up a few meters. More of a \u0022bug that might want a look at for a polished final version\u0022 than a \u0022bug that actually affects me personally\u0022."}]}
