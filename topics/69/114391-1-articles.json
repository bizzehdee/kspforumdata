Upon further examination, I noticed that my ailerons were barely even moving. Later, on the ground, I switched the other control surfaces along the wing to roll as well and took a couple of pictures. The problem should be immediately apparent.\n\nControl surfaces in normal position:\n\n![FF7CCEE14F154D713B98742FC8ECE33A9A510023](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/621843625269502271/FF7CCEE14F154D713B98742FC8ECE33A9A510023/)\n\nControl surfaces in roll position:\n\n![993682AEA800AB22F73B9A535C6A7714FF76678E](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/621843625269502468/993682AEA800AB22F73B9A535C6A7714FF76678E/)\n\nThe control surfaces have barely moved at all! What\u0027s worse is that the leftmost 2 control surfaces have actually rotated in the opposite direction that they are supposed to (This was later confirmed in flight). It is very possible that this is due to the forward sweep of the wings, which is shown in the picture below:\n\n![275E0B033864B99B64F7B0E751D828AF490F3B13](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/621843625269502649/275E0B033864B99B64F7B0E751D828AF490F3B13/)\n\nBefore I bring this post to a close, there are definitely a few concerns some of you might have which I have to address:\n\n-I did have a few mods installed when I took those screenshots and first observed the problem, but removing the mods did not solve the issue\n\n-The sideways facing pod shown in the SPH picture was not attached in any of the tests, with the kerbal in the command seat. The ailerons actually moved more when the craft was being controlled from the pod.\n\n-In case this was some glitch with controlling from the command seat, I added a forward-facing probe core in the fairing acting as the nosecone of the aircraft. This did not solve my problem.\n\n-I did replace the aileron with several other control surface types, all of which experienced the same problem\n\nI honestly have no clue why my control surfaces set to roll just aren\u0027t acting correctly. I suspect it to be something with the aerodynamic changes SQUAD made in the most recent update. It would be most helpful if anyone could shed some light on what is going on here.\n\nThanks!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T23:44:39Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 11:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Noname117**"},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T22:11:23Z","Content":"Just tested, it works perfectly for me.\n\nAnd don\u0027t complain about people taking under a day or so to reply. To test something we have to set up a fresh KSP install with the given configuration, do the test, then report.

Some have moved more than others, some have moved less. Some are trying to roll the aircraft in the opposite direction. As a plane designer, these tests show that at least my KSP is broken, and possibly everyone else\u0027s games too."},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T01:46:28Z","Content":"Ok, I see the issue more clearly now.\n\nA part opposed to its direction of control won\u0027t actuate. Actuation amount is scaled by angle (specifically, it\u0027s multiplied by the cosine of the angle between that of an optimal control surface for the input and the actual angle of the surface.) \n\nThis means that you no longer have to disable yaw on horizontal control surfaces, or pitch/roll on vertical ones. It\u0027s an odd change, and not in the patch notes as far as I can see. It would make building basic planes easier, which could be the reasoning.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-28T01:49:18Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2015 01:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SAI Peregrinus**"},{"CreatedByName":"Noname117","CreatedById":53624,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T01:59:54Z","Content":"Thanks for clearing up this issue a bit, though I am still uncertain as to why that would cause control surfaces to rotate in the opposite direction of what they should.\n\nAnyways, can someone wake me up when SQUAD fixes enough of their game for me to find it playable again?
