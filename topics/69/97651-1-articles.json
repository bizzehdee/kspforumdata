I started with Kerbal Space Program in 0.23.5(call me newbie if you want). When I heard of version 0.24, I didn\u0027t know how to update it, so I looked it up in the wiki page, found the patcher and downloaded it there. I executed it, and all was fine. Shortly after that, when 0.25 came out, it first seemed to work well. But I opened KSP, and suddently my saved games were all messed up, and most of the parts were duplicated. It didn\u0027t get better with 0.90; even the models and textures were all over the place(I had to reinstall KSP both times).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I recently saw what great stuff will be added in the next version(new aerodynamics system, you should really check it out), I decided to ask the nice guys at the forum what I did wrong, so I can keep my old save games for the next updates.

The easiest thing to do is to delete the entire contents of the GameData folder and then rerun the patcher so it can download the correct files. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Interplanetary Engineer","CreatedById":136090,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-07T16:35:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you, vexx23.
