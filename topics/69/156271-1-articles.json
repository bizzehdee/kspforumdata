I followed the guide adding the command module and then adding the parachute on top of it. Next step in the guide is checking and adjusting the settings on the parachute.

As a result, the guide\u0027s \u0022next\u0022 button simply refuses to light up effectively blocking/breaking the training session.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d like to request a solution to this problem so I can continue the training sessions / tutorials.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sebi.zzr","CreatedById":81294,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-11T23:11:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222951335\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022156271\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221486767033\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022174820\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Futteren\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn \u200E10\u200E.\u200E2\u200E.\u200E2017 at 11:50 PM, Futteren said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d like to request a solution to this problem so I can continue the training sessions / tutorials.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello and welcome to the forum.I see you\u0027re little confused,the parachute is set to 0.04,so just move the bar to 0.2.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHappy launching.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerwood Floyd","CreatedById":99768,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-13T00:18:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLook again more closely.
