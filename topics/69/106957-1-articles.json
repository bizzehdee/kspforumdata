(~10-20 FPS).\n\nBut in the KSC view or when i\u0027m flying, there is no problem (~40-60 FPS).\n\n![745ff8f7fe.png](http://puu.sh/hz1OF/745ff8f7fe.png)\n\n![b22b1eec37.jpg](http://puu.sh/hz1QC/b22b1eec37.jpg)\n\n![f9b38c6723.jpg](http://puu.sh/hz1S0/f9b38c6723.jpg)\n\nKSP Version: 1.0.2.842\n\nWindows 7 Pro\n\nGraphic card: GTX 670\n\nProcessor: Intel i7-2600k\n\nRAM: 8GB\n\nMods: Clean install (no mods)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T11:35:17Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 11:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Panini**\n  \nSolved"},{"CreatedByName":"Pentheus","CreatedById":142796,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T23:26:12Z","Content":"Are you running the game in OpenGL mode by chance? I was having the same problem and it was caused by the Space Center Crew being rendered. If you rotate your view so you are looking at the back of the VAB does your frame rate jump back up? If so try turning off \u0022Show Space Center Crew\u0022 under the General Tab under Settings from the main menu."},{"CreatedByName":"Panini","CreatedById":142755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T11:34:32Z","Content":"Yeah !
