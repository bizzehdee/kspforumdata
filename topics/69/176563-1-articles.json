I spent the following days updating drivers, installing antivirus, and making sure that my external drive was clean.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have all my drivers updated, and all of the hardware is installed properly and I\u0027m back up and running. Every other game that I\u0027ve played runs properly (Before I break them with mods and have to reinstall)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, for some reason, when I try\u00A0to launch ksp, all I get when I start it up is a completely black screen with nothing but the in-game cursor. No loading bar/splash screen/witty loading text at all. I figured something happened with the install, so I deleted it, and downloaded the latest installer from the site, got the game installed, but noticed something else a little odd. The launcher seems to be missing the background image, and is just replaced with white.\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/ahNPe7q\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMy blanked out launcher\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have tried updating every driver I can think of, I have tried running it as an administrator, I have tried troubleshooting compatibility, I have tried reinstalling multiple times to different locations, I have gone into the config to change the resolution settings, but for some reason, KSP is the only game that is giving me a hard time, and I can\u0027t seem to pin down the reason.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would provide a log, but it\u0027s not giving me one to post. I haven\u0027t changed any hardware out from before when it ran perfectly fine before the windows reinstall (Windows 10, 64bit btw)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause of the launchers missing images, I think it\u0027s just not rendering the game for some reason, but that\u0027s just a shot in the dark from me, and I have no idea what I would do to fix that if I was right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-08T19:38:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Don\u0027t use the launcher.\u00A0 Launch the game directly from the KSP.exe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) How long are you waiting?
