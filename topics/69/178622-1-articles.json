A couple of weeks ago, I got back into it and began playing it again. It\u0027s been all fine and good, but there\u0027s one slight issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor some reason, the launcher\u0027s background, which I would assume has an image behind all of its information, is blank, and looks a bit out of place. Furthermore, the place where the versions are supposed to be shown are blank (It says Current Version ID: -\u00A0 and Latest Version ID: - ), and I can\u0027t use the update button as a result. I managed to update the game manually from 1.2.2 to 1.4.5 or whatever it is now, but the launcher did not change during my update process. Other than these issues, the launcher itself seems fully functional, but whenever I launch the game it asks me if I want to allow the program to make changes to the computer, as if its some installation program rather than a game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNone of these issues directly affect the gameplay, but they are concerning me a bit. Is there anything I can do to fix this?\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-29T14:34:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe launcher was \u0022discontinued\u0022 awhile ago afaik, it\u0027s fairly non-functional now; just ignore it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe permission request is due to your security settings.
