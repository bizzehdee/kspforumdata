If you EVA and view the flight from the tracking center its status will be landed. Touching the vessel on an EVA at this point causes the Kerbal to go flying wildly about.\n\nMods / Add-Ons: All Stock\n\nSteps to Replicate:\n\n1) Construct a vessel that will wedge faring debris against parts of the vessel when the faring is deployed.\n\n2) Get into orbit.\n\n3) Deploy the faring.\n\n4) While debris are in contact with the vessel attempt to hit ESC and return to space center, it will not be possible as it says you are moving across the surface.\n\n5) EVA from the vessel\n\n6) Return to space center\n\nResult: View flight in tracking center, the status is landed. Attempting to fly the vessel again is extremely buggy. It does not respond to most control inputs.\n\nFixes/Workarounds:\n\nNone known.\n\nImages here:\n\n[http://imgur.com/a/1KtkS](http://imgur.com/a/1KtkS)\n\nLogfile Here:\n\n[http://pastebin.com/gaybVfw1](http://pastebin.com/gaybVfw1)\n\nFlight in question starts around 18:50\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T03:12:06Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 03:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Supernovy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T03:11:52Z","Content":"This is a known bug."}]}
