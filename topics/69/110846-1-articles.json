After restarting the game, I can spawn infinite Jedbro Kerman models. \n\nThere is always a Jedbro on the ship. He can go EVA, which will violently eject Jedbro and disturb the ship. The EVA Jedbro does not respond to keyboard commands, but wiggles if I click my mouse. When I switch back to my ship, another Jedbro is still on-board. I can repeatedly EVA an infinite number of Jedbro manikin clones.\n\nI have attached the crash report and a image gallery of the infini-Jedbro bug.\n\nEDIT #1 - I get a 2nd bug when I return to the spaceport. I get a vessel loading error. I have added a screenshot to the Imgur library below.\n\nEDIT #2 - After reloading the game for the 3rd time, the bug has cleared itself. The Jedbro clones have vanished, and a single Jedbro remains. He responds to keyboard commands as he should. The only repercussion is my ship is lying on its side and has a broken solar panel. \n\nCrash report: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6nKHXY9yO6Vc1lKeEJhN2xGcG8\u0026authuser=0](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6nKHXY9yO6Vc1lKeEJhN2xGcG8\u0026authuser=0)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
