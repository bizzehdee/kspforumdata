I created a fresh install, downloaded the new version from Steam, and launched a simple craft into orbit. Unfortunately, when it got there, I found what seems like it must be a bug. Whenever I try to use any of the direction assistance options from having a level 3 pilot, I end up with all my control surfaces oscillating wildly, including engine gimbal, [as seen here](http://www.gfycat.com/AbleClearcutBallpython). At least the craft ends up pointing in the right direction. In addition, when I went to reenter, I found that I had a similar, but worse problem in the atmosphere: [See here](http://www.gfycat.com/IllustriousValuableBoa). In that case, it looks like the craft is jittering and rotating past the target orientation. I have a saved game in this state, so I can upload any information needed."}]}
