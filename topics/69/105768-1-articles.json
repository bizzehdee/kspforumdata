I created a new career mode and went into the VAB to build my first rocket. I noticed the following:\n\nI noticed first that there was two MK1 Command Pods, labelled slightly different. One was MK1 Command Pod, the other Command Pod MK1. One has 10 units MonoProp. the other none. The heat tolerance on one is much different.\n\nI selected one, then the other; both yielded the same results. I cannot attach anything to them inline. no parachutes, antennae or fuel tanks/ engines. It does allows me to attach a goo canister from the side.\n\nI created a sandbox game to see if other parts behaved the same way, some did and others did not (MK3 cockpit)\n\nAny ideas?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T15:32:23Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 03:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by BROBI**"},{"CreatedByName":"TheMoonRover","CreatedById":136199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T22:32:35Z","Content":"I don\u0027t know why you have two Mk1 Command Pods, or what the cause is, but I\u0027m having the same problem when I add a few new parts to my mod. I\u0027m wondering if it might be that two parts have the same name (in the code). I\u0027ll investigate that."},{"CreatedByName":"BROBI","CreatedById":142086,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T23:05:07Z","Content":"I might have a bad install from Steam - I\u0027ll have to investigate more when I get home"},{"CreatedByName":"BROBI","CreatedById":142086,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T15:35:41Z","Content":"Solved:\n\nBad install from Steam. Used Verify Cache, returned with over 250 files not correct. Removed local data, reinstalled; still had problems, albeit a little better.\n\n**Removed all items from C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\Kerbal Space Program and reinstalled through Steam and voila! everything works as expected.**\n\nTurns out there was a great deal of duplicate parts, items available that shouldn\u0027t have been unlocked yet, no contracts showing up; and that is just to name a few.\n\nHappy flying!"}]}
