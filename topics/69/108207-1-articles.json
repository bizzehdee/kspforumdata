(Though you will be able to focus on other celestial bodies). Can be fixed in game by going to the tracking station or changing ships. Not game breaking but very annoying."},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T14:26:31Z","Content":"You can press backspace to focus on you current vessel."},{"CreatedByName":"burningcrow","CreatedById":108540,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T20:20:48Z","Content":"This is happening on mac too fyi. I\u0027m also unable to click on the orbit and bring up the orbit tool. Without that I\u0027m pretty much wasting my time. Anything about that?"}]}
