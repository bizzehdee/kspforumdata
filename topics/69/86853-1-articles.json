It was a long mission, and I had visited both minmus and the mun, so lots of memory use. Does that mean the KSC buildings need to be reloaded on approach, and glitch out during that?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T21:38:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have noticed this issue in old versions, I don\u0027t think a cause was ever found.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould you add the information detailed in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92230-Stock-Support-Bug-Reporting-Guide\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis thread\u003C/a\u003E?

I flew on a close flyby of the Mun, then re-entered kerbin somewhere over the desert and flew around a bit at low level looking at ground, then went back to KSC to land. Result: mystery explosions. I don\u0027t think the spaceplane is anything special, but I\u0027ve included the craft file just in case. The effect seems to happen exactly the same way if you cheat and use infinite fuel, so it\u0027s fairly easy to replicate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
