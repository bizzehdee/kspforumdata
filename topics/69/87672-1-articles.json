Use 14.10\u003C/strong\u003E. AMD GPU\u0027s really, really benefit from the updated kernel and Xorg that only the newest distro\u0027s have. I have an R7 260x, with Ubuntu 14.04 I had to use the fglrx driver to get 20-30 fps with heavy mods. I can do the exact same with Manjaro Linux running the latest Xorg and Radeon driver (radeon is the open source AMD driver...it\u0027s in the kernel so you have to be running the latest kernel, xorg, and mesa to be using it\u0027s updates). Manjaro is a snapshotted, Arch Linux, really good blend of bleeding edge and stability. While I think Manjaro is awesome, it is rough around the edges and does require a bit of terminal maintenance to deal with a few quirks it has. One benefit with Manjaro is Steam comes preinstalled, and in the Manjaro repos, you\u0027ll find a steam-native package that tweaks the default Steam install to use your system libraries and, for a lot of games, run better than with using the Ubuntu 12.04 libraries that Steam comes with. That steam-native package also comes with a Steam compatibility mode that forces Steam to use it\u0027s old libraries for the few games that have issues. KSP benefits from using the system libraries and is why a lot of us copy/paste it to somewhere else and run either directly or with a script.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and one other AMD/FGLRX issue you need to know -- don\u0027t use the driver from the driver manager....seriously, you\u0027ll regret it....go to AMD.com, download the latest available driver (14.9 the last I checked), and build and install it manually (it\u0027s two terminal commands you can copy and paste).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith Nvidia cards, for GPU drivers and Ubuntu, do a search for the Xorg-edgers PPA and install the Nvidia driver it has.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother option for GPU drivers is the SMXI or SGFXI scripts. SMXI works with Ubuntu/Debian based systems and does a lot of neat stuff. SGFXI is a driver installing script that works with Ubuntu/Debian and Arch/Arch based systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you just wanna play KSP, go with Ubuntu 14.10. If you wanna play KSP and also wanna learn a bit of Linux with an optimized and up-to-date system, go with Manjaro 8.10 or 9 testing (recommended over 8.10...it\u0027s old and about to be replaced...you\u0027ll thank me when you don\u0027t have to hit the terminal on first boot to fix some very minor annoyances...or \u0027 sudo pacman -Syyuu\u0027). Both have easy installers and Xtoro\u0027s 30GB shrink rule is true with both (I think all us Linux people have been repeating that like a broken record lately).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t have the greatest of system specs, steer clear of Kubuntu and instead use Xubuntu or Lubuntu. They all have the same installers and instructions to install, but they have different desktop environments when you\u0027re done. X and L run with the least amount of bloat out of all the Ubuntu based systems. With Manjaro, go with either the XFCE version (what I\u0027m using) or the Openbox version (what I used last year) for the light weight .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you get it installed..or not..come to the Linux support thread and we\u0027ll help ya as best as we can.

If you have a GPU older than those, it really doesn\u0027t matter what distro you go with because you\u0027ll be using the old, legacy drivers, but you will still benefit more from an up-to-date OS because the legacy driver is one of the various radeon open source ones (the legacy flgrx is kinda crap).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022xtoro\u0022 data-cite=\u0022xtoro\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOh I don\u0027t know how the whole steam thing works, never liked it. Can you not log into the ksp site and download whatever version you want?

From there, just download and install it. Really easy and simple...it\u0027s same on every Linux distro that has Steam and identical to how it\u0027s done on Windows. After that, I like to copy/paste KSP to a different folder so my Steam KSP is always unplayed and untouched in case I do something dumb and screw up my mods or whatever. It\u0027s just nice having a clean KSP around versus having to have clean it all up, repair the install, blah, and blah.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-18T15:15:59Z\u0022 title=\u002210/18/2014 03:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by skeevy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-18T20:12:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@skeevy Good point on the system specs...
