I think this is an \u0022out of memory\u0022 crash (I\u0027m not a KSP.log expert though). The thing is that I have 16GB of RAM sooooooooo its definitely a bug :/\n\nI had done many different mission items (like 6 items of 3 different contracts) during that flight so it might be mission related.\n\n[KSP.log](https://mega.co.nz/#!GE10iIaY!6l3GSlfCUXMa2dCFwdrj5E0MAxYZHL_3cBxmFb_swxM)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T19:41:14Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 07:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by earth**"},{"CreatedByName":"Zzabur","CreatedById":94190,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T17:02:44Z","Content":"About the same issue here, i got ctd after few mins, seems like a memory issue. I used to play 0.90 with about 20 mods and no RAM issues with vessels containing several hundreds of parts. Now i crash on \u003C30 parts vessels and no active mods.\n\nI have this issue on any missions, but it seems to happen often when aerodynamic effects are displayed, but not only. Sometimes even 1 minute after loading a game, it seems very unlikely that i run out of memory under this circumstances, though i got sometimes more than 90% memory used after few mins without mods and small ships."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T20:02:50Z","Content":"As KSP 1.0 is 32bit your 16gigs isn\u0027t being used, it\u0027s a limitation of 32bit programs unfortunately."},{"CreatedByName":"Zzabur","CreatedById":94190,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T20:32:57Z","Content":"KSP should run vanilla without any memory crashes, it happens only 2 minutes after loading any save, with small ships/stock parts.\n\nI am playing since 0.14 with tons of mods, i already crashed because of memory usage, but it happens when i run too much mods. In last version 0.9 32bits, i played hundreds of hours without any memory crash with about 20mods (FAR, USI mods, mechjeb, distant objects, scansat....) and huge vessels.\n\nUpdating to 1.0.2, memory issues on a vanilla install after 2 mins in a 4 parts ship, it is obviously not working as intended, even in 32bits. I didn\u0027t had any of this kind of issue in 1.0.1, even after hours of playtime. Even using vanilla\u002BATM mod doesn\u0027t prevent early memory crash. There is definitely some kind of memory leak issue in 1.0.2 in my opinion."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T20:38:20Z","Content":"Here\u0027s the crash, it looks like KSP was generating Mun craters at the time as \u0022PQSMod\\_VoronoiCraters.OnSetup ()\u0022 is only used for those I think.\n\n    [EXC 21:18:37.973] OutOfMemoryException: Out of memory\tLibNoise.Unity.Generator.VoronoiCached.ConstructCubeArray ()\tLibNoise.Unity.Generator.VoronoiCached..ctor (Double frequency, Double displacement, Int32 seed, Boolean distance)\tPQSMod_VoronoiCraters.OnSetup ()\tPQS.Mod_OnSetup ()\tPQS.SetupMods ()\tPQS.StartSphere (Boolean force)\tPQS\u002B.MoveNext ()[ERR 21:18:38.399] Could not allocate memory: System out of memory!Trying to allocate: 2097152B with 4 alignment.
