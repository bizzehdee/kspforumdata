I booted up one of my old saves , and from the begining I suspected something was wrong. First of all, the Anti alliasing wasn\u0027t loading in, when I zoomed out and looked at the Kerbal space center it had jagged lines all over it! I ignored it, and continued on and entered the construction building, from the inside I noticed that some of the textures looked very low resolution. And finally, The game was playing at a significantly higher framerate than it normally does on my GPU. I know that it isn\u0027t set to the lowest graphics settings because I turned them down to compare. Finally, I rebooted, and re-installed the game to see if it would solve my problems, and unfortunately it did not. I have bought the game through steam if that helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vectura","CreatedById":119212,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T15:14:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf by old you mean from a previous version, well, all kinds of funky stuff can happen. Low res textures are normally because you have turned down the texture quality in the setting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eanfran","CreatedById":130314,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-29T02:41:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been toying around a bit more, it seems that it is actually just the alliasing.
