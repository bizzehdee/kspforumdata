It was related to an update to my firewall software, Comodo.\n\nI decided to delete and reinstall afresh, and on doing that noticed that Comodo had, unprompted decided to install the game into a different part of my drive - I have subsequently unticked the sandboxing options, moved the game back to C:/games and it all seems to be working fine.\n\nI don\u0027t know what happened pre-reinstall but perhaps it was stopping me running particular executables - anyway, now fixed.
