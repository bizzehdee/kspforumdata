Moving this to the (unmodded) support forum, as it\u0027s a support request/bug report.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem also may depend on how you\u0027re running the game. There may be some OS X users here who have had similar problems. If you\u0027re running with Windows, then as previous people here have mentioned, the Windows x64 edition is horrifically buggy and really shouldn\u0027t be used. Unless you absolutely need the ability for the game to access more than ~3.7GB or so of RAM, stick with 32 bit. OS X has no 64 bit edition, so if you do want to go overboard with mods and use tons of RAM with your game, use Linux x64, as that\u0027s a lot more stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should be able to edit the thread and put a prefix up to say what OS you want support with.
