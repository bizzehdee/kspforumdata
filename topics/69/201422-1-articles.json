I was doing a pretty normal mission to Dres right, pretty boring, but I decided to go do some biome hopping and flew around 4000 meters away from my craft with my scientist\u00A0and collected some science from another biome. When I came back to my ship however all of my science parts, batteries, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E ports, and my ladder were laying perfectly below my craft in the same orientation they were placed on my craft. I reloaded a quicksave and came back to the craft and the same thing happened again. Additionally when I rewelded all the parts my craft had gained a ridiculous amount of mass and had lost over 1000 m\\s of Delta V, which blows because I was going to do some biome hopping but got screwed out of it by this bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s some pictures of the bug:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/PvW5DGB\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/PvW5DGB\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also have mods installed but they are all visual and I don\u0027t think they have any impact on this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMod List\u003C/strong\u003E: Astronomers Visual Pack, Distant Object Enhancement, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, Final Frontier, Scatterer, and Transfer Window Planner\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThis is a brand new, fresh install of the game, and the save was created in version 1.11.2.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EHere\u0027s the craft file:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.mediafire.com/file/ec1y2kfu6rfu1nw/Void_Space_1.craft/file\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.mediafire.com/file/ec1y2kfu6rfu1nw/Void_Space_1.craft/file\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone else encountered this?

The only thing I can think of is it may be linked to part clipping as few parts clipped there, combined with parking on a slope it\u2019s just unable to re-construct the vehicle properly when you return.
