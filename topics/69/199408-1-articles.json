While playing the game, I can see my CPU usage is only about 20-30%, but my GPU usage is at 100%, and only ever drops down to about 60% in the map screen. The lag also stops in the map screen and mission timer turns green.\u00A0 When not in map screen the mission timer is also almost always\u00A0yellow. Running 4x physical time warp, the mission timer is still green, again, provided if I am in map screen.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething that I find really interesting, is that sometimes, I don\u0027t run into any problems at all.
