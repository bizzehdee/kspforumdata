The problem is that, even though I am in the region specified (my plane is in fact landed dead-on the spot where the navigation tool says it is, and on the world map it is also exactly there), landed / gracefully crashed, stepped out and created said report, it isn\u0027t ticked in the list.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried several contracts / regions with these mission parameters and all amount to the same result; no go on the surface EVA report, no way to complete contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am running a clean 32-bit Windows ZIP installation from the website in a new career. I have had the experience that sometimes lack of memory sometimes introduces problems here and there, contracts being ticked off 2 seconds after they have been completed and other such delays, but those problems always come with similar problems in other aspects of the game, this does not and is replicable (in my copy anyways).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried and find something similar on the forum but was unable to find a similar post, so I assume there is none and I am the only one having this problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thyriel","CreatedById":113679,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-25T20:14:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edon\u0027t have my KSP at hand at the moment, but i think those contracts want surface samples and not EVA reports\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-25T22:02:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, be sure to read this sticky: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92230-%21%21%21-PLEASE-READ-BEFORE-POSTING-%21%21%21-Stock-Support-Bug-Reporting-Guide\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92230-%21%21%21-PLEASE-READ-BEFORE-POSTING-%21%21%21-Stock-Support-Bug-Reporting-Guide\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA screenshot (of the map view, the contract pulldown, and the Kerbal itself in this case) would help diagnose the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake sure you\u0027re actually landed with the Kerbal, and not on a ladder or standing on the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile still in the craft, go to map view, select the waypoint and hit \u0027Engage Navigation\u0027, then see if the navball icon for the waypoint is blinking.
