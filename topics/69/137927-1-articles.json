Second, open up your KSP installation folder and try to run the KSP Launcher. If that runs, click the little gear icon at the bottom and change your graphics options - reduce stuff to minimums, set the resolution to your monitor\u0027s native mode or lower, and uncheck\u00A0the full screen button. Odd as it sounds, I\u0027ve had much better performance in KSP since I unchecked Full Screen and then use the menu bar option to make the app full-screen through OS X.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, that\u0027s all I got.
