KSP 1.0.2)\n\nSmall landing gear brakes accelerate when tied in an action group with LV-T30 (not tested with other engines).\n\nThe engine has a 0 trust limiter set and not working.\n\nWhen I press the brake key it accelerates even tough I am on 0% trust with the main trust control. \n\nDoes not work while in the air(flying) only works when touching the ground.\n\nIt accelerates at about 5 to 15 m/s.\n\nBug is reproducible.\n\nEdit: Looks like it happens when I travel with more than 37 or so m/s on the surface.\n\nPicture of craft:\n\nEdit: Brake torque 30.\n\nEdit: Confirmed its only on certain places of land it may have nothing to do with the action groups(because it accelerates only on certain places and brakes on others it has to be moving on the ground tough).\n\n(Reason for \u0022Aerodynamic Forces Overlay Enabled\u0022 F12 is my screenshot key)\n\n![0AD6BD207C67673A1D19CD10F3E5AAD3AD90C023](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/39748012115424298/0AD6BD207C67673A1D19CD10F3E5AAD3AD90C023/)![C67D52FF6D05EC8BB6891AE2CB36FF58B4005D04](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/39748012115110126/C67D52FF6D05EC8BB6891AE2CB36FF58B4005D04/)\n\nHere is a picture of me pressing the brakes and going from 10 m/s to 25 and above:\n\n![0B43D11371D508DA3908D6C0FB9BA2B6769A91F4](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/39748012115473449/0B43D11371D508DA3908D6C0FB9BA2B6769A91F4/)\n\nAs for the place:\n\n![F714755A106C1081D77FE7821D25EF91780FA766](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/39748012115497662/F714755A106C1081D77FE7821D25EF91780FA766/)\n\nEdit: looks like it works pretty much everywhere it started happening after 1.0.2 because it wasn\u0027t happening before(excluding runway and flat land because it happens while going up a slope i think needs further investigation).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T08:58:39Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 08:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by krum555**"}]}
