After entering them, I see all available parts unsorted on the left. Category buttons are gone, however I can get them back by cycling \u0022advanced mode\u0022. Selecting a part instantly places it on the building floor, clicking another part puts them in the same position (so they overlap). No part on the screen can be moved with LMB, however RMB functions work. I can load a craft, but still can\u0027t edit parts.\n\nThis is how it looks like: [http://imgur.com/a/G80sC#0](http://imgur.com/a/G80sC#0)\n\noutput\\_log Gives a big error when I enter VAB:\n\n    NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object  at RDTechTree.LoadTechTree (System.String filePath, System.Collections.Generic.List\u00601 rdNodes) [0x00000] in :0   at RDTechTree.ReLoad () [0x00000] in :0   at RDTechTree.PreLoad () [0x00000] in :0   at RDTechTree.FindTech (System.String requiredTechId) [0x00000] in :0   at PartListCategories.TechTier.ExclusionCriteria (.AvailablePart aP) [0x00000] in :0   at PartCategorizer\u002B.

But if I open a \u0022clean\u0022 save first, it kills the bug. It works like this:\n\n1. Start game, load clean game: no bug.\n\n2. Start game, load clean game, main menu, load \u0022my\u0022 game: no bug.\n\n3. Start game, load \u0022my\u0022 game: BUG.\n\n4. Start game, load \u0022my\u0022 game, main menu, load \u0022clean\u0022 game: BUG.\n\nOf course I\u0027ve tried to save \u0022cured\u0022 game, but it does not stay this way when reloaded.\n\nOf course here\u0027s the \u0022bugged\u0022 savegame attached. Full output\\_log is added to the archive:\n\n[http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=01911753588895593723](http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=01911753588895593723)\n\nI hope you will be able to reproduce it using my save.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-16T09:39:33Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2015 09:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wojtus**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wojtus","CreatedById":145802,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T09:39:13Z","Content":"This situation also caused and empty science tree.
