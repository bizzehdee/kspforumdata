If I remember correctly, the game crashed while I was\u00A0retroburning at around 20km AMSL. I have 100% ground scatter enabled, in case that matters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI checked the log file, but the last entry was from a minute or two before the crash, and\u00A0all the entries starting\u00A0~10 minutes before the crash seemed nominal. Since there was nothing out of the ordinary in it, I didn\u0027t bother to make a backup of the log file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also noticed that the was no crash folder generated by Unity\u00A0(the directory that contains\u00A0crash.dmp, error.log, and output_log.txt, with the name being the timestamp of the crash (formatted as yyyy-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E-dd_HHmmss)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crash was of the \u0027sudden exit\u0027 variety, rather than the \u0027hang/freeze/not responding\u0027 variety. I just tested closing KSP by hitting Alt-F4 (window froze for 7 seconds before closing)\u00A0and by killing the process via Task Manager (window instantly closed, same as what happened during the crash). There was no error message/window/notification of any sort after the crash.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI restarted the game, loaded my quicksave, and successfully landed the ship without any further technical issues.
