I have KSP through steam and have the latest updates and everything and not modded game at all. The sound folder in the local KSP file on my computer is empty. I dont know if thats normal? Ive uninstalled and re-installed twice with no effect on the sound whats so ever. Also, the sound didnt work in the last build before the 1.00 update.
