I double-click KSP.exe, and then Windows freezes. i can move my mouse, but cannot click on anything/close windows or anything. The only thing I can do is ctrl-alt-del and end the KSP task. If I try double-clicking the launcher, I get a blank window that pops up for a moment, then freezes exactly as before. I have tried running both as administrator with no luck. Originally, this one was on a manual install. I deleted everything, and downloaded the installer version and ran that. Same results.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maceemiller","CreatedById":130574,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-11T19:43:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIm presuming your using 32 bit KSP?
