What i discovered is that if you have a ship in orbit around kerbin it is very easy to exploit the \u0022get science from space around kerbin\u0022 mission. Completing that with a quick \u0022crew report\u0022 and \u0022transmit\u0022, then you exit to space center and check the missions. By clicking decline a few times you are going to get the option of doing the \u0022get science from space around kerbin\u0022 mission again. Do the \u0022crew report/transmit\u0022 thing, then go back to the mission center. This exploit probably works for any easy to do mission, just have ships in place and you could spam transmit science from anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou get the idea. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Suggestion) While KSP is more of a sandbox than a real game, this simple exploit is a bit obvious. Missions should definitely not be offered again if you have recently completed that same mission. I get that having a way to \u0022grind\u0022 cash is important if you want let players who refuse to revert crashed ships (or play on hard) a chance to build up their cash again, but it probably shouldn\u0027t be this easy. Just a thought.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
