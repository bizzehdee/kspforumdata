Unclear if this is an intended feature or an unintended consequence of making docking ports rotatable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerb Your Enthusiasm","CreatedById":206635,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-15T14:18:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is\u00A0 a known consequence of the new rotating docks,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a hot fix coming for this in the next update, and you should be able to autostrut through them after it.\u00A0 Until then, you could either try reverting to 1.11, or manually put struts on the outside.
