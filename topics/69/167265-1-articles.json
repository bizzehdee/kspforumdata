No-one seems to have these problems except for me. Whenever I make a rocket and move it over to the launch pad, The staging doesn\u0027t want to set off the rockets. The parachutes will deploy, The rocket will decouple, and still the rocket will not fire. The rocket will fire when I select it and tell it to fire but using two solid rocket boosters makes this impossible. I have checked and yes there is a green light at the bottom left corner. Has there been anyone with these same issues? Does anyone know how to fix it? Thanks in advance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-06T12:28:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223212287\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022167265\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221509970393\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022182644\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bret_Dean\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 minutes ago, Bret_Dean said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0The parachutes will deploy, The rocket will decouple, and still the rocket will not fire.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt sounds like you build your rocket from bottom to top while the game and the staging mechanism expect you to build it from top to bottom.
