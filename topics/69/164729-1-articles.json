KSP was the first thing I installed. KSP freezes on launch 100% of the time while loading the files. I never get to a menu. There is nothing else on this machine except SteamOS. I did install another game after and it works fine. Is there a known problem with SteamOS and KSP right now? Is there something I could put in the launcher options to make this work? I don\u0027t even have access to any kind of desktop or terminal with SteamOS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-03T08:50:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSteamOS is a debian linux distribution.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou need to supply log files of KSP trying to start up before anyone can begin to help you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsEmbed_finishedLoading\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed5960897748\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83213-stock-support-bug-reporting-guide/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022overflow: hidden; height: 211px; max-width: 502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
