I have played KSP on Windows.... And well.... I have a voracious appetite for mods, and 32bit just wasn\u0027t cutting it anymore. After hearing rumors that Linux supports 64bit.... And as many mods as 16 GB of RAM can handle..... Well, I am here now. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI honestly kinda picked a distro kind of at random. I am a complete newb and I know next to nothing about Linux other than it is based on Unix... (which I got some training courtesy of Uncle Sam a little over a decade ago). I digress a little though. I picked up a copy of Debian 8 with the Cinnamon desktop (I am guessing that\u0027s a reference to the desktop enviroment?) through OSdisc.com.... I also have a copy of Mint-Debian on a thumb drive though I think I need to burn a DVD of that before I can install it... If I wanted to. I think I know just enough to get myself in trouble. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nI guess that my question is, what do I need to know about using Linux with KSP and vis versa. Perhaps this could become a thread of what to consider when migrating from Windows over to Linux, what to consider etc for someone who knows nothing about it.... \n\nFirst thing I\u0027ll contribute, through trial and error is, that Debian 8, GNOME and ATI don\u0027t mix well for performance. I didn\u0027t really try playing the game per se, but just the initial menu screen was really choppy. In trying to get updated drivers for my video card, I learned that ATI recommends using the drivers that came with the OS. I\u0027ve been using my HD TV as a screen, but the \u0022Free Radeon\u0022 drivers limited me to 1260 by 440 pixels (I could be remembering the last number wrong.....) Fortunately for me, I had an nVidia 560 Ti as a backup. Other than the base drivers have told me that my 40\u0022 TV is really a 72\u0022 TV, it seems to work better. (I\u0027ve downloaded the updated drivers but I haven\u0027t installed them yet.\n\nI\u0027ve kinda lept in with both feet, but if I had this to do again, I might run a dual boot system and preserve my MS Office documents and iTunes. I kinda thought that I could use Windows programs with Linux.... and I guess you can with an emulator named Wine. That said, there are music players in Linux that will play the non DRM files in my library so the iTunes thing might be a brief headache while I get that sorted out.\n\nAnyway, what other concerns and considerations are out there when switching to Linux? Which distro is the most newbie friendly one? This doesn\u0027t apply to me, but if the person\u0027s machine has 4 GB of RAM is it worth it to switch to Linux, and if so what are the arguments for (or against)?\n\nA final note, I started this thread to help information to be passed to users who are considering switching from Windows or OSX to Linux as to the benefits and/or pitfalls of the switch. I would appreciate it if the arguements are made with this in mind. I would appreciate it if when people contribute to this thread, they refrain from bashing other OS\u0027s.\n\nThank you all for your comments and suggestions.\n\nMy copy of Linux is, according to the disc,: Debian Live 8.0 Cinnamon"},{"CreatedByName":"Sandworm","CreatedById":66244,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T00:06:18Z","Content":"Do not pick a distro based on rumors of guesses.

Stick to a well supported, active distro and stick to a common configuration. Since you are going to Linux for a single program (KSP), look at what\u0027s recommended for it. It\u0027s a transition to jump OS (anyone who tells you it\u0027s just like Windows is lying through their teeth), so don\u0027t make it harder on yourself by picking one with less help resources or by running a noval configuration. Another thing to look for as a Linux newbie is a distro with package management but any recommended distro will likely have that.\n\nBoth Ubuntu and Mint should be serviceable choices. If you have a few choices to select between, try a live disk of each for an hour an test driver functionality and feel. Though feel can be altered to taste, it is easier to start nearer to what you want. Don\u0027t play KSP at that time, but explore the window manager and device compatibility.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-10T00:36:02Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2015 12:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ajburges**"},{"CreatedByName":"Fizwalker","CreatedById":78337,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T01:18:06Z","Content":"In my case, I am already frustrated by windows in particular and microsoft in general.

The next thing you need to do is add proprietary drivers for your video card. The open Source drivers that are installed automatically are no good for 3D Gaming. You can find them by going to the Menu, Applications and then look for the Additional Drivers app. You can get proprietary drivers for both AMD and nVidia though as you have discovered the nVidia ones are better supported. If you have installed Ubuntu then you need to also do a couple of things (I believe Mint may already have them), you need to install Codecs for Media and stuff like truetype fonts and Java. Follow the instructions on a page like [this](http://www.tecmint.com/things-to-do-after-installing-ubuntu-15-04-desktop/) to help you get the additional stuff you need for a full desktop experience.

So, if your GPU is fast enough, for AMD the open source drivers are way better regarding stability and desktop integration. With one exception:\n\nThe open source AMD drivers are currently **broken** on **Debian 8**, at least with **Southern Islands** cards. Here\u0027s the [bug report](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=774784\u0026archived=False\u0026mbox=no). So, on Debian 8, if you\u0027re using an AMD Southern Island card, you\u0027ll have to use the proprietary drivers, or install a fixed mesa package manually, but that\u0027s a thing I wouldn\u0027t recommend a new user to do. \n\nSo, to install the proprietary AMD drivers on Debian 8 (they [don\u0027t work with Gnome 3](https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/release-notes/ch-information.en.html#gnome-fglrx) btw), check the [Debian Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/ATIProprietary).\n\nEdit: Emacs\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-10T11:48:02Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2015 11:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by soulsource**"},{"CreatedByName":"Green Baron","CreatedById":107381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T12:38:13Z","Content":"Debian is a \u0022sporty\u0022 Distro because it\u0027s totally open source and free of any copyright (see: copyleft, GNU GPL).

If you can switch the nvidia card do so, nvidia has very good linux support, but for KSP even Intel HD graphics will do.\n\nI must make something clear, without any offence: Linux is NOT based on Unix, it was completely written from scratch, in the beginning by Linus Torvalds, today by many of the worlds best programmers. And then, unless windows that takes total control of your computer and does \u0022everything\u0022 for you, in Linux you should really learn the basics of your operating system. There are many good books about Ubuntu or derivatives (or Debian, but be prepared to do do more things \u0022manually\u0022), get one, have fun experiencing that \\*you\\* can control your computer.\n\nLinux itself is not a graphical system, there is a pile of window managers and graphical environments that you can freely choose from (see Xorg), but you should know how to use the console interface, type commands, watch performance, start and stop programms, look at files etc. \\*without\u0022 graphical help. Believe me, you will have more fun with your computer as something that yesterday appeared as a crash to you tomorrow is just a restart of the window manager (for example). It starts with installing a graphics driver (from the console) and does not end with nrowsing through logs to find an offending process ...\n\nIn the beginning, don\u0027t use wine, wait until you know more about your system or frustration may be the result. Use dual boot instead.\n\nDo use dual boot, it\u0027s sophisticated and no problems are to be expected. Again, i\u0027d recommend Mint or Ubuntu, download a USB-Image for install and install it. Linux is the best documented operating system that exists. After install switch to a console (Ctrl-Alt-F1), log in and read the man-pages for the follwing commands (enter man \u003Ccommand\u003E):\u003C/command\u003E\n\nList files: ls, Change directoy: cd, Copy file: cp, Move/rename file: mv, Delete file: rm, display file: less.\n\nAs Steve\\_v pointed out you should learn the package management. Install a frontend buy typing in:\n\nsudo apt-get install aptitude\n\nThat make your life easier in the beginnig when you look for drivers from the repository (nvidia !).\n\nman apitude\n\nwill help you. When you can handle that, man apt-get and its \u0022see alsos\u0022 :-)\n\nLearn an editor (console text based ! Those long haired bearded gurus use vi or emacs), i\u0027ll suggest nano which is easier to use. If it\u0027s not there install it\n\nsudo aptitude install nano\n\nDo not care about cinnamon, xfce, lxde, gnome, kde or one of the numerous other environments. They are just for clicking with the mouse.\n\nSo, that\u0027s my recommendation for starting with debian. Install the nvidia card, that\u0027ll make your life easier. I think that debian has an nvidia driver in it\u0027s repositories (Mint and Ubuntu do have) bust you must add the non-free channels to your sources.list :-)\n\n Edit: like soulsource said, the open source nouveau driver (for nvidia cards) is second best choice (understatement :-)), use the proprietary driver, if available from repositories.\n\nHave fun in a new wolrd !\n\nk\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-10T12:41:43Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2015 12:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by kemde**"},{"CreatedByName":"WeirdCulture","CreatedById":76591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T12:43:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So guys vim or emacs.\n\n[ed, man! man ed!](http://www.gnu.org/fun/jokes/ed-msg.html)"},{"CreatedByName":"soulsource","CreatedById":110576,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T14:06:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Debian is a \u0022sporty\u0022 Distro because it\u0027s totally open source and free of any copyright (see: copyleft, GNU GPL).

That\u0027s especially important for users of AMD graphics cards and broadcom network cards, as the open source radeon and broadcom drivers requires non-free firmware. So, to get the open source radeon driver to work with 3D accelleration, one needs first to enable the contrib and non-free repositories in [sources.list](https://wiki.debian.org/SourcesList), update the list of packages (there\u0027s a refresh button in synaptic, or on the command line run \u0022apt-get update\u0022 as root), and install the firmware-linux-nonfree package (\u0022apt-get install firmware-linux-nonfree\u0022, again as root).\n\n(As said, if you have a Southern Islands card, forget the open source radeon driver on Debian 8 until [this bug](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=774784\u0026archived=False\u0026mbox=no) gets fixed, as it will crash regularly.)\n\nEnabling the contrib and non-free repos will give you extremely easy ways to install the proprietary drivers as well. For AMD you\u0027ll then have packages named fglrx-driver and fglrx-control available, and for nvidia there\u0027s nvidia-driver (or some nvidia-legacy-\\*\\*\\* packages for older drivers for older cards).\n\nFor AMD cards it might be necessary to run \u0022aticonfig --initial\u0022 as root after installing the proprietary drivers.\n\nA word of warning: On all distributions that have their own package managers, it\u0027s in nearly all cases the best to install software from the repositories, even if it\u0027s older than software found on the vender website. The reason is, that if you install software from the repositories, there\u0027s usually a way to cleanly uninstall it again, as it uses the native package format of the distribution. If you download an installer from somewhere on the web (ok, let\u0027s be clear here: I\u0027m talking about the AMD or nVidia graphics driver installers) there might be (for the graphics drivers: there is) no clean way to uninstall the software again. This might (for the graphics drivers: will definitely) cause issues when upgrading the distribution to a newer release.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-10T14:12:18Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2015 02:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by soulsource**"}]}
