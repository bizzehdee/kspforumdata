I am just Unable to play game. it is crashing to desktop after load in menu. I am having the same problem but it is sooner then that it is crashing to desktop in the menu system I can not get any where the game is un playable at this state on 1.0. The crash was not happening a few days ago in what was it 0.93 there was not crashing but know the game on steam and the down load from your site store both are doing the same problem crashing to desktop in the load area or in the menu area when I click on some thing. \n\nUnder stand this is on a great power house of a system and it is a fresh install of windows 7 pro 64x. you should see it run GTA V, it is tuned well. But this type of crash befouls me, and will not make a crash report. it also has all up-to-date drivers and also for the thing plugged in to the USB. the new problem is that I reinstalled the old version and know it has the same problem so something steam or KPS installed is conflicting with something. All I know is I would love a Dev\u0027s help on this one\n\nAlso to add tried compatible mode try admin also restarted a lot after reinstall look through the registry found no doubles and not repeats and problems with pointers.\n\nfinely got a error report from the game but do not know how to attach it here.\n\nThanks for your time hope you can help\n\nMotherboard: ASUS MAXIMUS VII HERO \n\nCPU: Intel i7 4790X \n\nCooler: Corsair H100i Liquid Cooler \n\nRam: 4 Corsair dommanter 16GB DDR3 1866 \n\nGPU 1: EVGA Nvidia GTX Titan 6GB \n\nHDD: 1TB WD Black Edition \n\nSSD: Samsung 510GB SSD (OS drive) \n\nSSD: Samsung 248GB SSD \n\nOS: Windows 7 pro x64 \n\nPower!: Corsair Gold 800w\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T08:14:27Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 08:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by alanthegreat**\n  \ngot new info."}]}
