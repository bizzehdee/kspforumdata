All engines are at 100% thrust. Thrust indicator is pointing horizontally (the same direction as the last engine.)\n\n**Result:** \n\n The direction of the thrust indicator (purple arrow) only changes if the engine placed last is tilted.\n\nThe thrust indicator in the picture above points horizontally. This does not represent the correct direction of the thrust vector.\n\nThe result if you launch the rocket above is seen here:\n\n[http://imgur.com/V5TtMYz](http://imgur.com/V5TtMYz)\n\n**Fixes/Workarounds:** \n\nNone\n\n**Other Notes/Pictures/Log Files:** \n\nExample rocket: [http://imgur.com/t51eufw](http://imgur.com/t51eufw)\n\nRocket on launch pad: [http://imgur.com/V5TtMYz](http://imgur.com/V5TtMYz)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T02:13:52Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 02:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw**\n  \nfixed typos"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T01:26:03Z","Content":"I can confirm this.\n\n[![vKK5ouYh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/vKK5ouYh.jpg)](http://imgur.com/vKK5ouY)\n\nThere are 8 TurboJets and one Skipper pointing aft (that\u0027s a lot o\u0027 thrust). Pointing in other directions (inside the cargo bay) is 1 48-7S (spark) pointing directly forwards and 4 LV-1 (ant) engines pointing sideways, (minuscule amount of thrust compared to the main engines) yet the thrust indicator is pointing forwards (and slightly to one side). I\u0027d not appreciated that it was due to the last engine placed, but that makes sense with this as the cargo was the last thing to be added to the craft."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T02:14:06Z","Content":"It is indeed a bug, unfortunately."},{"CreatedByName":"misterbk","CreatedById":144226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T22:21:58Z","Content":"Getting this same bug with O-10 \u0022Puff\u0022 monopropellant thrusters, when they *are* placed in Symmetry mode.\n\n**Placing two Puff engines on a lander with no other engines, with 2x radial symmetry mode, dropped on the left side:**\n\n![3DNgBS6.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/3DNgBS6.jpg)\n\n**Placing the two thrusters the exact same way, but dropping on the right side:**\n\n![uuJ1mJJ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/uuJ1mJJ.jpg)\n\n**Placing one thruster only, no symmerty mode, on the left side, to show the error in direction is the same:**\n\n![ftLzkb9.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ftLzkb9.jpg)\n\nI was shuffling parts around on the rover, trying to fix an unwanted pitch on my lander when thrusting. I rotated the Puff engines to point downward, and that made the arrow at least point mostly in the right direction. Might get more dV from them that way anyway.
