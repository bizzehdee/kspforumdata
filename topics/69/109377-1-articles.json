In some cases this can be destructive \u0026 cause the craft to lose control during ascent. Screenshots \u0026 craft file still uploading, but I do have a craft which will produce a destructive wobble in atmo.\n\n**To Reporoduce:**\n\nThis phenomenon can be observed on the Kerbal X, however while in the atmosphere, the wobble is self-correcting rather than destructive (presumably due to the large number of fins).\n\n1. Launch a Kerbal X\n2. Throttle to full, engage SAS, and stage twice (standard lift off)\n3. Yaw East between 3 and 5 degrees\n4. Release controls, and observe the SAS wobbling\n\nWhat appears to be happening is that when a craft relies on gimbal more than it does fins, the SAS wobble becomes self destructive. The below craft relies on the mainsails for control and has winglets only for stability in the lower atmosphere.\n\n![4en2kY3.png](http://i.imgur.com/4en2kY3.png)\n\nKER and many other mods are on this particular install. This bug has been observed and verified in a stock 1.0.2 version of KSP.\n\nWith the above craft, the wobble is highly destructive while attempting to cross the trans-sonic boundary, often resulting in a complete loss of control \u0026 mission abort.\n\n[**.craft file download**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_BVD9gAcd6BV0ctUEVZY2tHSDQ/view?usp=sharing)"}]}
