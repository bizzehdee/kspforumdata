If I have any reaction wheels besides the one built into the command pod activated, the ship will flip out. I have no idea how to fix it, but it\u0027s game-breaking."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T08:01:58Z","Content":"The craft shouldn\u0027t flip out from the reaction wheel torque, it\u0027s likely the mass of the wheel is causing it to act like an arrow flying backwards, it\u0027ll want to flip.\n\nSAS is bugged and it can be off center sometimes but it\u0027s not constant, we will need to see your craft to determine more.\n\nPlease see the support stickies and upload your craft files."}]}
