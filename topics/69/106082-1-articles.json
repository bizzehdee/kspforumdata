Landed and performed an EVA. A couple of seconds after the Kerbal touched the ground, the game blanks out. The general format of the display is still present, but it shows no information about my plane, Kerbal, or navball. The view goes completely black. A previous quick save being loaded up did not resolve. Returning to the tracking station doesn\u0027t show the space center at all. I exited the game and reloaded and found my ship gone and Kerbal MIA. Otherwise the game seems to be working as normal."},{"CreatedByName":"xxserilviaxx","CreatedById":79675,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T20:00:44Z","Content":"Were it perhaps a female kerbal you sent up there?"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T20:36:42Z","Content":"This happened to me at KSC, but with Bob. I think there are some issues. When I first had him killed upon EVA, it said he\u0027d collided with girders (I made a testing rig for a ground test that he could get out and EVA a little)."},{"CreatedByName":"xxserilviaxx","CreatedById":79675,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T20:46:21Z","Content":"Did alot of testing already but maybe I should try with male kerbals aswell. The females just seem to have a very crazy physics setting where the male kerbals are perfectly stable (Visually atleast)\n\nThe females just need to fall a certain way and they evaporate \u003E.\u003C made a in-depth report on it maybe there is some answers in there or something I overlooked perhaps."},{"CreatedByName":"Sarstan","CreatedById":70855,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T01:40:18Z","Content":"This happened with Jeb for me. Not sure what else I can highlight other than it was a nearly hour long flight where I spent more of it at 4x speed.\n\nEdit: I came back to playing a few minutes ago and found out that the rescue missions I had are still present, but the kerbals are completely missing from tracking. So I guess it wiped out all my \u0022ships\u0022 that were present as well.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T02:54:00Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 02:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sarstan**"}]}
