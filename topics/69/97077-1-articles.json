If you open the debug log (Alt\u002BF2) from the VAB, the errors it shows might point you in the right direction, but if not you should be able to spot the broken file by its file size -- broken craft files typically have a significantly smaller file size than normal. You can check it by opening the file in Notepad, or another text editor; the file will end abruptly, or be missing sections. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WDude4k","CreatedById":117232,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-19T02:03:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, yep.
