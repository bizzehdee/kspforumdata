Both went out and docked with an asteroid in Munar orbit (command vehicle, and a science lab). Built a third one that was going to be a Munar-lander with the ability to also grab the asteroid. Using the same first and second stage to launch it as the first two vehicles. The vehicle comes apart on me when I get into orbit and then use time warp to advance to my first burns to get ready to go out to Mun. I am in an orbit about 85,000 m up. Most of the components, the second stage and all the parts attached to the lander capsule just fall straight down to Kerbin when I hit the time warp key. Did it three times with two different lander designs. Any idea what might cause this. Will a simple reboot fix it?
