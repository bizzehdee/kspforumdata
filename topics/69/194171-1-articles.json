It even gave me a link to click on to do so. Problem is, when I click on it, I get a screen that says \u0022The page you requested does not exist.\u0022 This is weird to me on two accounts. First, because it\u0027s a link that was generated by the game itself, not a forum or tech support person or something. And more importantly, Steam is designed specifically to keep my games up to date at all times, as it reminds me every single time I open it. Any ideas? I am playing this on a newer computer right now than when I previously played it. On that older one I had mods, but this one I do not, and I also uninstalled my making history expansion so it should just be vanilla right now. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling. I tried verifying the cache.
