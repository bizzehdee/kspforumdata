Sometimes crew transfer just ... stops working. It seems to happen often when you have big stations and low framerate. Even spamming the lmb doesn\u0027t get recognized.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway - what I do to fix it is reloading the ship. Then transferring works (for a while at least). It is extremely annoying but at least it\u0027s possible to get around.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
