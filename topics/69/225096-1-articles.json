Inside the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E I can look around and leave but as soon as I place any part at all I can not look around or leave the building. I can scroll through the different tabs of parts and even select them but they will not attach to the part I first placed. I am also not able to move the first part at all but I can interact with any modifications like draining fuel or changing the looks of the part. I have deleted and reinstalled ksp several times and switched through game versions then back and the problem persists. This is my first time ever posting so I\u0027m unsure if I am properly using the\u00A0 Forums correctly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
