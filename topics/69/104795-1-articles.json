However when I actually dock with it, it falls through the floor, and then if I go to the space center and go back to it, it reappears out of the floor, projected upwards and destroying the probe cores, then seems fine but without the cores I can\u0027t control it. Any ideas how to redo the design ready for 1.0?\n\n[http://imgur.com/a/ipfXd](http://imgur.com/a/ipfXd)\n\nP.s. I don\u0027t know how to link to imgur so it shows up on here, any help?\n\nThanks for any help!"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T22:56:07Z","Content":"This is a bug with docking using the Advanced Grabbing Unit/Claw. ATM, if the active vessel runs into a deployed claw, the world is destroyed. You can work around this by having the docking vessel carry the claw or using docking ports. For your platform, you might also try hitting G to lower the landing gear and immediately switching to the other vessel with [ or ].\n\nAlso, the Imgur tag is [noparse]\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Switching as I lower landing gear works perfect for now, and hopefully the rolling onto it will work perfect in 1.0. I did consider using docking ports but I thought with the new Aero coming out it wouldn\u0027t be great having a port on the bottom of each plane. \n\nAnd thank you for the Imgur information."}]}
