When I try to change my camera angle, it\u0027s really slow. No lag or anything like that, just a slow moving process for the camera. To do a 360 around my spacecraft I have to drag like 5 times.\u00A0I\u0027ve experienced this earlier, but then it helped with a restart of the game, now\u00A0it\u0027s not enough.

One thing to check would be the mouse polling rate, it can cause issues if it is too high.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso if you\u0027re using a development version of Sierra it may help to switch to the stable release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gianni1122","CreatedById":170752,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-04T16:20:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m on MacBook Pro with macOS Sierra but I\u0027m running KSP\u00A01.2.1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use the arrow keys to rotate camera. Did you try eliminating\u00A0the possibility that it is a mouse problem by using your directional arrow keys?
