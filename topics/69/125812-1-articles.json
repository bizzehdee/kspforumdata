This is on the way up, usually less than twenty seconds from launch at full thrust. I can slowly accelerate to stay under the 250 or so threshold, but then it takes about 10 minutes and ....loads of fuel to escape the atmosphere. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;ve tried sticking aerodynamic stuff to block it as well as heat sinks on the side and protecting them, but to no avail. It feels like this is just a hyper strict rule that needs changing on the parachutes - because what\u0026#39;s the point if you can\u0026#39;t accelerate to enough of an escape speed? \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAny advice would be appreciated.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T11:34:10Z","Content":"\nHi.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nDo you mean actually burning up, or just the parachute icon turning red? The chutes should become \u0022safe\u0022 again once you drop below 250m/s, and the parachute icons will change back to normal. Drogue chutes have a higher top speed before they become risky/unsafe.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TronX33","CreatedById":109784,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-01T02:31:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222284970\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022125812\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221447843969\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022153753\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022VaughanHiggins\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 11/18/2015, 2:52:49, VaughanHiggins said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nevery time I get to 250m/s on launch they burn up and turn \u0022unsafe\u0022 for deployment.
