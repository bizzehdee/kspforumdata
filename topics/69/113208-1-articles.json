(yeah I know right)\n\n(I kept getting unexpected roll behaviors.)(Strong trendency to roll one way...)\n\nand just now i was flying plane with the aero forces on and i saw this. (tiny blue force vector up but only ever on right tank)\n\n(and hey that the way I felt my previous designed plane always wanted to roll. Hmmm)\n\n(also note it really is a visibly bigger effect than that it is just quite transient as you stall the plane and try and grab the image.\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/v6ZuQM8.png](http://i.imgur.com/v6ZuQM8.png)\n\n![v6ZuQM8.png](http://i.imgur.com/v6ZuQM8.png)\n\nNow that is a very hard pitch up, and there is small blue force vector BUT only ever in the right hand fuselage.\n\nPitch down and i can see them in the left as down force.\n\nI built the pane symmetrically with mirror.\n\nThe craft file has the the tanks attached as mirror.\n\nand yeah I \u003Ecould\u003C perhaps have been flying crooked and not pitched up or down evenly. But nope. \n\nI tried real hard to get the forces vectors from the left tank and no dice.\n\nAdmission. I do have (some NON aero mods in the career game.. but no its not them. (Thats karbonite jet engine and KOS computer in the middle)\n\n(and a kerbal engineer chips attached somewhere. Alarm clock, blah blah.) \n\nI will see what i can do about replicating it in a pure stock sandbox sometime.\n\nNot sure whether or how you want the craft file attached. \n\ncraft file available on request and instruction.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-17T14:06:23Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2015 02:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Onchyophora**\n  \nfixing stuff."},{"CreatedByName":"Val","CreatedById":126227,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T18:08:10Z","Content":"Not sure if this counts as a necro, but I just had that happen, as did \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9**jlcarneiro**.\n\n![MK63Q7c.png](http://i.imgur.com/MK63Q7c.png)\n\n[Craft](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B34u1G2080ndVVlVRlFGUW1FWXc/view) (stock)"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T18:20:43Z","Content":"Please don\u0027t use the aero overlay for any testing of aero forces, it\u0027s known to be inaccurate, enable \u0022Display aero data in action menu\u0027s\u0022 via the debug screen instead.\n\nThe line you see is body lift, and KSP is known to misreport lift and thrust on mirrored parts when using the CoT, CoM, CoL and aero forces displays, as it only uses the original part and not its symmetry clones for some things, this is easily seen in the editor when placing Rockomax 24-77 Twitch engines in symmetry, the CoT indicator will point to the side.\n\nAnd please reproduce this in stock, addons affect KSP even if they aren\u0027t in use.\n\nAs for Onchyophora, too much canard and not enough rudder.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-26T18:25:02Z\u0022 title=\u002209/26/2015 06:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sal\\_vager**"}]}
