I don\u0027t know if or how many files steam keeps in the cache but you can clear in manually in the steam settings -\u0026gt; downloads. So if you scraped the 5.3GB already, there should be still some space left after installing the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
