Not sure this is also the case in the game when flying.\n\nTo reproduce start building a VTOL:\n\n1. Start new plane in SPH.\n\n2. Use Mk2 Liquid Fuel Fuselage as root part.\n\n3. Add BZ-52 Radial Attachment Point in the center below the tank so that a VTOL engine can be attached to it.\n\n4. Switch on CoG display, CoG is still in center of tank.\n\n5. Attach Basic Jet Engine to BZ-52 Radial Attachment Point below tank -\u003E CoG moves UPWARD although heavy weight is added BELOW the tank. CoG should move DOWN!\n\nThe sad part is, that the same calculation seems to be used when flying the craft.\n\nGuys get your very very basic physics straight! I consider this a game breaking bug because it makes serious space plane construction practically impossible at least for VTOLs or planes that have significant weight above or below the center of the plane.\n\nEdit: It seems that CoG is always moved in the wrong direction when weight is added above or below the center. Removing fuel from tanks even moves the CoG further up.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-26T23:52:52Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2015 11:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DocMoriarty**"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T05:33:50Z","Content":"Not a bug, the Mass of the jet engines has been intentionally offset."},{"CreatedByName":"clivman","CreatedById":139191,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T06:12:46Z","Content":"It is to represent the weight of the other parts of the engine, the unrealistic engines we have in game were causing COG issues which made it hard to build normal (non-canard) aircraft."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T07:39:26Z","Content":"Yes, VTOL jets have taken a bit of a beating in the last couple updates.

Total crap."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T08:49:49Z","Content":"Well, the reasons are more than just canard aircraft. But primarily it was a way to move the CoG forward on standard aircraft configurations. Several changes were made to make CoM management easier (such as air breathing engines sucking fuel from every single tank). These changes make CoM management a *little* easier for basic planes, but make it much more difficult for anything even slightly complex.\n\nPersonally I\u0027m not on board with all of the changes. The CoM for the jet engines needed to be moved forward some, but it\u0027s way too far now. Also, I\u0027m not a fan of jets sucking fuel from every tank.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"}]}
