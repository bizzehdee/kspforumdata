In the parts list I still see the old mk1 cockpit in the parts selection list (alongside the new one)\u00A0to put on my planes, but I ignore it and attach the new mk. 1 cockpit to my plane instead. But when I load up the craft on the runway it loads up the old mk.1 cockpit. When I hit the IVA button, I see the IVA of the new mk.1 cockpit, but the exterior is the same as the old one.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis same bug is persistent with the \u0022Wheesley\u0022 basic jet engine, and sometimes happens with the \u0022Whiplash\u0022 turbo jet engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have deleted and re-installed ksp 3 times now. This little problem was not present the 2nd time I re-downloaded ksp but the older parts were still in the part selection tabs. I have tried deleting the part files but it seems to not go away.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny suggestions?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bilfr3d","CreatedById":75448,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-02T09:16:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuplicate of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/131214-old-parts-sticking-around/\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/131214-old-parts-sticking-around/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo answer your question:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are on Steam, uninstall the game completely and re-install it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you downloaded the game through the store, delete all local files and re-download and extract the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe issue comes from old part models still being present in your GameData folder, and (I\u0027m assuming because of partID and entityID reasons) the older model is chosen to be displayed. You COULD remove the files yourself, saving a re-installation/download, but I\u0027d recommend re-downloading it anyway just to make sure it goes properly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YargJay9991","CreatedById":143494,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-02T22:03:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, don\u0027t use the included patcher.
