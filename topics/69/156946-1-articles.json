The thing that might also be happening is your watching videos which the users have turned on a sort of cheat, or MechJeb autopilot. Otherwise, you should try building a similar ship than the one currently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-04T06:21:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hate to ask an obvious question but do you know about throttle? The default throttle is 50% (though you can change it and I suggest either 0% or 100%). The stock ships were made to work at 100% throttle for the most part. Try hitting \u0022Z\u0022 before launching and see what happens. Z is max throttle, X is 0 throttle, and shift/ctrl throttle up and down gradually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t ask me why they made ships that don\u0027t work with their default throttle.
