Thanks for trying to help ^-^. The fairing was to small. But I fixed it by moving the eva chair so that the bottom barley sticks out of the fairing with out expanding it. This allows the kerbal to be occluded along with the chair. Tho also another bug is that quick saveing and quick loading in occludes the kerbal. Idk if actually expanding the fairing this time will fix it or not but I\u0027m happy with this so far.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso if anyone else wants to attempt a mission like this using juno engines to get to orbit. Use oscar tanks instead of cubic struts to attach engines and air intakes. The cubic struts generate more drag even when it\u0027s nodes r occupied than the oscar tanks for some reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m still having a bit of trouble getting past the sound barrier but this helps a lot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso why did squad make the aerodynamic system so janky!?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
