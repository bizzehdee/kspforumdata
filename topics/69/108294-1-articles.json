This doesn\u0027t appear to be effected by any mods (and I\u0027m only using stock flags). Was the flag supposed to be displayed?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-09T14:27:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2015 02:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Synthesis**"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T23:17:54Z","Content":"This is what I see when I mouse over one of my flags, can you post what you see so we can figure this out?\n\n![hTBqy2V.png](http://i.imgur.com/hTBqy2V.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Synthesis","CreatedById":26557,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T14:26:44Z","Content":"So, I was slightly mistake in my diagnosis--but I\u0027m getting the same thing.\n\n![Tracking_zpsoarxsbxq.png](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v510/MarkSynthesis/Tracking_zpsoarxsbxq.png)\n\nAs it happens, DirectX vs. OpenGL doesn\u0027t seem to matter.
