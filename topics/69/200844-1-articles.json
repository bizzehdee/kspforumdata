So I added some (a huge bunch) of strusts to\u00A0a storage and I sent it to my station. I took an engineer lvl 3, went into building mode, and I added the strusts linking my different modules. However, if I leave the station focus, like going to tracking station, or doing F5/F9 they all disappear. Well, they don\u0027t really disappear as they\u0027re still there, but they\u0027re not linked anymore. I\u0027m adding a screenshot so you can see the strusts being there, but not linking anything. I was playing with some mods, so I unistalled/reinstalled the game, but I still have this issue. And I believe I\u0027ve created this save files after the release of the update \u0022Some Assembly Required\u0022.
