Upon landing I returned to the Space Centre to look up contracts. Everything was fine until I went to the tracking station to find that none of my ships were there. They were all gone! I tried to reload but it wouldn\u0027t do it. I went into the option menu to find my Alt. F5 saves to reload one of those but they were gone too. So I am basicslly stuck with a complete empty save file with no ships and no past saves or reload option. Does anyone know what I can do to try and restore my save?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-17T19:44:30Z\u0022 title=\u002208/17/2016 07:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by WillSpaceMan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-17T19:42:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour question has been moved to the Support section.
