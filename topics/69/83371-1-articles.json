I do get it when the updater requires them (which it does for writing to system introduced program paths), but there\u0027s no use in those privileges while gaming, apart from maybe writing the save files/logs to the program folder, which isn\u0027t what the program folder is for anyway. The whole purpose of the UAC is to secure the system, running everything as admin is Win9x style and puts the system at risk (at least with the possibility of modded installs). Additional thought: Responsible parents won\u0027t give their offspring admin users, but will want them to be able to play KSP. Of course one can always link to the binary itself, but then the launcher is useless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince it circumvents a major security system of Windows I\u0027d consider it a bug, and most certainly not a feature. I vote for a change, moving processing data (logs, saves) to the user folder where they belong for 14 years now and starting KSP as regular user like every other program (it works, I do it all the time, with the x64 version and not more or less crashes than the other way round).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexanderB","CreatedById":17544,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-31T01:24:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E....or just drop the KSP folder somewhere with user rights (like the desktop). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the fact that KSP is standalone, and doesn\u0027t paste its files all over the computer in all sorts of seperate folders (*cough* hidden ProgramData, or in hidden folders under the User folder) And as long as you *don\u0027t* put it in Program Files, it\u0027ll not need admin rights to run.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-31T01:35:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, Windows tends to restrict programs\u0027 access rights that\u0027re on the Desktop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeal location is, generally, the drive root (e.g., C:\\KSP_win).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"M3tal_Warrior","CreatedById":116603,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-31T07:39:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBoth of you don\u0027t get the point: I already have the program outside the system restricted folders (to be clear: E:\\Spiele\\KSP\\*), because I have a very small system drive.

That is the bug, not me needing some crude help how to install a program after administrating the OS for over a decade.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrivileged mode is to install drivers and programs and generally being able to change the system (despite not being as mighty as root). KSP doesn\u0027t need to change anything, it doesn\u0027t install stuff, isn\u0027t communicating with the hardware directly and does not write to HKEY_LM or other users keys. Simple stuff: Give it the rights it needs, as little as possible, as much as necessary.
