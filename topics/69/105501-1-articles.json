Steam updated stock version. New Career game after update. No Mods.\n\nTried to use Alt click to duplicate the Elevon 1, but after clicking the part did not appear and all other parts became un-clickable.\n\nI used [Ctrl]\u002BZ to undo placement and then duplicated part appeared placed where I originally wanted it, but does not have any hover-over action and does not respond to undo and redo commands as shown.\n\nError has spread to other parts. Any part that I try to edit now becomes unusable. Parts now stuck to mouse. Pressing Delete will not get rid of part. Cannot exit SPH with part stuck to mouse, had to force quit game.\n\nSeems a restart of the game has fixed the error. At the moment I cannot reproduce.\n\nVideo of Error - [https://youtu.be/Gdu1B-Ny57A](https://youtu.be/Gdu1B-Ny57A)\n\nLink to Saves and Output text folder (Google Drive) - [https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B4UD7pVDF2KLfmNmYi1pODJ0ajR5dUk0T0dsUG1lLXFVNGcxY25HbmRsWE85U2tEM1Qtc1U\u0026usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B4UD7pVDF2KLfmNmYi1pODJ0ajR5dUk0T0dsUG1lLXFVNGcxY25HbmRsWE85U2tEM1Qtc1U\u0026usp=sharing)\n\nPlease let me know if the permissions need to be changed.\n\nJust trying to help the community I have began to greatly enjoy!"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T04:22:02Z","Content":"This may be a craft-specific error.

Using of undo functionality can cause lots of problems especially when working on large ships with lots of parts. In previous versions it caused me several game crashes, part duplications, unclickable parts, huge memory leaks, and even compleete game crashes. in one case I was even stupid enough to save the bugged ship which caused the KSP to crash every time I tried to load it."},{"CreatedByName":"Judman13","CreatedById":141938,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T12:06:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This may be a craft-specific error.

I have tried to reproduce it, but have not been able to.\n\nI was hoping there would be something in the logs that would point to what happened. However, I am not savvy enough to track that down."}]}
