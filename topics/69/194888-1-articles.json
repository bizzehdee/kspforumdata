I use mods but have uninstalled everything and the bug persists, so thought I\u0027d post here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m basicly running through a career game and have a contract to land a tourist on Moho. I\u0027ve designed a tiny lander with just enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E to land and launch from low orbit. I basicly designed the craft and then used the alt \u002B f12 cheat menu to set my orbit around Moho to test it. Everything works great on the way down, but when I launch off the surface the lander is still marked as \u0022landed\u0022 in the map screen. I can launch and get to orbit fine, but still it\u0027s marked as landed. I can\u0027t time warp, change vessel, save, or go to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E because the game is treating the craft as moving over the surface. In the map view, the usual orbit lines are not present, even when the craft is at 1000Km altitude. I\u0027ve also done a quick test in the same way with the Mun, and the same thing happens. All my current craft are fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s just affecting new craft or if it\u0027s because I used the cheat menu to set the orbit. I\u0027d like to make sure it\u0027s because I\u0027ve used the cheat menu before sending a craft all that way to find it still bugs out and ruins my career game. I\u0027ve used the cheat menu in the past when designing craft and don\u0027t recall ever having this issue before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m using v1.8.1 while I wait for kopernicus to update. I\u0027ve tried restarting everything which doesn\u0027t help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny thoughts on what the problem might be?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-19T22:39:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know the details, but you can open you save .pfs and search for the name of your vessel.\u00A0 In there should be a state labeled \u0022Landed\u0022, you can switch that to whatever a flying vessel would have (\u0022flying\u0022?).\u00A0 As I said, I\u0027m unsure of the details, so I might be wrong, but take a look.\u00A0\u00A0 Someone else should be along shortly to confirm or refute my theory.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-20T00:52:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt sounds like a bug reported \u003Ca href=\u0022https://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/24913\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere (link)\u003C/a\u003E in which case a brief timewarp *before*\u00A0\u00A0you take off\u003Cbr\u003E\nseems to prevent KSP from getting confused into thinking you are \u0027landed\u0027\u00A0while moving.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Turbo Ben","CreatedById":193979,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-20T11:01:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223806111\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022194888\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221592606363\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002264714\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gargamel\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 hours ago, Gargamel said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know the details, but you can open you save .pfs and search for the name of your vessel.\u00A0 In there should be a state labeled \u0022Landed\u0022, you can switch that to whatever a flying vessel would have (\u0022flying\u0022?).\u00A0 As I said, I\u0027m unsure of the details, so I might be wrong, but take a look.\u00A0\u00A0 Someone else should be along shortly to confirm or refute my theory.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the reply.

The bug in that link seems to be caused by broken solar panels after a rough landing. My landings are good and the craft doesn\u0027t even have any solar panels. Time warping does not seem to help. However, there is another solution put forward, which is to switch between vessels while on the surface before launching. I tried switching to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and back to my craft and it launched without the bug appearing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for pointing me in the right direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
