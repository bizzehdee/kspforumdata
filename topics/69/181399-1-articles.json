Looked up the Gilly characteristics, and looks to me like the max altitude at which you can orbit Gilly is indeed 113km. Am I missing anything?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222qvbl6q.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022234\u0022 src=\u0022http://i68.tinypic.com/2qvbl6q.png\u0022 width=\u0022431\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-15T03:19:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah that\u0027s a pretty straightforward bug.
