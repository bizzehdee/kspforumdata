I don\u0027t even have the official mods installed; my GameData folder has only the Squad folder in it.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1) Start a new save, or load an existing save.\n\n2) (if you have no ships anywhere, ie your tracking station is empty) Put a vessel on the launch pad. A single Mk1 capsule will do.\n\n3) Leave it there and return to the Space Center.\n\n4) Hit the \u0022]\u0022 key.\n\nI would supply a log but the last stuff in it is the loading of the KSC scene.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-08T10:36:48Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2015 10:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by 5thHorseman**"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T09:28:00Z","Content":"Confirmed to occur on Linux also, please make a bug tracker entry for this one, I think it\u0027s one the devs would have to look at in the editor as there\u0027s no player.log output either."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T10:49:35Z","Content":"Done and done.
