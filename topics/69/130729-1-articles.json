KSP would continually crash in the following situations:\u003Cbr\u003E\n- If OBS was started recording before KSP was launched, and then KSP was launched. In this scenario, KSP would instantly crash\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- If OBS was started recording while KSP was loading. In this scenario, KSP hung for a couple seconds, then crashed\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- If OBS was started recording while KSP was loaded.

Seems as though the issue was caused by something within DirectX 9.0c and it\u0027s runtimes (or how KSP used them, or SOMETHING related to DX 9.0c), because after forcing KSP to launch with DirectX 11 (-force-d3d11) the issue disappeared.
