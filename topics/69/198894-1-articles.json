First time I\u0027ve done one of these quests. I built a vessel from a mammoth engine, a little more fuel than I needed to escape atmo, some \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E ports/monoprop, 6 command seats inside of a structural tube, and then an aerodynamic nose cone on top of it. 8 radial chutes and 8 radial drogues.\u00A0flew up to 70km then fired the engines retrograde, customers passed out instantly. When the vessel landed, I could not do anything. The buttons provide visual feedback that they are being clicked but do not go anywhere. The only option that works is \u0022revert to launch.\u0022 I tried it a second time and had the same exact problem.\u00A0Here is a video demonstration of what it looks like -\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/5OPrdsPRhjE?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
