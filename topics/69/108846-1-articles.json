I recently discovered this on a mission to Jool, whereas when I turn off my SAS, torque not disabled on the module, it starts a roll that is uncontrollable. I\u0027ve tried everything, but nothing happens. I can temporarily cease the roll by disabling every SAS, even the capsule-built ones. Any tips?"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T23:47:17Z","Content":"Have you tried clearing the trim with Alt\u002BX?"}]}
