I can\u0027t recall if they\u0027ve been updated at all over the course of development, but the minimum listed should be capable of running the game, but perhaps requiring lower settings and with lower framerate as compared to a more powerful system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP\u0027s performance is almost entirely tied to the CPU, as opposed to many games where the graphics card becomes the main performance bottleneck. So if you\u0027re only planning on playing KSP, the processor is pretty much the most important component to consider. My understanding is that the graphics capabilities of the last few generations of Core i3,5,7 series processors are usually adequate to run KSP without the need of a dedicated graphics card, but it may require reduced graphics settings. For many users, the second most important component to consider is amount of RAM, as this can affect mod use and general performance if the amount is too low. After making sure those two components are adequate, the next thing to consider might be a dedicated graphics card. If you have some desire now, or in the future, to play other games besides KSP, you will probably be wanting a dedicated card at some point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re buying a laptop you won\u0027t really be able to upgrade/add parts later (aside from RAM), so it\u0027s a good idea to buy for what you want now and what you think you\u0027ll want between now and when you\u0027re ready to upgrade again. If you\u0027re buying a desktop, upgrading parts is not terribly difficult so you can always add a graphics card or more RAM -- or possibly even a CPU upgrade -- at a later time. The install process is likely easier than you think and there are a lot of good resources available online to assist part picking and installation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have a price point in mind for how much you want to spend and an idea of how you\u0027ll be using the computer besides KSP (and any bells and whistles you might want), I\u0027m sure we can get a some ideas together on what to look for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-18T20:23:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a good experience I would recommend a minimum i5 with\u00A0at least 8GB of RAM and a decent video card to handle the terrain.

I do have an i5-4690 (3.5GHz), 16Gb RAM but integrated graphics. The game runs, is stable and never ran out of allocated memory. Big vessels are no problem, as long as they are in interplanetary space - the frame rates are acceptable, even for 400\u002B part assemblies.

You can get it for about $300.

On the plus side, the 7th generation Intel Pentium G4560 is a decent two core CPU for gaming, and is cheaper than a comparable i3-7100. Since KSP is CPU intensive and mainly using just one core, the 3.5 GHz would work pretty darn well I think - at least for a $300 computer. But it is not very up gradable, limited by the 180 watt power supply. It has an open half-length, full-height, PCIe 3.0 x16 slot, but you would have to replace the power supply to use any more useful graphics card. And then of course you might run into heat issues...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut for $300, I am sure it would serve for people on a tight budget, and it is the only pre-built Intel G4560 box I can find.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Curveball Anders","CreatedById":107529,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-19T12:07:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been running KSP on a dinky old Lenovo W500 during weekends and vacation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(It\u0027s not that I\u0027m a technological masochist, I just don\u0027t lug my main gaming rig around).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCore2 Duo (\u003Ca href=\u0022/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\u0022 class=\u0022__cf_email__\u0022 data-cfemail=\u0022c490fdf2f4f484f6eafc838cbe\u0022\u003E[email\u0026#160;protected]\u003C/a\u003E) 4G Ram and running on the discrete AMD RV635 gpu (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s playable with all graphics at minimum and not too monstrous designs (and with very few mods).
