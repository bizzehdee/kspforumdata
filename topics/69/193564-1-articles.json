Having said that, I was, believe it or not, forced to learn the game. I got shoulder tapped to run a program for kids using KSP. I had not played computer games for years and had zero interest, but I had to learn it to run the program.\u00A0 I wanted to be reading a book or be kayaking.\u00A0 But, it\u00A0was a good opportunity and the person who asked is someone who has supported me a lot at work.

Despite all that, it is really a fantastic game that engages you creatively.
