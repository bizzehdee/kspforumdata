When I complete a mission and recover a vessel I don\u0027t seem to be receiving the science or reports. I first noticed this on my first vessel travelling to the Mun and back. I didn\u0027t receive the science from the Science Jr or the Mysterious Goo which I observed when landed. I also did not receive any new reports in the Science Archives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI repeated the above and got the same result.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter this I tried a more local science experiment. Starting with 41.6 Science and 1.4 Science in \u0027Materials Study while flying at Kerbin\u0027, I sent a Science Jr into the sky above the space centre and observed the materials bay flying of Kerbin. It gave me a Recover data score of \u002B16.4 Science. I pressed keep data, landed the ship and recovered the vessel. When I look back in my Science Archives I still seem to have only 1.4 Science in \u0027Materials Study while flying at Kerbin\u0027 and 41.6 Science in total.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then tried somewhere I hadn\u0027t been before and did a Materials observation at Kerbin\u0027s Ice Caps. I got the same results here saying I should get \u002B7.5 Science and when I go to the Science Archives, I have nothing in this report and still 41.6 Science in total.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do have screenshots if you need, but as they just show the above I haven\u0027t included them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt looks to me like I can\u0027t save missions or gain science.
