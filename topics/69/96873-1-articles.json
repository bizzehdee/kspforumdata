When actually playing, panning the camera around when it happens can suddenly put you on the other side of the craft (it seems like it carries on listening to input, but not updating the screen during the freeze). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Euntil this version and the last I never had this issue.

It tends to be the worst when working with very large craft, especially in the VAB/SPH.

Your suggestion of jumping back to the main menu does help a little and it is worse with large ships. Odd thing is that I never used to have this issue at all and that was making much larger, more modded craft. It\u0027s making the game almost unplayable, I just tried launching a 150 part craft and it was freezing every 1-2 seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
