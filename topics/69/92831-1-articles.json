It\u0027s simply not very stable in the Unity engine for the moment. It may not be for quite some time. We really don\u0027t know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere have been people saying that using OpenGL (command line switch: -force-opengl) has a similar memory footprint reduction and some also report an increase in performance. It is dependent on your hardware, though, and may not be very useful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
