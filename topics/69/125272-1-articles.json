Squad has never guaranteed save compatibility across versions, because any of the many changes applied with each new one can screw the old saves. It could be possible to find exactly what impacts your game, and to suggest ways to solve specific points; but consider good practice to finish a career game with the same KSP version it started with, and start a new game with each newer version (reason why I\u0027m keeping separate KSP installs with each version of the game).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
