I altered trajectory a few times prior to this and left and came back to mission a few times. After a shallow intercept of Mun gravity well to lower my orbit further, I alter orbit for last time and decide to return later. While doing a few other missions, this happens. Has this happened to anyone else? 1000 of the same asteroid. Is there a way to terminate multiple objects from Tracking Station without having to do this a thousand times? It takes about 10 sec to terminate one object since my FPS is so low. game is so slow now it actually effects other aspects of game. Now that this mission is bust and I have to find another Class E to capture, since this one has been \u0022disturbed\u0022. This is the farthest I have ever taken career mode and I don\u0027t what to start again. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
