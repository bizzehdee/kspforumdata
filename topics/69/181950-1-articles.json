I know the developers thought that was a pretty neat idea, but I play on a 4K 13\u0022\u00A0Zenbook and I do not run the game in 4K. The UI becomes tiny, and I don\u0027t even bother to fix that because\u00A0it runs with as much chop as a\u00A0chef with two seven-inch knives, a shipping container\u00A0full of bell peppers, and a\u00A0bag of cocaine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027ve always done is set resolution to 1600x900. I\u0027ve been perfectly content and it\u0027s worked fine, but every time I boot KSP it automatically sets the resolution to 3200x1800 which is the monitor\u0027s actual resolution. How can I make it NOT do that?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-04T09:28:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat never occurred to me to try. I just did now and it works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote: I run the game in windowed fullscreen mode. I do that because the game vanishes in actual fullscreen when I alt-tab away which is annoying on a multi-screen system. I like browsing the forums while waiting for something, sometimes. However, I just put it into fullscreen mode and changed the resolution and the game acted exactly like you described the game working in the past. So maybe something\u0027s up with your system. I have no idea what, of course, but it seems to work fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:/\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon1.png\u0022 title=\u0022:/\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
