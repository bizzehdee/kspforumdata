Note I was in a Kerbin escape trajectory. Other things to note is that my solar orbit would transfer to Jool and I had a maneuver mode on my solar trajectory. Similar lag and crashed happened when I turned the comic patch draw limit too high. So it may have been me putting too much strain on the patched comics system however I doubt that was the case because I have loaded more conics in 1.8. Also this changing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003Esoi\u003C/abbr\u003E lag did not happen in the Rosetta mission.
