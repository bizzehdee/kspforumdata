Whenever I try to fly a space plan in the atmosphere and use the time warp, the plane will start tilting down every few seconds. If I am not using the time warp, it simply never happens (flew for over 30 minutes without warp, the plane never tilted), while when using warp, it will happen at different intervals (higher warp factor means it reoccurs more often).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe drop caused by the tilt is quite significant, and seems to increase as the warp factor increases. It usually is a 5 to 15 degrees drop. If used in warp factor 4, an upwards angle of 30 degrees can change to a descent at 30 degree in a matter of seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am always flying using SAS, as it is nearly impossible to fly a plane in the atmosphere in warp without it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis seems to be affecting smaller space planes the most. Larger ones seems to have less of those tilts, and they don\u0027t seems as frequent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, although I couldn\u0027t try it again recently, I do remember trying to fly a plane in higher altitudes (25km\u002B), and it was affected by this bug, but it seemed to be working both ways, meaning that after a certain number of drops, the plane would start tilting up, doing the exact opposite, and going back to the height it was before starting to go down again. Problem is, the difference between the high point and low point could be of more than 15km, so this would render the use of warp for missions that require to fly below a certain altitude too dangerous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried to install and use MechJeb to work around this, as it has more accurate control on the craft, but the issue is the same in this case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuild ID is 00861, but as stated, this is happening since the Alpha on steam.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDX diag: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/ykiu79oxlao368l/DxDiag.txt?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/ykiu79oxlao368l/DxDiag.txt?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have not included screenshots, as in this case it would be pointless (showing a plane that is pointing lower than the previous screenshot), but I could make a video to show the bug, but I do not have any video software at the moment\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aidyn89","CreatedById":150653,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-03T06:51:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI did some more tests, and it seems that this drop is caused by the space plane rapidly rolling left and right, for a short period of time.

For the reasons given above, any time you warp you are playing with fire. When I design rovers, I often want them to operate safely at x2 or x4 warp so I bugtest it around that, which is counterintuitive and not much fun and sometimes compromises designs, but you pick your poison.
