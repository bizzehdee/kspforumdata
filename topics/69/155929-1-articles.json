To map the axes you need to look to the right side of that menu where you did the buttons. All buttons are on the left column, but the axes are to be found next to them, on the right side.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI dont have a screenshot handy, but its easy to find. So easy in fact that it becomes easy to overlook.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvery axis has a slider for Deadzone and Sensitivity under the button that assigns the command to your joysticks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helps. Otherwise search for joystick setup, i seem to remember that a helpful member posted a screenshot of the settings/input screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: welcome to the forum!
