The wiki says to use the \u0022patcher\u0022 ([http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Patcher](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Patcher)) but the link for OS X ends up redirecting to the KSP home page. There\u0027s also a forum post that says the patcher doesn\u0027t work for version 1.0\n\nI\u0027ve tried using the \u0022Launcher\u0022 application, which was suggested in another forum post. When I open the Launcher app it just says \u0022Checking for Updates...\u0022 forever.\n\nI got 1.0 by downloading a brand new game from the main KSP website, but I don\u0027t wan to start the game over every time an update comes out. What am I missing?\n\nSide question: is there any official documentation? The support page on the main KSP website just has an email link."},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T07:21:00Z","Content":"Unfortunately, at the time of writing, both the launcher and the patcher aren\u0027t working, so you have to redownload the entire game in order to get the latest updates. This is actually good practice, as it ensures you don\u0027t have any outdated game assets / resource files lying around in your system.\n\nYou can copy your savefiles out from the saves directory to a temporary location, and once you have installed the updated version of the game, copy those savefiles back in. I\u0027ve been updating my game this way since 0.18, and I\u0027ve never lost my savegames.\n\nAs for official documentation, there is the volunteer-run wiki:\n\n[http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Main_Page](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Main_Page)"}]}
