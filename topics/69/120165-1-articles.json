So I thought, \u0022Hey, I want more science!\u0022. So I went and built a rocket to get me to Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got the thing up and brought up enough fuel to make it there and back a couple of times. I thought things were golden. So I set it up for the transit to Minmus and was just watching it coast. I play real-time and that 8 day transit was a lot more painful than the few hours it takes to get to the Mun. But oh well, I\u0027ve never seen Minmus up close so it\u0027ll totally be worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few days later, 3 days away from Minmus influence, I still can\u0027t see it, it must be tiny, eh? I am sitting on the couch watching a movie with the map on the computer so I can glance at the clock counting until my next node and I see my orbit going back and forth between Minmus encounter and Kerbil orbit. I frowned and got up to take a look and my ship was just spinning around all weird but otherwise appeared to be fine. So I stabilized it and saw on the map that I was heading toward Minmus encounter and figured I was good to go. Looked at the ship again real quick and noticed I had 4 staging markers with nothing under any of them. I figuratively scratched my head and figured it was just some sort of a glitch so I went to the space center in order to re-load the ship. I went in to the tracking station and found my ship and two pieces of debris from my ship which was odd because there shouldn\u0027t be any debris yet but I hadn\u0027t jettisoned anything out of the atmosphere yet. So I proceed to load the only non-debris item and I just see the lander from my ship and then a second later, I notice the rest of my ship floating next to it, fairing still intact and everything. I was getting pretty steamed because it\u0027s already been 5 days watching this thing go but I figure, Minmus is small, maybe I can still get this lander on the surface in one piece since we\u0027re already over half-way there. So, irritated but a little cooled off, I go back to watching my movie and when it\u0027s over, I check the game again, and I see a bunch of orange bars, presumably because it\u0027s overheating? I didn\u0027t have any radiators on it because it was just a miniature lander and I barely fit a couple of small experiments on it as it was.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I\u0027ve taken the last week off from the game and I want to try again but I don\u0027t know what happened because I wasn\u0027t watching when it started its acrobatics. So, any idea on whether it was just a glitch in the game or another 1.0 new thing I need to account for kind of thing that I still don\u0027t know what it was?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any help in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-05T00:39:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a glitch of some sort, and so, your thread has been moved to support.
