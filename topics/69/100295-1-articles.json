Sad that on a machine that runs wow fine at good settings and civ 6 at max wo issue, Kerbal is failing. So 0.90 is broken in someway if so many peoples games have started crashing."},{"CreatedByName":"Tohkur","CreatedById":137689,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T03:53:42Z","Content":"Update:\n\n-force-opengl = lots of graphical glitches for me (only bottom left quadrant visible)\n\nRAM checks out (Memtest86 v6.0; 6 passes, windows memory diagnostic) with 0 errors\n\nTried the fix for freezing from fired/dead kerbal bug; no luck, still freezing (no entry in persistent.sfs for rescuing any kerbal, stock patch did nothing)\n\nRolled back video drivers to 770 disc original; no luck, still freezing\n\nReinstalled 347.52 video driver; no luck, still freezing\n\nReverted to KSP version .25, everything works perfectly....

Sadly, the logs are quite fill with useless spam sometimes.\n\nObviously this is a tough problem, since it\u0027s leaving no trace in the log files. One of the things that changed in 0.90 was the inclusion of PPFX edge highlighting. That particular feature seems to cause some sneaky behavior.You might also want to try making sure that option is off, along with anti-aliasing. If you turn them off in the settings menu, you\u0027ll have to restart for it to take effect.\n\nAlso, the -opengl flags seem even more volatile in v0.90. It used to be that they would just sometimes cause problems, or sometimes not. Now it\u0027s either catastrophic or totally necessary. I believe this particular thing is due to a unity update.\n\nYet another thing to try, that unity updated, is full screen mode shenanigans. Try running in not full screen (or the other way around, if you\u0027ve already been running not full screen). One thing that seemed to help a few people was using the -popupwindow flag. For this, I would recommend copying \u0026 pasting your KSP install to another folder. Then make a shortcut to KSP.exe. Edit that shortcut and include the command flag \u0022-popupwindow\u0022 (without the quotes).\n\nThat\u0027s all I can think of off the top of my head. Unity made some changes that seem to cause graphics problems, and KSP\u0027s big graphics thing was adding the edge highlight (which is sort of hit-and-miss). Hopefully something in there will help.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"}]}
