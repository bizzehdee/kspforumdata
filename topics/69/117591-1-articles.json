I did have mods installed when I first noticed the issue, but have since removed them all and started a new game to test and it has made no difference what so ever. Have tried reloading physics.cfg and that has made no difference either...\n\nAny suggestions would be much appreciated.\n\nG\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-04T12:55:20Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2015 12:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by gazzareth**"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T05:37:59Z","Content":"I noticed the same thing after I copied and pasted KSP over to a new branchoff folder and I deleted the physics config, after that, I noticed that things wouldn\u0027t cool off properly.\n\nI\u0027ve tried copying and pasting the correct config over, but nope, I think there may be more to it than just the physics config.\n\nEdit: Wait, module manager has physics cache, maybe if I delete that, pretty sure I don\u0027t need MM with the stripped down mod setup I have on the branchoff KSP atm.\n\nEdit2: Yeah, removing MMs cache did the trick.
