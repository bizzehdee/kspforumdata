Terrain set to low, Antialiasing off, minimum settings except rendering at simple. Getting 12 fps. I get higher framerate on lower performance gpus like the intel I3 - HD graphics 4000. There is no logical reason for ksp on near minimum to use more graphics power than battlefield 4/arma 3 on full.\n\nCPU: AMD A10 5800k OC 5ghz\n\nGPU: MSI r7 265 OC 1050mhz\n\nRAM: 8gb, 4gb allocated to KSP 32 bit.\n\nOS: Windows 7 64 bit.\n\nStats: GPU usage - 100%\n\nCPU usage - 6% \n\nallocated RAM usage - 1.2 GB/4GB \n\nPaging file usage - 0GB/32GB\n\nForce Opengl results in lower frame-rate than default DX11.\n\nNo crafts launched, clean save.\n\nEDIT: Switching from FSSS x4 to EDSS x12EQ seems to have increased framerate. But it still should be alot higher.\n\nEDIT 2: It seems that Post process anti-aliasing is using alot more gpu than it should on a simple game like ksp. The ksp version of anti-aliasing is just blurring, basically unusable. I found the best combination of looks and performance is Adaptive multisampling with edge-detect 24x \u002B EQ. It still is using a ridiculous amount considering that games like battlefield 4 uses less for much higher graphics. \n\nIf anyone knows a way to anti-alias KSP without completely killing the gpu please reply. I know its a beta and its not optimized but even ARMA 3 runs better than this.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-05T00:52:23Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2015 12:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by kokowang**"},{"CreatedByName":"wasmic","CreatedById":64885,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T19:21:34Z","Content":"I also once had a problem like this.

It only lags when GPU maxes out. My CPU maxes out at around 1200-1500 parts, by that time im running about 1 FPS because my GPU is dying.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-05T00:57:31Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2015 12:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by kokowang**"}]}
