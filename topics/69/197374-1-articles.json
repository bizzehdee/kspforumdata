Fuel Transfer:\u00A0 The fuel transfer lockup bug is still very much alive.\u00A0 Sometimes it can be fixed by changing focus between \u003Cem\u003Eevery single transfer, \u003C/em\u003Esometimes by warping.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Ore harvester and drills often stop when the mining complex on Gilley (see photo) loses focus to another ship somewhere.\u00A0 This was also happening with a refinery/miner on the Mun.\u00A0 It\u0027s basically impossible to produce meaningful amounts of fuel unless you want to keep the focus on the miner for around 24-48 hours.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. My mining landers-- 4x Refinery, Refueling Lander, and Storage Farm---have wheels so that they can traverse overland after landing and dock, so that no separate mining truck is needed.\u00A0 On Gilley, they can\u0027t get any traction, which might be understandable.\u00A0 However, they also sit a couple of meters above the ground after landing, so that they roll around and are difficult to keep upright.\u00A0 I eventually settled for traversing to the refinery and docking with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters, using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E and reaction wheels to keep them from rolling upside down.\u00A0 Once docked, with the landing legs extended, they seem to sit on the ground.\u00A0 They still jump off the ground when the focus switched to the docked complex, which should be bug 4., I guess.\u00A0 Oh, and 5., the fueler has been sucked underground once, which also happens on Minmus regularly.
