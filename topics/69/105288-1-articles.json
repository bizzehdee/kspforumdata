I build an ore scanner satellite consisting of:\n\n1. 3 Probodobodyne OCTO stacked on top of each other, the middle one being the root part\n\n2. 3 rows of OX-STAT panels in 8x symmetry\n\n3. 2 octogirders, 1 one either end\n\n4. 1 orbital ore scanner on top, the smaller one\n\n5. 1 communotron16 in 4x symmetry, approx. 30 degrees angled upward on the top octogirder\n\n6. 1 FL-A5 adapter connected to the bottom octogirder\n\n7. 2 Z1k batteries underneath the FL-A5\n\n8. the new 1.25m xenon tank\n\n9. another FL-A5\n\n10. an ion engine\n\n11. a TR-2C separator and underneath a 1x1 structural panel\n\n12. a 2.5m stock fairing base\n\nfor the rest of the rocket: see imgur album\n\nB. saved the craft and launched it\n\nC. on the launchpad during physics load, the camera shook like crazy, clipped through the terrain, never stopped -see first imgur image-\n\nD. after physics load -camera still shaking- throttle and SAS worked, but blue rings appeared, for an instant the skybox was visible \n\nE. hitting space bar, the rocket powered up, then again violent optical glitching, afterwards the 4th and 5th picture\n\nalso during building, the new fairings and service bays seem to glitch, as if the textures were not properly applied to the mesh, like in the 5th picture...\n\nimgur album:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

If said drivers were not up to the job that would be understandable, but KSP runs GREAT in linux using the opensource ati driver, just 1.0 added bugs due to fairing/service-bay/heat-shield-cowl transparency overlays.
