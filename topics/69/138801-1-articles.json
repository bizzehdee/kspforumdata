In 1.0.5 I launched it with 5 kickbacks in a bottom stage, and 5 thumpers in a middle stage (created with symmetry), and I had big yaw and pitch problems during launch that I \u0022solved\u0022 by slapping an enormous reaction wheel on the thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I am still having the problem in stock 1.1.2. The upper stage flies straight all by itself, merely controlled by\u00A0the reaction wheel in a HECS. So the Pitch/Yaw problems are not coming from there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried rebuilding stage 2 and stage 3 from scratch, but nothing changes. In the atmosphere, the kickback stage can be controlled with aerodynamic control surfaces -- but you can see that there is a constant pitch and yaw control being applied. The thumper stage gets lit in the upper atmosphere, so the aerodynamic control surfaces are not effective to control that one. The\u00A0reaction wheels have\u00A0to apply more and more and more yaw/pitch until they\u00A0max\u00A0out -- and then the rocket starts to veer, of course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I simplify stage 2 to being just a single thumper, the problem goes away. If I add\u00A02 radial thumpers to the central one, the problem is smaller than with 4. I\u0027ve tried the experiment with hammers, and they seem to do something similar. If the thrusts are equal from the SRBs, then experiencing\u00A0a torque would mean that the radial mountings are not exactly the same distance on one side as on the other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone else seen this? Can anyone confirm it with an experiment or two?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodari","CreatedById":157578,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-04T02:11:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI always have this problem with larger SRB\u0027s as well.\u00A0 It seems to be because their thrust is strong enough to cause the connection between them and the rest of the ship to flex slightly which means they are no longer firing in line with center of mass and thus producing some torque.\u00A0 My usual solution is to add a couple struts to the top(and possibly the bottom as well) of each booster, either connecting to the ship itself for 2 way symmetry, or to the adjacent boosters if I\u0027m using 4 way instead.\u00A0 This is enough to hold everything in place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-04T21:34:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222559865\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022138801\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462327915\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157578\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hodari\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 hours ago, Hodari said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI always have this problem with larger SRB\u0027s as well.\u00A0 It seems to be because their thrust is strong enough to cause the connection between them and the rest of the ship to flex slightly which means they are no longer firing in line with center of mass and thus producing some torque.\u00A0 My usual solution is to add a couple struts to the top(and possibly the bottom as well) of each booster, either connecting to the ship itself for 2 way symmetry, or to the adjacent boosters if I\u0027m using 4 way instead.\u00A0 This is enough to hold everything in place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, I really can\u0027t put this any better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sure that if you go back through the VAB and look at where decouplers and struts are located, something won\u0027t be aligned or will obviously flex off-centre. fix that and you should be sorted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
