I landed on Mun and run out of fuel. I sent refuel station with normal Docking Port \u00A0connected to hinge and pistons so I can manuever docking port independently much like an arm. I got crafts closer, and docked. Transfered the fuel and\u00A0everything is fine upto this point. When I undocked I saw that I can no longer control my main craft, it doesn\u0027t have a name\u00A0and even though two crafts undocked I can control both simultaneously like it is a single craft,\u00A0\u00A0stages\u00A0got merged and\u00A0\u00A0can\u0027t get crafts separated. Is this a bug or am I doing something wrong.\u00A0 ( I don\u0027t want to send a capsule to get my crew back, I want that particular craft back for challenge)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTLDR: I docked with normal Docking Port that is connected to pistons and hinges, transfered fuel, undocked and crafts and stages got merged even after undocking.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny ideas?

You may need to load a save from before the two things got docked together, or go rummaging in the forums to find one of several threads about similar issues which also contain possible fixes. I believe there\u2019s also a mod that can unpick corrupted saves, but haven\u2019t used it and can\u2019t remember the name.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-31T23:44:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt sounds like you\u0027ve got that rare but annoyingly persistent undocking bug, but I\u0027m sorry that I don\u0027t remember the fix.

I\u00A0tried docking maybe 15\u00A0times and the result is still same. I have to add that when I undock, hinge on my main craft breaks away from it, probaby because of slope and pistons create tension.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I tested on Kerbin, there was no problem.

I tried 0 dampening thing but didn\u0027t work. What happens is that when I undocked hinge that connected to piston and docking port\u00A0on my main craft comes off even with unbreakable joints. I think before docking port undocks\u00A0 it breaks and since there is no vehicle connected it can\u0027t undock and the vehicle is put into purgatory. I tried disassembling parts with a kerbal setting gravity to zero and assembling again but again same, still comes off. I believe the problem is this but might be wrong. I will use top port for this one since it works, but going to be careful on next craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-01-02T18:32:55Z\u0022 title=\u002201/02/2021 06:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 2, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by MertMe\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
