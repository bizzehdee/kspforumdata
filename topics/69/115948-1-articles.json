A while back, in 0.90, I made a Timberwolf mech. The aerodynamic nose cone that came with 0.90 was an excellent fit for the geometry \\*and\\* it even had a texture that kinda looked like a cockpit when oriented a certain way. You can see the result in my 1.0 hype\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/1HD6dlLTLsA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n video.\nAs you might imagine I had a lot of requests to release the files, but I really couldn\u0027t. Getting the mech and dropship to work took some serious part config editing so that the masses were compatible with the abilites of the IR mod. I also needed to do some welding to keep the part counts down. I have decided to revisit this post-1.0, now that the pre-release IR I used is actually released, KOS has been updated, and the welding mod has been updated. \n\nUnfortunately, my cockpit part is gone. It has been replaced by a new part that does not have the desired geometry. This is probably the one part critical to the entire design, and would not bother continuing without it. I tried to get the part into my 1.04 folder but have been unsuccessful. At first I moved the original part folder in its entirety into a subdirectory of 1.04\u0027s gamedata, but the part would not attach properly. I then looked at the part config from the 1.04 replacement and the file format is obviously very different. I tried editing the new 1.04 file to contain information related to the 0.90 nosecone, but when I did this the part was not available in the editor.\n\nHere\u0027s [a screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/hJbRcyl.png) of both config file contents and the path to the part files I have attempted to copy in. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nI\u0027m not entirely sure where this question belongs... I\u0027m talking about changing something about the game, but the change involves using previous stock game files. It\u0027s also not exactly an addon, I just want to reuse an earlier part. If anyone thinks the question would be better answered in another subforum let me know (or just move it!)"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T03:10:55Z","Content":"Erk, nevermind, the rover body is gone too (WHY SQUAD WHY?!?).
