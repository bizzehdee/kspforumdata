But when I launch it, this the situation happens in image above. So it\u0027s quite small rather than 1920x1200 and windowed. \n\nAt the same time, after game launch, it gets not responding. After waiting 2 or 3 minutes, Squad logo appears and game starting to normally load parts. But at the end of the loading, nothing happens. The writing above loading bar changes(recruiting Kerbals etc.![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)), and changes but nothing happens like I said.
