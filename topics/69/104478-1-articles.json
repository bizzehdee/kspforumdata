Pod stops when kerbal stops walking.The shaking of the ship while it over-corrects to point regtrograde/prograde/whatever constantly causes the orbital line to dance in and out of the sphere of influence. When outside of the sphere, strange orbital shapes appear.\n\nHere is an image of the skewed orbit-line:\n\n![c9lnDHzvut1tlKvcLagLa0Wnvb2C2Sye8n7yjTEyLHlKx5Cpkj3o4QmgpMZs8v7VFlajhWgeGnSVQqw=w912-h798](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/c9lnDHzvut1tlKvcLagLa0Wnvb2C2Sye8n7yjTEyLHlKx5Cpkj3o4QmgpMZs8v7VFlajhWgeGnSVQqw=w912-h798)\n\nHere is a craft capable of replicating the scenario:\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwkqQUMaryIqNlk3amI1WTFPWjg/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwkqQUMaryIqNlk3amI1WTFPWjg/view?usp=sharing)\n\nSimilar/identical issues have been pointed out on Facebook threads in previous versions but have become notably less frequent.
