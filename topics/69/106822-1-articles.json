Another tiny thing that\u0027s bugging me that I\u0027d like to ask about: the missing jet engine glow. I recall in I think it was 0.21, or whatever the update it was in which bac9 redid the jet engine models, I recall he also added a red glow to the engines when they\u0027re activated. This appears to be missing in 1.0 and its first two patches (1.01 and 1.02). Is this coming back at some point?

That seems like a big waste of a cool effect. Could you guys not repurpose it to show when the jets are active instead of when they\u0027re overheating (which doesn\u0027t happen anymore).\n\nEdit: Wow, I just checked all the other stock engines and *none* of them glow when running anymore. Huge step backward, guys. Please consider adding that as a cosmetic effect and not strictly tying it to engine heat levels. I guess this has turned into more of a suggestion thread at this point, sal, so please chuck it over there if you\u0027re so inclined.\n\nTo be clear, I\u0027m talking about this:\n\n![9C19B821D3784FDA83E8CFC04D39864DD5280E98](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/68997312834102359/9C19B821D3784FDA83E8CFC04D39864DD5280E98/)\n\nor this:\n\n![FD89A99BE4E6C802635C083FE96C83B4BE9485CA](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/468672921179623683/FD89A99BE4E6C802635C083FE96C83B4BE9485CA/)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T12:06:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 12:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Bomoo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T12:15:09Z","Content":"I\u0027ve actually seen the LV-909 effect: It only appears when the engine gets hot, and then it stays there for a while.

Kind step backwards for the jets.\n\nI found it was quite difficult to notice the missing glow on the rocket engines, but the jets are immediately noticeable. Only way I ended up getting the ramjets to glow was taking them through quite a rough re-entry, and then they kept glowing until I recovered the craft even though I\u0027d shut them off. Bleh.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve actually seen the LV-909 effect: It only appears when the engine gets hot, and then it stays there for a while.

There\u0027s currently no visual cue that the engine\u0027s running other than the exhaust plume. I think the low heat cue could be the current effect for the interior of the bell glowing, and high heat the external casing starting to glow (as with the LVN). Or just the dark orange/red outline that non-engine parts get when they overheat too heavily."},{"CreatedByName":"BlackSun","CreatedById":144657,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T12:40:36Z","Content":"I was going crazy, I thought something was messed up with my Game or Video Drivers, every Screenshot and Video on Youtube shows the Jet Engines glowing when throttling up...

If this is designed and intended like this, it\u0027s still something I\u0027d rather want to change. Are there any Mods to bring back the visual Appeal of (in particular) Jet Engines? I\u0027m really unhappy about this, it looks extremely cheap.\n\n\\*Edit: Where does my Paragraph / Word Wrap Formatting go?

Now they probably don\u0027t any longer either, though due to the huge Exhaust Flame covering up most of the Engine, it\u0027s harder to notice I guess. At least with those, you can still see the big Flame shooting out of it, whereas Jet Engines don\u0027t show any Sign of being active other than the Smoke Trails Way behind \u0027em, which is not helpful when you\u0027ve got, for Example, several jet Engines close to each other and one failed.\n\nAll I\u0027ve been able to find so far was an Engine Light Mod, which adds Lightsources to Engines.
