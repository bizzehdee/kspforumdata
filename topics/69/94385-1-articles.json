The effect does not always seem to occur at 1x warp but will always occur with physics warp turned on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis never *really* bugged me enough to report it before, but with 0.9 creating contracts to, say, land two continents away to take several ground samples, being able to leave a plane to make its way there on warp would be nice. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVideo demonstration: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/mu2sbamgjmg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://youtu.be/mu2sbamgjmg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Secuas","CreatedById":126000,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-24T13:37:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA mod that may help is the Pilot assistance mod: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100073-0-25-Pilot-Assistant-0-7-Nov-20-Atmospheric-piloting-aids\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100073-0-25-Pilot-Assistant-0-7-Nov-20-Atmospheric-piloting-aids\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had this wobbly issue as well.

The sound also loops when not in physics warp, but the brief stutter doesn\u0027t have as much effect simply because the game is running at a slower pace.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I guess this is another \u0022sound loop/stutter\u0022 related issue.
