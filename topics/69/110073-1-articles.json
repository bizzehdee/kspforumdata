Or more likely were.\n\nI made saves.rar before uninstalling, but foolishly it was left in the game folder.\n\nNow the whole folder is gone with the saves.rar as well. \n\nIs there any way to restore ?\n\nI do not really care about my normal save or mods. Was using only EVE KER and Transfer Window planner anyway.\n\nBut on my hard save I had pretty big base on Minmus as well as refueling orbiting station. Few of my orange shirts had pretty close calls with the death, but was not lost.\n\nShould I just start over and try to get over it ?"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T06:44:45Z","Content":"Depends how you reinstalled the game.
