Run the ksp.exe in the same folder.\n\nMore info:\n\nRight-click the shortcut you normally run the launcher from and check the Properties. \u0022Start in\u0022 will tell you the directory you need.\n\nOpen explorer, and put that directory into the bar, and find ksp.exe. You can just double click that to start it.\n\nBetter yet, right click it and drag it to your desktop and select \u0022create shortcut here\u0022 so you can launch it every time.\n\nIf you want something special like \u0022fake fullscreen\u0022 or OpenGL mode you need to know the switch. Fake Fullscreen is one of my favorites so I know it by heart. You can add those to the shortcut with:\n\nRight click that shortcut and check it\u0027s properties.\n\nIn the \u0027Target\u0027 box, where it has \u0022bla bla bla\\ksp.exe\u0027 just add -popupwindow to the end. And turn off \u0022Fullscreen\u0022 in the actual game.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-08T08:37:23Z\u0022 title=\u002203/08/2015 08:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by 5thHorseman**"}]}
