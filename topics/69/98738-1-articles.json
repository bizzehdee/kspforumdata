A small ion/solar powered probe on its way to minmus is having its APO reduced quite quickly and visibly over time, maybe by as much as 500-1000 m each second if I switch to the craft. Currently it is 48 120 000 m so as a percentage the drift is not too huge, but it still matters because if I set a maneuver node for my circularization it becomes visibly offset from the orbit in a minute, and after that if i try to edit it by a tiny amount it jumps up and shows wildly different resulting orbit...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I can just wait for the probe to get closer to Minmus without it being active, i.e. in the tracking station.
