I move the stick to set the axis, but the menu box gets real finicky (spazzing numbers) and shows a different axis than the one I am actuating.

Using a Microsoft Sidewinder Force Feedback 2 joystick, in very good condition. Have no problems with it in several other games, and in-game calibration from my flight sim says all is as it should be.\u00A0I\u0027ve used the old Logiteck 3D Pro stick in KSP with no problems. So I suspect this is a problem with the game. Using 1.3.1 64 bit, problem persists regardless of mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow before you suggest that I need to press the Apply button, I will tell you that I have already tried this.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u00A0I have used this game for quite a while, and I know what I\u0027m doing for the most part.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m getting sick of using the\u00A0keyboard for my\u00A0control axis. Not how a real plane flies. Being a flight sim guy, this game is unplayable for me if I can\u0027t use a joystick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help appreciated...
