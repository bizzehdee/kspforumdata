And haven\u0027t intensified though. I went over to Linux for various reasons, One pro for Linux players in KSP is that it crashes less often, or almost never. This is true. KSP crashed a horrible amount of times on my old Windows computer and have crashed maybe twice or 3 times on linux which crashes were actually explanatory due to excessive memory usages. Ah yeah, you can use many many more mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027m very happy about that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027m furious about is the framerate. And I\u0027m talking about my framerate opposed to others. And I\u0027m not talking about the default framerate here. That means if I launch a 50-100 part ship the framerate is about as good on my previous windows build and it has very playable FPS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMax physics Delta time per frame is already at 0.03.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I know many of the videos out there with 500-1000 part ships are recorded in slowmow and sped up with editing software, and these people get 1-2 frames per second in real life seconds maybe 5. Videos like these for example.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrjpELy1xzc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrjpELy1xzc\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI get that framerate aswell, but I get it with 250-300 part ships. This forced me to play KSP in a kind of playstyle that is by launching low part count vessels, doing alot of docking for fuel transfers to get my duna, jool and other interplanetary missions working whereby I\u0027d like to mine ore and actually build colonies and stuff. Which is hard because all my surface and orbit vessels should be spaced outside physics range for me to not get redheaded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll my FPS issues are due to part count.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI love realism, I love RO/RSS, and I like mods using large large fuel tanks just so I need less of the same part to lower the count.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I\u0027ve reached a point right here and right now where I would not be ashamed to see a new option whereby you can test your vehicle for mission specific physic calculations like re-entry and stuff and if a mission specific maneouvre accomplishes all the physics challanges that I could turn of Physics calculations all together just so I can play this game for fun (whereas fun is the eventual goal of this game, right)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI spent the whole week trying to create a 4 seat Eve ascent vehicle that can operate from 1km surface elevation to orbit. It has 250 parts with ladders, parachutes etc incorporated. I got 5-10 fps in orbit. I thought, Oh no, It still needed airbrakes, heatshield, maneouvring rockets, fairing, and the actual rocket to launch it from the KSC. So I build my heatshielding, fairings, airbrakes and maneouvring rockets to test a design that would get it to aerobrake at eve. I used Physics time accelerating and on rails time accelerating as much as I could to take me through the painfully slow framerate situation and it took me a full day (with several re testing) just to manage a simple heatshield design where FPS dropped down to litteraly 2 FPS with the physics delta time frame per second to max while it aerobraked through the atmosphere. With heatshielding, fairings, maneouvring rockets that initial 250 part count went up to 300.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think we can safely assume that with the necessary part count to lift that 200ton behemoth into orbit with conventional parts it\u0027s going to be atleast well over 500 parts. That \u00EDs absolutely unplayable. I already setup my mission profile to send the eve ascent vehicle to eve first and then get the kerbalnauts there. I would love to one day submit a Eve attempt in the challanges forum for example as for this case. But I always get to demotivated to attempt a video for it because it takes days with hyperedit to test simple aerobraking designs, ascent rocket designs all under 5 fps and I would have to slow down time so much for making a KSP video it would take atleast a day if not many days to capture anything and all without having fun in terms of gameplay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor all these performance reasons I\u0027m inclined against my own will to cheat the game engine and have occasionally posted threads on the forums here, one not so long ago as I recall to edit physics calculatable settings just to improve framerate, and I get the undertone in peoples replies that this would be a cheat and I should not come here to ask these things, which I don\u0027t even want to but my performance issues are so devestating to having fun in this game that I feel I\u0027m forced to use these meassures. Things like tweakscale to reduce amount of engines and procedural fuel tanks are all meassures I\u0027m forced to use to reduce part count and promote playability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich is not a playstyle I want perse but am forced to. And it\u0027s also the reason why I never posted a mission challenge in the challenges subforum as that\u0027s usually stock only and in order to compete to the top of the challenge tables you usually require the biggest of ships, which any part of my hardware of software doesn\u0027t allow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s the last bit I want to add to this, physics calculations for earodynamics. It\u0027s fun with a 50-100 part rocket/spaceplane, but beyond that it\u0027s hell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d say, thanks for all the attempts at realism, which it isn\u0027t because you would need FAR for that (ironic) and alot less thanks for ruining playrate and chance of having fun with neccesarily big ships for a planet one whishes to takeoff from that you have put into your own game. Even for people with more regular performance digits on the FPS gauge getting a Eve return vehicle especially for multiple kerbals on and off the service is not so much a design challenge but a testing your nerve kinda thing in how much frames one is willing to allow to process through time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like a RANT to squad!? Never!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m just blowing off steam and I\u0027m the one that fails, and I know that. I love squad, and this is the best game I ever played, and that can only be developed by the best of producers and clearly this framerate issue is more of a personal problem then it may be for everybody else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried all the different settings combinations for graphics in the KSP settings menu.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve used like all the available working propriatary drivers for my ATI HD 7850 videocard.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027ve read ATI videocards and linux in general thus Ubuntu do not work well together. And one should buy a Nvidia card.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe that\u0027s the short reply I\u0027ll get, get a new videocard!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t get that! I\u0027ve read a reply of someone some time ago as I was in the hunt to solve my problem on this very forum who used a 3th generation ATI HD grapics card, one from the\u00A0 low budget segment.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAre ATI linux drivers for my specific graphics card so badly supported (or not at all) that a videocard 4 ATI HD generations ago from a low budget range (whereas mine is a medium/high budget range) and 3 years newer outperforms it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr are there more forces at work here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I also don\u0027t get is that my framerate drops with part count and more so when it has to deal with physics calculations, thus Delta changes, aerodynamics and just alot of parts here and there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThats the business of the CPU, not the graphics card. I\u0027m not a IT man but that\u0027s basically how it has sinked in to me over the year when it comes down to KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe videocard doesn\u0027t do physics calculations.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut if it does, please inform me about it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut if it\u0027s the CPU thats at fault then I\u0027m still scratching my forehead. Its a 3570K 3,4 ghz intel ivybridge that I even overclocked to 3.9 ghz.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn Ubuntus system monitor while KSP is running none of the CPU cores ever get close to 100%\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHell, I can\u0027t even tell which of the CPU cores KSP is using. Mabe there lies the problem! Shouldn\u0027t KSP completely utilize the processing power of 1 CPU core to 100%\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf that\u0027s the case then one of my CPU cores should read 100% while ksp is running. It doesn\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just checked this and the highest one of the cores jumped at is 58% and the other cores are processing at 21 through 58% at the time of monitoring.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy this time you might wonder, how about other games?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I don\u0027t play many games anymore these days, my real and only occasional hookup is KSP. But I did played some battlefield alot on the same computer when it had windows on it and it runs fine.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBecause I\u0027m a only 1 year linux user I don\u0027t yet know all the ins and outs which are near infinite when it comes down to linux. But I never gotten the information about my framerate issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI read tons of usefull information on the Ubuntu One forums and even open a few questions there myself in hopes for a solution to this specific KSP problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere they bash ATI and Ubuntu combinations and recommend a Nvidia card, which reminds me of what I said earlier in this thread, KSP is not graphics card intensive. I mean, the ATI HD7xxx proprietary drivers for Ubuntu must be really really crappy if they\u0027re causing these excessive framerate issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m willing to believe that it\u0027s the fault of my graphics card, but how do I know for sure. Are there other linux or preferably ubuntu users out there that have experienced similar bad results with ATI drivers?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd did you move over from one Linux distro to another and got better results??\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope I made my point clear, and that some of you have experience with similar issues and what could be done to solve it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-29T18:05:46Z\u0022 title=\u002212/29/2015 06:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Vaporized Steel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"radonek","CreatedById":84077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-30T15:20:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, ATI cards do have a really excrementsty drivers. Even windows ones are not exactly great, so this is not really surprising. Supposedly there are some hw/drivers combinations that work well, or can be kicked to shape if you know your way around X. Many don\u0027t.\u00A0I can only advise you to google around your card model and drivers version and see what comes up. I\u0027m sorry I cant help you more but this is sole reason why I stay away from ATI/AMD ever since I moved to linux.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther then hassling with drivers, few more things can be done. First, disable window manager eye candy.\u00A0Google found this for me:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://itsfoss.com/speed-up-ubuntu-unity-on-low-end-system/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://itsfoss.com/speed-up-ubuntu-unity-on-low-end-system/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can top that with avoiding unity altogether and using some simpler window manager like twm or maybe xfce. With proper kernel, drivers\u00A0 and X stack this wont be of much help, but if windows manager is behind this, it will show. Thing here is, if you run simple (or as they say, \u0022unaccelerated\u0022) window manager like twm, game can draw directly to hardware (or window, which should go to hardware shortest way possible).\u00A0Fancy window managers like unity have to grab window content, turn it into texture and apply their own fancy stuff (transparency, shadows or other eyecandy) which should not take much \u0022if drivers can do such operations properly\u0022...\u00A0If you want to try it, have some experienced penguin herder at hand or PM me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther thing worth a try would be using builtin intel GPU. Like you said, KSP is not very graphics intensive :-) It will run just fine and intel have about best linux drivers of them all, with kernel modeswitching, proper xrandr and all that. Like previous, this is not a solution but could help you isolate the problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, you will need a way to measure you success. For that, fire up terminal and run glxgears, it will show simple animation and measure FPS. Note it is very simple test, not true benchmark.\u00A0More FPS in glxgears does not translate to that many more FPS in game, but it tells you progress. Other program that might come handy is glxinfo. It should print several pages describing your GPU capabilities. That, or just a few lines including dreaded \u0022direct rendering: no\u0022 which means you screwed up and your driver (or more precisely, X server) is not using your dear GPU at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for CPU labor, no, you hardly ever \u00A0see single core actually go to 100% with KSP. CPU Core load is measured during time interval and in that time kernel can and will move tasks between cores as it sees fit. for example, say you have 1 second measurements, kernel will put process at one core and after 500ms push it to other core, ergo you will see two cores having 50% load. But top will show that process ran at 100% alloted cpu time, which is correct. (This gets more complicated with threads, but in KSP other threads are negligible compared to physics computing, essentialy making it behave like singlethread). Moral of this to use top (or htop or whatever that measures processes and not cores).\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"v8Dave","CreatedById":134518,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-30T17:24:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222341993\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022128842\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221451488852\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002284077\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022radonek\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, radonek said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, you will need a way to measure you success.

The combination of the (reasonable) new aerodynamics, the (overengineered) thermal system, and the extended physics range all mean that KSP now lags worse at lower part counts than it did back in 0.90.

Even windows ones are not exactly great, so this is not really surprising. Supposedly there are some hw/drivers combinations that work well, or can be kicked to shape if you know your way around X. Many don\u0027t.\u00A0I can only advise you to google around your card model and drivers version and see what comes up. I\u0027m sorry I cant help you more but this is sole reason why I stay away from ATI/AMD ever since I moved to linux.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther then hassling with drivers, few more things can be done. First, disable window manager eye candy.\u00A0Google found this for me:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://itsfoss.com/speed-up-ubuntu-unity-on-low-end-system/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://itsfoss.com/speed-up-ubuntu-unity-on-low-end-system/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can top that with avoiding unity altogether and using some simpler window manager like twm or maybe xfce. With proper kernel, drivers\u00A0 and X stack this wont be of much help, but if windows manager is behind this, it will show. Thing here is, if you run simple (or as they say, \u0022unaccelerated\u0022) window manager like twm, game can draw directly to hardware (or window, which should go to hardware shortest way possible).\u00A0Fancy window managers like unity have to grab window content, turn it into texture and apply their own fancy stuff (transparency, shadows or other eyecandy) which should not take much \u0022if drivers can do such operations properly\u0022...\u00A0If you want to try it, have some experienced penguin herder at hand or PM me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther thing worth a try would be using builtin intel GPU. Like you said, KSP is not very graphics intensive :-) It will run just fine and intel have about best linux drivers of them all, with kernel modeswitching, proper xrandr and all that. Like previous, this is not a solution but could help you isolate the problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, you will need a way to measure you success. For that, fire up terminal and run glxgears, it will show simple animation and measure FPS. Note it is very simple test, not true benchmark.\u00A0More FPS in glxgears does not translate to that many more FPS in game, but it tells you progress. Other program that might come handy is glxinfo. It should print several pages describing your GPU capabilities. That, or just a few lines including dreaded \u0022direct rendering: no\u0022 which means you screwed up and your driver (or more precisely, X server) is not using your dear GPU at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for CPU labor, no, you hardly ever \u00A0see single core actually go to 100% with KSP. CPU Core load is measured during time interval and in that time kernel can and will move tasks between cores as it sees fit. for example, say you have 1 second measurements, kernel will put process at one core and after 500ms push it to other core, ergo you will see two cores having 50% load. But top will show that process ran at 100% alloted cpu time, which is correct. (This gets more complicated with threads, but in KSP other threads are negligible compared to physics computing, essentialy making it behave like singlethread). Moral of this to use top (or htop or whatever that measures processes and not cores).\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, I read this about the ATI cards. Tried many driver versions, even ones that send me straight to the Grub boot loader to reload the open source drivers just to test each of them. In the end only a few of these drivers actually work and the performance is all similar. I don\u0027t know how to go beyond the X as I used official drivers by AMD but if you have supply of info to get me in a general direction I would really appreciate that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the link. What about window manager eye candy? I never used window manager and I use a default theme. As for other window managers, You suggest 2 options. Which one would you think is better in user friendlyness. I heard some of the window managers are different, perhaps more difficult to navigate with then others.

The combination of the (reasonable) new aerodynamics, the (overengineered) thermal system, and the extended physics range all mean that KSP now lags worse at lower part counts than it did back in 0.90. Even 0.90 with FAR and DRE ran better than 1.0.5 does now. Things like that Mars Ultra Direct video were done on previous KSP versions that ran less badly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said you *should* do better than you are. I run a Core i3 6100, GTX 750 Ti, Debian Linux, and I can maintain 10 fps on a 600 part ship. You have a similar CPU as far as running KSP goes. Two factors could explain the discrepancy:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGame settings. The aerodynamic effects tank framerate for me so I usually put them on minimum. If you\u0027re actually GPU-limited then obviously sending the detail right down will help. Even if you\u0027re \u0022CPU-limited\u0022 like most people playing KSP, graphics settings still impose some CPU load.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMods can sometimes \u003Cem\u003Eseriously\u003C/em\u003E hammer your fps, I\u0027ve seen an 80% drop from a buggy mod before now - that means that what should be 25 fps will be running at 5 fps just because you installed or even just updated one of your mods. I\u0027ve also seen a serious hit from Smokescreen, which is a part of Realism Overhaul. On the other hand I\u0027ve not seen more than about a 5-10% hit from FAR, but of course if several mods each cost you 5% of your framerate it starts to add up to big damage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have to admit, I could have made it shorter and clearer.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe thing about the heavier load on physics in 1.0 is basically why I\u0027ve come to realize I have to adjust my performance somehow.

AMDs track record on the other hand... summarily dropping support for older cards, with no \u0027legacy\u0027 driver available, failing to update their code for months and putting people in the position of \u0027downgrade the entire X.org stack or have no OpenGL\u0027 etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis lack of commitment to keeping up with the times, combined with the complete lack of drivers (not counting FOSS drivers, as not AMDs work) for other Unixes (e.g. FreeBSD) makes AMD graphics products a solid no-buy for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-06T14:30:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve seen people use cheat engine to turn off physics completely.
