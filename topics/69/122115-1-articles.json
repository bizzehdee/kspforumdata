With the Navball at the largest size, and setting the music to zero volume via the in-flight settings caused some graphics issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack then, the thing that fixed it was reducing the size of the navball or turning up the voulme slightly. I think the other thing that fixed it was running the game in frameless window mode via the -popupwindow command.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing to possibly check is the settings.cfg, and make sure the resolution didn\u0027t get messed up. Make sure the resolution matches your desktop settings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing that might help us is to upload the log file. The instructions for how to do that are in the sticky in this forum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
