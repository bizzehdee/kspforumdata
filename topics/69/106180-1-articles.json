It\u0027s weird, the problem isn\u0027t present near the beginning of a launch (say, I launch my rocket and have it immediately crash into the ground), but once I gain altitude (say ~5 km and more), any explosions will have the choppy sound, including any debris that hits the ground through staging (Kerbal X stock rocket\u0027s boosters for example). It seems like the sound engine is having issues dealing with multiple instances of a single sound being played simultaneously. I was hoping this would be resolved in 1.0, but it\u0027s still there.\n\nI don\u0027t know if it\u0027s just me since I haven\u0027t found anyone else reporting the problem. This has become too much of a noticeable problem for me to ignore while I have been developing a new plugin that revolves around explosions. I have updated my sound drivers, re-installed them etc., and I have no sound issues in any other game/application. I\u0027ve tried changing the audio settings in-game and I think that bumping the responsiveness in the normalizer to max may have helped very slightly, but I cannot tell. OpenGL mode seems to reduce the issue, but it\u0027s still there. All other sounds are fine in game, and it\u0027s definitely not the general sound stutter that can be common with the Unity engine.\n\n**System Specs**\n\nWindows 7 Ultimate x64\n\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 Ti (Primary Monitor)\n\n NVIDIA GeForce 9600 GT (2nd \u0026 3rd Monitors)\n\nIntegrated Audio (Realtek HD) on an ASUS P8 Z68-V Pro Motherboard\n\nIntel i7-2600K CPU\n\n16 GB DDR3 RAM\n\n128 GB Corsair SSD / 2 TB Seagate HDD\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T02:02:26Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 02:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by stevehead**"},{"CreatedByName":"Corovaneer","CreatedById":26202,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T20:45:18Z","Content":"Same here, but I even kinda like it.

At about 0:34, the failure occurs and you can hear the very choppiness of the explosion sound FX.

It sometimes seems to do it even for a single explosion. I assumed it was a feature; I like the effect. It sounds like it might be a somewhat broken implementation of sonic booms and/or the doppler effect. I know the doppler effect is/was simulated in some way, because this is in the changelog:\n\n     ==================================== v0.18.2 RC2=======================================================Bug Fixes and Tweaks:* Music:- Fixed an issue where some tracks were subject to doppler effects in flight."},{"CreatedByName":"GorillaZilla","CreatedById":100625,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T16:55:03Z","Content":"Aye, I\u0027m suffering from this bug too.
