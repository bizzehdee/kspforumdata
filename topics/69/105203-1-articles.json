Open Construction Basics Training \n\n2. Flick through the first couple of messages and place the command pod.\n\n3. On the add a fuel tank step select the the Fuel Tank, then immediately drop it back into the parts list to destroy it (note if a new player double clicks, this has the same effect), the messages advance a step, but you haven\u0027t placed a fuel tank. This also hides the fuel tank from the parts list view, meaning you can\u0027t reattempt to place it.\n\n**Result:**\n\nStuck in tutorial only being able place LVT-45, can\u0027t exit to main menu to restart.\n\n**Fixes/Workarounds:**\n\nCan place an LVT-45 below another one then advance through the rest of the tutorial messages to get to the end and exit to main menu.\n\n**Other Notes/Pictures/Log Files:** \n\nAlso happens the same at the LVT-45 step, but you aren\u0027t stuck there like before and can just flick to the end.\n\nSorry for a bug after only 30 minutes!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-27T18:07:44Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2015 06:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Chonner**"},{"CreatedByName":"Daziman","CreatedById":141857,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T18:35:21Z","Content":"I had the same problem :/"},{"CreatedByName":"bs7599","CreatedById":142762,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T20:17:02Z","Content":"Same happened to me."},{"CreatedByName":"Suicider","CreatedById":141344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T20:28:12Z","Content":"Confirmed, bug still exists in Version 1.0.2.842 It isnt Game breaking but hey, if you want to do the Training properly, do not get rid of that fuel tank."}]}
