I started by using the 64 bit installer. When i launched KSP after installing, all i got was a \u00A0black screen. Since i had never had a chance to put it in full screen, it was easy to close out of. however, it would freeze my computer for a few seconds and then close. So, i uninstalled it. Then i tried getting just the .zip file from the website for 1.3 64 bit, and it is saying it is having a server migration (which it has said for over a week, but only on that link). So i moved on to trying the 1.2 .zip file, and when i opened KSP after installing, the same issue ocurred. I then moved on to the 32 bit counterparts of all of these options, with the same problem. some installs play the music, but all stay on the black screen. let me know if you need any info about my computer or install. thanks for your help\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Samssonart","CreatedById":57129,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-06T18:28:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi mikeshehadi,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease refer to the\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83213-stock-support-bug-reporting-guide/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EStock support and bug reporting guide\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0and provide the information pointed out there.
