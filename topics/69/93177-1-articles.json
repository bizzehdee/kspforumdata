My good computer is at home, I\u0027m at school.) Anyhow, in the last version of the game, when I set the game to run in fullscreen, the game would letterbox the screen. This meant no weird issues with stretching. With 0.90, the game now stretches 1024 x 768 to 1366 x 768. I don\u0027t like the stretching, and I can\u0027t play in windowed mode with the toolbar in the way at the bottom of the screen. Is there a way to make the game letterbox like it did in 0.25?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Inglonias","CreatedById":2460,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T21:02:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI seem to have semi-solved this by using -popupwindow, but it\u0027s not \u003Cem\u003Equite\u003C/em\u003E what I want.
