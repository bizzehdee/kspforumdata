I recently recieved a contract to make a outpost on minmus with wheels. I have created two segments that will combine to make the outpost. But when I was testing if they would dock correctly half of the wheels broke when they did dock. I quickloaded and this happens every time. Also I do not have a lvl. 3 engineer so I\u00A0cant repair them. Any ideas on how to fix this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
