Actually, there is no error logged at all; however that kind of log ending (\u0022crash\u0022 with the stacktrace) is what I am used to find when KSP uses more memory than the OS can provide (normally would bring a \u0022Out of memory error\u0022). Anyway, you sure have a large number of add-ons installed, your issue is therefore almost certainly different than CheckYoStaging\u0027s. Can notice you have 2 different ModuleManager versions installed (2.5 and 2.7.4), only the latter gets loaded (as designed) still you may wish to delete the first, is useless and only delays loading. Another problem I\u0027m finding is with TweakScale, at least that is the add-on I believe can produce that spam of \u0022BoxColliders does not support negative scale or size.\u0022 messages towards the end of the log. I am unable currently to check each single one of the add-ons you have to see if the crash can be reproduced (also, would require to know better what happened before the crash, it may be related to a specific situation with your savegame and actions done; therefore best if you could also show those (we call those \u0022reproduction steps\u0022 in testing parlance)). If you can isolate a specific situation that always brings to the crash, the next step would be to retry without one or more of the add-ons to see if the situation changes. That way you should be able to find what add-on (or combination of) produces the crash, if that\u0027s related to just one or more. In general, a \u0022Object reference...\u0022 kind of error can easily be due to one or more add-ons managing the same data, each unaware of the operations done by the other (or even by stock KSP) if they don\u0027t check for object existence; therefore I consider highly possible you\u0027ll find what causes the error testing that way. Should you end with a situation without add-ons installed and still the error shows, then please provide again output_log, savegame, reproduction steps and even system specifics (possibly, all that is listed in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83213-stock-support-bug-reporting-guide/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ethis help thread\u003C/a\u003E).
