But if I switch on the ore converter to generate liquid fuel while the engines are running then one engine starts running at a lower thrust. I noticed this in a slightly modded install, so I quickly threw together a very simple test craft in a stock install. I confess to adding in hyper-edit to save me the time of actually launching and getting up to the asteroid. \n\nThis is the test craft running it\u0027s engines while also producing liquid fuel. Note the flame on one engine is very much smaller. (in the second pic you can see on the context menu it\u0027s output is only about 8kN, should be 60kN.)\n\n[![vCXGhGUl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/vCXGhGUl.jpg)](http://imgur.com/vCXGhGU)[![YavfVLul.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/YavfVLul.jpg)](http://imgur.com/YavfVLu)\n\nThe test craft has a central tank and 3 radial tanks which the engines are mounted to and fuel lines running from the central tank to the 3 radial.\n\n- If the fuel is all in the central tank, then running the liquid converter doesn\u0027t seem to cause a problem, but if I move the fuel to be evenly distributed in the 3 radial tanks and then run the converter then one of the engines will run at a lower thrust.\n\nHere is a save file with the test craft docked with an asteroid. It is setup so there is no fuel in the central tank and about 85l of liquid in each radial tank. All converters are switched off.\n\n- Hit Z to start running the engines at full thrust =\u003E all engines work at full thrust as expected.\n\n- switch on either the liquid or liquid\u002Box converter and one of the engines will drop to about 8kN thrust\n\n- switch converter off and all engines will fire at full thrust again.\n\n(the craft is not particularly well docked so it will spin when at full thrust, so I recommend putting the camera into locked mode)\n\n[QuickSave file](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9436261/bug%20testers/quicksave.sfs)\n\n[craft file](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9436261/bug%20testers/MiningBugTest.craft)\n\nI have seen this before, a long time ago when playing with Kethane. Exactly the same thing happened when running the kethane converters while the engines where on power. This was ages ago, like back in 0.18."},{"CreatedByName":"martinborgen","CreatedById":142875,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T12:46:52Z","Content":"Yes, I\u0027ve noticed this as well."},{"CreatedByName":"Weedlepickles","CreatedById":144922,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T20:55:53Z","Content":"I had just the same bug! It might be that the engines take fuel from the small tanks while they are evenly filling up from the generator causing some sort of trouble?\n\nI had 2 Nerv-engines on my craft, one on each side with the generator in the middle. An interesting effect I found was that if you used the thrust delimiter on the engine that worked fine the other (the faulty one) would get even lower output, suggesting that it\u0027s not necessarily that the generated fuel just goes to one engine and not the other."},{"CreatedByName":"hazarada","CreatedById":72036,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T01:33:39Z","Content":"This keep happening over and over on one of my crafts.

(and instructions on how to replicate) \n\nSingle engine craft don\u0027t seem to suffer this issue, seems to affect craft with radial mounted engines (possibly its the radially mounted fuel tanks that are the issue). What I found with the test craft in my thread is that if all the fuel is moved into the central tank then the problem doesn\u0027t occur, but if there is fuel in the radial tanks then running the converter will cause one engine to have a much lower thrust than the others. I have also seen setups where 2 out of 3 engines produce lower thrust."},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T14:34:42Z","Content":"Right, so the engine is being deprived of fuel even though there is lots available.
