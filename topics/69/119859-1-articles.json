All 64 bit does is allow the game to use more than 4 GB of RAM before crashing. If you have 4 GB or less of RAM, it won\u0027t make any difference. Although KSP version 1.1 will also be upgrading to Unity 5, which has a much more stable 64 bit version than Unity 4, which KSP currently uses. The instability of the 64 bit versions of Unity 4 is why there has never been a 64 bit version of KSP released for Mac, and is also why the Windows 64 bit version was discontinued. The Linux 64 bit version just happens to work because code is generally simpler on Linux, and so is less likely to bug out. But KSP version 1.1 should work with 64 bit for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Other features of Unity 5 will (hopefully) noticeably improve KSP\u0027s performance in 1.1 but 64 bit shouldn\u0027t noticeably affect performance by itself.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-01T02:24:55Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2015 02:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheMoonRover\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
