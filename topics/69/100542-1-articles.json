I\u0027ve been playing since 0.25 and he just downloaded 0.90 (which is what i\u0027m obviously now running as well). \n\nI don\u0027t have any of the facility limitations that he does. He can\u0027t build very heavy rockets because his launchpad won\u0027t support it. Things like that. His Space Center is almost completely empty and he has to upgrade everything. I know upgrading the facility is part of the 0.90 release, but why don\u0027t i have to do it? Was i \u0022grandfathered\u0022 in or something like that? \n\nI\u0027m thinking about starting a new game so i have to do that as well, just thought i\u0027d ask what you guys thought. Thanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T18:58:26Z","Content":"Either you\u0027re playing using the 64bit Windows executable, where there\u0027s a bug that leaves you with what look like upgraded buildings but no way to actually upgrade them, or you\u0027re still in sandbox and he\u0027s in career ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nMake sure you\u0027re starting the KSP.exe, not KSP\\_x64.exe, and your facility will also start at level 1 with a new career save."},{"CreatedByName":"jmullin09","CreatedById":137734,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T20:14:50Z","Content":"I just ran home at lunch and started a new career save just like my buddy did and i too have a meager little space station. So i\u0027m guessing that they didn\u0027t retroactively make people that had already progressed in career mode start from scratch once upgradeable buildings were introduced. Makes sense, especially with the weight limit on the launch pad! I wouldn\u0027t be able to even think about launching my Mun explorer on a launchpad that can\u0027t support a toothpick and a stiff breeze. It\u0027ll be fun to start over, especially knowing what i know now about the game. And it\u0027ll be easier to help my buddy since i had no clue what he was talking about when he was building rockets too heavy for his launchpad. \n\nIt would be funny if they built something into the actual release that made everyone start over. Like a nuclear event or something. Thanks for your input!"}]}
