The second stage\u0027s engine is encased within a fairing attatched to the top of the first stage, acting as an interstage, and closing at the bottom of the second stage\u0027s fuel tank. When I first close the fairing after building it and launch the rocket, the two stages separate flawlessly. But upon loading the rocket up for a second time as a subassembly,\u00A0the two stages won\u0027t separate as the fairing is holding them together, locking the second stage\u0027s engine with an invisible force within the interstage fairing. The two stages are both separate spacecraft at this point, but they still remain connected by the fairing. If I were to timewarp and clip through the fairing, it will warp the upper half of the rocket back to its place within the fairing and destroy it instantly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere are some pictures to help visualize my issue...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond stage engine housed inside interstage fairing of the first stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022unknown.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002281.58\u0022 height=\u0022381\u0022 width=\u0022467\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/346894843869528066/716538006042968124/unknown.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst time loaded, they separate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022unknown.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022114.04\u0022 height=\u0022585\u0022 width=\u0022513\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/346894843869528066/716539649203634188/unknown.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Added as a subassembly to a payload) The bottom stage is now a separate craft and is separated, but they remain stuck together by the fairing in the middle. The only way to break the link would be deploying the fairing, but the first stage has no probe core, so that is impossible.
