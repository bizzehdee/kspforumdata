The parts/action groups/crew tabs are greyed out and the only buttons I can click on are the new/load/save/launch/exit buttons. It appears to be some sort of mode. How do I get rid of it? Restarting the game did no good, and neither did exiting and reentering the VAB. Also, how did I get into it in the first place?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RA3236","CreatedById":150734,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-20T13:19:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay... Ummm.... Standard procedure, I suppose. Logs, e.t.c. Try pressing buttons one at a time, maybe f2 since I frankly have no idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
