It worked fine so i added a couple things and sent one to vall and it worked fine. I took a break for a while and when i came back i checked on the rover. When i hit W the rover accelerated and veered to the side. It was strange and I tested the same rover blueprint on kerbin and it still had a problem. Was it design or a bug? I haven\u0027t seen anything about it and i was hoping someone else could give me some insight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qzgy","CreatedById":160994,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-22T02:40:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you post screen shots of the rover?

Now this tends to be only a few degrees (5-15 at most at an extreme) and after the wheels gain traction they tend to resume normal control. Now with KSP\u0027s 1.1 they likely included that aspect of traction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
