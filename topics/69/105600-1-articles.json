As a bonus, it also uses an unused bit in DDS flags to keep certain textures readable.\n\n[https://github.com/ducakar/TextureReplacer/blob/e8e9ab024517f612247d2079959fe0d5e5438fac/TextureReplacer/DDS.cs](https://github.com/ducakar/TextureReplacer/blob/e8e9ab024517f612247d2079959fe0d5e5438fac/TextureReplacer/DDS.cs)"}]}
