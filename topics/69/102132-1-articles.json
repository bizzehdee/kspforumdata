I\u0027ve seen address-space pressure cause basically the same failure modes you\u0027re describing across a couple of different versions of KSP and OS X. There are enough bugs open on the tracker for apparent leaks that opening another one probably won\u0027t add any useful information.\n\nThe kinds of memory leaks that affect .NET applications like Unity are hard to debug. The system garbage collector doesn\u0027t allow unreachable memory to remain allocated (usually; there are a few lower-level bugs where garbage collecting a managed object fails to deallocate an unmanaged allocation that it uses). The more common type of leak is one where an object remains reachable somewhere even after the programmer is no longer interested in it. Automated analysis tools can\u0027t tell whether you\u0027ve leaked that memory or just haven\u0027t run the code you were saving it for. And when the crash happens, the stack trace tells you only what was trying to allocate memory when you ran out. You\u0027re on your own to figure out what code should have disposed of something to prevent the crash.\n\n1.0 probably won\u0027t be the end of memory leaks, but I do hope to see some incremental improvements."},{"CreatedByName":"xerogravity","CreatedById":138388,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T16:10:27Z","Content":"I used to run the Boulder Co clouds etc but am now down to just NavyFish Docking Alignment as my only mod.

The closest I could some would be the (made up) \u0022It has been noticed that Mac users usually buy Macs with small amounts of RAM (less than 4GB),and then there\u0027s not enough for KSP, causing some of KSP\u0027s memory to be swapped to disk, i.e., virtual memory is used, leading to awful performance, but no visual glitches or crashes or bugs like you just described.\u0022 That\u0027s also not true (particularly in this case where 16GB was reported), nor related to symptoms in rendering, but it would make sense if it were.\n\nAnyway, one way for xerogravity to check if s/he is on to something is to observe memory consumption over time especially when returning to known states, e.g., back to the Space Center with the same number of craft/parts in flight or none. If memory is indeed leaking, then consumption will trend up over time even in these steady-state situations. But, I don\u0027t think it would be worth the headache: what would you do with that information, tell Squad the OS X build is broken? \n\nMemory leaks don\u0027t directly cause problems other than out-of-memory crashes (they can indirectly cause all sorts of other problems, e.g., poor performance with certain GC algorithms that tend to thrash when memory pressure is high.) The symptoms xerogravity saw presenting are indicative of programming errors, bugs in texture handling most likely, not poor reference management. Though, in theory they could be bugs whose symptoms are triggered by other bugs that are technically memory leaks. \n\nxerogravity: the forums seem to say 0.90 on OS X is a very mixed bag and far less stable for many of the folks reporting than previous versions, e.g., the thread I started related to this: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113514-Which-Operating-System-for-0-90-on-Apple-Hardware](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113514-Which-Operating-System-for-0-90-on-Apple-Hardware) -- though I didn\u0027t call out all the symptoms you saw, I have seen them all and much more on OS X with 0.90; the last 0.24.x builds were the Rock of Gibraltar by comparison."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T14:13:12Z","Content":"Heh, [Macs using a lot of Ram is common](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=mac\u002Busing\u002Btoo\u002Bmuch\u002Bram\u0026t=canonical), apparently this is normal and \u0022unused ram is wasted\u0022 ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nSeveral Mac users I know are finding 4 to 6 gigs of their Ram are in use even immediately after boot and with no programs open, and on an 8gig system that isn\u0027t leaving KSP with as much, especially if you have Safari or other programs running.\n\nYes KSP and the Unity3D game engine will load assets and keep them in memory, these are freed on scene change but the PQS terrain system is known to allocate a larger cache than there is memory available, but rather than being a \u0022[**memory leak**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_leak)\u0022 this is a bounds checking issue.\n\nThere\u0027s no fix for this at this time, the only workarounds are to reduce memory usage overall with texture management addons, the 1.0 release should improve the situation though if Squad take note of community feedback.\n\nAlso, KSP on OSX has some issues with graphics which may explain the grey grid xerogravity reports, these are usually caused by anti-aliasing and the PPFX edge detection graphics feature, neither of which are working properly in Unity on OSX and are disabled by default on OSX for this reason."},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T16:41:58Z","Content":"First, \u0022free memory\u0022 is an ambiguous term, especially when we\u0027re comparing different operating systems. In many systems, the amount of memory a process uses is not even a well-defined quantity, because memory regions may be shared between processes.\n\nHere is an overview of the memory usage of my two Macs (8 GB MacBook Pro and 16 GB iMac) under a fairly typical workload in OS X 10.10:\n\n[table]\n\n[tr]\n\n [td][/td]\n\n [td]MacBook Pro[/td]\n\n [td]iMac[/td]\n\n [td]iMac with KSP[/td]\n\n[/tr]\n\n[tr]\n\n [td]App Memory[/td]\n\n [td]3.81 GB[/td]\n\n [td]4.17 GB[/td]\n\n [td]6.70 GB[/td]\n\n[/tr]\n\n[tr]\n\n [td]File Cache[/td]\n\n [td]990 MB[/td]\n\n [td]3.24 GB[/td]\n\n [td]5.17 GB[/td]\n\n[/tr]\n\n[tr]\n\n [td]Wired Memory[/td]\n\n [td]1.22 GB[/td]\n\n [td]1.28 GB[/td]\n\n [td]1.29 GB[/td]\n\n[/tr]\n\n[/table]\n\nThe workload is the same for both computers. App Memory means memory used by user-level processes, while Wired Memory is used by kernel processes. File Cache is essentially free memory: recently opened files that are kept in memory, because there is no better use for the memory at the moment. These figures are based on the figures reported by Activity Monitor; top reports about 1 GB less. I\u0027m not even sure what causes the difference.\n\nThere is definitely something strange going on with the memory usage of KSP in OS X 10.10. The last column is the iMac with a newly started unmodded KSP sandbox in empty VAB. KSP uses 2.45 GB of memory, which is a lot more than it used to be. If I put a Mk1 command pod on the launchpad and revert to VAB, memory usage increases to 2.50 GB. I repeat the same a few times with a few different command pods, and the memory usage increases to 2.57 GB. After doing the same with Kerbal X and Learstar A1, memory usage in empty VAB increases to 2.71 GB. After a few more stock crafts, the memory usage is at 2.76 GB. After doing the same with a newly-built 41-part rocket using parts not in the stock crafts, memory usage is at 2.90 GB. Then I fly a mission with the rocket, recover the pod, and return to VAB, and the memory usage has increased to 2.95 GB. I clear the VAB, and the infamous disco effects start.\n\nThe same also occurs with anti-aliasing off (it has been at the default 2x setting since I originally installed KSP 0.22 on this Mac). At the end of a similar sequence, the memory usage in empty VAB is 2.77 GB. After deliberately using as many different parts as possible and reverting to VAB, I finally got the memory usage over 2.95 GB, starting the disco effects.\n\nIt doesn\u0027t look like a memory leak to me. More likely, the game caches the assets that have been used, in addition to loading them at startup. The more parts there are, the higher the initial memory usage becomes. The more parts you use in a single session, the higher the memory usage grows.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-22T18:42:35Z\u0022 title=\u002203/22/2015 06:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jouni**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T23:35:11Z","Content":"Random observation: 32-bit processes can\u0027t use the full 4 GB in Yosemite. I tried allocating memory in 1 MB blocks, and the allocations started to fail soon after 3500 MB (around 3.42 GB). Apparently the rest of address space is reserved for something else. Kernel-related stuff and GPU memory are my best guesses. Incidentally, the GPU of my iMac has 1 GB of memory, and KSP starts behaving badly when memory usage approaches 3 GB. A similar limit may have existed before, or it may have been introduced in Yosemite, or even in some GPU drivers shipped with Yosemite.\n\nIt seems that there are a number of reasons why KSP 0.90 and OS X 10.10 are such a bad combination:\n\n1. KSP both preloads all assets on startup, and caches a second copy of the assets that have actually been used. This may either be intentional or a bug, and the bug can be general or Mac-specific.\n2.

Apparently OS X always reserves around 0.5 GB of address space for shared libraries, leaving only 3.5 GB writable virtual memory for a 32-bit process. My test program was able to use 3.4 GB of that, so it worked as it should. KSP, on the other hand, allocated only 2.8-2.9 GB of virtual memory, leaving a large unmapped region at the end of the address space. As it uses around 200 MB of shared libraries, KSP ran out of memory when its memory usage approached 3 GB.\n\nThis has probably something to do with the fact that KSP runs in a virtual machine. Perhaps Mono sets the heap limit lower in OS X 10.10 than in earlier OS X versions. If someone using an earlier version of OS X could run \u0022vmmap -resident KSP\u0022 when KSP is running, and post the end of the output similar to the following, it might help understanding the situation.\n\n    ==== Summary for process 1586ReadOnly portion of Libraries: Total=205.3M resident=118.8M(58%) swapped_out_or_unallocated=86.5M(42%)Writable regions: Total=2.9G written=2.2G(73%) resident=2.3G(80%) swapped_out=261.5M(9%) unallocated=616.6M(20%)REGION TYPE                      VIRTUAL RESIDENT===========                      ======= ========CG backing stores                  7188K    7188KCG image                             40K      40KCG raster data                     14.8M    14.8MCG shared images                    336K      96KCoreAnimation                        16K      16KCoreUI image data                    84K      84KFoundation                            4K       4KIOKit                             510.3M   358.0MKernel Alloc Once                     4K       4KMALLOC                              1.9G     1.5G        see MALLOC ZONE table belowMALLOC (admin)                       64K      16KMALLOC freed, no zone              2768K    2736KMALLOC_LARGE                       3720K    3680KMALLOC_LARGE (reserved)             912K       0K        reserved VM address space (unallocated)Memory Tag 242                       12K      12KOpenCL                               16K      16KOpenGL GLSL                         128K      76KSTACK GUARD                        56.1M       0KStack                              23.8M     560KVM_ALLOCATE                       549.1M   477.1MVM_ALLOCATE (freed)                  12K       8KVM_ALLOCATE (reserved)               40K       0K        reserved VM address space (unallocated)__DATA                             9204K    5512K__GLSLBUILTINS                     2588K     412K__IMAGE                             528K       0K__LINKEDIT                         49.4M    11.9M__OBJC                             2488K    2144K__TEXT                            155.9M   106.9M__UNICODE                           544K     256Kmapped file                        68.2M    17.9Mshared memory                        68K       8K===========                      ======= ========TOTAL                               3.3G     2.5GTOTAL, minus reserved VM space      3.3G     2.5G                                   VIRTUAL   RESIDENT ALLOCATION      BYTESMALLOC ZONE                           SIZE       SIZE      COUNT  ALLOCATED  % FULL===========                        =======  =========  =========  =========  ======GFXMallocZone_0x15e9000               1.1G     893.6M      38306       1.1G     94%DefaultMallocZone_0x15cb000         724.6M     641.3M     427680     668.1M     92%DispatchContinuations_0x15f8000      8192K       116K        107         7K      0%CoreGraphics_0x3800c00                244K       232K        665        15K      6%QuartzCore_0x182dc00                   76K        76K        508        16K     20%===========                        =======  =========  =========  =========  ======TOTAL                                 1.9G       1.5G     467266       1.7G     93%"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T15:16:44Z","Content":"I continued abusing KSP until it crashed.

Either none of the remaining regions of contiguous address space is large enough, or OS X just refuses to allocate address space from the remaining regions.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ==== Summary for process 13161  \n\u003E ReadOnly portion of Libraries: Total=200.8M resident=163.5M(81%) swapped\\_out\\_or\\_unallocated=37.3M(19%)  \n\u003E Writable regions: Total=3.2G written=56.8M(2%) resident=3.0G(93%) swapped\\_out=0K(0%) unallocated=242.7M(7%)  \n\u003E   \n\u003E REGION TYPE VIRTUAL RESIDENT  \n\u003E =========== ======= ========  \n\u003E CG backing stores 9044K 9044K  \n\u003E CG image 12K 12K  \n\u003E CG shared images 336K 100K  \n\u003E CoreServices 468K 468K  \n\u003E CoreUI image data 64K 64K  \n\u003E IOKit 637.8M 582.4M  \n\u003E Kernel Alloc Once 4K 4K  \n\u003E MALLOC 1.9G 1.8G see MALLOC ZONE table below  \n\u003E MALLOC (admin) 64K 16K  \n\u003E MALLOC freed, no zone 7132K 7060K  \n\u003E MALLOC\\_LARGE (reserved) 912K 0K reserved VM address space (unallocated)  \n\u003E Memory Tag 242 12K 12K  \n\u003E OpenCL 16K 16K  \n\u003E OpenGL GLSL 128K 76K  \n\u003E STACK GUARD 56.1M 0K  \n\u003E Stack 23.3M 576K  \n\u003E VM\\_ALLOCATE 763.4M 649.4M  \n\u003E VM\\_ALLOCATE (freed) 16K 16K  \n\u003E VM\\_ALLOCATE (reserved) 40K 0K reserved VM address space (unallocated)  \n\u003E \\_\\_DATA 9120K 6436K  \n\u003E \\_\\_GLSLBUILTINS 2588K 708K  \n\u003E \\_\\_IMAGE 528K 124K  \n\u003E \\_\\_LINKEDIT 48.4M 15.3M  \n\u003E \\_\\_OBJC 2488K 2452K  \n\u003E \\_\\_TEXT 152.3M 148.2M  \n\u003E \\_\\_UNICODE 544K 484K  \n\u003E mapped file 69.1M 27.0M  \n\u003E shared memory 132K 112K  \n\u003E =========== ======= ========  \n\u003E TOTAL 3.7G 3.2G  \n\u003E TOTAL, minus reserved VM space 3.7G 3.2G  \n\u003E   \n\u003E   \n\u003E  VIRTUAL RESIDENT ALLOCATION BYTES  \n\u003E MALLOC ZONE SIZE SIZE COUNT ALLOCATED % FULL  \n\u003E =========== ======= ========= ========= ========= ======  \n\u003E GFXMallocZone\\_0x15e9000 1.1G 1.1G 56719 1.1G 95%  \n\u003E DefaultMallocZone\\_0x15cb000 804.3M 724.2M 984987 741.3M 92%  \n\u003E DispatchContinuations\\_0x15f8000 8192K 108K 112 7K 0%  \n\u003E CoreGraphics\\_0x400a000 152K 144K 660 15K 9%  \n\u003E QuartzCore\\_0x182ce00 16K 16K 2 112 0%  \n\u003E =========== ======= ========= ========= ========= ======  \n\u003E TOTAL 1.9G 1.8G 1042480 1.8G 93%\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nThere are three kinds of memory regions that kept growing, as I used different parts and moved between VAB and the launchpad:\n\n1. IOKit, which means stuff related to device drivers. This suggests that there could be a problem in some GPU drivers shipped with Yosemite.\n2. MALLOC, and specifically DefaultMallocZone. The region does not really grow, but it keeps fragmenting due to a large number of small memory allocations.\n3. VM\\_ALLOCATE, which I guess is the memory managed directly by Mono without using malloc(). This could be a result of the game caching the assets that are currently in use, but not releasing them when they\u0027re no longer needed.\n\n**Edit:** There is also \u0022GL: Detected 0 MB VRAM\u0022 near the beginning of Player.log, which suggests a Unity/GPU driver issue.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-23T15:30:10Z\u0022 title=\u002203/23/2015 03:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jouni**"},{"CreatedByName":"Yakky","CreatedById":94432,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T22:49:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hi xerogravity ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E It has been noticed that Macs use a lot of RAM even when idle, so there is not much RAM for KSP, this causes KSP assets to be cached and they may not be retrieved properly.\n\u003E \n\u003E Anything you can do to reduce your RAM use may help, such as shutting down unused applications, also please see the stickies and provide your logs.\n\nFWIW I run KSP on a Mac with 32 gigs of physical RAM and still have these problems, so I don\u0027t think the main culprit is a memory paging or swapping issue, although it\u0027s possible that it could compound other problems."},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T00:55:41Z","Content":"That\u0027s a good start.\n\nWhat ways did you abuse KSP?

It would really help to have a reasonably reliable method of intentionally causing that crash, not just waiting until it does.\n\nThe easiest way is to build a craft with as many different parts as possible, put it on the launchpad, and revert to VAB. After reverting, the game uses more memory in VAB than before. If that doesn\u0027t raise memory usage high enough to cause disco lights or other graphics glitches, repeat the same with parts you haven\u0027t used already.\n\nReusing the parts you have already used doesn\u0027t seem to affect memory usage that much. I\u0027d guess that either the game caches a second copy of the assets that have been used, or there is a weirder than usual memory management issue. If you\u0027re using stock parts with low graphics settings, you may run out of parts before memory usage grows high enough. In that case, you may try observing different planets at various distances to increase memory usage. It\u0027s helpful to return to VAB afterwards, as the game seems to use more memory in VAB than during flight."},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T01:23:37Z","Content":"Thanks!\n\nI\u0027ll give those approaches a deeper look Soon^TM^.
