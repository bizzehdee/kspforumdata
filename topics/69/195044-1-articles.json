A couple of days ago\u00A0while I was playing ksp I got a frown face blue screen on my computer, so I had to restart it. Once it had restarted I tried to launch the game and for a couple of seconds I would see this dialogue https://imgur.com/a/MfSbFJq\u00A0and the game wouldn\u0027t launch. It has done the same thing since then.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have tried reinstalling the game(deleting every KSP file at the steam\u00A0directory before reintalling), reinstalling steam as a whole, restarting my computer, verifing the integrity of my files and reinstalling windows\u00A0without any success.

Unfortunately when I looked at the power settings suggested in the article they were already set to max performance (both plugged in and out). As I said I already updated my driver and I actually have my wireless disabled so I don\u0027t think it would be that. I have previuosly seen this driver_Power_state error when using Nvidea\u0027s raytracing render engine Iray, which I belived to be caused by the program to try to overload the VRAM when using large texture assets (as the engine loads all assets into vram unlike msot which can use system RAM), and this causing the gpu driver to get upset \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E. I think it can be range of driver related issues; according to other posts online this error is also often caused with a new driver install, and thus before I saw your post I tried someting else:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI downloaded the previous driver for my 1050 off Nvidea\u0027s website and doing a clean install of that (uninstalling the card driver using device manager, updating devices in the manager and then installing the driver from the downloaded file selecting custom install and clean install tickbox) and this seems to have at least mitigated the problem. I haven\u0027t yet had another BSOD whilst trying to run kerbal, and after about 10-15 mins of intermittent \u0022not responding\u0022 from KSP I actually managed to get to the Main menu which I hadn\u0027t done before.

I know the KSP update\u0027s coming very soon so maybe this might fix it if we\u0027re lucky, though i won\u0027t hold out hope. I think I ought to report this as a bug to Nvidea although I\u0027m not really sure whose end this problem is on (I have always suffered from slow load times which may have been caused by a Unity bug as I understand from common issues page so maybe this is related?).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nanyway sorry for wall of text but here is a list of what I am doing at the moment if it might help others:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E1) updated to windows 2004\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E2) done a clean KSP install after deleting all files manually as well a uninstall from steam, and disabling cloud sync\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E3) using\u003C/strong\u003E \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003E-force-glcore\u0022 in launch options\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E4) initially updated graphics driver BUT THEN uninstalled and then reinstalled and\u00A0 older driver (446.14\u00A0 notebook for my gtx 1050, dont know what \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.
