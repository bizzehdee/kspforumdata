In case of the telescope mod yeah i remeber doing that good spot, but the mod is still on there because i love telecopes...but if i were to accept a mission and the agent tied into that mission was in fact a mod agent and i deleted that mod would it still have the same effect? Mod is Dmagic it was for orbital sciencey stuff...so if i were to change the parameter instead of that mod agent maybe change it to a stock ksp agent?Advice please..\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-02T22:40:27Z\u0022 title=\u002203/02/2015 10:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mindog101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fireblade274","CreatedById":134571,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T08:56:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eok now i figured it out, here is persistence file \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/n09fmnup907fbxx/persistent.sfs?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/n09fmnup907fbxx/persistent.sfs?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also put in my Dxdiag file \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/rb6n2keu8u6163l/DxDiag.txt?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/rb6n2keu8u6163l/DxDiag.txt?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eagain I already \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003Echecked from the progress, contract, and roster sections, and all the crew names in the progress and contract groups showed up in the roster.
