That root part may not be the part with the \u0027free\u0027 node you want to use. And if that root part has no free nodes of its own and is not surface-attachable, you won\u0027t be able to attach it rightaway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo just click in the air to \u0027park\u0027 that ship a moment. 1.1 introduced the ability to re-root unattached assemblies. Use this to your advantage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUse the Root gizmo on the unconnected ship, to select the part you want to connect with. This can be one with an actual free node (eg a docking port or the open end of a tank, etc), or a part that can be surface attached. Basically you force the game to redo the part structure so it becomes a proper subassembly with the part you want to connect with as root. Now try and place it and you\u0027ll see it\u0027ll work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWord of warning though: the game will have very odd ideas sometimes about the orientation, so don\u0027t be too surprised if it looks like it\u0027s attaching all wrong. Sometimes it\u0027s pretty darn impossible to convince it to attach \u0027right\u0027, but if you ignore it and place it anyway when it turns green, you should be able to move it in the right position with the rotate/offset gizmos.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the part you want to be root is somehow already the root of that ship, just make a random other part root first, then back to the one you actually want. Sometimes the game needs to be forced to \u0027redo\u0027 the root for it to work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBarring all that, pics and/or craft/save files if it\u0027s still not working and you want more help, otherwise it\u0027s just blind guesswork.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JMBuilder","CreatedById":30493,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-09T23:00:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBINGO!
