The other buttons remain functional.\n\nChecking the Debug Log, I found a NullReferenceException the first time, but no NullReferenceExceptions the second time. However, the debug bar told me that an input lock called \u0022R\u0026D\u0022 was on. **Clicking \u0022Clear Input Lock Stack\u0022** removed this lock and allowed me to press \u0022escape\u0022 and use the Pause Menu to return to the title screen, from which I was able to resume playing.\n\n...So if anyone knows what causes this, commentary is welcome, and if anyone else has encountered this issue, try what I did and let us know if it works or not."}]}
