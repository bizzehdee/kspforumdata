The issue persists after I uninstall all my mods. It\u0027s also a very odd issue.\n\nI understand that if a workaround exists (as it does here) then I should use it, and I will, but I also figure that a 100% reproducible BSoD is kind of a big deal, regardless of cause.\n\nStep 1: Launch KSP\n\nStep 2: Plug in a [Logitech HD C310 Webcam](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-960-000585-HD-Webcam-C310/dp/B003LVZO8S).\n\nStep 3: Bluescreen! Yaaaaaay!\n\nHere\u0027s the bluescreen information I pulled from BlueScreenView:\n\n    ==================================================Dump File         : 081015-9250-01.dmpCrash Time        : 8/10/2015 3:40:17 PMBug Check String  : SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTIONBug Check Code    : 0x0000003bParameter 1       : 00000000\u0060c0000005Parameter 2       : fffff880\u00600481a7b3Parameter 3       : fffff880\u00600dfea250Parameter 4       : 00000000\u006000000000Caused By Driver  : ks.sysCaused By Address : ks.sys\u002B1a7b3File Description  : Product Name      : Company           : File Version      : Processor         : x64Crash Address     : ntoskrnl.exe\u002B748c0Stack Address 1   : Stack Address 2   : Stack Address 3   : Computer Name     : Full Path         : C:\\Windows\\Minidump\\081015-9250-01.dmpProcessors Count  : 4Major Version     : 15Minor Version     : 7601Dump File Size    : 372,776Dump File Time    : 8/10/2015 3:41:03 PM==================================================\n\n...Yeah. This probably isn\u0027t your fault, but it does only occur with KSP loaded. Trying it with Cities: Skylines does not produce a blue screen.\n\nNow, the game starts up just fine with the webcam plugged in, but the issue is that it\u0027s plugged into my monitor\u0027s USB hub. When I turn the screen off and then on again, the computer bluescreens.\n\nHere\u0027s a link to my DxDiag information. [http://pastebin.com/u1N93ZQ1](http://pastebin.com/u1N93ZQ1)\n\nAnd here\u0027s a link to the minidump.

However, I don\u0027t want to do that because I\u0027m lazy. Aside from unplugging the webcam, do you have any idea what I can do about this issue?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-10T20:11:06Z\u0022 title=\u002208/10/2015 08:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Inglonias**\n  \nAdded a minidump."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T11:06:14Z","Content":"Sorry no, aside from completely reinstalling Windows, I don\u0027t know what is causing your issue but a blue screen is indicative of *serious problems* with your operating system.\n\nThe minidump tells me nothing however it\u0027s a \u0022system\\_service\\_exception\u0022.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E STOP Error 0x0000003B: SYSTEM\\_SERVICE\\_EXCEPTION\n\u003E STOP error 0x3B means that an exception happened while executing a routine that transitions from non-privileged code to privileged code.
