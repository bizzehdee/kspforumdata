Anyways, I played around with a fresh install of ubuntu and without having the nvidia drivers installed CPU-load seems to be fine (all cores between 10% and 40% viewing the space center, flying small things...), although the game is slow due to the weak intel graphics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo test, i installed the nvidia drivers with nvidia-prime: Game runs faster now but the high CPU loads are back (At least one core constantly \u0026gt;70%, fan speeds go to max... and that only viewing the space center). So there definitely seems to be an issue with the nvidia drivers, and its not PPFX. :/ I hope 1.0.3 will be fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T18:21:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm, well maybe whatever is causing it is in the logs, can you please upload your KSP.log and Player.log to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://hastebin.com\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHastebin\u003C/a\u003E for me \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kmarti","CreatedById":137101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T02:13:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHmm, well maybe whatever is causing it is in the logs, can you please upload your KSP.log and Player.log to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://hastebin.com\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHastebin\u003C/a\u003E for me \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealright, here we go:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERunning via Intel Graphics:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://hastebin.com/tuwosatude.vbs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://hastebin.com/tuwosatude.vbs\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECPU loads: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FAiw2ff.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/FAiw2ff.png\u003C/a\u003E (sorry for the orange hue)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERunning via Nvidia Graphics:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://hastebin.com/isuludekiz.vbs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://hastebin.com/isuludekiz.vbs\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECPU loads: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oDP8i5p.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/oDP8i5p.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kmarti","CreatedById":137101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T00:47:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kmarti\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kmarti\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ealright, here we go:\u003Cp\u003ERunning via Intel Graphics:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://hastebin.com/tuwosatude.vbs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://hastebin.com/tuwosatude.vbs\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECPU loads: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FAiw2ff.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/FAiw2ff.png\u003C/a\u003E (sorry for the orange hue)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERunning via Nvidia Graphics:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://hastebin.com/isuludekiz.vbs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://hastebin.com/isuludekiz.vbs\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECPU loads: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oDP8i5p.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/oDP8i5p.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow on 1.0.4 --\u0026gt; same thing happening \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jtaylor996","CreatedById":82966,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T17:59:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1.0.4 is completely unplayable for me.
