I have now managed to launch but I thought I\u0027d report the glitch anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d built a v simple rocket when all the building where tier 1 and it was able to launch just fine. I then purchased the upgrade launch pad. I didn\u0027t use it right away as I still have a mission in progress. I went back to that mission and landed the craft. that was all yesterday.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo today I come to launch again, using the exact same rocket but on the new launch pad. The craft just would not lift off. I tried reverting to launch (several times), quicksaving and loading, and returning to the VAB and moving the rocket about before trying to launch again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a pic of the craft on the pad, note the throttle is full and you can see exhaust from the glowing red engine;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/V9BjogW\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/V9BjogWl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022V9BjogWl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually I tried going into physics warp. The second I hit 4x physics warp the craft jumped off the pad (and promptly exploded). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/Cf1aO50\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Cf1aO50l.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Cf1aO50l.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I tried that again and with a bit more care in controlling it I managed to take off and not die at 4x physics warp. wasn\u0027t the most ideal launch profile \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/nx8rgY9\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nx8rgY9m.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nx8rgY9m.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was just heading for a surface marker so I thought I\u0027d try and get there anyway. I didn\u0027t make it, but when I next reverted to launch suddenly it was working fine and the craft took off as expected. The issue lasted for quite a while, 15-20 mins of not being able to launch, or only launch in physics warp. Then suddenly it was fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, no idea what caused this and I can\u0027t replicate it. Nothing I tried seem to fix it, it just fixed itself (didn\u0027t restart the game or exit to menu either)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy guess is there was a collision mesh issue which is why physics warp \u0027jiggled\u0027 it free.
