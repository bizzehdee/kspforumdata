Using the same PC. Game runs fine except for any time I press any of the roll/pitch/yaw controls for more than a second the game locks up until I release the button. Using the keyboard by the way. If I rapidly press the buttons then it does not freeze, it works ok. I did notice when in flight anytime I press a control surface key the flame on the rocket cuts out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo mods\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eversion 0.90\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei7 3820 3.6ghz\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E16gb ram\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDual AMD HD 7900\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings I have tried:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Turning AMD crossfire on/off makes no difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESetting all graphic settings to their lowest makes no difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*********************UPDATE**********************\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I have narrowed down to the lag/freezing is caused by keyboard inputs. I have a X52 joystick and I binded the throttle keys to buttons on the joystick and it worked perfectly, no lag what so ever. Though it might be the keyboard, I have another one laying around so I tried the other keyboard but still had the same issue, so likely not the keyboards fault. After some fiddling around, I found out that if I change the keyboard settings for Repeat Delay and Repeat Rate to the slowest settings I don\u0027t get any lag/freezing. Not sure if anyone else has experienced this, still not sure why its causing the issue but that\u0027s what I did to get around it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-05T03:05:21Z\u0022 title=\u002202/05/2015 03:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tach_tech\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
