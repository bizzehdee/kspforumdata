I am travelling quite a bit and wonder if there is any way to have a dual installation? At home I want to use my higher specs machine but want to also be able to use it on laptop. I purchased windows version directly from KSP and just unxipped the file on my home computer but when I try to do the same on laptop (with the same file) it does not start.\n\nI understand that this need to be limited to keep piracy at bay but would really try to get this to work. Is it even possible? \n\nBR,\n\nMattias\n\nPS. At first startup I allowed the game to send info to developers from my computer so I guess they have my IP etc, is this what is blocking me now?"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T10:35:42Z","Content":"Hi pmattiasn, welcome to the forums ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nSquad don\u0027t use DRM on KSP, just unzip it to a folder that is not protected by Windows and it should work if your graphics drivers are okay.\n\nBy protected I mean any folder made by Windows, so Users, Desktop, Program Files are all \u0022protected\u0022 from running applications that aren\u0027t expressly installed and have registry entries.\n\nMake your own folder such as C:\\Games and unzip it there.\n\nIf it still doesn\u0027t work we\u0027ll need to find out why, the sticky threads here show you where to find your logs and how to upload them so we can see what\u0027s gone wrong ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
