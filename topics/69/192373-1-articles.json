It\u0027s an incentive to put some communications satellites up there, which you\u0027ll probably need to do for the Mun and Minmus too and definitely need to do for other planets.

It does exactly what it says in the name, and I think it works with planet packs too e.g. JNSQ or real solar system. Alternatively there\u0027s a resonant orbit option in MechJeb, or if you\u0027re absolutely against using any form of computer assistance, you can do it yourself:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1- Launch your payload into orbit. Works best with several satellites on one rocket, use the interstage nodes option on fairings to stack them up inside the same fairing and remember you\u0027ll need engines and\u00A0decouplers for each satellite; set the decouplers to minimum force to release the satellites gently.\u00A0The number of satellites is n; remember that for later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2- Once you\u0027re in orbit at the desired inclination, boost outwards until your apoapsis is at synchronous orbit height. This varies depending on what planet you\u0027re orbiting, but for stock Kerbin it\u0027s 2863.33km or so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3- When you reach apoapsis, burn prograde until your orbital period is n-1/n of 6 hours; for a set of 3 satellites, this would be 2/3 of 6 hours = 4 hours, for a set of 4, 3/4 = 4.5 hours, etc. Once complete, IMMEDIATELY release the first satellite and burn prograde until the orbital period reaches 6 hours exactly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4- Switch back to the deployment ship, go around one orbit until you reach apoapsis again. Deploy the second satellite and burn prograde until its orbital period is 6 hours.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5- Repeat until you run out of satellites, then point retrograde a bit before or after apoapsis and burn until you run out of fuel or periapsis goes below about 45km. If you run out of fuel, the rocket will be safely out of the way of your satellites, and if you get the periapsis down low enough it will hit the atmosphere and either burn up or deorbit. It\u0027s always a good idea to get rid of unwanted debris or spent rockets if you can, they can affect the game\u0027s performance if you let them build up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA number of planets and moons can have geostationary orbits, here\u0027s a simple guide:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=627744131\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=627744131\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MechBFP","CreatedById":184845,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-16T00:51:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223756028\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022192373\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221584112231\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022203293\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00222epicpanda\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/13/2020 at 9:10 AM, 2epicpanda said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDunno if im being dumb but i dont remember this ever happening before.
