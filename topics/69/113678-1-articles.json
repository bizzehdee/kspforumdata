CoL does not seem to change with deployed state. Seems to always affect CoL as if deployed. Subsequent airbrake installs do not affect CoL at all. Wierd...\n\nEdit: Further testing show it to be in the VAB only. SPH behavior seems normal.\n\nPics!\n\nSame craft in SPH and VAB\n\n![uc?export=download\u0026id=0B4zLBUio4kIndGlrdTFxTXdLTE0](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download\u0026id=0B4zLBUio4kIndGlrdTFxTXdLTE0)\n\n![uc?export=download\u0026id=0B4zLBUio4kIncDh6clFVbkRIdUk](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download\u0026id=0B4zLBUio4kIncDh6clFVbkRIdUk)\n\n![uc?export=download\u0026id=0B4zLBUio4kInb3BUTGM2TkJsSzQ](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download\u0026id=0B4zLBUio4kInb3BUTGM2TkJsSzQ)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-22T05:56:32Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2015 05:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by g00bd0g**"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T06:35:20Z","Content":"Well, the reason why it works this way is how the code is handling a lifting surface at zero Angle of Attack. Yes, the airbrake has a lifting coefficient associated with it. So in the VAB (where there is zero AoA), the CoL indicator is moved because the tail fins aren\u0027t creating enough lift to overwhelm the airbrake lift coefficient. In the SPH, it\u0027s different because the tail fins have enough oomph to override the zero-lift associated with the airbrakes.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"}]}
