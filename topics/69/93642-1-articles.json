The music will continue to play after the freeze. So far it hasnt actually crashed yet. There doesnt appear to be any crash log created. I tried 64 bit and it didnt freeze but after noticing the upgraded buildings bug im not sure I gave it enough time. If this happens in the VAB then its not a total lockup. Some buttons are still clickable and the flag is changeable on the craft. The center of mass button will still toggle the icon on the ship and the kerbals are still walking around the VAB floor. Windowed mode and changed graphics settings to minimum will also have the same issue. Totally lost on this one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T07:41:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi jwilly246,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you could please look at this thread: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92230-%21%21%21-PLEASE-READ-BEFORE-POSTING-%21%21%21-Stock-Support-Bug-Reporting-Guide\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92230-%21%21%21-PLEASE-READ-BEFORE-POSTING-%21%21%21-Stock-Support-Bug-Reporting-Guide\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will tell you how to find the output_log.txt even if KSP doesn\u0027t crash.

I was so focused on the crash log i overlooked the output log file. Last portion is it mentioning a hang up while trying to autosave. Which sounds about right now that I think about it.
