Now they have two stars and are two\u00A0points\u00A0short of the third.\u00A0When I look at their accomplishments I see they have flyby Kerbol (4pts) and not orbit Kerbol (6pts) like previous grand tourists, so I thought maybe I had not noticed an intercept on exit of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut then I saw one kerbal, picked up on Minmus\u0027 surface, who had not orbited Kerbin before being rescued. He also has\u00A0flyby Kerbin and not orbit Kerbin, but I know for a fact that their\u00A0craft\u00A0was\u00A0in a free and clear orbit of Kerbin out of atmo with\u00A0AP = PE =~\u00A0100km just prior to reentry ie not intersecting any other \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, so he should have got a straight orbit of Kerbin but he didn\u0027t and got a flyby.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what is going on here? Am I missing something? Is it a bug with orbits not being recognised properly for astrokerbal experience?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyeon else noticed this? Has it been reported?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT I can add an observation which is that the first time the Kerbal rescued on Minmus entered Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E he\u00A0was already on an escape trajectory as the craft was heading out into Kerbol orbit via a trajectory plotted inside Minmus \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, maybe that was why he was tagged with flyby, but it doesnt explain not updating to orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-05T21:19:47Z\u0022 title=\u002202/05/2017 09:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 5, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by boolybooly\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hotaru","CreatedById":135669,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-06T13:32:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt might be that Kerbal achievements are \u0022backwards\u0022 for Kerbin since you start there, so a flyby would be a \u0022higher\u0022 achievement than orbit in the same way orbit is, presumably, worth more than a landing on Kerbin.
