To make a long story short, I edited the max thrust value on the Aerospike engine, then later, put it back to 180. Later on, I was playing with a rocket in my normal sandbox save, and activated the next stage (which had an aerospike engine in it). Immediately the rocket was destroyed and the remaining debris left the solar system immediately. I reverted to vehicle assembly, and looked at the thrust value of the aerospike engine, and it had a value somewhere around 60000! I looked at the files, and the Maxthrust Value was still at 180. I didn\u0027t care about it that much, because I never use that engine anyway. But now, since I really need that engine, I looked through the data and couldn\u0027t find the problem. I Remembered the time I screwed up the physics data in the cheats menu, and that the eventual solution was to delete the physics file, and the game downloaded another physics file. Thinking it would do the same, I deleted the file for the aerospike engine. It did not work, and now I need to get a file for that part. How should I go about doing that?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-19T21:24:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCopy your save folder to a different location.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDelete the entire KSP folder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReinstall KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMove your save folder back to its original location in the new install.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr, if you\u0027re on Steam, you might be able to get away with just verifying file integrity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jeb14","CreatedById":191898,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-19T21:38:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow do I verify file integrity through steam?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"4x4cheesecake","CreatedById":187982,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-19T21:43:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223601807\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022184611\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221558301908\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022191898\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jeb14\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 minutes ago, Jeb14 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow do I verify file integrity through steam?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight-click on the game in your library -\u0026gt; properties -\u0026gt; local files -\u0026gt; verify integrity of game files.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou probably have to delete the config file manually, not sure if steam just checks for missing files or also replaces modified files.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBtw: The next time you want to try something like this, you may want to try a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50533-140-16x-module-manager-402-february-3rd-2019-right-to-ludicrous-speed/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EModuleManager \u003C/a\u003Epatch.
