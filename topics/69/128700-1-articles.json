These are pretty common (especially with mods and such installed, or after playing for a while), the only thing posting about it on the forums will do is clutter up the support forum. Crash logs aren\u0027t everything, and the developers don\u0027t need five squillion core dumps saying the exact same thing.\u00A0On the off chance it was not just a RAM-based crash, they/we need more info than just the crash log.\u00A0Can you tell me what you were doing at the time? Can you reliably\u00A0reproduce the crash by following a certain set of steps?\u00A0Was it a freeze or did it just pop you back to desktop?\u00A0Are you running OS X (what version?), Windows (what version?), Linux (what version/flavor/build/thing?) What are your system specs? (CPU,\u00A0RAM, GPU) Most importantly, do you have any mods installed? Make a thread with that info, and wait for a reply. (However, if you can\u0027t reliably reproduce the crash, it\u0027s probably RAM based. Don\u0027t bother. Just suck it up and pray for 1.1.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-27T07:25:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould like the answer to this as well. I have multiple crashes (between 2 and 4) on every version since 1.02 that are definitely not memory related crashes. They usually happen when reverting flight to the SPH.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vaporo","CreatedById":110800,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-27T13:07:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, it always says that, but everyone just ignores it. I don\u0027t know why they keep that message in. If everyone were to clog up the forums with crash logs, it would be impossible to organize, and there\u0027s no way that the developers would have time to go through every crash log. Usually just ignore posting the crash logs unless you have a specific issue that you want help with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-27T13:07:27Z\u0022 title=\u002212/27/2015 01:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Vaporo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
