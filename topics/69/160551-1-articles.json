It\u0027s a system that should run Kerbal with no problems, yet I\u0027m having the weirdest issue that I\u0027ve never experienced before in any game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the game is in focus, CPU and GPU usage is very low, resulting in a framerate of about 20 FPS, even on the main menu. If I watch my CPU usage on my second screen, I can see it sat at about 1%. But, weirdly, if I set Kerbal to windowed mode and switch focus to my second screen, I see framerate skyrocket to about 500 FPS while Kerbal is out of focus but still visible on my main monitor. CPU temperature goes up, as does GPU usage. I\u0027ve tested every combination of settings (including various V-sync settings, frame locks, SLI on/off, etc)\u00A0I can think of and the same behaviour happens every time.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI grabbed some video footage of this happening to demonstrate my point. Keep an eye on the info in the top left. You\u0027ll see it start on 20 FPS while the game is in focus, then shoot up to above 250 FPS when focus is changed. Bringing the focus back to Kerbal reduces it back to a solid 20 FPS once again.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ie2Evguzw5Q?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHopefully I\u0027ve explained the problem. If anyone has experienced something similar or has any idea (no matter how noobish - I may have missed something obvious) what may be causing the system to use no resources to run the game while it\u0027s in focus, I\u0027d really appreciate some help!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSystem specs are as follows:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIntel i7 7700k @ 4.8 GHz\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2 x GTX 980 Ti\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n16 GB RAM\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSamsung SSD 960 EVO 250 GB (where the game is installed)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bencillo","CreatedById":177711,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-12T22:55:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seems I found the problem.
