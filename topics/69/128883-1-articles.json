The Kerbals were left on Moho, and I just tried to pick them up. They weren\u0027t there. They showed up on the map, but when I landed right on top of where they should be, there was nothing there. I went back to mission control, and got an error box saying their weren\u0027t loaded because their models weren\u0027t found. I don\u0027t really want those Kerbals, so how do I get rid of the map markers? They show up when I track active EVA\u0027s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo summarize, how do I get rid of map markers for Kerbals that have ceased to exist?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Speadge","CreatedById":145302,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-30T11:28:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbest is for sure to edit your savefile and delete those lines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Curveball Anders","CreatedById":107529,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-06T14:31:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222341814\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022128883\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221451474889\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022145302\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Speadge\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 2015-12-30 at 0:28 PM, Speadge said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbest is for sure to edit your savefile and delete those lines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut remember to always make a backup of any file you hack by hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
