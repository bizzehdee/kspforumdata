Fly up out of the atmosphere\n\n2.) decouple ship\n\n3.) rotate\n\n**Result:** steering is very sensitive, when rotating faster and faster you get to a point where the ship start flipping directions. when rotating even faster you get slower.\n\n**Other Notes/Pictures/Log Files:** \n\n- youtube video\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/jhs6xJ9AvHQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n- when going on EVA the Kerbal is shot away with enormous speed\n\nimagelink: [http://i.imgur.com/kqMR9zt.png](http://i.imgur.com/kqMR9zt.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T22:27:31Z","Content":"The ship flipping part looks like the [wagon wheel effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagon-wheel_effect), and rapid spinning might also explain why the Kerbal is flung away so violently. There used to be a hard limit on rotation speed, but I\u0027ll have to see if that was changed in 1.0."}]}
