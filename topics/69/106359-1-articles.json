At my moon base, every time I accidentally warp past 1k, one of my local ships explodes. It isn\u0027t mods causing it and it isn\u0027t part clipping. I checked both. There are also various other problems associated with going past warp 1k, such as bugged mining equipment and temps can sometimes get set to NaN for every part of the vessel which requires a save edit to fix."}]}
