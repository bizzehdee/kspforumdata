Normal game only with destructible buildings disabled.\n\n- Quicksave (F5) doesn\u0027t work at all, no quicksave.sfs in save folder\n- Quickload (F9) opens a complete new instance of the game\n\nI installed the game from scratch, doesn\u0027t help. Keybindings are correct.\n\nJust wanted to report it and see if somebody can confirm this or if I have done something really dumb to break it.\n\nThanks,\n\nJaden\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-27T21:12:35Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2015 09:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jaden**\n  \nSolved!"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T20:09:09Z","Content":"Hi Jaden, where is KSP installed?

Sorry for wasting everybody\u0027s time.\n\nThe Keyboard functions were set incorrectly ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif) It wasn\u0027t even recognizing F5 as F5.
