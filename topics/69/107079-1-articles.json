I stayed with them until the parachutes were deployed in both of their pods (early game, so they are in separate pods with heat shields and parachutes), once reentry effects were completed and parachutes were deployed in both pods, I switched to a piece of debris made up of a probe core and a nose cone that was ejected prior to reentry. When I went to switch back, the two command pods that were left lightly floating to the ground were gone. I looked in the log and it showed Jeb and Hilde Killed, but does not show anything happening to the command pods they were in."}]}
