KSP.exe, KSP_x64.exe, and the patcher all throw UAC prompts when I try to run KSP, which seems really inappropriate given as I\u0027m running the zip version in a non-system directory. Steps to replicate are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Download the zip file from the store\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Unzip into a new folder in the desktop\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Launch any of the above (Launcher works fine, then asks for UAC when you click \u0022Play\u0022)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know if it was installed elsewhere in the filesystem it might need permissions, but it really shouldn\u0027t on the desktop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT- Well, what the heck. I told it \u0022no\u0022 at the UAC prompt, and now it\u0027s not asking on subsequent launches.
