I have attached a picture of a craft that produces this issue. It seems to stem from having control surfaces mounted at an angle too near the CoM. In the image, (counting inside to out) the 1st and 3rd control surfaces have the proper pitch deflection while the 2nd and 4th are inverted. All have the proper roll deflection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/P4WSzXU.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022P4WSzXU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECounting outward from the fuselage:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 1st (innermost, inside the engines) set are mounted horizontal to the direction of flight and deflect properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 2nd set are mounted at ~30deg (whatever the swept wing angle is) and have inverted pitch control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 3rd set are shifted further back using the offset tool. Any further forward than their current location will result in inversion, but they deflect properly where they are in this image.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 4th (outermost) set are angled as well (but now using the Control Surface 1 part instead of 5) and experience inversion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, any surfaces mounted at that angle along that entire troublesome line (slanting back at 30deg) will experience inversion. An un-angled control surface causes no issue, and an angled surface sufficiently far back is fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlacing a large fuel tank on the front of the craft (to shift the CoM far forward) resolves the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it appears that this issue only occurs for control surfaces mounted with a rotation, and only when applying pitch input and if they are sufficiently close to the CoM. It does not seem to affect the roll axis, though it is possible an analogous configuration could produce this issue on that axis. Removing all mods from my install did not resolve the bug.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-16T21:43:56Z\u0022 title=\u002208/16/2015 09:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sumghai\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ECrossed out untrue statement\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-16T21:47:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008000;\u0022\u003E[MOD - Moved to Support (unmodded install) subforums, which has existed prior to and after game release]\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;","CreatedById":78047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T02:31:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/103923-Problem-with-inverted-control-surfaces\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/103923-Problem-with-inverted-control-surfaces\u003C/a\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"arq","CreatedById":71084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T04:21:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the relocate and the link.
