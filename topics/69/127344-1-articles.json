It\u0027s just that I\u0027ll then swap to a different craft (say, an accommodation module for 15 kerbals) and I\u0027ll then get a tick by THAT requirement and the \u0022new base\u0022 tick vanishes - which doesn\u0027t worry me immediately because I realise THAT module doesn\u0027t have the antenna, dp and power gen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I land that module on the asteroid and you\u0027d assume I\u0027d get both ticks back again, but I don\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other strange thing is that all the subsequent modules I land DO cause cause mission ticks to accumulate. If I\u0027m landing a command centre to get the tick for \u0022new base\u0022 and then I\u0027m landing, say, an accommodation module and getting a tick for that but losing the \u0022new base\u0022 tick, you\u0027d think that when I went on to land, say, a laboratory I\u0027d get a tick for that but lose the tick for the accommodation module. That doesn\u0027t happen though. Every subsequent module that I land DOES cause more and more things to get ticked-off the requirements list (and remain ticked). It\u0027s just the \u0022new base\u0022 tick that seems to vanish as soon as I land a different module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wonder if the solution might be something as simple as landing my modules in a different order?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there any way to force the game to give me Asteroid base missions so I can experiment with different things?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWorst-case-scenario is that I\u0027ll have to just build asteroid bases like an orbital station with a grappler on the end and spear them into the asteroid all in one go but I don\u0027t really want to do that \u0027cos it isn\u0027t very realistic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-09T16:27:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be honest it\u0027s really hard to diagnose contract issues without having the persistent.sfs to test, you can find it in the save folder for each of your profiles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt may be that the contract is itself bugged and Arsonide would be able to help, he\u0027s Squads contracts guy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can force the contract to complete, and can also clear the contracts list so another similar one shows up in the debug screen, try alt\u002BF12\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
