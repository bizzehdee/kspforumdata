I have no idea why and when I used a rocket that worked last time I used it, it also started tilting. How do I fix this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ultimate Steve","CreatedById":161505,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-18T22:24:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPictures of the rocket would help, you can upload them to a hosting service like imgur then paste the link here. Pictures would better help us diagnose whether this is a difference in flight profile between the first and second flights, a general construction problem, or an actual bug in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have draggy bits in the front, try removing them, or putting fins as far back as possible on the base of the rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, welcome to the forums! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jas0n","CreatedById":57441,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-18T23:40:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt probably is unstable aerodynamically which means if it tilts a tiny bit, the offset will get larger and larger.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-19T01:09:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst off, welcome to the forums!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecondly, in general; a proper rocket looks like an arrow.
