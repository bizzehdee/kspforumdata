Actually playing the game is no harder or easier on any of the settings. The only things that change is how expensive things are, how much money you make from the contracts, how much science you get and need, and therefore how many grindy missions you need to fly before you can unlock new stuff. If you can\u0027t fly every mission perfectly, you will lose money rather than gaining it on \u0022hard\u0022, and that seems to be your problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-29T19:00:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs anyone else seeing this?
