For some reason, they disappear whenever I retract them while moving at a low altitude. I noticed that they are recorded in the F3 GUI as \u0022splashed down hard\u0022 when I retract them over water. When I was taxiing on the runway at ~100 m/s, it apparently overheated at temperatures exceeding those on the surface of the Sun. My guess is that the instant the surfaces stop moving, their physics is updated based on how far the part was deployed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI usually play with a few mods, but I confirmed that this phenomenon still persists with pure stock \u002B expansion.
