I\u0027ve tried reinstalling, restarting, I\u0027ve updated my Nvidia Drivers, I\u0027ve tried changing every graphics setting to the lowest possible, nothing seems to fix or even noticeably prolong the amount of time I play before it crashes. \n\nOne thing I thought might be causing it might be some sort of error to recognize my windows managed 12gb of pagefile on three separate drives:\n\nUnity Player [version: Unity 4.6.4f1\\_99f88340878d]\n\nKSP.exe caused an Access Violation (0xc0000005)\n\n in module KSP.exe at 0023:011f9fa0.\n\nError occurred at 2015-08-06\\_153446.\n\nD:\\Program Files\\steamapps\\common\\Kerbal Space Program\\KSP.exe, run by Chrysaor.\n\n69% memory in use.\n\n4095 MB physical memory [1238 MB free].\n\n0 MB paging file [0 MB free].\u003C-----------------------------\n\n0 MB user address space [2533 MB free].\n\nWrite to location 00000000 caused an access violation.\n\nBut even after I set a specific amount of pagefile to one of my drives it didn\u0027t make any difference to the issue or the log. I\u0027m thinking about reducing the amount pagefile down to a set 4096 on a specific drive and disabling the rest. Any help would be wonderful.\n\nEDIT: I tried running with only 4096mb of pagefile on my OS drive, no change \n\nCrash Dmp: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/bgrsn20bzm8po22/crash.dmp?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bgrsn20bzm8po22/crash.dmp?dl=0)\n\nDxDiag: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/k2dj38pn5ubxdbf/DxDiag.txt?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/k2dj38pn5ubxdbf/DxDiag.txt?dl=0)\n\nError Log: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/l3zecr0ivywuc1q/error.log?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/l3zecr0ivywuc1q/error.log?dl=0)\n\nOutput Log: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/ubobobr7s71ju7b/output_log.txt?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ubobobr7s71ju7b/output_log.txt?dl=0)\n\nReport Ini: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/fhhrlmepj6w9znl/report.ini?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fhhrlmepj6w9znl/report.ini?dl=0)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-06T22:20:34Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2015 10:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DarkOrion4600**"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T01:02:00Z","Content":"I doubt it has anything to do with the page file.

That was so frustrating. You\u0027re right, it was indeed Precision X. I don\u0027t know if it was advertised to \u0022boost\u0022 gaming, but it does unlock the clocking speeds, voltages and fan profiles on my video card, I use it to check how much work my GPU is doing while in game.\n\nI don\u0027t understand it though, Precision X only uses 53,000K with all of it\u0027s components, Chrome right now is using 286,000K and I\u0027ve used Chrome in the background while playing KSP without it crashing. Actually, the game hasn\u0027t crashed AT ALL since I stopped precision X. Maybe it\u0027s not running out of memory, that is to say, maybe Precision X isn\u0027t using too much memory, maybe Precision X just somehow interferes with KSP\u0027s ability to get resources.\n\nWhatever the case, it\u0027s fixed!
