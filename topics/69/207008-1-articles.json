Despite having the same processor and 32GB of RAM that it had before, running KSP through the integrated graphics system made it perform noticeably worse even with plain stock KSP. Looking down at terrain wrecked the frame rate most of all for some reason, something I\u2019ve also seen when running KSP on an old potato desktop that was the cheapest in the shop a decade ago, so definitely aim the camera up as much as possible!I don\u2019t recommend trying to use visual mods if you can barely run KSP without them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTurn the terrain details and textures down as low as you can, disable terrain scatters, turn off anti-aliasing, turn down part details and textures, turn off aero effects, reduce the number of patched conics to 3, reduce the max persistent debris to a very small number (but above zero, just in case), disable V-sync and turn off the frame rate limiter- this last one won\u2019t do much when the game is running but can make a huge difference to load times as for some reason KSP loading is frame limited and I\u2019ve seen three- or even four-figure FPS numbers loading off an SSD.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBuilding vessels with more parts puts more pressure on the CPU and KSP is single threaded so modern multi-core, multi-thread processors can\u2019t use their full potential.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-01T12:20:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI turn off temperature gauges as well...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI also look to the sky, when launching...
