F2 toggles the UI just fine, however repeated F1 presses results in not a single screenshot being taken. I\u0027m playing on a laptop running Win 8.1.\n\nI checked the root folder where KSP is installed and there is indeed a folder titled \u0022Screenshots\u0022, but it is empty.\n\nIs there a quick fix for this? Is it operator error? I was going to include a screenshot of my KSP installation showing the Screenshot Folder, but I just noticed I\u0027m not allowed. Take my word for it.\n\nAny help is much appreciated! I mean I just made my first successful orbit of Kerbin and not a screenshot to show for it! ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-12T13:58:46Z\u0022 title=\u002207/12/2015 01:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Korbit**"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T02:55:11Z","Content":"Check the Settings page in the Main Menu, the key might have been remapped.

I opened the debug log, and pressed F1. A \u0022log: SCREENSHOT!!\u0022 entry was immediately made. However it didn\u0027t show any path for saving the file and when I checked the Screenshot folder in the KSP\\_win folder it was still empty. I also did a search of the output\\_log.txt for the term \u0022Screenshot\u0022 and got no hits.\n\nSomeone else suggested that I may need to reinstall.

It could be a permissions thing, where you don\u0027t have write permissions on the directory. Unlikely as you\u0027re able to save files and write logs, but still. I\u0027m at a loss ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nAnd note: Reinstalling isn\u0027t that bad. Just save your entire \u0022saves\u0022 folder (and \u0022gamedata\u0022 folder if you use mods) and put it (or them) into the new KSP install folder and you\u0027ll have exactly the same game you did before."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T02:56:19Z","Content":"As I noted in your other thread, this can happen if you have KSP installed in Program Files. Moving the KSP folder to its own spot on the C drive should fix it. No telling where Windows may have hidden the pics you\u0027ve already tried to take, though. I never did find mine."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T03:57:11Z","Content":"Okay. We\u0027ve been stabbing around about this for a bit. What might help out more is if you could tell us what version of KSP (steam, store version, etc) you are running. And perhaps upload one of your output\\_log.txt files. I\u0027ve confirmed that mine also does not show a Screenshot path, so your searching there won\u0027t turn up anything except a lack of an \u0022Error!\u0022\n\nProviding the output\\_log.txt might give us some info, or at least provide some clues as to where the pathing is pointing. If you do reinstall (non steam), make sure you keep away from Program Files, Desktop, Documents, or any other similar locations (as Vanamonde suggests). Otherwise windows likes to \u0022help you out\u0022 sometimes. I\u0027ve heard some people\u0027s pictures end up in the \u0022Documents\u0022 directory, or in the \u0022Pictures\u0022 directory. They might even get buried in the AppData directory.\n\nGood luck,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Korbit","CreatedById":147331,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T09:27:25Z","Content":"Thanks to everyone who weighed in on this issue!! We can put this baby to bed! Case closed! Solved!\n\nA big shout out to Vanamonde who came up with the winning answer!\n\nOnce I confirmed the screenshots were working after moving the KSP folder out of Program Files (x86), I made a note of the name of the screenshot. They are simply screenshotX.png where X=the number of that particular screenshot. I then searched my hard drive for \u0022screenshot\u0022. \n\nClaw you were correct about the AppData directory. All screenshots I\u0027ve ever taken are in this location:\n\nC:\\Users\\Dean\\AppData\\Local\\VirtualStore\\Program Files (x86)\\KSP\\KSP\\_win\\Screenshots\n\nBelieve me I never would\u0027ve thought to look in a Virtual Store! I had previously scanned the AppData directory looking for a KSP folder with no luck.\n\nBy the way after moving the game out of Program Files (x86) it ran fine, however I lost my saved games. They were also found here.\n\nThanks again everyone. I will definitely pay it forward when I\u0027ve learned enough to be helpful!"}]}
