Everything works on the stick and throttle, but I just can\u0027t seem to get the controls right for ksp. I cannot properly bind the action keys to the buttons (i try and bind action 1 to the trigger, but nothing happens to it. binding the other action keys (gear, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, lights, etc.) works just fine.) Also, while i fixed the stupid reversed throttle problem, i do not have exact control over it. There is heavy precision and slowness at the extreme ends of the throttle (max and cut), but absolutely no control over mid. It just speeds past. This makes it very hard to have precision over the throttle in flight, which is the only thing stopping me from attempting a powered rocket landing with the stick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone know of a good solution to this problem? is it just a problem only I am experiencing? I\u0027m loving the precision of having a flight stick, but i just cannot play without having all of my action groups or a good throttle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fast-and-Free","CreatedById":179194,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-04T08:32:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt sounds like you have modified the Sensitivity of your throttle axis which applies a curve to your input\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry the default value of 0.84, that should be linear\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you can\u0027t bind any action on your trigger in KSP you can try circumventing this with Thrustmaster\u0027s T.A.R.G.E.T. software, a tool for scripting and customizing your joystick.
