After making quick progress through the very beginning stages of career mode I unlocked the TT-38k Radial Decoupler\u0027s and have been using them to help get through the easier contracts. About to start making my way towards MUN but before I do I wanted to see if anyone could help with my issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo like the title says my TT-38k Radial Decoupler\u0027s are firing individually in the same stage, thus making me smash the space bar 5 times in rapid succession and throwing my rocket in a roll. I was wondering why this is the case and am not sure if its something I need to unlock in career or just a minor bug any help would be greatly appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T19:38:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe need more information as detailed in this thread: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92230-Stock-Support-Bug-Reporting-Guide\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92230-Stock-Support-Bug-Reporting-Guide\u003C/a\u003E before we can diagnose the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf special importance in this case is a screenshot of the simplest craft you can build that experiences the decoupler issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes it happen with any other decoupler?
