At least based on the in game reported mass of .05. Could somebody check me and make sure I\u0027m not going crazy? ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif) I hope it is the center of mass tool that is wrong and not the parts labeled mass. \n\nGreat game by the way!\n\nWindows 8.x\n\nKSP 1.0.4.861\n\n[![MassBUG.jpg](http://i1152.photobucket.com/albums/p489/FusionLove1/MassBUG.jpg)](http://s1152.photobucket.com/user/FusionLove1/media/MassBUG.jpg.html)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-28T22:20:45Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2015 10:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Red Tick**"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T02:09:09Z","Content":"You are not crazy, it is by design for the Jet Engine.

Now that I know it is a \u0022feature\u0022 and not necessarily a bug I wonder if i can make a change to some sort of config file that is used to determine CoM overrides like this?
