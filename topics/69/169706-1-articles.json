I\u0027ve only ever accepted these missions in large packs while declining everything else, possibly related.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use no mods, ever. Happens on both 32 and 64bit. No apparent connection with CPU stress or anything else relating to hardware. Happens regardless of starting KSP 20 minutes ago or 20 hours ago.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo reproduce with relative ease and speed: start new career profile, get only just far enough to start spawning tourist missions for sub orbital launches. Accept these in swarms to launch\u00A0a whole bunch\u00A0in the same craft\u00A0and just\u00A0leap out\u00A0to like 71.000m and cash in, decline all other missions, sooner or later one of the missions just won\u0027t complete because a tourist hasn\u0027t spawned and could not be put in the craft. (Using existing saves also works but involves repeatedly saving and loading which could cause all manner of other issues with the game, completing the missions is the least likely to cause unrelated problems and the farther you\u0027ve gone from Kerbin the farther you need to send the tourists.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only thing I can think of to check for while\u00A0trying to identify the bug\u00A0is that maybe they can\u0027t spawn because their names overlap with an existing Kerbal, not much but maybe a starting point. I usually discover the problem long after already cashing in a group so haven\u0027t really seen if this is possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: The bug appears not to happen if the missions are accepted slowly and all other missions are declined slowly, not entirely sure but this way it didn\u0027t happen even after around 500 missions in a row which is enough to suspect that it\u0027s a relevant factor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-21T15:18:10Z\u0022 title=\u002201/21/2018 03:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 21, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Rejected Spawn\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdditional information.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rejected Spawn","CreatedById":172225,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-21T22:01:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally got a save file that has one of the bugged tourists and the mission hasn\u0027t been accepted yet.

(most likely because i am using mods) It seems that its all about the names of your tourists, so if two tourists from different contracts have the same name, only one will spawn. Maybe the game names tourists randomly so you just increase the chance that it happens, and maybe it tries to avoid giving the same name twice, but if you have to many tourists, it runs out of names and has to use one twice. (you could try that out and see if there is a maximal number which you could just avoid, although thats not really a\u00A0solution i guess)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
