Loving the new graphics for KSP on 1.9.1 however i got a problem. At low altitudes when the textures are higher res, the planets surface flicker, its quite distracting and i never had this problem before i cant really find any other posts describing the same issue. Same PC. Help please? really annoying.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VoidSquid","CreatedById":196199,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-13T13:06:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou mean this maybe?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u002277983\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed7140694458\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/190361-ground-texture-shaking/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:169px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf yes, quicksave-quickload helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"2epicpanda","CreatedById":203293,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-13T13:10:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nno not like that, its more in the distance. It doesn\u0027t happen close to your ship or Kerbal.

It\u0027s possibly the game trying to improve performance by only loading the best textures when you\u0027re close and making do with lower quality textures further away. Maybe it was fixed in 1.9.1, but I haven\u0027t tried that yet due to a long list of currently incompatible mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-14T12:22:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom the video posted above.
