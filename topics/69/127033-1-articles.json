I can solve it by sticking huge fins on my rockets but\u00A0I\u00A0prefer rockets without them. I\u0027ve not been able to get any of my preferred launchers to fly without large fins on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there any solution or workaround for this?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-04T23:09:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/125198-fairing-col-offset-also-staged/#post2296449\u0022\u003EInfo here.\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents ipsClearfix\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter further investigation, there are three bugs going on here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) The location of the body lift line before decoupling the fairing is incorrect. It\u0027s applying lift force too far ahead of the fairing (i.e. the overlay is correct).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- My StockBugFixes now contain the fix for this in ModuleProceduralFairingFix.

That is, it\u0027s showing the lift too far ahead, but that\u0027s an overlay problem. That\u0027s not a force position problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Fix for this is to simply cycle the overlay after decoupling (I did not include this fix because it seemed wasteful to spend CPU cycles checking for and fixing the overlay).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) The direction of the body lift after decoupling is incorrect. The overlay is showing the direction that lift is being applied, which is in an incorrect direction (i.e. the overlay direction is correct).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- This is not limited to the procedural fairings, but is actually a systemic problem in the body lift algorithms. You can replace the fairing with any part that\u0027s wider than it is tall (such as a SAS module, or FL-T100), and the incorrect direction of body lift results.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheers,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n~Claw\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-05T14:53:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks sal. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0I\u0027ll use that fix.
