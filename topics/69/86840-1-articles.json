The game clock ticks as it should and the in-game time is green. But after some time the anti-kraken-bullet-time kicks in. And it happens more and more with every game start-up. I found a way around it by just doing the phys warp, but then the frames get worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt happens to the stock game as well as to the modded one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts?
