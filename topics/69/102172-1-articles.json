I have a tank that i used a lot of offset and rotate on, and for some reason it loads fine, and i can play with it in -game. However, when i reload (through F9, tracking view, or revert to launch) it comes out looking like this:\n\n![EWbueHK.png](http://i.imgur.com/EWbueHK.png)\n\nWhy is this happening?
