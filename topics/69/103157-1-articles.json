Sometimes Unity thinks the ALT key is down, even if it isn\u0027t. You can tap on it a couple times and that usually resets it.\n\nIf that doesn\u0027t work, then please upload a log file. Perhaps you are running into some other error that is preventing the game from responding.\n\nWelcome to the forums! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"ShadowZone","CreatedById":112420,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T11:00:48Z","Content":"One question: Do you have other software running in the background?
