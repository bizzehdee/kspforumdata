In particular, this seems to occur on final for Runway 09, because I don\u0027t see this occur on takeoff from 09. ON one occasion it looks like one of the smaller structures near the VAB blew up from the collision, but I didn\u0027t capture a screenshot of that prior to uncontrolled vehicle disassembly. The parts that seem to collide are the the Small Delta Wing and the Structural Wing Type B.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESystem specifics:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWindows 7 (64-bit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntel Core i5-4670K @ 3.4GHz (stock speed)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8 GB DDR3 RAM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Build info: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebuild id = 00642\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2014-10-07_10-59-44\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBranch: master\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScreenshot:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/gPq3Gc6\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/gPq3Gc6\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure how to attach a craft file, though I am open to suggestions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T00:50:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022VirtualCLD\u0022 data-cite=\u0022VirtualCLD\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m not sure how to attach a craft file, though I am open to suggestions.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can upload to a place like mediafire or pastebin.

But I think it\u0027s more likely in .25 because the plane parts now have lift values, and the bug seems to only target lift parts. Usually to replicate it you simply need to fly far away from Kerbin and return. Like flying an SSTO to Minmus or another planet without ever closing the game at any point during the mission. But it only happens on occasion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"luizopiloto","CreatedById":97503,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T04:28:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENope... this happned to rocket parts with no lift too... in my case, the ship had deployed parachutes, slowly going down, and it landed on a invisible bulding...
