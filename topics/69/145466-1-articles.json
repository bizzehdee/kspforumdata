Once I get to it and hit it or attempt to climb rover is either ejected significantly hieght.

It looks like the planes making up the surface dont meet at the edges, like one plane is elevated slightly. Through the gap you can see sky box. Sometimes its just a graphical artifact and the physical surface lines up correctly. other times the physics matches the graphics, but its not like hitting a wall. Its like the engine considers the two planes to meet as intended, but one is a meter or more higher, so when a wheel crosses the boundry, the game thinks the craft has had one end elevated by a meter or more in one physics tick. The resulting velocity and rotation is assigned to the craft in the next tick and off it goes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have not seen one of these since 64b became a thing, but i used to get them on kerbin, mun and minmus. I learned to drive around or hop over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ultimate Steve","CreatedById":161505,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-06T12:48:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou have discovered the great Minmus Rift! I\u0027ve never seen it myself. Rifts happen when the terrain tiles don\u0027t match up properly. There is a huge one on Gilly somewhere, and one near Minmus\u0027 poles. They occasionally happen elsewhere, but the two I mentioned happen regularly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrWolf83","CreatedById":141199,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-06T12:54:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks all a for the answers j did like the last reply suggested last night after posting and drove along it until I could cross.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
