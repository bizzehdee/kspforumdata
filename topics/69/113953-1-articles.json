These parts are not in the service bay! I have had it happen to solar panels, parachutes, and antennas. The workaround is to open the service bay doors, even though the part is usually nowhere near the service bay.\n\nOften with symmetrically attached parts, only one of them is deemed to be \u0022stowed,\u0022 which makes even less sense.\n\nWindows (Win7), 1.04\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-24T05:56:21Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2015 05:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mikegarrison**"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T07:02:24Z","Content":"Yes, this bug has been persistent.
