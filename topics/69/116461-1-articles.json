Launch stability enhancer and exploding ships on warp","CreatedByName":"Trogdor!","CreatedById":148047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T04:29:16Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Trogdor!","CreatedById":148047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T04:29:16Z","Content":"So in my travels I have encountered 2 different bugs. The first one occurs when you launch a ship with a launch stability enhancer that is placed in such a way as to be off the launch pad at launch.\n\nWhen you do this, every x number of seconds, the LSE will spawn beside your ship and you will fly away from it very fast. However, if manage to keep your ship arrow straight, you will make it to orbit safely (the LSE likes to crash into your ship when it spawns, which makes the parts that contact it explode). After that, the interesting stuff starts to happen. If you switch to the LSE \u0027debris\u0027 that spawns, you will notice that it\u0027s orbital speed does not change, but it will be under constant .5g acceleration! Kerbin will slowly recede from you and you will eventually leave kerbins SOI. (good luck trying to timewarp, change vessels, or return to the space center. You can\u0027t! \u0022you are under acceleration\u0022)\n\nToday, I was hit by this ([http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/103282-Exploding-and-bending-ships-while-time-warping](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/103282-Exploding-and-bending-ships-while-time-warping)) bug, and wouldn\u0027t you know it, my RC-L01 Remote Guidance Unit ripped itself out of my space station, and it\u0027s orbital speed stayed the same, while it was under constant .5g acceleration!\n\nMy theory is that somehow these parts are becoming detached from the physics of the game and remain stationary while kerbin moves away from them.\n\nThoughts?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-21T04:31:30Z\u0022 title=\u002207/21/2015 04:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Trogdor!**"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T11:35:55Z","Content":"Hi Trogdor! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nMy thoughts are that these issues are known and reported [**\\[here\\]**](http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/4874) and [**\\[here\\]**](http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/5150), please note that more info is needed for the second issue, specifically some solid reproduction steps that can produce the issue from square one (new craft on launchpad).\n\nIf you can help towards that it\u0027d be appreciated."},{"CreatedByName":"Trogdor!","CreatedById":148047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T15:31:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hi Trogdor! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E My thoughts are that these issues are known and reported [**\\[here\\]**](http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/4874) and [**\\[here\\]**](http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/5150), please note that more info is needed for the second issue, specifically some solid reproduction steps that can produce the issue from square one (new craft on launchpad).\n\u003E \n\u003E If you can help towards that it\u0027d be appreciated.\n\nAlas, if my google fu had been better, I could have found those already reported bugs. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif) They look very much like those that have already been reported. I will try to mess around with the second one a little more, because mine was a bit different in that I did have a claw and I did use RCS, but the vessel that spontaneously deconstructed was the root part of the one that I undocked with, was under no more acceleration than that of the decoupling force, and the the non-physics 5x warp is what caused it to rip apart. The ship that I undocked was left intact, and it didn\u0027t matter which vessel I was flying, only the former ripped apart. A restart did fix the issue.\n\nIn hindsight however, I do believe I used a 4x physics warp with a reusable lower stage during the same play session. That vessel did not have rcs capability or a claw. I will see if I can find a reliable way to trigger it."}]}
