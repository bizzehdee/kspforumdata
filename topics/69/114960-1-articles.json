You could switch to the part and it showed a full battery. \n\nIs this as intended ? It means you cannot detach parts and go get them later."},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T16:19:51Z","Content":"Not sure if it is intended, I can\u0027t say I\u0027ve ever tried it myself, but there is a long-standing bug where docking ports fail to engage because they get stuck in the wrong state.\n\nSee [this thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/78863) for details and a way of unsticking the port if this is the problem."}]}
