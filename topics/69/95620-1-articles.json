This requirement can be bypassed by undocking the ship from a parent or older ship. In practice this means that if you have an old orbital fuel station to which you dock a ship that was previously ineligible for a contract due to not being \u0022newly constructed\u0022, after undocking the ship will be registered \u0022as new\u0022 and fully eligible to complete the contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother method I\u0027ve used is to launch a satellite pre-docked to a mothership. The single satellite can then undock, complete a contract, redock, and repeat the cycle indefinitely. The only requirement is that the satellite does not contain the \u0022root\u0022 part of the ship (this must be on the mothership). Effectively it\u0027s possible to use the same old ship to complete an infinite number of contracts all requiring a \u0022new ship to be built after the contract is completed\u0022, provided the ship has a docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course this could be argued as a \u0022feature\u0022 rather than a bug, but I thought I\u0027d report it just in case.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-04T12:28:11Z\u0022 title=\u002201/04/2015 12:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kerano\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-04T13:42:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I\u0027ve not conclusively tested it myself, I believe it\u0027s actually possible to complete more than one contract consecutively with the same ship or satellite as well, provided:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAll the contracts you\u0027re trying to complete were accepted before you launch the ship to complete the first one\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAll the contracts you\u0027re trying to complete are met one after another in the same play session\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that in mind, I do believe this is (at least in part) a bug. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the issue is not so much that this is obviously a bug -- it\u0027s that there isn\u0027t really an elegant solution to this.

I haven\u0027t been able to imagine a way around it yet, and it still offers the greatest flexibility for the user. They still get to keep and use the actual satellite if they want, but they can\u0027t fulfill another \u0022put a satellite in orbit XX\u0022 contract. It still suffers from some limitations, as does the \u0022turning over the satellite to the company\u0022 approach. I\u0027m not really sure yet which makes the best sense from a gameplay standpoint.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut from the standpoint of \u0022build a new ship/satellite,\u0022 either of the solutions Vexx listed nullifies that requirement completely. Yes, you could still complete a contract with a vessel that\u0027s already in space. However, you could only do it once with any particular vessel. And really, from a contract fulfillment standpoint, does it matter if the satellite that fulfills my contract comes from space or the launch pad? So long as it met all of my requirements (orbit, power, parts, etc...). Tracking the ID takes care of reusing the satellite for \u0022put a satellite in orbit XXX\u0022 farming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing this opens up, is that a player can send a satellite freighter to other planets and await contracts, sort of a mother ship with multiple satellites. That way the player can fulfill \u0022satellite in orbit around XXX\u0022 contracts without waiting (or timewarping) years of game time for the one, newly launched satellite to get to there. But it also doesn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Eforce \u003C/em\u003Eyou to do it the freighter way. If you still want to wait and launch a new satellite to fulfill, you can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETracking the ID allows the player to continue using the satellite for their own purposes, but also prevents it from being abused for more contracts. However, I still find fault with this because \u0022if I was the company,\u0022 I would be pretty upset that my newly acquired satellite just got moved by the contractor I paid to put it there. But as a game player, having satellites littered all over the place that I can\u0027t do anything with, or having them just disappear (upon contract completion) also seems \u0027wrong.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis same approach could be used to identify a space station for specific contract fulfillment. Tagging the ID as having been used by a contract, the the station can\u0027t be triggered again to fulfill the requirement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn either case, I guess that was a long way of saying \u0022yes, I agree that it should be changed a bit.\u0022 Not that Vexx or I can control it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"im_sparticus","CreatedById":133739,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-04T18:59:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECompleting a station around mun with a contract for a similar station around Kerbin requires fulfilling the Kerbin one first (unless ou park for less than 10 seconds).

Aside from launching two sats from two separate launches, there are a couple of approaches you could use. One is to put enough fuel on the sat to be able to reach both orbits. Another is to piggyback two sats on the same launch vehicle. I don\u0027t see how either approach could be considered cheating, or not fulfilling the contract. It\u0027s a matter of thinking about cost-effective ways to accomplish a mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, parking a vessel in orbit with 20 small sats ready to be undocked for sat contracts does seem to contradict the \u0027launch new vessel\u0027 spirit of the contract. I\u0027m not sure I\u0027m on board with the mindset that each launch only be allowed to complete a single contract however. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother case I\u0027ve seen (but haven\u0027t tried myself) is outpost missions. Early outpost (orbital or surface) missions appear to specify roughly 5-Kerbal capacity. Later, outposts with additional capacity are specified, sometimes with additional equipment like labs. Currently (again, haven\u0027t tried this myself yet..), you can simply add 5-Kerbal capacity to an existing 5-Kerbal outpost, and have it complete the contract. Does this meet the letter of the contract? No, it does not. Should a lot of effort be spent eliminating that option to players? Well, I\u0027m not sure about that. Why not use a piece of equipment we already own to make the mission more affordable?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, I can imagine the following contract: Build a new 15 Kerbal outpost, with science lab an a thermometer. You already have a 15 Kerbal outpost with a science lab, but no thermometer. Now, you just have to dock a thermometer and viola! For maybe $15k launch costs, you have just built a \u0027new\u0027 15 Kerbal outpost with science lab and thermometer. While I think adding on to existing outposts that you own is a great idea, adding a thermometer which cost next to nothing to launch maybe is going a bit too far. Ok, way too far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think everyone who has posted here has had excellent thoughts on practical ways to make contracts better. My suggestion is to be careful about how much you limit player options for completing contracts. Being able to use a single launch vehicle to complete multiple contracts has certainly added a lot of interest to the game for me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-04T20:51:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022im_sparticus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022im_sparticus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPerhaps \u0022run a test\u0022 once the contract is complete so as to avoid unintentionally fulfilling one en route to another.

In the case of orbital stations and lander bases though, it\u0027d be relatively simple to complete a contract just by docking the unique part and little else to an existing spacecraft satisfying the other contract requirements. Then again, you\u0027d still have to transport the unique part there from Kerbin and rendezvous after accepting the contract, so it\u0027s still an improvement on the current exploitable system.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, orbital stations are a bit trickier.
