So, removed the mods and continued to have the problem. Then I uninstalled Kerbal and deleted all of the the game files. I downloaded kerbal and did a fresh intall. I am still experiencing the same problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen full screen is checked then click apply, the app goes full screen, but a black square appears in the bottom left corner (approx 1/6 of the entire screen). Then after clicking accept, the main menu of the app appears normally in the square in the bottom left but showing as if it were 1/6th of the main menu screen normally. The rest of the screen is still the settings -\u0026gt; graphics screen and flashes flashes extremely rapidly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen this occurs I have been able to successfully alt-tab and bring up the main menu normally, but this does not happen every time. In the failed attempts the screen remains black and can be brought back to normally display content by alt-enter to windowed mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E When alt-tab is successful and the main menu is displaying correctly in full screen.

Some people have it working, but only part of the screen will display anything, and sometimes it just doesn\u0027t work at all.
