In particular, I was missing the Arial fonts. The information on that problem at the beginning of this thread seems to imply that KSP uses fontconfig to find installed fonts, so I installed them to ~/.fonts and ran fc-cache -fv, which found and cached them. However, this is not actually the case - running under strace reveals that in fact KSP only searches recursively under /usr/share/fonts regardless of fontconfig settings. This means that users like me, on public machines without root access, cannot install the fonts anywhere KSP will find them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did come up with a workaround that let me use the fonts, but I would hesitate to recommend it to others as it involves patching the KSP binary. Please back up your install before you try this, and only proceed if you actually understand what all of the words in the following procedure mean and what you\u0027re doing at each step.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo do it, first make a font directory somewhere you can write to, and put in it the Arial fonts and a symlink back to /usr/share/fonts. The full path to this directory must be shorter in length than \u0022/usr/share/fonts\u0022 - I used \u0022/tmp/fontslol\u0022. It\u0027s likely possible to use relative paths from the location of the KSP binary but I haven\u0027t tried it - if you get it working please let me know!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, use the command \u0022strings -t x KSP.x86(_64) | grep fonts\u0022 to find the offset in the binary of the directory name where it searches for fonts - I found that in the 64 bit 0.23.5 binary it\u0027s at offset 0xF1F168.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, open the binary in your favorite hex editor and navigate to that offset. Write over the \u0022/usr/share/fonts\u0022 string with the name of your directory. Be sure to terminate the string with a null byte if it\u0027s shorter than the original string.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe patched binary will now search recursively under your new directory for fonts, finding the Arial fonts and searching through the symlink for whatever else it needs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is an ugly hack, but I thought I\u0027d post it here in case others are in the same situation - I\u0027m not sure if the font-loading code comes from KSP or Unity, but it\u0027d be nice if whichever team is responsible could address this issue in future versions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-13T08:39:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022heikkik\u0022 data-cite=\u0022heikkik\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi.
