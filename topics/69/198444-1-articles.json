It does have a dedicated graphics card, but just a Radeon R5 230, so even then the overall performance doesn\u0027t differ that much from yours. I increased RAM from 8 to 16 GB a while ago, mostly to be able to cope with all those mods, so now it runs reasonably smooth even when I throw in a few\u00A0pretty graphics mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a stock game with graphics settings turned down a bit, your machine should be just fine. And KSP is a wonderful game even on the lowest settings!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AeroSky","CreatedById":207684,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-01T08:57:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s pretty similar to my specs, so I\u0027m pretty sure it can run stock KSP with minor to no lag. I can run large numbers of mods, but I suggest avoiding graphics mods because it will seriously lag your game (On those specs of yours). I also suggest not using part mods until you\u0027re\u00A0quite experienced in the game, because it fills up the part list a lot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stalagmike","CreatedById":208471,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-06T18:08:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for all the excellent replies. So it looks like his laptop will run KSP ok (for now). Next thing is how I go about \u0027gifting\u0027 it to him? The Steam account\u00A0 on his laptop is in my name so I can order it for him but then it will be hard to keep secret and there won\u0027t be anything IRL for him to open on Xmas day. I don\u0027t think disc copies of KSP are available. I guess I could just print out some image files and maybe put it in the sleeve of an old DVD case just as a dummy gift, and then install the game on Xmas Eve. Anybody else got any better ideas?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-06T18:45:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure how much it\u0027ll help now, since it seems you\u0027re not set up the same way, but...\u00A0 this is how I handle Steam games with my daughter who\u0027s 11.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe has her own Steam account that she uses on her computer.\u00A0 I never buy anything through her account.\u00A0 When she gets a game, I buy it as a gift through my account and gift it to her.\u00A0 That way there\u0027s no dealing with shared accounts and she can never buy games on her own.\u00A0 If I\u0027m not mistaken, when you give a game to an account, you can schedule the delivery.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere used to be ways you could buy codes for games, and then you could give your son a card with the code on it, but I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s still a thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal Productions","CreatedById":208620,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-27T03:55:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYES!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have an i3 without a graphics card, but KSP works great, if not best.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt will work good, but better with a GPU.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EBottomline: IT\u0027LL WORK.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
