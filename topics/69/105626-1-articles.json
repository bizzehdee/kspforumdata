It went up on even 8000 degrees! Even though it was not realy exposed into the airstream. Every other part seems to be fine. An the heatshild did its work. I had no problem with the rocket fliping around. \n\n![screenshot7.png?_subject_uid=81883400\u0026w=AAAk7_uOzwZJXSPnB3moUvu9BzzZWkF2YmTiaL0AmrghxA](https://dl-web.dropbox.com/get/Screenshots/screenshot7.png?_subject_uid=81883400\u0026w=AAAk7_uOzwZJXSPnB3moUvu9BzzZWkF2YmTiaL0AmrghxA)\n\nDoes anyone have similar problems, or an idea what might be the problem?\n\nGreetings,\n\nSalad\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T16:49:57Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 04:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by grosser\\_Salat**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nicdanger","CreatedById":121250,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T18:26:00Z","Content":"Having the same issue with no mods, finally used the thermal debug tool and a very ineffective gravity turn to keep the temperature down.

Also different parts have different cooling rates (take different amount of time to cool down). \n\nSo I guess Stayputnik might have low heat tolerance and pretty slow cooling speed."},{"CreatedByName":"grosser_Salat","CreatedById":116353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T09:11:40Z","Content":"@SilverWarrior: It\u0027s an idea, but the temperatures of the Stayputnik climbed and fell back over thousands within seconds. It was a really strange experience. \n\nI narrowed the problem now: We have a convection heat of 491032 degrees. Shown in the picture above.
