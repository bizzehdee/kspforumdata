From Steam? Because the KSP.exe (or KSP_x64.exe) was never run; it says it ran the Launcher.exe, which should not happen when running the Steam version.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Not_a_rocket_surgeon","CreatedById":120157,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-02T01:11:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI figured it out. I was only using the default video card. Once I downloaded the correct video driver it worked just fine. BTW I tried to run the KSP_x64 shortcut from the folder and the shortcut created at install.
