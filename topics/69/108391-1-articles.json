I\u0027ll describe the issue first:\n\nI built a (very large) ship in VAB last night, it took a long time because it\u0027s complex. I did a number of test launched throughout the build process to test out various aspects of it as I went. Quite frequently the ship exploded for various reasons, but that\u0027s okay, it was testing. But a couple of times I am sure, as a part exploded, I very briefly saw a launch clamp attached to the ship, and I think perhaps to the part that exploded.\n\nThis morning I completed the ship\u0027s construction and tried launching it for real, fully crewed, etc. Nearing the time when the first stage would separate (several thousand meters up), the ship exploded and I definitely, though very briefly, saw a launch clamp still attached to the ship (I believe to the part that exploded, I think it was a LFB KR-1x2 engine). So, I thought to post this in hopes that this could be researched and squashed. I created a zip folder with a screen shot, the .craft file and the .log file, which you can download from my personal website [here](http://jscript.ca/ksp-images/Launch%20Clamp%20Bug.zip). I didn\u0027t take a close look through the log file myself, it might include my entire morning\u0027s work and not just the launch itself.\n\nAlso, after the ship exploded, I tried reverting to the launch, then the KSP program hung up/crashed. Just so you know, the ship has about 500 parts.\n\n**KSP version:** \n\nbuild id = 00842\n\n2015-05-01\\_14-10-53\n\nBranch: master\n\n**What Happens:** \n\nCraft explodes, can briefly see a launch clamp still attached to ship several thousand meters up.\n\n**Mods / Add-Ons:** \n\nAll Stock\n\n**Steps to Replicate:**\n\n1) load .craft file contained in zip file (link is above)\n\n2) launch the ship\n\n**Result:** \n\nFor me, the ship explodes several thousand meters up, just a little bit before the first staging action should occur.\n\n**My Machine:**\n\n Model Name: MacBook Air\n\n Model Identifier: MacBookAir6,2\n\n Processor Name: Intel Core i7\n\n Processor Speed: 1.7 GHz\n\n Number of Processors: 1\n\n Total Number of Cores: 2\n\n L2 Cache (per Core): 256 KB\n\n L3 Cache: 4 MB\n\n Memory: 8 GB\n\n Boot ROM Version: MBA61.0099.B12\n\n SMC Version (system): 2.13f9\n\n Software: OS X 10.8.5 (12F2518)\n\n Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 5000 1024 MB\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-09T14:03:19Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2015 02:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by justidutch**"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T18:06:59Z","Content":"There seems to be a bug when you use a lot of launch clamps, I\u0027ve seen this on Linux and others have reported it on Windows, try to use as few launch clamps as possible."}]}
