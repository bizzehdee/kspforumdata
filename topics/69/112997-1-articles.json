Speed \u003E15m/s\n\n3) When close to the anomaly(maybe 100m), engage the brakes.\n\n**Result:** Craft will rapidly accelerate. This doesn\u0027t happen on the runway, or on the grass on the other side of the runway.\n\n**Fixes/Workarounds:**\n\n- None that I know of\n\n**Other Notes/Pictures/Log Files:** \n\n- This will work with mixed gear, although it depends on the brake torque. If you reduce the torque on the medium gear, the other gear can stop you on the same terrain. \n\n- Example craft using mixed gear: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/z0mospjptz64njj/Buggy%20Brakes.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/z0mospjptz64njj/Buggy%20Brakes.craft?dl=0)"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T18:33:30Z","Content":"There\u0027s a known issue with wheels, please use the Claws unofficial patch until this is fixed."}]}
