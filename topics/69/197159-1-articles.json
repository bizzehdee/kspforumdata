Unfortunately, still, many software titles ignore this, especially games. This leads to people assigning blame to Microsoft, blame to software/game developers and such recommendations like \u0022run it as an administrator\u0022 (which is very bad except may be for \u0022first run\u0022 situations, where some additional setup steps may be required).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo prevent such problems for all games, the first thing I do on a new PC is create C:\\Games and install all games to this structure, including Steam (or a least, the Steam game library). Actually, you can name it anything you want and even put it on other drives than C:, the only thing important is, that it is a folder you created by yourself, one that was not created and UAC-protected by Windows. Windows will not UAC-protect folders you created yourself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFollowing this advice, you\u0027ll never have the need to use \u0022run as administrator\u0022 every time (even if the game manufacturer tells you otherwise) and the games are able to write into their own folders, even if they should not. Therefore, less risk for malware, since you\u0027re no longer using elevated user rights (administrator access).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope this makes sense to you and helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-24T12:40:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223871801\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022197159\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221603477411\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022153446\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sfhq\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n17 hours ago, sfhq said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, strictly speaking, this is NOT Microsoft\u0027s fault (this time).

Having a tested backup on a different (and ideally remote) machine. Preferably a filesystem on said machine that is only accessible by tightly controlled backup scripts (e.g ssh as a dedicated no-shell user with \u0027forced-commands-only\u0027 set).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have personally had a machine compromised exactly once, (by a bot \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E) and entirely through my own stupidity (creating a user with an obvious password for guest access at a party, and forgetting to deny ssh login).\u003Cbr\u003E\nRecovery was as simple as a ctrl-alt-sysrq-k; cat \u0026lt;restore_script\u0026gt;; sh \u0026lt;restore_script\u0026gt;, and I was back like nothing happened in under 10 minutes.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe number of times I have restored backups for other reasons, be it hardware failures or simply me doing something destructive, is beyond counting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe could indeed, though it\u0027s a pretty convoluted solution to a simple problem.

Sure; full system backups are the norm in a production/business environment where every second down is thousands in lost income. But for your average home user who has a decently fast internet connection? Do you really need all 1.5TB of games rolled into your ISO? Or just a snapshot of your preferred OS with your absolutely needed applications ( 7zip, Blender, Programming utilities etc.) and your documents? That in my experience is normally fine, and comes in closer to \u0026lt;200GB for Windows 10.\u00A0 With a fast SSD and USB 3.0 flashdrive; i can be back up and working in a few minutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd since if i need to get back up that urgently usually the last thing on my mind is games, those are normally fine downloading in the background.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yeah, it is convoluted.
