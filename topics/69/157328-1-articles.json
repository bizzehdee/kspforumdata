All of my shielded docking ports no longer allow me to dock, whether on a vessel in flight or when building them from scratch. The animation works fine, but there\u0027s no magnetic attraction and it won\u0027t dock.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI remember seeing this a long time ago on the forums, and there was a thread that recommended modifying the gamesave persistent.sfs file. If anyone remembers this and can point me to the old thread, or can let me know how to re-enable my shielded docking ports, I\u0027d greatly appreciate the help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-05T14:26:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/130421-seaview123/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022130421\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/130421-seaview123/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Seaview123\u003C/a\u003E, this is happening between two new vessels?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it\u0027s only with shielded docking ports that were already launched, even then trying to dock with a new port, it could be the file, and if you upload it somewhere we can take a look.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it\u0027s between any craft including new ones that suggests the install is damaged, if you have KSP on Steam I suggest you \u003Ca href=\u0022https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2037-QEUH-3335\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Everify the cache\u003C/a\u003E and see if it helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-09T15:08:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might try the KML tool in the first post on this thread:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/32913-cant-undock-bug-how-to-fix/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0026amp;comment=2647440\u0026amp;embedComment=2647440\u0026amp;embedDo=findComment\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know this is the opposite of the problem you are having, but I think the tool can fix your issue, too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-09T15:31:22Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2017 03:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seaview123","CreatedById":130421,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-29T01:21:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the help, folks. I found that there\u0027s a mod I\u0027m running which affects the rotational angle which the docking ports contact. By spinning my craft I was able to get the ports to mate. In the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, there are now settings for what angles the ports would mate at, and for new vessels I now have to remember to set the ports to 360 degrees. I\u0027m not sure which mod I\u0027d installed is making this effect, but it\u0027s interesting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
