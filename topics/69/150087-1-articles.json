I want to use my existing quicksave that i use since 1.0.5. its sandbox but i have massive progress done in it. i have rovers and probes on most of celestial bodies in the kerbol system and few ongoing missions. transfer from 1.0.5 to 1.1.3 worked, but when i open it in 1.2, things like communication networks (things that ar new to 1.2) dont work. Communication thing in upper left corner isnt showing up with old quicksave, but when i crate new save, it works. Also, i cant aim my camera. KerbNet doesnt work because there is no connection to ground stations.\u00A0when i opened quicksave as a text file and looked for game version it said 1.1.3. i tried to change it to 1.2 but that doesnt work. Also, my saves are\u00A0modded if that helps (im using usi ls, usi mks lite, eve, asteroid day, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003Ekis\u003C/abbr\u003E and few\u00A0part mods)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ndoes anyone know how to transfer quicksaves from 1.1.3 to 1.2 WITHOUT losing features?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-15T18:12:26Z\u0022 title=\u002210/15/2016 06:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by notJebKerman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-15T15:54:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving to Technical Support.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you be more specific about \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eexactly\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E which features \u0022don\u0027t work\u0022, and also exactly what you mean when you say \u0022don\u0027t work\u0022?\u00A0 Statements of the form \u0022I expect X but observe Y instead\u0022 are helpful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you checked your game settings?\u00A0 There are a lot more new settings in 1.2, including the ability to enable/disable CommNet, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raznag","CreatedById":151221,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-16T20:40:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have the same problem here, CommNet is not working in my old saved game (I\u0027m playing Science) but when I start a new game the commnet icon on top of the tracking station appear but not with my \u0027\u0027regular\u0027\u0027 game. \u00A0My game is\u00A0unmodded. \u00A0I don\u0027t have any setting to enable/disable CommNet, the only thing I have is \u0027\u0027KerbNet\u00A0Map Aligns with Orbit\u0027\u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-17T09:28:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou need to turn commnet on in the settings panel, while playing press escape, click on difficulty settings, you will see options on the following screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raznag","CreatedById":151221,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-17T10:24:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk Got it now! \u00A0Thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
