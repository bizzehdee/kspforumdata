I updated from 1.2.1 to 1.2.2 and have noticed a fairly game breaking glitch within my install. I get really good 40 - 60 FPS below 200 ish parts, but as soon as i go over the FPS drops to 5 to 10. For seemingly no reason. Happens to all vehicles excedeing 200 parts and FPS doesnt drop any lower for craft that even have over 1000 parts. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n0 - 200 parts = 40 -60 fps\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGreater than 200 parts = 5 - 10 fps.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really need some help with this please anyone. All my projects are craft over 200 parts. Before the update i would get no lower than 25 FPS on my biggest craft and now the lag is unbearable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI reinstalled, 4 times, completely erased everything from the steam cloud and reinstalled, reinstalled and launch OUTSIDE of steam, and completely deleted all of my projects\u00A0i worked hours on off my computer. Nothing has helped. Is there a way to revert back to 1.2.1? My other computer is not subject to this problem though i cant exceed 200 parts purely because of the technical specs. There is no set part count where lag drops on that PC. FPS decreases normally with part count like every other computer in the world does, except my laptop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHELP PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-26T21:09:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you have not supplied any technical specs or log files for your laptop it is hard to give you any advice.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIs it integrated graphics?
