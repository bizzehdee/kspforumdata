It was planned as a huge fuel supply for my orbital station. The building process was pretty long inculding some errors and fixes but in the end it worked out and I had my facilty completed. It wobbled a bit upon loading and shaked due to some clipping errors with the drills but nothing crucial until the tanks got heavier because of fuel getting loaded into them. I created an album to show my problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wanted to know if I can edit the safegame file in a way that the tanks are on the exact same level as the root part to avoid clipping into the ground or if I can change the root part to the lowest part. Also will this bug be fixed in the next version? In my opinion the altitude of a vessel from the ground should be calculated by the lowest part, not by the root part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease help, I spent a whole week building this and its pretty frustrating.

Luckily, it started only to happen at the edge of the base, and destroyed a pipeline extension I planned to put there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe point is: You cannot build large ground bases... period. You simply can\u00B4t. If part count doesn\u0027t kills you in the meanwhile, sooner or later they will encounter terrain and until squad finds a way to let them dig a little into moon dust... there is no way. Another solution would be to level terrain (i think someone, somewhere, would be making a mod for that).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are, currently, 2 workarounds, for future bases,\u00A0as far as my experience with this annoyance goes:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Use Klaws to connect buildings, they are cumbersome, ugly and totally un-realistic, but since you can \u0022flex\u0022 them by unlocking the pivot, they help solving the problem of going around terrain..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Use landing legs. Put everything on landing legs, I even designed some base modules using landing legs, panels (for good looks) and docking ports, and then I wil lower my fuel tanks on top of them, each base takes 3 sr doking ports facing UP, and several docking ports and small docking ports facing the other sides. thus allowing more modules to be attached to each other. But each module rests on landing legs, several of them, to support large fuel tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut... even these workarounds have limits, do try not to stretch your base too much along a single direction and make it more circular.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, and by the way, unless for good looking reasons, you need only one ore tank and one ISRU, and a few drills, just enough so that the whole thing works 24/7 on the energy package you have, the only thing you need to have plenty is fuel tanks, of course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESO,\u00A0on to\u00A0some PRACTICAL ADVICE:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince you already have the base in place and, obviously, do not want to waste all those hours (believe me,\u00A0I know what that means...(sad, rolling eyes \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E )) Try to find the troublesome end.

(particularly on low gravity moons)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt will waste huge amounts of fuel up and down but it will save countless game hours doing the landing - docking routine of multiple smaller ships\u00A0which is always more complex, although fun, when you\u0027re talking docking at a ground station, and will prevent the inevitable clipping into terrain problems that occur with permanent ground bases...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-21T12:04:54Z\u0022 title=\u002203/21/2016 12:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Jaeleth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Broco","CreatedById":4320,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-21T13:06:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey, thanks for your reply, though it takes a lot of hope away from me.

However, since docking ports work in pairs I would try to find the other docking port\u00A0\u00A0that connects with that one and move it the same amount. Another idea is to detach the ports, in game, relocate the port, editing game file, and then try to inch the whole structure up again, to dock. You will also have to reset the magnet, (which will imply more game file editing or a ship that\u0027s capable of pushing the whole thing back and forth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbut... Before that, I would really try to use Hyperedit, it is very easy once you get the precise coordinates where you are and where you want to relocate your base, maybe selecting different terrain slope will solve your problem.
