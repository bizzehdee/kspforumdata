I removed the mods and I am still crashing to the desktop with a nameplate of the game in the top left of my screen, and another window of the report crash. It was working perfectly yesterday. Then I installed a new cooler and i7 7700k oced to 5ghz, i ran a stable 2 hr stress test. But I think it might have to do with the evga clc 280 ui.
