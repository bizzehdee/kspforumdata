IIRC it hasn\u0027t really been supported officially since the Alpha versions of the game. Find the .exe shortcut in the directory and copy it to somewhere like your desktop, then you have a direct shortcut to launch the game. You should update the game from Steam if you have it on there, rather than using the launcher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-10-05T15:01:26Z\u0022 title=\u002210/05/2018 03:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 5, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by RealKerbal3x\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sounthernrebel78","CreatedById":38590,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-05T15:11:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI download from the KSP store directly.
