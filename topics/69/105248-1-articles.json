I put Jeb from the stranded ship to mine.\n\nAfter I took Bob. As soon as I clicked EVA and bob got out, both ship seperated and were sent km away of each others\n\nI guess the 2nd problem is not only related to the Docking Tutorial, but for now it\u0027s the only EVA that I did"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T04:51:15Z","Content":"Tried the docking training. Everything was fine until undocking when the rescue ship glitched, wouldn\u0027t move when thrust was applied and it dissassembled and exploded on time warp. Tried it a second time, again all was good until undocking. After undock focus was on the stranded ship so I \u0022]\u0022 keyed to change ships. The speed indicator on the navball looked glitchy so I hit the \u0022]\u0022 key again to change back the rescue ship and it again dissassembled itself.\n\nThe game then needed to be shut down and re started."}]}
