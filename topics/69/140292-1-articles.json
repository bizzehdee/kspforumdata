Firstly it starts at about 2gb (which I think is a pretty ok level for it to be at) but once in the vab the amount of ram allocated increases at an exponential rate, From about 1gb/m to almost 4gb/m, and as a result it freezes and I have to close the game from the task manager... any clue as to why this happens?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-22T08:47:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really can\u0027t see this being an unmodded issue or it would\u0027ve been reported before. \u00A0It is most likely a clash between different mods or simply a bug in one mod and your unmodded game is less unmodded than you think.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you read this thread:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83213-please-read-before-posting-stock-support-bug-reporting-guide/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...and upload an output_log.txt/player.log file as this is the only thing likely to contain any clues to what is going on...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-23T03:29:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, provide a .craft or whatever you were doing.
