I have tried using fins with built-in control surfaces, suh as the FAT-455, and I have tried putting on a fin and adding the control surfaces seperately, and neither will work. The yaw indicator at the bottom left shows that I am yawing to the left and right, but the control surfaces don\u0027t move. I have tried disabling everything but yaw, and can only get it to work when I deploy it and use the yaw action group to change the angle at which it deploys. I would fly with that fix but it does not return to neutral automatically and that is a feature I would like to use.\u00A0 Attached is a picture of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Screenshot2024072721.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002251.75\u0022 height=\u0022499\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://u.cubeupload.com/GGaF/Screenshot2024072721.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-28T03:34:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s a pretty massive plane. It likely needs more force or \u0022control authority\u0022 anyway. But as for the control surface not moving, do you have the same problem on smaller planes or is it just this one?

Since my probe core is facing upwards I am assuming it is messing with the way the control surfaces have been moving. placing the probe core facing forward has fixed it.
