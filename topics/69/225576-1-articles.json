I have tried using fins with built-in control surfaces, suh as the FAT-455, and I have tried putting on a fin and adding the control surfaces seperately, and neither will work. The yaw indicator at the bottom left shows that I am yawing to the left and right, but the control surfaces don\u0027t move. I have tried disabling everything but yaw, and can only get it to work when I deploy it and use the yaw action group to change the angle at which it deploys. I would fly with that fix but it does not return to neutral automatically and that is a feature I would like to use.\u00A0 Attached is a picture of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Screenshot2024072721.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002251.75\u0022 height=\u0022499\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://u.cubeupload.com/GGaF/Screenshot2024072721.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-28T03:34:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s a pretty massive plane.
