Now I went to continue playing, and the game won\u0027t launch. It loads all the parts. Then when it\u0027s done, it shows the orbiting planets \u0022Loading...\u0022 in the bottom right, loading the menu. After a moment, when the menu should pop up, the game stops running. I have no clue why. I also don\u0027t know what\u0027s important to post here for diagnostics (Save files? Game folder? System specs? Mother\u0027s maiden name?) so if there\u0027s anything that would be helpful I\u0027ll be glad to post it, just ask for whatever\u0027s useful.

Try editing your settings.cfg file and set TEXTURE_QUALITY = 1 (or even 2 or 3). Then reload the game and see if it starts up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was running into the same problem. KSP was asking for a lot of memory right when it tries to load the main menu (grabbing lots of texture space). I\u0027m not sure if this is a KSP bug or a problem with the memory management underneath.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
