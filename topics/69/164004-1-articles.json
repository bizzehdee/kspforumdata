There are two tests you can do (in my experience) to analyze\u00A0the situation. Something like this has happened to me before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, are the staging icons not in any stage, the same way they are if you have, for example, an engine that is not attached to your spacecraft? And second, if you click on a pod from the parts menu, does it drop in the middle of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, without attaching to the rocket like it was the first part you put down?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf so, the only solution I could find was to reassemble the rocket. I hope your spacecraft isn\u0027t as complicated as mine was. (It was a Martian-type Duna Ascent Vehicle. Over a hundred parts on the spacecraft alone, not to mention the rocket, because this was in the bad old days before Autostrut.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReally hope you and I have different problems. It\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emight not\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ebe, because in my case clicking on a part of the rocket in question duplicated it and it had the same problem as the rest of the rocket. Also, if you rebuild the craft from scratch and it experiences terrible glitches upon loading on the launchpad, remove any farings that may be on the rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
