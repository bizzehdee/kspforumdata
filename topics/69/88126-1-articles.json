All you can do is go to full throttle really quickly (hit \u0022Z\u0022) then immediately cut the throttle to zero (hit \u0022X\u0022). That will allow the computer to recalculate and give you an appropriate burn time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Attilion","CreatedById":126726,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T11:32:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the tip, not very energy-efficient, but useful \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
