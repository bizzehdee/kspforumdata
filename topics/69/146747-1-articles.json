When physics kicks in, asteroids with anchored craft wobble madly, way faster than such majestic bodies should. And when you undock a craft, things spring and sometimes explode. If more stuff is anchored, the effect is more pronounced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my yesterday\u0027s refueling rush, I finally saw what I believe is the origin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the asteroid is mined, its mass reduced, it shrinks. Physically, the potato gets smaller.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA klaw anchored to it still remains anchored to the surface. But the point where the klaw physically is - doesn\u0027t move!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had some things anchored to that one depleted \u0027roid. I remember explicitly I was anchoring them to the visible surface. Now they are floating - and not just a bit, but good ten meters above the asteroid! Still attached to the \u0027void\u0027 as firmly as ever. But if I anchor new stuff, it anchors to the new surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo - there is this strain - the link between the klaw and the surface is no longer millimeters between where the klaw is, and where the surface is - it\u0027s the two stretched apart good ten meters. Now if I detach anything, it will shot off like from a cannon - and the asteroid will shot in the opposite direction. And of course as physics kicks in, these extremely strained links assert themselves - and stuff wobbles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
