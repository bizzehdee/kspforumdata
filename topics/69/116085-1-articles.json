I\u0027ve found one strange bug in 1.0.4. There is no engine exhaust damage. In 1.0.2 version something like that could destroy fuel tank in less than a second. In 1.0.4 everything i did cause no result. Is this only my problem?\n\n![aDMEEFz.png](http://i.imgur.com/aDMEEFz.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T17:35:09Z","Content":"Hi dimitriy, try opening the flight log (alt\u002BF3) and look for damage being reported."},{"CreatedByName":"dimitriy","CreatedById":148178,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T17:53:42Z","Content":"It has notes about damage, but I meant total destruction of the part (fuel tank in this example)."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T18:39:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It has notes about damage, but I meant total destruction of the part (fuel tank in this example).\n\nThen it\u0027s doing damage, please keep going till it overheats or is damaged enough to explode, lots of things were changed for 1.0.x and parts blowing up too easily was one of them ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"dimitriy","CreatedById":148178,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T13:33:10Z","Content":"Well, here is my results. \n\nI was trying to overheat lots of parts with different engines and their amount.
