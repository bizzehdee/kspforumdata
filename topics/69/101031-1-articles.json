Might wanna try swapping batteries if you have an extra laying around somewhere. If you are jacking straight from the wall, try using battery only and see if it changes. That would suggest a bad power feed before it gets to the battery. Just a few Ideas. \n\n instant power offs are almost always cause by heat or weak power feed.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I have some mods (KER, KAS Lazor docking cam and B9 parts) so I realize that this is the wrong forum... but my brand new computer is doing the same thing and it wipes out my quicksave and persistant files as well...

Turns out when I ordered the computer, they put a chief-max 650 Watt power source in it. They are notorious for putting out 1/2 wattage.. hence I didn\u0027t have enough juice to power my vid-card, and it would shut down instantly.

I\u0027m not sure what the PSU is, but my son did a fresh KSP install and my mods...He had to crank all the graphics settings down to minimum for it to stay running. I will be looking into a better PSU soon. KSP on minimum graphics is a sad place indeed. BTW, the core settings had no effect at all...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-05T12:46:24Z\u0022 title=\u002203/05/2015 12:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by vixr**"},{"CreatedByName":"tsaven","CreatedById":138869,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T04:30:07Z","Content":"It seems to be graphics related, I\u0027ve found after more testing that it\u0027s basically as soon as I go into the actual launching or viewing craft in orbit. I can far around building rockets in the VAB all day with no problems, but now after I go to launch, it shuts off within ten seconds of launching.\n\nI\u0027m watching all the temperatures and they\u0027re not out of range, GPU is in the low 70s and CPU cores are in the high 50s. \n\nI can\u0027t be sure about power, it\u0027s a very old laptop (Bought it new in early 2008) and the battery is in quite bad shape, probably can\u0027t get more than 20 minutes out of it if I tried. However, I\u0027ve tried removing the battery and only using wall power, or using just the battery, and I still get the same result. Hard power-offs.\n\nOddly, no other intensive program does this, I can do plenty of other gaming and other intensive applications with no problems (aside from overall slowness that I expect from the system of it\u0027s age.)"}]}
