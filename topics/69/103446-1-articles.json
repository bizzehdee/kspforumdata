I\u0027m using a Mac (prepare for Mac hate).\n\nI don\u0027t know how to upload an image from my computer onto the KSP forums (I have 2 screenshots saved onto my computer), but it causes a really large shadow inside the VAB/SPH that takes up about half of the screen, and when playing the actual game itself.\n\nIt doesn\u0027t make the game unplayable, but it\u0027s ruining my experience. The bug only goes away once I completely exit KSP and I don\u0027t know what causes it. I really hope it\u0027s fixed soon because it\u0027s really harming my (and no doubt other\u0027s) KSP experience.\n\nThanks."},{"CreatedByName":"Tom7896","CreatedById":140502,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T14:50:48Z","Content":"Correction: I took 5 screenshots of the bug inside the VAB and in-game, and made an album on imgur.

You can try fiddling with the graphics yourself, for starters try to mess with with \u0022Pixel light count\u0022 and \u0022Shadow Cascades\u0022. It may be just a particular setting that does the problem.\n\nIf that doesn\u0027t help, try reinstalling. But before you do that, make sure it\u0027s not just one save that does it. \n\nI\u0027m pretty sure this doesn\u0027t happen too often, so the problem is likely in your particular install / setting."},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T20:42:48Z","Content":"It\u0027s a bug caused by poor memory management in KSP, especially in OS X Yosemite. KSP is a 32-bit program, so it\u0027s limited to 4 GB of addressable memory. Out of that 4 GB, around 0.5 GB is reserved for shared libraries, leaving 3.5 GB for the actual game. Due to poor memory management, possible memory leaks, and possible bugs in some GPU drivers shipped with Yosemite, KSP keeps using more and more memory when you switch between VAB and flight scenes. Eventually the address space becomes too fragmented (another sign of poor memory management) and memory allocations begin to fail, even though there is still hundreds of megabytes of free memory out of that 3.5 GB. The first symptoms are often graphics glitches, such as giant shadows and disco lights.\n\nThere is no fix at the moment. Lowering the graphics settings will help, though. As the initial memory usage is lower, you can play longer sessions of KSP before the glitches start to happen."},{"CreatedByName":"Tom7896","CreatedById":140502,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T20:15:24Z","Content":"Thanks guys.
