Your fix didn\u0026#39;t work but thank you for mentioning \u0022windowed mode\u0022! That set me off trying to experiment. I tried a ton of different timings and combinations, but it turns out the simpler one did the trick: if I turn Fullscreen off [I]right[/I] when KSP launches out of Steam (\u00C3\u00A2\u00C5\u2019\u00CB\u0153F) then my orbits are drawn! RELIEF! I can play the game now.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks everyone.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs an aside, I look forward to the 1.1/U5 fix. The whole UI is kind of a buggy piece-of-s*** for Mac users. Still playable, but highly annoying. OH well. I love the game so much I play anyway. Don\u0026#39;t tell Squad.\n"}]}
