They look like they should attach and glow green as if they will attach. I even turn off part clipping and the issue persists and breaks the game slightly\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods / Add-Ons: None\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESteps to Replicate: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Have a subassemly ready that you built in the VAB. Maybe some sort of fueltank bomb\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Go to the SPH and turn on symmetry mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. attempt to attach a bomb to the underside of your aircraft\u0027s wing or anywhere in general. if you try to mount it to a connection node, the node will disappear\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResult: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you cant put the subassembly down unless you delete it. If you click on the plane, you cant put it back down. If you want to get out of this hell, you will need to reload your plane. If you try launching, the game locks up. If you click exit, the button does nothing. this makes wing mounted bombs impossible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFixes/Workarounds: None that i can figure out\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther Notes/Pictures/Log Files: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot available ATM.
