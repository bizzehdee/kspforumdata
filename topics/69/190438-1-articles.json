For some reason my Minmus mining base is rotating since I upgraded to KSP 1.8. It used to be stable while deployed on Minmus. Ever since I landed it, it stood rock solid with the solar panels facing north and south to collect all the sunlight. Now it rotates. After I expanded the base by an additional module, it rotates by one degree every 4 seconds!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried fiddling with the landing struts damper settings, resetting them to auto, hibernating the probe core, removing the engineer from the lander can, activating \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, nothing worked.
