AND this allows for you to abuse this mechanic. You can choose which cycles of your orbit experience aerobraking, and which don\u0027t, by either loading your ship or watching it from the tracking station.\n\nI think the fix for this should be that if your ship\u0027s orbit dips into the atmosphere at any point in it\u0027s orbit, it should have to be destroyed in order to return to the space center.\n\nAnyone else notice this/share the same opinion on the fix?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T07:45:23Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 07:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Supernovy**"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T01:47:33Z","Content":"It\u0027s been this way since basically the beginning. Ships won\u0027t be removed until they reach 0.01 atmospheric pressure or higher (might be a bit different in 1.0 now), the limits of which are on the [KSP wiki](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Atmosphere). In some ways it makes sense since the acceleration they would feel is generally pretty low. But I also would be fine with extending that range to 1.5 times or so, since at 25km on Kerbin you will definitely see some serious aerobraking."},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T07:46:39Z","Content":"The no-aerobraking-when-unfocussed thing is intended, as is the altitude/pressure at which the game deletes craft.\n\nAtmospheric physics range is 22.5km in stock, now, however."},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T13:17:53Z","Content":"I\u0027d be happy with an increase in the delete height myself, I reckon 30km would be fair."},{"CreatedByName":"Bug_","CreatedById":140851,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T05:04:08Z","Content":"The acceleration they feel can actually cause some significant changes in the orbit.
