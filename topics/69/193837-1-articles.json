I recently installed KSP 1.9 (unmoded) and it worked terribly (high temperature and 5-10 fps), previously I played version 1.4 or 1.3 a few years ago on the same computer and I didn\u0027t have this problem even with many mods. What is the reason? High terrain resolution in new versions? I\u00A0 don\u0027t know much about hardware, maybe only one core or something works?

Multi-core processors don\u2019t help and a slower processor will really struggle to run the game especially with larger ships inside his is range.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow old is your laptop? It\u2019s possible that the game updates since then are just too much for it to take, or that you\u2019re running mods that are putting too much strain on your hardware. Remove parts mods if you can and anything else CPU intensive (graphics mods tend to be OK as the graphics card doesn\u2019t work that hard compared to the CPU/RAM) and that might make the game run faster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zxy44","CreatedById":187884,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-13T14:06:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProblem is that on the older version even with many mods, the game worked better than on version 1.9 without mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cavscout74","CreatedById":181783,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-13T20:07:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/187884-zxy44/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022187884\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/187884-zxy44/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Zxy44\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst off, let me just say that I am not a hardware expert by any measure.\u00A0 However, it strikes me as odd you are having problems with 1.9 as the new unity version KSP switched to in 1.8 generally runs better than previous versions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would guess its due to the CPU, I believe that is a 4th gen CPU which is pretty old (2013).\u00A0\u00A0Just yesterday, I was told by the IT department at my job that we can\u0027t install an offline standalone version of our aircraft maintenance manuals on any of our computers because the standalone requires a core i5 processor, and all our computers are i3\u0027s - so it might be an issue where the new Unity engine needs a newer CPU.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you listed 1.7GB did you mean Mhz?\u00A0 If so, that is a little slow - KSP doesn\u0027t need multiple cores so much as raw speed on a single core due to physics calculations not being too easy to share.\u00A0\u00A0 Most newer laptops I\u0027ve looked at had 2.3 Mhz base speed (and I just bought one last month due to a catastrophic coffee spill)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso being an older laptop, I\u0027m guessing cooling isn\u0027t as good as newer ones - and even my new one gets pretty warm running KSP with dual fans.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8GB ram \u0026amp; pretty much any graphics card should be plenty for stock KSP, so unless there is something wrong, neither should be the issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour best bet might be to use an older version (pre-1.8) until you can upgrade your system.\u00A0 It kinda sucks, but if it was working before it should at least allow you some KSP time even if you miss the newest bells \u0026amp; whistles.\u00A0 The second DLC was actually released for 1.7.2 IIRC, so you can still get that if interested.\u00A0 I don\u0027t recommend using my method to get an upgrade (spilled coffee next to laptop, while I was grabbing paper towels, it ran under the laptop \u0026amp; got sucked up by the cooling fan \u0026amp; distributed throughout the laptop resulting in lots of popping noises \u0026amp; smoke), as I really wasn\u0027t ready to spend that money at the time.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-13T20:14:36Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2020 08:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Cavscout74\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
