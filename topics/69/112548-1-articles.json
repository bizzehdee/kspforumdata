(I started it because my previous saves were glitched out from the previous game versions;.![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nYea. So its been freezing randomly every half hour. The last time came only 10 min after the previous. Some of them report errors, some not, but they all end the same, and it does not matter what I am doing. They have been increasing in frequency and although it seems to save the moment it crashes its becoming so frequent its unplayable; not even enough time to land my craft from a low orbit ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nI run windows 8.0\n\n8gb ram\n\ni5 4690k OC watercooled to 4.25mhz\n\n2gb 6950 AMD GPU\n\nHere is my persistence save; [https://www.dropbox.com/s/n09fmnup907fbxx/persistent.sfs?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/n09fmnup907fbxx/persistent.sfs?dl=0)\n\nand some crash reports, most recent first\n\n [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/4unrri6ari35kiw/AAAApY1-RsI0LOznZ82ULa_ca?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/4unrri6ari35kiw/AAAApY1-RsI0LOznZ82ULa_ca?dl=0)\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/2ga8n52kz9okb4z/AAASaWNJnjRtlwxhwke0rgm3a?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/2ga8n52kz9okb4z/AAASaWNJnjRtlwxhwke0rgm3a?dl=0)\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/a0jybjqn1vcpfdc/AAB0MMk3MGbglBJ1cmF4suVHa?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/a0jybjqn1vcpfdc/AAB0MMk3MGbglBJ1cmF4suVHa?dl=0)\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0z4grjdydhkusrx/AABMvot9MinngwFQokDfiMkTa?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0z4grjdydhkusrx/AABMvot9MinngwFQokDfiMkTa?dl=0)\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fr6zrg728j1uf7g/AABpjnz2tFIuHSPw70G6JZ8Ma?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fr6zrg728j1uf7g/AABpjnz2tFIuHSPw70G6JZ8Ma?dl=0)\n\nLet me know if anymore info is needed. This is really a pain in the ass as ive been playing all through the night:confused: and it didn\u0027t used to be like this earlier.

Known problems should be fixed. Get rid of temp gauges until it is fixed."}]}
