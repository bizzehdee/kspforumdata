The problem is only fixed after a restart of the computer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe CPU does not appear to be at high demand. While playing KSP everything flows nicely, no stutter at all. After quitting KSP the computer the fans for the CPU and RAM reduces RPM and stabilize at an idle speed. Still the performance of the computer appears to be as if it was under very, very high demand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExamples of issues: Starting a web browser takes a very long time. After clicking on an icon on the desktop it takes ages before it is marked/selected. Clicking on anything down in the lower right corner of the task bar only shows the frame for a long time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help solving this problem would be highly appreciated. It is annoying having to restart the computer after every play of KSP...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-23T17:48:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah I experience the same issue. I think it\u0027s a Windows 10 issue itself. I\u0027m not technical in any fashion, but from what I\u0027ve seen poking around on my computer, when KSP gets stuck after I tell it to close, it opens a \u0022Windows Troubleshoot Logger\u0022 or something like that and it tends to eat up 5% of my APU. Which with KSP frozen at 80% and generally other programs pushing my overall power to 98%, my entire computer starts to lock up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo it\u0027s possibly something with Windows just not killing the program but rather trying to solve it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust a guess.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
