(In other words, you see the craft rendered on top of the map mode background which shows kerbin/space/orbits of multiple craft, etc.\n\nI\u0027m not sure if the intent is for the game to switch out of map mode due to the part exploding, but it is a weird combination of things being rendered.\n\nGameplay is otherwise unaffected, switching out of map mode will restore the \u0022normal\u0022 view you have of your craft, switching back into map mode again restores map mode to \u0022normal\u0022.\n\nI\u0027ve never exploded anything on rentry yet while in map mode (since I have no purpose for map mode on reentry to kerbin), but it may be possible to produce this bug with other means of causing overheating.\n\nP.S. Yes, I understand you shouldn\u0027t go that fast in the atmosphere, but early hard career mode forces you to do unadvised things to get to orbit with the tech you\u0027ve got and part limitations that exist in the non upgraded facilities."}]}
