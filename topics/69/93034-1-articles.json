When I go into map view and my engine is firing, not only does the volume of the engine SFX change (as if i\u0027m changing throttle) but it also pans from one ear to another in a very weird way when the map camera is moved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure everyone has come across this issue (I think I\u0027ve heard it in many a youtube video), but I would just like to bring it up and see if there is a fix I am just ignorant of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Ps.
