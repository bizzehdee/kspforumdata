It\u0027s nice that there\u0027s a mod that lets you adjust the angle that precisely, but it\u0027s a bug that it\u0027s even necessary to do so in the first place. Real planes don\u0027t magically teleport into existence above the runway and then drop down onto it, therefore any problems that occur as an effect of that should be properly viewed as an undesirable artifact of the simulation, rather than a thing players should have to compensate for in their gameplay. One simple fix would be to design a bit of taxiway just off the edge of the foot of the runway that, unlike the rest of the runway, is indestructable, and have the spawning happen there. Make the indestrucable part just one patch big enough to handle whatever the SPH lets you make and no more. That way people still have to deal with landing planes on the destructable runway and the consequences of doing so poorly, because one patch of indestructable surface isn\u0027t enough to land on - just enough to spawn on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T19:00:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think anyone has seriously suggested that.

Sensible is sized appropriately to do the job. I haven\u0027t found anything to do that requires an aircraft big enough to trash the runway on takeoff. Even my bulk fuel tankers and heavy cargo lifters tend to top out at about 125 ton.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that\u0027s just me; plenty of other folks like to build huge things, and that\u0027s all cool. There is no one true way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure, Squad messed up a bit [1] by not smoothing out the initial physics drop and setting the destruction thresholds of the runway and launchpad too low, but I don\u0027t think that the basic concept of destructible launchpads/runways is a bad idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I stuff up a landing and slam a large aircraft into the runway at crash speeds, it \u003Cstrong\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eshould \u003C/em\u003Etake the runway temporarily out of commission. If a design stuffup on my part means that my rocket slams into the ground the moment I try to launch, it \u003Cem\u003Eshould \u003C/em\u003Edamage the launchpad in the process. That\u0027s what happens in reality, and I see it as something that adds to the challenge and immersion of the game if done right. The implementation just needs a little fine tuning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe nature of KSP is changing, from a pure sandbox toolkit to a tycoon game with strong sandbox elements. This is going to happen; it\u0027s been the stated goal from the beginning, and it\u0027s a direction that a lot of players are happy with. But Squad are maintaining science and sandbox mode, and pretty much all of the new elements are optional or avoidable. If you want to continue playing ye olde style KSP, you can. Nobody has to do a testing contract or watch a building explode unless they choose to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI play in the sandbox, and I also play career. Sometimes I enjoy the freedom of sandbox mode, but often I find that working within constraints is more interesting. It\u0027s a free verse vs haiku sorta deal; formal constraints can limit creativity, but they can also inspire it. They\u0027ve both got their place, and there is no good reason to say that one is better than the other except in terms of personal preference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[1] Actually, a lot of the glitches in .25 make me wonder what the Experimentals team were doing for the few weeks they had the game. Did no-one try to launch a huge rocket? Why didn\u0027t anyone notice how OP\u0027d Outsourced R\u0026amp;D is? Etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
