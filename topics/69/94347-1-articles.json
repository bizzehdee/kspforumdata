Whenever I try to put fuel tanks underneath or on top of other radially mounted parts, I can\u0027t. They just go sideways and I\u0027ve tried to rotate them every single way (Also using the shift mode as well) but it just won\u0027t work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/H2uSjJe.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022H2uSjJe.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease help??\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Boomerang","CreatedById":92198,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-24T06:55:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave the tanks oriented so that the long axis is vertical, then hold down your Alt key while positioning them. That\u0027ll force node attachment only and avoid the weird surface attach features that happen when you try to cluster things so closely like that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZtheCdr","CreatedById":128427,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-24T17:32:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs Boomerang said, pressing the \u0022Mod key\u0022 will make it so parts can only be attached when their green nodes line up. Your \u0022Mod key\u0022 depends one what software you have. For example, if you have windows, then your mod key would be the \u0022Alt\u0022 key.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
