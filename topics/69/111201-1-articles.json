I was testing the new reentry heating simulation to get an estimate of how much ablator I would need for a reentry, when I discovered something strange: my ships will never burn up on reentry even if I intentionally try to destroy them and reentry difficulty is set to 100%. I ran the following experiment to highlight the problem:\n\n1) Launch a Mk1-2 command pod to a Kerbin orbit with three radially mounted parachutes and a clamp-o-tron docking port. Also, use the 2.5m heat shield with 160 ablator. \n\n2) Reenter the atmosphere from a highly eccentric orbit, or in general at an unusually large speed. e.g: ap \u003E 2,000,000m and pe \u003C 30,000.\n\n3) Repeat with 80 ablator. (smallest non-zero amount possible)\n\nOn the first run, the 160 ablator is nearly all consumed; however, there is always a tiny amount left. Amazingly, on the second run, the 80 ablator is never entirely consumed either even though nearly twice that much was burned on the previous run. I\u0027ve even tried adding extra weight to make up for the missing ablator. I\u0027ve also performed this experiment on a straight-in (i.e. vertical) reentry at ~3,000m/s incoming velocity with the same results. Indeed, the ablator consumption rates during reentry seem to be magically scaled to by the initial amount of ablator such that the shield is never completely used. \n\nI\u0027ve looked around and can\u0027t find anyone else with this problem. I had originally installed kerbal engineer, but have removed it and verified that it\u0027s not causing the strangeness."},{"CreatedByName":"DuoDex","CreatedById":107061,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T01:03:35Z","Content":"Unless I am greatly mistaken (feel free to correct me), the ablation and heatshield mechanics are still very much under construction.
