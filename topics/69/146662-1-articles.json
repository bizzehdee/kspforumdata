To my surprise I see I have the option of choosing between 32-bit and 64-bit. What should I choose to get the best experience possible? I play on a modern pc with 64-bit Windows 10. I thought I heared that 64-bit is advantageous when using mods, but I use no mods whatsoever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-27T21:35:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222732631\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022146662\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221472333291\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022153758\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Puddle Jumper\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 minutes ago, Puddle Jumper said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat should I choose to get the best experience possible?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave 64bit CPU \u0026amp; OS: Use 64bit version - there\u0027s no good reason not to and it allows the game to use more memory (probably not a big deal with stock, but much important with mods).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jas0n","CreatedById":57441,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-29T13:38:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe whole mods not supporting 64-bit is a thing of the past, when KSP 64-bit first came out.
