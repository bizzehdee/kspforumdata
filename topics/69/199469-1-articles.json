When I click the \u0027Cycle Display Mode\u0027 button in the upper left corner, nothing seems to happen - I see no noticeable change in the display, as illustrated in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/KerbNet\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbnet Wiki\u003C/a\u003E. - just Ore mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLikewise in the Tracking Station, regardless of the Cutoff % setting, the Color and Style\u00A0buttons change when I click them, but I see no apparent change in the Mun display. I see the few random waypoints I set, in different colors, but they don\u0027t change either (not sure if they\u0027re supposed to or not). And based on my reading I thought I\u0027d see a couple of anomalies on the Mun, but\u00A0\u00A0so far nothing, just a few Unknowns out beyond Minmus.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InfernoSD","CreatedById":208873,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-10T16:40:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not 100% on this, but it seems like where you access KerbNet from makes a difference.
