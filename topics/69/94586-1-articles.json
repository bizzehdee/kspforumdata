In my experience, the cause of a crash typically appears within the first few modules on the list -- standard out of memory crashes usually have KSP.exe, Mono.dll, and DirectX input .dll files, whereas crashes caused by other things (AVs, or sometimes game \u0027optimising\u0027 applications like AMD\u0027s Raptr or NVIDIA Experience) tend to list those things first or second in the error.log file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck, and try not to kill too many kerbals out there! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-26T22:46:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022RivaTuner Statistics Server\u0022 is part of the HUD/overlay that comes with many GPU driver packages.
