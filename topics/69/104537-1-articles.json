I don\u0027t know if this is a known bug.\n\nWhat happen is when I turn on the SAS(not happening when SAS is off), the rocket change its pitch randomly. It happens when the center of thrust is higher than the center of mass. This is done when I put the stock radial engine near the top. I\u0027ve also tried it with SRBs and a self made radial engine.![LGh25hp.png](http://i.imgur.com/LGh25hp.png)![5eufdr5.png](http://i.imgur.com/5eufdr5.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-20T23:07:46Z\u0022 title=\u002204/20/2015 11:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by trafalgar**"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T01:27:59Z","Content":"This is a known bug.
