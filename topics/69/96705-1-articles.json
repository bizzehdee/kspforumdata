It seems the game does not want to register that I am in the target zone. As a developer, my instincts tell me that this has something to do with another surface temperature scan which was part of the same mission, and nearly co-located - this first one completed without a hitch. I am not sure whether or not I was in both zones when doing the first scan, but it is a strong possibility. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have moved in and out of the zone several times (traveling half way around the Mun).

There are missions to perform tempscans in flight. So I flew a mission to place a probe on a polar orbit. Did this than try to meassure temp. Not possible. Lowered the orbit to unter 9000m. Still did not work. So I let the probe alone and planned a new mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust as I wrote this post I again tried and now it worked...

You are 100% not in the zone. Fly a little further NE and you\u0027re in, where the temp scan completes the contract normally. There\u0027s a message on the screen that tells you when you\u0027re entering and leaving a scan zone.
