It seems abnormally high at 1.53 units of LF/second. I understand that the oxidizer requirement was removed and that the part needs to be balanced for that, but really? Between the increased mass of the engine and the overheating, there is almost no benefit to using this engine when compared to the LV-909 \u0022Terrier\u0022 which has only a slightly higher fuel burn (1.60 units/second), a SIGNIFICANTLY lower mass (0.5 compared to the 3.0 of the LV-N), is cheaper to purchase, and doesn\u0027t have to deal with overheating. Am I the only one experiencing this? Is this a bug, or intended behavior? \n\nI also performed the \u0022rocket equation\u0022 found here ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation)) for a small test ship and figured I would have about 5.4km/s of delta-v. In testing, I only got about 3.0km/s out of it. \n\nKSP 1.0.0 for Steam\n\nNo mods"},{"CreatedByName":"TinfoilChef","CreatedById":43840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T07:02:07Z","Content":"I\u0027ve noticed that once the LV-N begins to overheat it\u0027s thrust drops drastically and doesn\u0027t return to 60KN until it cools off, could this be affecting the dv you get from it?"},{"CreatedByName":"ThomJ","CreatedById":65605,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T09:44:41Z","Content":"I haven\u0027t noticed any loss in thrust due to to overheating, at least not with the test ship. ![wRW5nms.png](http://i.imgur.com/wRW5nms.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T18:04:38Z","Content":"The LF use is doubled from .90 as they don\u0027t draw O anymore, you still need the same mass through the engine ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"ThomJ","CreatedById":65605,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T21:39:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The LF use is doubled from .90 as they don\u0027t draw O anymore, you still need the same mass through the engine\n\nI guess that makes sense, but it still doesn\u0027t explain why my delta-v calculations were way off.

The benefits of not having to carry the oxidizer on an already 40\u002B ton interplanetary drive are also pretty significant and I found that in the post above, my math was indeed off and the Dv you get is roughly the same as pre 1.0. I\u0027ve only built a couple small IP drives and I was able to send a medium sized station to Gilly (and had I not gone the wrong way around Eve I could have brought it back). So to sum up, LV-N\u0027s are still good for interplanetary travel, but only interplanetary travel (assuming the heat is dissipated properly). But if you\u0027re within the Kerbin system or sending out small probes from a larger ship (to some of Jool\u0027s moons for example), I would definitely agree that the terrier is the way to go."}]}
