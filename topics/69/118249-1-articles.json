It seems that your baseline memory usage is a bit higher and your problem threshold a bit lower, which is why the memory leaks crash the game for you but not for me.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It really seems the VAB has something to do with it.\n\nI think memory leaks have been identified in three situations, which may all be related:\n\n1. Just playing the game. Memory usage seems to increase slowly, when you rocket is sitting on the launchpad. This is pretty minor, and I\u0027m not sure whether it really is a memory leak.\n2. Scene changes, such as repeatedly launching a rocket and reverting back to the VAB. This is the fastest way to leak memory.\n3. Asset caching. KSP loads all assets on startup, but it seems to cache a second copy of the assets you have actually encountered during the game. If you keep launching and reverting the same rocket, the memory usage doesn\u0027t really increase after the first two attempts. If you use different parts in the rocket, the memory usage just keeps increasing. Similar things happen, if you fly for long distances close to the surface.\n\nRight now, the only way to avoid crashes is reducing the baseline memory usage. Relatively small differences in the baseline can mark the difference between frequent crashes and a stable game. This is why I believe that a 64-bit version would solve the problems. Until then, [Master Tao\u0027s workarounds](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/125288) are your best hope.

This is with FAR \u002B SXT \u002B Ven\u0027s \u002B KSPI \u002B a few other smaller mods like science alert, so it\u0027s okay for (lightly?) modded installs too.\n\nNote, x64 did NOT work with a big RSS \u002B RO \u002B FASA modded install.

The difference is that the process will happily keep running at up to 50GB used. At this point my MacOS starts complaining about running of space on the system partition due to the ever-growing swap file. Still, it takes a loooong time to reach that point, so I am happy enough. And there are no obvious swap thrashing performance issues, so the OS seems to do a good job of keeping the actual stuff in memory rather than the leaked ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-18T21:20:30Z\u0022 title=\u002208/18/2015 09:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by bos**"},{"CreatedByName":"Rokanov","CreatedById":149722,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-18T21:56:19Z","Content":"TLDR: Set texture quality to 1/4 or 1/8, install texture replacer.\n\nI\u0027ve had these issues on OSX and have tried a whole bunch of solutions, with moderate success, so thought I\u0027d share what seems to have helped. The game usually runs with 1.9-2g ram usage according to activity monitor (though haven\u0027t monitored recently as it\u0027s been fairly stable).\n\nI\u0027m currently running around 80 plugins with acceptable stability (crashes are hours apart).

By far the best is reducing texture quality to 1/4 or 1/8. At 1/8 I could run the game for hours with no crashes, and only the occasional crash at 1/4\n\n2. Texture Replacer. I\u0027ve tried Active Texture Management, but it doesn\u0027t compress DDS textures (which most now are) and I found it difficult to produce results. Texture Replacer has some similar features, mainly unloading textures from ram and compression. I don\u0027t know how much of an impact Texture Replacer is actually having, but it seems to be having a positive effect.\n\n3. Graphics options as low as possible:\n\n - Terrain Detail - Low/Default. Use settings from Astronomer\u0027s Performance Improvement to reduce ocean quality while keeping Kerbin terrain at default (or Kerbals take frequent leaps through the terrain)\n\n - SM3 Shaders and Terain Scatters - Off. More for FPS, but turning off terrain scatters definitely reduced crashes when flying long distances over Kerbin\u0027s surface\n\n - Render quality at good. Simple is okay, but any lower and you lose shadows which are pretty essential for landing\n\n - Texture quality - 1/4. With Ven\u0027s Revamp, parts still look nice at 1/4 quality.\n\n - Aerodynamic quality - Low. FPS improvement\n\n - Screen Resolution. I did reduce it for a while, running in windowed mode (with a black desktop) which certainly helped, but I put up with more frequent crashes to gain that extra screen space.\n\n - AA and V-Sync off. FPS.\n\n - Anything not mentioned at default setting\n\n4. Run pruners and remove unnecessary parts and internal spaces.\n\nKind of tired, may not have included everything I have done and may not make much sense, but I hope there\u0027s something helpful here! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-18T22:54:29Z\u0022 title=\u002208/18/2015 10:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Rokanov**\n  \nUpdated system specs"}]}
