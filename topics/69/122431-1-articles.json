Can\u0026#039;t click SAS presets.","CreatedByName":"Arugela","CreatedById":133381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-06T12:43:00Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Arugela","CreatedById":133381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-06T12:43:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if this is something solvable outside of removing parts or waiting for an update to improve performance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut when the game gets too laggy you can only highlight the prograde marker and other SAS presettings. Could this be called a bug. Is it something they could eventually program around to make it more likely to work in high stress situation? Currently I can generally get it to get the red highlight. But if you click it never takes the commands or changes green after clicking in very laggy situations. It stop responding to seemingly left click commands for some reason. this actually happens on several things on the interface. The only usable things are generally keyboard commands. Which all work well but are delayed from lag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, testing this, It seems to only be the navball... So maybe it is something that could be considered a bug. Even the button on the navbal to make it slide down or up and be visible works. It\u0027s only the buttons inside the navball that are hidden when it is closed that are affected from what I can tell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not the mouse itself as I can use all other mouse features like zoom and rotate with right mouse. I can also click everything and it works, albeit slowly from lag. This is something I have actually noticed for a long time. It is the single biggest problem I get when making really really large ships.(which I do almost exclusively) Although I haven\u0027t consciously tested it until now. Clicking presets for SAS is the single most important thing in large ships I build. It is the larges problem I encounter from interface like issues out of all bugs in the game. It is a certainty after so much lag is reached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve basically just clicked everything else in the game on the interface and the only things affected are literally the RCS, SAS, and preset buttons. The presets gain a highlight from hover but cannot be turned green to change them.. The RCS and SAS don\u0027t havea highlight from what I can tell and also can\u0027t be manually clicked to change them. I have to use keyboard shortcuts. This unfortunately leaves the SAS presets out of actions(Stability assist, prograde, retrograde, etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe surface to orbit window even works. And it works faster than almost anything else in the entire interface. So it\u0027s just those 3 things. The two buttons and the SAS preset buttons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using linux x64 with 64 bit KSP via steam.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFedora 22 x64\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGnome desktop as is default with Fedora 22\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8 gigs ram (1600)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E560ti 384 core 1gig Vid card.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E256 SSD main drive.
