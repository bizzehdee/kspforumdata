I have tried several different programs but all have the same result.\n\nKSP 1.0 briefly appears as an icon in the system tray, before returning to the task bar as if minimized normally.\n\nKSP 0.90 could be iconized normally. I am using the same settings as in 0.90.\n\nIs there any solution to this?"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T18:50:20Z","Content":"Hi Krakenfour, have you tried the manual for Iconize?
