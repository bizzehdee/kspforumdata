Neither my CPU core nor my GPU are at 100% use, KSP uses around 80-90% of a core (with frequency scaling disabled) and the GPU is around 40-70% utilised. Yet still that stutter is there, clearly apparent at 10x timewarp."},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T02:44:30Z","Content":"I\u0027ve noticed the stutter every couple seconds with windows too. It\u0027s noticeable with engine exhaust as you can see periodic gaps in the effects and noticeable with number readings where the number will pause for an instant and then update.\n\nNo idea what can be done about it though."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T15:13:18Z","Content":"[**It may not be possible unfortunately**](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/unity-stutters-and-its-not-the-game.89900/), though players seem to suffer varied stutter or none at all.\n\nAll I can really suggest is lowering the delta timer, and closing unnecessary programs."},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T23:19:26Z","Content":"I have noticed it chugs with the latest version on my QX 9650 with 8Gb DDR3.\n\nWhile it could be unity I have also been having problems with Windows. In the thread you linked the Mac user was fine but their Windows machine was not.\n\nMicrosoft are not infallible and I have had issues with some updates lately which were well replicated by others which were entirely due to MS\u0027s oversight. Anyway the latest problem I have been having is with services starting up causing various games to drop to the taskbar in Win7 x64 Home Premium Sp1. This never used to happen but started recently and I am sure MS have screwed something up because it was even caused by their user experience programme which I have had to disable. \n\nI have not got the faintest idea whether they are responsible for the chug. \n\nJust saying it is not impossible that its not all Unity\u0027s fault."},{"CreatedByName":"rectifier","CreatedById":138727,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T04:42:25Z","Content":"Occurs for me under both Linux and Windows. My PC is not working very hard at KSP either. \n\nMostly the audio stutters for me though. I notice if I am burning in map view, fairly often it will sound like the engine flamed out. 1/2 second later it will pick back up. dV continues to change smoothly so it\u0027s not the physics, just the sound."},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T13:50:04Z","Content":"OK that rules out the Windows hypothesis then."}]}
