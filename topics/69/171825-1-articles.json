I run two monitors and want to be able to play KSP on one, while doing other things on\u00A0 the other. I know this has been posted many times, but bear with me...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile in full screen, the program minimizing when you click into another program. Fixing this would be super oober cool - but my guess is it\u0027s not do-able?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA band-aid might be fixing not-fullscreen. Either allow the program bar at the top to auto-hide, or reduce the screen by that many pixels. IE - The monitor I run KSP on is 1920x1080. When in not-fullscreen, the game area is 1920x1080\u002Bprogram bar...pushing the bottom of the game off the screen.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny chance we could do one of these? It would be ssoo awesome.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the awesome game!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
