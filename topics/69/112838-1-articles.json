The KSP store update server is not currently working for anyone, though there have been OS X-specific issues in the past.\n\n**Workaround:** Update KSP by downloading directly from the KSP or Steam store and installing it in a new location. Then copy your saves from the old KSP\\_osx/saves folder to the new installation. Update and install mods as needed."},{"CreatedByName":"MaxPeck","CreatedById":145248,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T16:54:18Z","Content":"You are a Titan among men for addressing this.
