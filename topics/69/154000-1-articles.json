After it\u00A0doesn\u0027t burn for a while due to throttle limit during a warp, it runs out of its own electric charge and will not restart even if there is fuel left. Even though there is\u00A0a trillion batteries on the ship(which still have loads of power), the engine refuses to draw power from anything and just doesn\u0027t burn. I tried shutting down and reactivating the engine, going to tracking station and back, restarting the game, updating and even verifying cache integrity. It\u00A0still doesn\u0027t work.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAm I just a total noob and missing some kind of game mechanic? I mean, from what I understand, electric charge should run freely through all the\u00A0connected parts of the ship. That\u0027s not the case with my game. However, the story doesn\u0027t end here\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter some messing around with the game trying to fix this, I ran\u00A0into another issue.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0A different time when I had solar panels, the engine didn\u0027t run out of electricity. The thing is, IT STILL WOULD NOT FIRE. I had a full electric charge, a tank of fuel, and a powered drone core, but the engine just didn\u0027t activate. I mean, I could still \u0022shutdown\u0022 and \u0022activate\u0022 the engine, limit it\u0027s thrust and gimbal, but I would\u0027t actually get any response from it. All that would change was the \u0022prop. requirements met.\u0022 would pop up and show 0.00%, while the specific impulse changed form 0.0 to 320.0. That\u0027s the only change I manged to find in the menus. On the outside, nothing happened. The fully operational craft simply refused to work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo is my game haunted or am I doing something\u00A0wrong? I can\u0027t get any further in the game without long warps, and every time I come out of one my engines don\u0027t work anymore. Please help.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sebi.zzr","CreatedById":81294,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-25T11:08:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EHello,\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/172860-artemissotnikov12/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022172860\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/172860-artemissotnikov12/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@artemis.sotnikov12\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0and \u003C/span\u003Ewelcome to the forum.Liquid fuel engines do not require any electric charge to work,unless they are in fact some sort of hybrid engines.Therefore please read and provide more information:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83212-how-to-get-support-read-first/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dangerhamster","CreatedById":146944,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-25T17:03:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust a quick guess, do you have Comnet switched on?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
