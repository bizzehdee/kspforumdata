So to start off I upgraded my graphics card from a GTX 560 to a GTX 1050ti. I had to update the bios for the 1050ti to even work but after that mess, (installed wrong bios, had to reinstall windows) I finally got it working. So I go to run it and everything is running as usual at the space station view but when I go to launch my FPS has obviously dropped. When I launch theFPS seems to go down even more but I\u0027ll have to test that again. Everything used to run perfectly, even with borderline ridiculous sized ships and I\u0027m just stumped. I\u0027ll provide any other information needed cause I\u0027ve been at this for a LONG time and I\u0027ve noted a few other things that might help but I\u0027m just not that good with computers to really pinpoint the exact problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-05T09:45:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf by \u0022bios\u0022 you mean \u0022driver\u0022 and by \u0022got it working\u0022 you mean you \u0022didn\u0027t install a new driver after reinstalling windows\u0022 you need to install the current driver from the NVIDIA homepage because Windows itself will just install a pitiful substitute of a driver.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reinhart Mk.1","CreatedById":194521,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-05T14:58:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223516695\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022181140\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221546681515\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022119953\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Harry Rhodan\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, Harry Rhodan said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf by \u0022bios\u0022 you mean \u0022driver\u0022 and by \u0022got it working\u0022 you mean you \u0022didn\u0027t install a new driver after reinstalling windows\u0022 you need to install the current driver from the NVIDIA homepage because Windows itself will just install a pitiful substitute of a driver.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nno i mean the bios for my motherboard. it was f4 and now it\u0027s f14.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reinhart Mk.1","CreatedById":194521,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-05T16:23:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell I did a clean install of KSP with a new save and everything seems to be working out fine.

A clean install and fresh save fixed the FPS issue, I tried importing the ships with the same save and I definitely think I messed something up. I seem to be good at breaking games in some weird way so I doubt anyone else has had this issue but if you are having the same problem I would suggest this. Cheers\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
