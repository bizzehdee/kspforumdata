I am currently using an Xbox controller in my PC for KSP and I would like to map at least pitch trim somewhere (e.g. in the D-pad), but I cannot find it in the Input settings area.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, in KSP somehow the D-pad is identified as two axes instead of four buttons, which is a limitation. Can this be changed?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help would be welcome!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
