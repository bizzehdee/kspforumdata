I Quicksaved while Jebediah Jerman was on a ladder ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif). Normally, it doesn\u0027t let players quicksave while a Kerbal is hanging onto the outside of a vessel, but in this case it did since I was playing *as* that Kerbal. Why he was there isn\u0027t really important, though I\u0027ll let you know it involved two high-science Mun samples, my inability to store both of them in the command pod, and Jebediah Kerman\u0027s valiant offer to ride the ladder back home in order to keep the data. So I quicksaved with him on the ladder (mistake), made a first attempt to get back home with him, exploded a few minutes later, and then reloaded the quicksave. \n\nNow, the problem is that if I reload the save, he\u0027ll be right where he was on the ladder before gently drifting downward at about 0m/s and ever-so-lightly brushing into the vessel, where he then explodes into a cloud of smoke about a second later. This literally happens every time I try to reload save, he\u0027ll be there for a second and then explode for almost no reason. Now someone else might\u0027ve just dismissed this as a stupid glitch and moved on with their space program, but I am determined to save Jebediah Kerman from his frivolous ladder-induced grave, as he was carrying almost 250 science and the vessel he was holding onto was literally the rescue mission sent to recover him from the Mun. I\u0027ll admit I\u0027m quite new to this game, so I\u0027m not really knowledgeable on how to modify a saved game, though I was able to find the **persistent.sfs** file however, which currently lists him as:\n\nKERBAL\n\n {\n\n name = Jebediah Kerman\n\n type = Crew\n\n brave = 0.5\n\n dumb = 0.5\n\n badS = True\n\n state = Assigned\n\n ToD = 219081.354003586\n\n idx = -1\n\n CAREER\\_LOG\n\n {\n\nNow I don\u0027t know what I\u0027d need to change here, but basically what I want to do is to stop him from exploding every time I reload save, which is probably caused by him barely touching the vessel he\u0027s hanging on to. So if there was a way to change his coordinates so that he\u0027d be a few feet away from the vessel when I reload, that might just do the trick. If that isn\u0027t possible though, maybe there\u0027s at least a way to edit him to start inside the command pod when I reload save, since I would much rather have him dump one Mun sample than have him explode and lose both. \n\nAnyway, any information or suggestion on how to fix this problem would be greatly appreciated ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Also here\u0027s some of the vessel information from the persistent.sfs file:\n\nVESSEL\n\n {\n\n pid = c287677513eb4f168eec236dda04101b\n\n name = The Kerbombinator\n\n type = Ship\n\n sit = LANDED\n\n landed = True\n\n landedAt = \n\n splashed = False\n\n met = 52862.9286247282\n\n lct = 717372.902684031\n\n root = 0\n\n lat = 69.6342685012026\n\n lon = 238.888279335165\n\n alt = 4671.77315272822\n\n hgt = 3.3543\n\n nrm = 0.003661099,0.9999917,-0.001794015\n\n rot = -0.1036134,-0.7105452,0.08992339,0.6901476\n\n CoM = 2.171162E-07,-0.8851245,0.0002361454\n\n stg = 1\n\n prst = False\n\n ref = 3526195038\n\n ctrl = True\n\n cPch = 0\n\n cHdg = 0\n\n cMod = 0\n\n ORBIT\n\n {\n\n SMA = 102337.120508927\n\n ECC = 0.999967420283034\n\n INC = 69.6342365656019\n\n LPE = 269.999999999995\n\n LAN = 213.967852143207\n\n MNA = 3.14159265358979\n\n EPH = 770235.831308759\n\n REF = 2\n\n }\n\n PART\n\n {\n\n name = mk1pod\n\n cid = 4293794020\n\n uid = 3526195038\n\n mid = 4161499125\n\n launchID = 42\n\n parent = 0\n\n position = 0,0,0\n\n rotation = 0,0,0,1\n\n mirror = 1,1,1\n\n symMethod = Radial\n\n istg = 0\n\n dstg = 0\n\n sqor = -1\n\n sidx = -1\n\n attm = 0\n\n srfN = None, -1\n\n attN = bottom, 4\n\n attN = top, 1\n\n mass = 0.8\n\n temp = 0\n\n expt = 0.5\n\n state = 0\n\n connected = True\n\n attached = True\n\n flag = Squad/Flags/default\n\n rTrf = mk1pod (The Kerbombinator)\n\n modCost = 0\n\n EVENTS\n\n {\n\n }\n\n ACTIONS\n\n {\n\n }\n\n PARTDATA\n\n {\n\n }\n\n MODULE\n\n {\n\n name = ModuleCommand\n\n isEnabled = True\n\n controlSrcStatusText = Not Enough Crew (0/1)\n\n EVENTS\n\n {"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T19:12:21Z","Content":"Please [add some info](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92230-%21%21%21-PLEASE-READ-BEFORE-POSTING-%21%21%21-Stock-Support-Bug-Reporting-Guide)to this.
