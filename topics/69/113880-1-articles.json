Setting inverted on the aileron right click menu doesn\u0027t solve this.\n\nYou can off course rotate the command module 180 degrees round its axis to get \u0027normal\u0027 behavior, but sadly then the navball shows the world upside down. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nGreets,\n\nJan"}]}
