I suppose it would be more accurate to say that the camera falls off of the craft. I have noticed that it is preceeded by about half a second by a very slight, almost imperceptible lag. The camera falls to the ground (or into the ocean). Coincident to that is a loss of stability in the aircraft. I can pilot the craft in cockpit mode, but even with SAS active, I cannot recover and maintain stable flight. I get a nearly constant High-G indicator (My cockpit is a Mk. 2 for aircraft), and my vertical speed bounces between off-scale high ascent and descent, making a safe landing impossible where it was once only difficult. I have attempted switching vessels with the bracket keys, no good. I have tried toggling between the map and camera, no good. Camera and cockpit, no good. I have adjusted the FX settings, no good. I have adjusted the anti-aliasing rate, no good. The last thing I have tried is parking a second craft off to the side of the runway and switching between those two, but you can\u0027t switch craft when you\u0027re in the atmosphere. Any suggestions?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-29T23:43:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey TheGrandSophia,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat would be really awesome is if you could supply us with some more information.

I\u0027m using Windows (8.1, if it matters), KSP version 0.24.2 via Steam, although I don\u0027t actually play the game through the Steam client all that often (again, I don\u0027t know if that matters, so I\u0027ll just dump all of my info on you and you can choose what\u0027s helpful and what\u0027s not). According to my task manager, I\u0027m playing the 32-bit version. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome amplifying information: Originally, I thought the error might be in my design, so I modified it in a couple of ways and tried to work around it that way. The problem remains. The craft are very simple, and aptly named Problem Child Mark 1 and Mark 2. In order to re-create the incident after the first time, I followed a rigid flight plan based on my original intent. Procedures as follows: From start position on runway, activate brakes, activate SAS, check stage sequencing. Release brakes, activate engine, 1/3 throttle on Mk. 1, 1/2 on Mk. 2. Take off as soon as airspeed allows, ~80 knots for Mk. 1, ~118 for Mk. 2. Proceed to shore on heading 090. Once over water, immediately bank 45 degrees right, come to heading 135 true and proceed until the Old Airfield is at bearing 300 relative. Bank left 45 degrees and throttle back two notches, come to bearing 090. Once on course, lower landing gear. Once over land and on satisfactory approach, cut engine to idle (X key) and land with a rate of descent no faster than 5 m/s. Apply brake and come to a stop. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe error occurs shortly after settling into the long leg of the plan (bearing 135 outbound to the old airfield), ~6.7 km from the end of the runway where the craft starts, and well over the sea. Also, I discovered that the instability settles down somewhat if you\u0027re in \u0022straight and level\u0022 flight after the loss of stability, however it goes bonkers again if you attempt even the smallest maneuver and there is only a narrow band of stable flight. If you pitch above or below that band, the aircraft will twist, spin, stall, and dive. I have attached to this message a folder containing the output log, my Dx diagnostic readout, persistent save file, craft files for both mk. 1 and mk. 2, and 16 screenshots. The cockpit view screenshots are only from Problem Child Mk. 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/sh/z3mwi4o2pmsidgc/AACSPupeQDhay86A2R0LC9OUa?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/z3mwi4o2pmsidgc/AACSPupeQDhay86A2R0LC9OUa?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoph\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-30T04:33:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm, up front I would say that most of your instability is actually caused by a bug with the flight control surfaces.
