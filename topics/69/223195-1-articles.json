My computer is, admittedly, underpowered for ksp (1.4ghz core 2 duo, 4gb of ram and intel integrated gpu) but it was running fine on windows so i think its an os problem\u003Cspan\u003E \u003C/span\u003E. I dont know how to send the logfile, but i looked through it and there were some warnings, but none at the end of the loading, which is when it crashes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
