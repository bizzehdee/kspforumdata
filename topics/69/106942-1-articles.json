And one problem seems to persist no matter what I do. Consider this plane:\n\n![11155072_10202769359515252_2327240095147674366_o.jpg](https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xaf1/t31.0-8/11155072_10202769359515252_2327240095147674366_o.jpg)\n\nI\u0027ve tried moving the centre of lift all around the centre of mass, but for some reason no matter what I do, when it comes time to fly it, and I pull back on the pitch the control surfaces on the wings go the wrong way. \n\n![11188294_10202769359395249_4492188377566337453_n.jpg?oh=13bd9ae5d49e5dea4b4cc179d01516dd\u0026oe=55CB2F4C](https://scontent-ams.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/11188294_10202769359395249_4492188377566337453_n.jpg?oh=13bd9ae5d49e5dea4b4cc179d01516dd\u0026oe=55CB2F4C)\n\nAt first I trusted the game knew what it was doing but no. I have to pitch forward to go up. And simply inverting the controls doesn\u0027t fix the problem, because some of the plains still work the way there supposed to; pitch backwards to go up. If the game can\u0027t figure out how it\u0027s supposed to work, can\u0027t we at least add to the tweakables an ability to invert a control surface?"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T19:29:26Z","Content":"As I recall, the way the control surfaces respond seems to depend on where they root to the fuselage. Since you\u0027ve got them attached to a part that angles backwards, the control surfaces are behind the CoM but the attachment point is pretty much at the CoM. Try moving the attachment root itself back far enough that the attachment point is wholly behind the CoM. And yeah, it can be quite a pain."},{"CreatedByName":"NomenNescio","CreatedById":116492,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T19:44:07Z","Content":"Alright that did the trick, but still someone (preferably devs) fix this! A tweakables menu is all it would take."},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T19:49:03Z","Content":"What I don\u0027t remember is where the force is applied. If the force is applied at the root point, then those control surfaces will work to lift the CoM when angled as they are in your picture despite appearing to be in a position that will force the nose down, so it\u0027s \u0022just\u0022 a visual problem (and tweaking it to go the other way would actually cause your plane to be pushed into the runway when you tried to pitch up). But if they set their response based on the root point while applying their forces where they actually reside, then I\u0027d say that\u0027s more than just a visual problem."},{"CreatedByName":"NomenNescio","CreatedById":116492,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T14:48:08Z","Content":"I can\u0027t answer your question as to where the force is applied, I only know that before I had to pitch forward to ascend and pitch down to descend, and that would imply that the control surfaces are the wrong way around."}]}
