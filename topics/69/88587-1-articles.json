I fly past the KSC to the south and circle back to the runway from the ocean. Cant remember exactly but it was about 4km out that things started to go poof in a cloud of smoke.

I find a deorbital burn to a periapsis of 20km over the peninsula to the east of the KSC gets it down in the right area, but it has plenty of liquid fuel left if you are a bit off. I have a few mods installed, but all stock parts on the spaceplane. For the record these mods are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAntennaRange\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECollision FX\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrowdSourcedScience\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEditorExtensions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbalEngineer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbalJointReinforcement\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlanetShine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrecisseNode\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Alarm Clock\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI may try with these uninstalled when I get the time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelsteele3","CreatedById":127113,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T15:34:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInvisible walls m8.
