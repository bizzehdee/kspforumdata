Afterwards I decided to install ScanSat and some Stock-like parts. Then this textures glitch appeared, there is also a large amount of lag. Only the KSC ground seems to be affected. I decided to remove the mods but the problem still persists. I then uninstalled KSP and went into the folder (I use Steam) and deleted all the remaining files.

Also, you only have 3GB of ram. v0.25 seems to be more RAM intensive than previous versions (probably due to the SP\u002B parts and destructable buildings).

Using reduced Texture Quality will reduce memory consumption, which could be getting mishandled by OpenGL. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, maybe Sal or Kasper will be by.
