Had an unmodded, normal-difficulty career game and somehow all my science data is lost in the journey to recover it from Ike to Kerbin. I transmitted (and recieved) a few EVA and crew reports via the MK 3 antenna. After mining-refueling and flying back home everything else got lost somehow though. Although i can still see the data (review the reports and transmit them) on the journey itself it dissapears once my vehicle touches down intact.\n\nMaybe it helps with further patches.\n\nBlack Dog"},{"CreatedByName":"Sonny_Jim","CreatedById":103060,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T17:20:50Z","Content":"Could you post your save file somewhere?"}]}
