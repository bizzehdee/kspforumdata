It seemed most prevalent in KSP, but I started to wonder when I encountered similar issues in other unity-based games. Sometimes the error would be in Unity itself, and sometimes in a dll that was in use at the time. The only common factor, it seems, was that Unity was at some point involved.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThreads elsewhere for reference:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted\u0022\u003E\n\n\n\n\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022pln\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.reddit.com/r/idlechampions/comments/9i0wwr/unityplayerdll_caused_an_access_violation/\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/773951/discussions/0/1696040635916121951/\nhttps://forum.unity.com/threads/unityplayer-dll-caused-an-access-violation.510062/\nhttps://forum.lastepoch.com/t/unity-crash-access-violation/35306\nhttps://www.gog.com/forum/pathfinder_kingmaker/game_version_215x_unity_crashes_randomly_unityplayerdll_caused_an_access_violation_0xc000000\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/jyl4b3/game_crashing_with_unityplayerdll_fault_exception/\nhttps://linustechtips.com/topic/1260614-unityplayerdll-caused-an-access-violation-0xc0000005/\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI ran through everything trying to hunt this down. BIOS flashing, windows updates, graphics drivers, everything. Eventually a thread on the Unity forums and a list of common factors seemed to point to one thing - almost everyone having this problem was using XMP overclocked RAM at 3200Mhz. I didn\u0027t initially see overclocked RAM as an issue; it\u0027s sold to be overclocked to 3200Mhz, and many motherboards provide built-in features to effortlessly overclock it. More importantly, every other game works absolutely fine, zero crashes or unusual issues. No other problems in Windows, everything all rosy. Just not Unity.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s such an infrequent issue (randomly popping up every 15mins to 4 hours) that I never bothered to look into it any further, and just kind of accepted it as an odd incompatibility somewhere.\u00A0I finally bit the bullet earlier this week, and after extensive googling decided to manually enter the RAM timings in the BIOS, not expecting it to help. I have to say, I\u0027ve been surprised. I can\u0027t say 100% that the problem\u0027s fixed due to the intermittent/random nature of the issue, but I\u0027ve had about 10\u002B hours so far with no Unity crashes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor anyone having a similar issue, if you are using XMP in the BIOS to overclock your RAM to 3200Mhz, either manually enter the timings or choose another setting (e.g. 3000Mhz / 3400Mhz).
