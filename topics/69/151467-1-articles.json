If you go to your settings, you can change the FPS limit. maybe you\u0027ve set it to 30fps.

Basicly what V-sync means is that it holds the refresh rate of your video card the same as that of your monitor. So when your display is set to 75Hz (75 new frames per second), your videocard never sends more than that amount of frames per second to your display. If you disable the v-syns, it has to effects:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nyour videocard isn\u0027t \u0027held back\u0027 by your display.

(not so good effect)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nFor benchmarking the V-sync is disabled most time, because it can effect the\u00A0performance of your videocard.
