You can do this by right-clicking on the installed part in the SPH, which should bring up a pop-up window that allows you to select/deselect Pitch, Roll, and Yaw axes. Make sure the appropriate axes are active (Pitch for elevators...). They should default to all axes enabled on initial installation, but worth checking anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDead battery? That\u0027s unlikely, as you stated you were able to activate the engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe double check to make sure the control keys are mapped the way you think they are. Also, not sure if caps-lock would affect control key inputs, but worth checking. Do rockets still respond to control inputs properly?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso curious if nose wheel steering works. I think nose wheel steering is disabled by default, so you may need to enable nose wheel steering by right-clicking to bring up the options. See if the nose wheel is turning. If it is, the problem is limited to the control surfaces. If the nose wheel also does not move, that might indicate the control inputs are not functioning correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s all I can think of at the moment..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"braekyn","CreatedById":107319,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-14T03:45:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I checked activation, no issues there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGyro\u0027s seem to sork no problem, as does any engine gimbal, so I doubt it\u0027s controls but i\u0027ll have a look. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBattery\u0027s are fine - Fresh from the gate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill check nose wheel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jim Starluck","CreatedById":118879,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-20T05:07:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m getting something similar to this. The elevons on the wings aren\u0027t responding, but the Delta Deluxe tail fins work fine, as does the wheel steering.
