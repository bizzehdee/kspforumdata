Following the OS reinstall, the iMac appears stable while not running KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started a KSP session this morning (No mods and no Texture reduction) ran well for about 45 min, then suddenly stopped and the OS X crash dialogue pops up. So same basic behaviour.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI concur with Tao that this is probably a memory issue. If the iMac was overheating then the issue would probably present itself as the OS shutting down or the crazy \u0022Space Disco\u0022 graphics aberration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will now reinstall texture reduction and see if that helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-01T10:21:16Z\u0022 title=\u002211/01/2014 10:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Wallygator\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wallygator","CreatedById":97357,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-01T10:22:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sp1989\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sp1989\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECount me as one of the people who is experiencing horrifying amounts of lag after installing Yosemite.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not suffering from any Lag, just unpredictable freeze, and or OS crashes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wallygator","CreatedById":97357,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-01T10:34:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith ATM (texture reduction) now installed, I can see on the activity monitor that KSP is chewing on 1.29GB of RAM while I\u0027m in the VAB editor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this a \u0022normal\u0022 reading?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I notice that the KSP task memory usage as shown in the activity monitor gradually increases over time.
