I have a following issue with KSP: when any of my kerbals goes to EVA,\u00A0 they just disappear, no matter if my craft is standing still on the ground or doing 350 m/s with afterburners at 5000m. There is no \u0022poof\u0022 whatsoever when they disappear, and i can\u0027t even see the kerbal exiting the craft at all. After the disappearance i\u0027m only able to zoom on\u00A0 the craft itself. When i click the EVA button, the game doesn\u0027t focus on the kerbal at all as it would usually do,\u00A0so this (and the fact that i\u0027m unable to see kerbals exiting the craft)\u00A0brings me to this thought; what if the kerbal dies inside the cockpit (or pod, depending on what type of craft am i flying or \u0022flying\u0022) so that\u0027s why i can\u0027t see any \u0022poofs of death\u0022? Does anyone have an idea on what could be the cause?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"4x4cheesecake","CreatedById":187982,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-12T16:52:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich KSP version?

Just press \u0027F3\u0027 after going on EVA, it should contain something like \u0027xyz went on EVA\u0027 and if your Kerbal really dies, there will be an entry as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-13T09:03:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry EVa\u0027ing, then switch ships ( [ or ] ).\u00A0 They might just be invisible, which might be even weirder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you recover that vessel, or just go back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, does the kerbal still exist in the astronaut center?\u00A0 Are they viewable in the tracking station?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kspguy77","CreatedById":189458,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-14T06:25:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy version is 1.4.3 and no, i don\u0027t have any mods installed, only a couple of aircraft downloaded from KerbalX (do they count as mods??).

The kerbal goes also missing from the astronaut list, gotta check the K.I.A list at some point.
