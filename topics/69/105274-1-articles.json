Then a restart of my PC, and I could get through to the store. Then I had the fun of needing a password reset (yup. Got the server maintenance message first couple of tries). Then I got to the store, but only option was to buy, rather than download. Hmmn.. I\u0027m suspecting there\u0027s something I\u0027ve missed somewhere, but will let you know how I get on. At least I\u0027m making progress! :-)\n\nUpdate: Tried once more, and this time I\u0027m seeing the bit where it recognises when I first purchased KSP, and is offering me the download. And.. -it\u0027s now merrily downloading now.
