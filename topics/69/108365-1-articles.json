At some point I was messing around with control schemes jumping in and out of menus, and when I went back into the game my plane was already on the runway. I tried to take off, but it immediately exploded. I hit escape, but the revert flight option was greyed out! so I held down quickload.... I thought the game was saving my progress periodically, and it would just load to the last stable point, but I was wrong and it loaded the last quicksave point I made, like a week ago.... and all my progress is now gone, and all my ships are invalid (locked parts). I can\u0027t seem to find anyway to undo that load and load back the original save from when i booted up the game. Is there any way to fix this or did I just {snip} myself? Thanks.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-10-18T01:00:11Z\u0022 title=\u002210/18/2023 01:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Oct 18\u0022\u003EOctober 18, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Gargamel**\n  \nPortions Redacted by moderator"},{"CreatedByName":"Barking Sands","CreatedById":143433,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T09:54:27Z","Content":"Doesn\u0027t look good.

All that work. :c\n\nGood to know for the future, I guess... and perhaps I should quicksave more often.
