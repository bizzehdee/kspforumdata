After all, the other people are using over-the-top gaming PC\u0027s capable of doing billions of calculations per second, while I just have a levono T430s Thinkpad. Do I really have a good computer for KSP, or is it only good for web browsing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-10T23:08:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if we say no you stop playing the game because it will be no fun any more?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-11T00:02:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s fine, just keep in mind that too many parts on a vessel will bog it down, also too many mods\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-11T00:31:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, looking at the specs on Google; it\u0027s not terrible besides the 4 Gb of RAM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou say it plays KSP, so yeah; it\u0027s a good computer to run KSP in my opinion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI used to play KSP on an old laptop that wasn\u0027t much better, and I enjoyed it just as much then on the lowest settings at 20fps as I do now on a better computer with highest settings and 60fps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-11-11T00:31:48Z\u0022 title=\u002211/11/2017 12:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 11, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Rocket In My Pocket\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DAL59","CreatedById":180784,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-12T01:53:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t install visual mods.\u00A0 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E is probably fine though.\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
