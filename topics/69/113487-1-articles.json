I use action groups for mining (1 lowers drill, 2 starts surface harvester, 3 stops surface harvester). The instant i press \u00222\u0022 the tanks go from 0 to full, and as much as i love getting 10,500 ore in a fraction of a second it seems wrong.\n\nKSP 1.0.2\n\nwindows 7 64 bit\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-20T05:13:52Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2015 05:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jkool702**"},{"CreatedByName":"GagaX","CreatedById":57813,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T09:44:06Z","Content":"I have exactly the same bug:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123946-BIG-FAT-BUG-Ore-containers-filling-emptying-instantly](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123946-BIG-FAT-BUG-Ore-containers-filling-emptying-instantly)"},{"CreatedByName":"jkool702","CreatedById":146465,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T15:19:13Z","Content":"This sounds like the same problem, except (thankfully) my ore tanks dont empty when I redock. Maybe this has to do with the fact that the ISRU is on the lander itself?\n\nAlso, the steps on your thred arent a foolproof way to reproduce that.
