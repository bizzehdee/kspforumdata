I just got the game a week ago and just now, I realized I\u0027ve been playing on version 1.0.0. Someone on the KSP amazon review said that he/she couldn\u0027t update the game as well. You can read the 1-star review here:\n\n[http://www.amazon.com/Squad-Kerbal-Space-Program-PC/product-reviews/B00WOXKBMS/ref=cm_cr_dp_qt_hist_one?ie=UTF8\u0026filterBy=addOneStar\u0026showViewpoints=0](https://www.amazon.com/Squad-Kerbal-Space-Program-PC/product-reviews/B00WOXKBMS/ref=cm_cr_dp_qt_hist_one?ie=UTF8\u0026filterBy=addOneStar\u0026showViewpoints=0)\n\nI also tried going into the patcher file and it said \n\nDetecting if OS-resident rsync is present...rsync is not already installed, so making use of bin\\rsync.exe. \n\nAuthentication \n\nGetting login token... \n\nUnable to authenticate with the server: Received malformed data from the server: File not found. \n\nWhat should I do? Uninstall and reinstall? If I do that, will it delete my current saves?"},{"CreatedByName":"eurybaric","CreatedById":33541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T22:27:38Z","Content":"First, go in the ksp folder, and just copy the \u0027saves\u0027 folder to somewhere else.

Still did not work: still stuck on version 1.0.0.822. Went to the launcher, and the same message came up about the rsync. Looks like I\u0027ll be stuck on 1.0.0. for a while. I\u0027ll contact amazon to see what they can do."},{"CreatedByName":"Astro Boba","CreatedById":146766,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T00:17:00Z","Content":"Update as of 6-23-15:\n\nAmazon has not yet update their version of KSP. Don\u0027t even bother contacting them. Instead, they tell you to contact KSP support. That\u0027s what I did and boy, KSP support was very helpful! \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00C2\u00BA They made a new account for me and that\u0027s when I was able to update the game. Now I really know why people love SQUAD: great game, great customer service."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T01:24:49Z","Content":"Moved to support."}]}
