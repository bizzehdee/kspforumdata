I am attempting to fly to different biomes and land to gather surface samples, goo, eva reports, temperature, science jr. etc. My aircraft flies around 270 to 300 m/hr, usually flying in the area of seeing the sound barrier lines but not burning. After about 10 to 20 minutes (sometimes more) the game will eventually crash...I\u0027ve crashed twice so far, the first crash didn\u0027t produce an error log. The crash files above are of the second crash. During that time I flew from base, to the desert biome across the ocean to the west...landed and gathered my science, and then it crashed as I was traveling back across the ocean to base."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T16:19:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E DynamicHeapAllocator out of memory - Could not get memory for large allocationCould not allocate memory: System out of memory!\n\u003E Trying to allocate: 4194304B with 4 alignment.
