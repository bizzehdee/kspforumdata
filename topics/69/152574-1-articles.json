I built a fairing at the bottom of a command pod, held up by i-beams, andreleased the fairing. It fell to the ground and sat there, on top of the ground, supported by the fairing edges.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI then reloaded and instead of decoupling, released the fairing itslef. The pieces all fell to the ground and lay there as you\u0027d expect. They maybe didn\u0027t act like they would perfectly, and spun a bit, but they quickly settled down and lay flat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vitekc45c","CreatedById":98257,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-26T12:19:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReinstal fixed it, i gues something was corrupted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
