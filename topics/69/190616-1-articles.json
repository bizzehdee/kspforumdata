The computer is kinda old and clunky but up until recently, it has run the game relatively well. However, ever since the 1.8 update, I haven\u2019t been able to load the game; it gets stuck in \u201CBreaking Ground SquadExpansion/Serenity\u201D and it just stays there without loading the game. I\u2019ve tried re-installing KSP and it still doesn\u2019t work. Any help is appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
