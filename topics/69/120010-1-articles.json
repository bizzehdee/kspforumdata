KSP runs great on the new system, but I\u0027m having trouble getting my joystick to work: I first went to assign axes and the joystick motion was detected just fine, but I couldn\u0027t save the setting and the game hung. Now whenever I try to assign axes the joystick is not detected, and looking thru my KSP.log file it seems the input isn\u0027t being detected by KSP at all. I tried a fresh install of KSP to no effect, anyone have any thoughts on how I might fix it?
