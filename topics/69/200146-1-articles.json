Well, previous updates were fine, but... As for 1.11, which has been released for around 10 days, I can\u0027t download a real 1.11.1 install. Yesterday, 18:00, UTC\u002B8, I downloaded the \u0022newest\u0022 version of KSP from GOG Galaxy Client. After I loaded my old saves, I entered the settings to have version watermark on (I always liked the version watermark). Err, it shows 1.11.0.
