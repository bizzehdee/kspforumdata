Because KSP is no longer in early access, Squad can\u0027t just push a mostly working update before summer holidays, and fix the issues a few months later in the next patch.

So until then, we just get to have a broken release? Who cares about 1.0.3? What\u0027s the point of pushing out another update if it \\*doesn\u0027t fix the major issues in the game\\*? Isn\u0027t that kind of like putting new tires on a car with a broken transmission? If it takes a transition to U5 to make the game work (and there are boundless issues on all platforms from what I can see) then I think they need to make that a top priority. It seems to me that \u0022push a mostly working update, and fix the issues a few months later\u0022 has already happened with 1.0.X\n\nIt would be one thing if it were a minor bug and people were just being nitpicky, but having to reload the game every few minutes because it melts down due to known defects shouldn\u0027t be acceptable under any circumstances. I would like to see some acknowledgement in the devnotes, some kind of proactive steps that make me, as a paying customer, feel like this product is worth my money.\n\nAnd for what it\u0027s worth, I bought it because it\u0027s a helluva lot of fun when it works. I\u0027ve recommended it to my colleagues, and for the record, I\u0027m a college aviation professor who has given serious thought to ways to use the EDU version of the game. But not like this, I\u0027m embarrassed enough to have recommended that my friends and colleagues buy what amounts to a broken game, I\u0027m not about to bring this into my classroom until it\u0027s fixed.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T05:43:48Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 05:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JJE64**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kersplattle","CreatedById":33796,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T05:55:52Z","Content":"I have to say that I \\*HAVE\\* had issues, but am not for now.
