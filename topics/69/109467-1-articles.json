But I deleted all of those and re-installed KSP before the problems really started. I had a bug where a rocket wouldn\u0027t start burning on the launchpad, it just sat there even though staging said the engines were on. After that I deleted all mods. \n\nThe first thing that happened was the construction center got bugged up. When accessed all the availible parts were just mashed together, no sub menus. This was persistant across all save games. Any part clicked would pop into the center, but couldn\u0027t be selected or moved. I re-installed a couple times, but preserved my save games, and this issue went away. Immediately afterwards however, I found myself suddenly unable to use the research tree. It just vanished. see figure A: \n\n![s84PgOu.png](http://i.imgur.com/s84PgOu.png)\n\nFrustated, I started a new game, figuring I could catch up and tired of fighting with it. For a couple missions all was well, then the availible contracts vanished, figure B. \n\n![TmTKrqo.png](http://i.imgur.com/TmTKrqo.png)\n\nWhen I first click the tab everything looks normal for just a fraction of a second, then disappears. \n\nI\u0027ve checked, and these problems are attached to the save games somehow. On the first game, the contracts work fine, but the research tree is gone. On the second game I can research to my heart\u0027s content, but the contracts poof away. No amount of restarting or re-installing has helped. \n\nWould like to resolve these issues so I can go on playing. Right now the game is broken for me."},{"CreatedByName":"Durandalski","CreatedById":144147,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T17:46:42Z","Content":"Update. I re-installed KSP after deleting all associated files I could find, as near as I can tell a completely fresh start. The problem with the contracts is persistant.

Note that after the first flight, what I see when entering mission control is a glitch where for a fraction of a second I can see a whole bunch of contracts in the leftmost box, then they vanish, leaving only whatever contracts are unfinished of the first four. This glitch happens every time I load mission control, on every save. \n\nThis problem has proved to be persistant across all saves and any re-installs or fiddling I\u0027ve come up with. Even my oldest save game, where I can see contracts, is broken. No new contracts replace those if they are completed or time out. Some help with this problem would be really appreciated. I can play science or sandbox all I want, but career mode is completely broken for me, which is very frustrating."}]}
