When I add these parts to a spacecraft, they appear normal in the VAB or SPH but once on the launch pad they revert to the grayed out model and don\u0027t function. No thrust from engines and no utility from other kinds of parts affected. If I revert the flight to VAB/SPH the parts appear in the grayed out form there as well, and any attempts to reload the saved ship will feature the broken parts as well. \n\nThis glitch is so bad that it basically ruins the entire ship, as the parts become so broken that they cannot be selected with the cursor in the VAB/SPH to remove them from the ship, essentially forcing one to recreate the whole ship from scratch. The parts also appear to be \u0022physicsless\u0022 (if thats the right term) when on the launch pad as they will fall beneath the surface if the ship is on the ground.\n\nThe parts that are affected in my game are:\n\nLV-909 Liquid Engine\n\nLV-T30 Liquid Engine\n\nLV-T45 Liquid Engine\n\nTT-38K Radial Decoupler\n\nLT-1 Landing Strut\n\nI haven\u0027t noticed any other parts affected. I\u0027ve still been able to enjoy the game using the vast amount of other engines and parts available, and have designed some nice manned missions to Mun and Minmus and some probe missions to other planets using both vertical rocket launches and SSTO Spaceplane launches but I want the ability to use these parts too, like everyone else who has the game. Also not having access to the LV-T30 really hampers my ability to anything in career mode, leaving me to only use the sandbox mode. \n\nI have searched far and wide on the interwebs and on this site to find someone else with this problem and a possible solution, but came up empty. Perhaps I just don\u0027t know the name of this particular glitch and have been searching for the wrong thing.\n\nI have tried to fix it myself. I downloaded the game in .25, and thought that maybe upgrading to .90 would solve the problem, but it didn\u0027t. So tonight I backed up my save file and deleted the \u0022Squad\u0022 and \u0022NASA Mission\u0022 folders, then used the patcher to reinstall those files, to no avail. The same problem persists, so hopefully someone here has experienced a similar problem and can advise. Like I said earlier, the problem has been present since day 1, so I posted here under the \u0022unmodded\u0022 forum because the only mod I have is Mechjeb and the problem started long before I installed that and was unaffected by it. \n\nHere are some screenshots demonstrating the problem:\n\n![uYVDlhA.png](http://i.imgur.com/uYVDlhA.png)\n\nHere you can see gray or brown and featureless engines, right next to the correctly featured parts in the menu. \n\n![Ec5fcAz.png](http://i.imgur.com/Ec5fcAz.png)\n\nInstalling the parts on your rocket will appear normal at first, as is shown here, but once on the launchpad...\n\n![I50Zo09.png](http://i.imgur.com/I50Zo09.png)\n\nIt is featureless and non-functioning. Occasionally, smoke and sparks will fly out the side! isn\u0027t this fun!\n\n![RBfJpKy.png](http://i.imgur.com/RBfJpKy.png)\n\nEven in the VAB!\n\n![amUQeNB.png](http://i.imgur.com/amUQeNB.png)\n\n![72gCS4O.png](http://i.imgur.com/72gCS4O.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-15T06:40:00Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2015 06:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cannonball89**\n  \nsolved"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T03:35:34Z","Content":"This looks like a bad install to me. I\u0027d suggest a full wipe and re-install of all files associated with the game, if reinstalling the GameData folder did not help.\n\nIf you got the game off of the KSP store, just re-download it.\n\nIf Steam, try deleting the game from your hard-drive and then re-downloading.

It looks like it! If you delete everything in GameData besides the folders \u0022Squad\u0022 and \u0022NASAMission\u0022, that should fix your problem. Provided the mod doesn\u0027t copy over the original stock parts...\n\nTL;DR: Make a clean install with nothing but Squad and NASAMission folders and see if the issue persists.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-14T03:37:56Z\u0022 title=\u002203/14/2015 03:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Starwhip**"},{"CreatedByName":"cannonball89","CreatedById":139432,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T04:02:08Z","Content":"Nope, Only Mod is Mechjeb and as stated, the issue started long before I was even aware of what Mechjeb was. I almost wanted my money back after I bought the game because career mode was impossible with this problem but then started messing around in Sandbox and have become increasingly addicted lol. \n\nI will try a clean install as suggested though. I just hope that I can load my backed up save files into a new install, because I have put so many hours into some of the ships and projects I\u0027m currently working on that I would almost rather keep playing without those few parts than to lose all of the ships that I have designed."},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T14:34:32Z","Content":"Yeah, definitely a bad install - I see some duplicate parts.. put your saves folder somewhere safe and then fully delete KSP and reinstall (download a new copy/verify game cache integrity as well)."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T19:47:04Z","Content":"Oh, you know what it is?

I just installed my old save files to the new version successfully and reinstalled mechjeb successfully and the duplicate part glitch has gone away. \n\nI think that my issue may have been caused by the fact that I downloaded the demo and played it for a few days before buying the full version, I think the demo files may have been transferred to the full game which may have caused the corruption that I experienced. \n\nFly classy kerbalites"}]}
