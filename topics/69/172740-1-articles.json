No Steam, no shared folders\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI d/l 1.4.1 not intending to use it as I am in the advanced stages of a career game in 1.3.1 but you know how it is \u0022just a quick look...\u0022?\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, I ran 1.4.1, launched a couple of ships, tried a few mods (mainly \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E, Kerbal Alarm Clock and Kerbal Engineer as they were updated) and then decided to leave it until mods such as Kerbal Joint Reinforcer became current (I always have space stations shake apart on me) :-(\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack to 1.3.1 and my asteroid station around Duna\u003Cbr\u003E\nArgh! All the in-game fonts are distorted, unreadable. The graphic text (Start New Game\u0022, Mods \u0026amp; Addons\u0022 etc is clean but all the in-game fine text is unreadable.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI tried re-installing with no mods. Still the same. With modes, the mod text is okay. It is just the in-game fine text that fails.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried trashing all the config files I can find, running clean vanilla, nothing works.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m not 100% sure that running 1.4.1 caused this as everything is in separate folders. 1.2 works fine, it\u0027s just 1.3.1 with my current game (many hours dropped into this one!) that I can\u0027t get to wor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone else come across anything similar?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nH E L P !\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/t50xb\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/t50xb\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
