Everything was working fine for weeks, even with ~30 mods installed through \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E. A couple days ago, the game started to run very slow and so I uninstalled the game, deleted \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, and reinstalled the game again. After the install was complete I ran the game with no mods and no \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003Eckan\u003C/abbr\u003E installed and upon entering fullscreen at 1920x1080, the fps in the menu dropped to 50-60 (as opposed to 120), and I could notice a stutter. In game, the space center was running at ~50 fps and in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E it dropped to 20. upon launching a Kerbal X, the timer stays yellow and my fps remains at ~20.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I change the game to a windowed mode, on a resolution less than my laptops native resolution of 3840x2160 like 1920x1080, then the fps goes right back up to the normal 120fps that I had prior. As I increase the resolution, the average fps starts to drop. I normally play at 1920x1080 fullscreen\u00A0all the time, because my computer cant handle 4k most of the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course I can physically play the game at a lower windowed resolution, but it would be highly inconvenient as the game is a small window in the center of my screen at that resolution. Again, this has never happened to me in this way before, and I have always been able to solve the issue by doing a clean install, but this time it doesn\u0027t seem so.

I always play with Vsync off, and I have the rest of the setting sliders in the middle. Having the settings like this didn\u0027t improve any performance, even when they were all set to low. I did turn the space center crew off, which improved performance in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, but all other scenes were unimproved.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy uninstallation process was to run the\u00A0 \u0022unins0000\u0022 application to uninstall, and then manually delete any folders which were left over that the application didn\u0027t get.

I am pretty sure I deleted everything \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003Eckan\u003C/abbr\u003E, as i searched my computer for anything that had \u0022\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003Eckan\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0022 in the name.

I did a little reading and found that the game would run better in borderless windowed mode, but as I said, running at 1080p, the game screen only takes up a small area. I read that if you change an option related to scaling in the properties of the exe file, that it would allow the borderless window to scale its 1080p resolution to my entire monitor. After doing this change, it seems to have fixed the problem, but I am still on the lookout for other issues. Thanks for your help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
