I just installed a new version of windows 7 64x and ofcourse the first game I download is Ksp. However when I first launched it and made a new sandbox game the entire screen was upside down! (except for the buttons). I have looked around on the internet and can\u0027t find anything on this. I really hope someone has a solution for this because I would love to play the new 1.0.5 update \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T21:28:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEr, there\u0027s no KSP bug that does this, I think you need to check your graphics driver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you upload your KSP output_log.txt to dropbox or pastebin I can take a look, also run dxdiag from the start menu and make a hardware report, it\u0027ll show your driver number.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
