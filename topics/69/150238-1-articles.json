I cannot even use these buttons on any program(chrome, not even notepad) on my windows. When I quit the game everything goes back to normal. Is this a known bug?

I discovered that this issue begins when the game is loading asset bundle definitions during the game start up. Also I noticed that if I do a scroll lock and unlock(FN\u002BINS) the locked buttons just work one time then gets locked again... Could it be related to 6-DOF controls? Because in 6-DOF control settings there was a shortcut activated with scroll lock button.\u00A0Never seen anything like this problem, its weird..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
