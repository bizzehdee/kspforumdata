I\u0027m 32:29 into the flight, and my Prop. Requirment Met is reading 97% and everything is good. One second later, my Prop Requirement Met drops in half to about 45%, my thrust falls in half, and my plane starts to fall out of the sky. The Prop Requirement Met value keeps falling and falling even as I scrub altitude, because I cannot maintain any airspeed. Eventually the plane ends up on the ground in some adjustable number of pieces. \u00A0If I fly it down, then a\u00A0couple\u00A0minutes later, at 0 altitude and about 130m/s, the Prop Requirement Met value is down to about 18% as I recall.\u00A0WTF? I have a screenshot at 32:33, but the system won\u0027t let me upload it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: After a little more testing, the bug is in the fuel flow system from this particular\u00A0aircraft design. The program is effectively giving me an infinite amount of fuel -- it \u0022knows\u0022 that there are still 800 units of fuel left in the two front tanks, and it is somehow still drawing fuel at a max rate of .04/s (which is not enough to keep my plane airborne), but it is not subtracting any of that fuel flow from those\u00A0tanks. So they are sitting there stuck at 400 units each. My plane \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Epartially\u00A0\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003Eruns out of power when the back 4 tanks get depleted of liquid fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI admit the design is funky. It\u0027s built to take a pilot and scientist\u00A0halfway around the planet, taking lots of science samples along the way, then climb to 19000 meters 3 times with enough control that I can still land it one last time afterward. The fuselage of my plane (from front to back) is: small circular intake, MK1 command\u00A0pod, MK1 liquid fuel fuselage, MK1 inline cockpit, MK1 liquid fuel fuselage, Science Jr.,\u00A0then 4 FL-T200 tanks, then a Wheesley, with a Thud strapped below the Wheesley. I suspect something about that order is blocking the fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-01T09:45:31Z\u0022 title=\u002212/01/2015 09:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Emore testing info\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-01T16:00:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/5909\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eknown bug\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0 Hopefully it will get fixed for the next update.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r_loewe","CreatedById":159561,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-28T15:52:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni hope 1.0.6 is out soon. this is very annoying because i am trying to do the grand tour of ksp with mining\u00A0but, my nuclear engines suddenly drop from 100 to 3 percent please help anybody\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FullMetalMachinist","CreatedById":156531,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-28T16:55:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222477077\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022126752\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221459180375\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022159561\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022r_loewe\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n59 minutes ago, r_loewe said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni hope 1.0.6 is out soon. this is very annoying because i am trying to do the grand tour of ksp with mining\u00A0but, my nuclear engines suddenly drop from 100 to 3 percent please help anybody\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope you haven\u0027t been deliberately mislead, but 1.0.6 is not, and never has been, a thing that is going to happen.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever 1.1 is due to come very soon, but I haven\u0027t heard if this specific bug has been squashed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for your specific problem, could you post a screenshot of your craft?
