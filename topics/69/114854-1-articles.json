Well over three thousand hours played. Still so many things I haven\u0027t done but really, REALLY want to.\n\nToo many bugs to enjoy myself though.\n\nSpace planes have problems. Stuff gets hot when it shouldn\u0027t. They have been nerfed to the point where you can get a spaceplane into orbit but then what, not enough fuel to do much else. Unless you build something unreasonable, counter-intuitive. Should be able to rescue a kerbal from orbit with a space plane and I can, if I time the launch just right, if I get to him at ap. But even then, enough fuel for the return? Most times not. Counter intuitive for the most part.\n\nAnd so, Space planes are cack.\n\nRovers wheels just don\u0027t work properly anywhere but on Kerbin. I had a lot of fun making modular base parts for the base-on-the-mun contract. I conquered the problem of docking ports not lining up. Had a system which should have worked on any world I could land them on. Unfortunately, the wheels are broken. Even with the \u0027fix\u0027 it\u0027s more like ice skating than driving and reaction wheels spaz out something fierce. This is the main reason Rovers are now cack.\n\nI made a small rover a dinky little thing that would fit inside the 2.5 utility bay with a little docking port to the top of the bay.\n\nPlan; take a lander with the bay at it\u0027s base. Land with the bay just above the surface. Detatch and drive the rover out.\n\nI designed my rover and connected a bay to it in SPH. Launched the bay with the little rover inside it. I would open the doors on the runway and see if the rover got out ok.\n\nWhen I launched. The bay with the rover still attached still with doors closed, hitched itself up and started gliding down the runway. Brakes on - no effect.\n\nI opened the doors while it was moving, just to see if I could get my rover out anyway (just something you do) and the whole thing lifted up, turned upside-down and then stopped. moving.\n\nAnyway, the whole plan went around the U-bend.\n\nAnd so Rovers are cack.\n\nI have docked landers on The Mun using RCS but they were light and didn\u0027t have a mass of several tons so I don\u0027t fancy trying it largely for fear of the next bug.\n\nContracts; I expected to get a \u0027go to The Mun and grab data from orbit and the surface\u0027 pretty much as soon as I got into Kerbin orbit. Nope.. got one for Ike, got one for Mimnus eventually. Had to go to The Mun without a contract so missed out on the extra cash.\n\nI went on a contract to recover small jet engine from Mimnus. As I approached, the engine slowly fell through the surface and disappeared from view.\n\nI had done a quicksave earlier and this time I managed to switch focus to the \u0027part\u0027 and it went through mimnus, out the other side and went off into space at terrific speed I watched until Kerbin was very small. Then closed the game in frustration.\n\nA whole mess of the test-this contracts are just plain silly.\n\nA tourist wants to do a suborbital on another body? Seriously? Why? Just because it\u0027s logistically difficult? (Ok some folks might actually look forward to this kind of contract different strokes)\n\nI\u0027m bored. I want to play KSP but it\u0027s too broken to have fun. I\u0027ve tried. Oh how I\u0027ve tried.\n\nI use Engineer, Chatterer and Alarm Clock but only stock parts.\n\nHaving to remove these mods and then test again just to make a report sucks all the fun out of my playtime. Especially when it means that I still can\u0027t do what I can\u0027t do. \n\nSo I\u0027m stuck until you guys fix some stuff.\n\nNow I know, a bunch of other forum users are going to explain to me how I\u0027m doing something wrong. How I\u0027m not following protocol or some such.\n\nSome might say that you were just being KSP fanboys but the fact of the matter is I\u0027m probably one of the biggest KSP/Squad fanboys on here.\n\nI have my cake. I\u0027d like to be able to eat it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-04T07:38:48Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2015 07:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Daveroski**\n  \nTypo"}]}
