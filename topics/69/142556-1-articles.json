The files were made when I first got the game shortly after asteroids were added. The crafts worked up until 1.0 and after 1.0 only one of the crafts from the .24 region worked. I have a non-working curropt ksp.90 backed up and since it cannot be used and 1.1.3 doesn\u0027t acknowledge the \u00A0craft in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E how do I recover the crafts? The only one that worked was edited and now works superbly. Is there a way to download KSP .90 to use them or update them? I run KSP off of steam if this helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness2","CreatedById":158940,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-27T09:49:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome of the parts have been migrated to a new part file. This will cause ships with the old versions of these parts to contain defunct parts and it might be what\u0027s causing your bug.
