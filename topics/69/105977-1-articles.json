Everything was OK.\n\nThen I read wiki. [http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Docking](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Docking)\n\nIt says: \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Right click the docking port on your ship and hit \u0022control from here\u0022. Now activate docking mode. What is happening now is that docking port will be seen as the \u0022center\u0022 of your ship. Activate RCS (the default key isR) and the controls will be very similar to the EVA controls. WS will be used to move forward and backwards, AD will be used to move left and right, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00A1\u00C2\u00A7 Shift and ^ Ctrl will be used to move up and down.\n\nBut the game doesn\u0027t work this way!\n\nW and S still pitch, A and D still yaw even though i\u0027m in **docking mode.**\n\nShift and Control still control main engine in docking mode.\n\nSpace hotkey doesn\u0027t affect anything.\n\nIs it a bug or am i missing something?\n\n**KSP version:** 1.0.0.830 Steam version\n\nSome screenshots:\n\nHitting W (It should move we forward, shouldn\u0027t it?)\n\n![qIfMhKB.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/qIfMhKB.jpg)\n\nHitting A (Shouldn\u0027t this move ME left, but not turn left?)\n\n![i6h5DKW.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/i6h5DKW.jpg)\n\nHitting shift (still control main engine)\n\n![WVVjYKz.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/WVVjYKz.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T13:39:43Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 01:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Shunt**"},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T14:18:53Z","Content":"The wiki was written a while ago - there were very major differences in how this stuff works between the last version and this one,and the wiki hasn\u0027t been updated yet. \n\nYou\u0027ve written it up pretty well!
