I deployed my chutes too early and was heading for certain doom into the ocean. At around 100 meters from the surface my ship suddenly shattered to pieces and the cockpit hit near light speed as it soared into deep space. \n\nHere\u0027s the thing....\n\nI couldn\u0027t play the game anymore due to this. Even when I started a brand new game I would be in the same predicament. When I went back to the base the screen would have the lower bar but the scene would be of space. I was forced to reinstall the game to correct it.\n\nI suppose I\u0027ll wait a few more months before picking the game up again. Seems you guys still have some major bugs to work out. Good luck!\n\nI was on the 32 bit version and had absolutely no mods installed (I wouldn\u0027t have bothered to report this if I had mods installed.) I\u0027ll check this thread tomorrow if you have any questions. I can pretty much tell you exactly what parts I used to build the ship, angle of the ship right before it disintegrated, ect.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-03T11:24:13Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2015 11:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jas1126**"},{"CreatedByName":"T-Bouw","CreatedById":21500,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T14:45:26Z","Content":"It really sounds like a game-breaking (literally) bug. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nPlease post a bug-report with all the info. you can muster at the Support subforum: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/76-Support-%28unmodded-installs%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/76-Support-%28unmodded-installs%29)\n\nMaybe Squad will take a look into it."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T14:47:50Z","Content":"I better move this over actually, Jas1126 if you put your save on dropbox others can have a look."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T22:16:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Even when I started a brand new game I would be in the same predicament.\n\nDid you actually restart KSP when you did this? Or just back to the main screen.\n\nTry moving that save out of the Saves directory somewhere else, then start up KSP. That would narrow it down to a corrupt save. Then, if so, upload as sal suggests and we might be able to help you out. Also, the logs from that crash might help out. (The sticky that T-Bouw linked shows where that stuff is.) Assuming you haven\u0027t restarted KSP since that crash.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Jas1126","CreatedById":99760,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T02:26:02Z","Content":"My initial new game was from the menu. The second restart was from Steam, meaning I had exited the game entirely. Both times I had the same glitch. I didn\u0027t think to preserve the save file.. Sorry. I honestly didn\u0027t even think to post this until I reinstalled the game. I was understandably peeved from the game being unplayable so wasn\u0027t thinking clearly. I was using cheats when this occurred. Infinite fuel, unbreakable joints, no crash damage, ignore max temperature and infinite RCS in sandbox (I just wanted so see what Eve looked like with my new PC.) This may have played a part in the ship disintegrating. \n\nSpecs: Copied from Speccy\n\nWindows 8.1 64-Bit\n\nIntel Core i7 4790 @ 3.60GHz\n\n8GB Dual-Channel DDR3 @ 800MHz\n\nMotherboard: Alienware 0PGRP5 Socket 0\n\nNvidia Geforce GTX 760-Ti 2GB\n\nHope this helps a little and sorry again for not having the save.."}]}
