Long time no real english practicing. \n\nIm running Mint 17.1 /Nvidia 660gtx/Roccat Kone XTD Mouse/ German local. etc. When in \u0022Map\u0022 i can scroll and turn around no problem. But when in VAB, after i added a part to the \u0022empty\u0022 space, whenever i \u0022left-click-hold\u0022 and turn the mouse, the sight goes havoc to all sides, as if the signal gets scrambled and to 1000000 sensitivity. when trying to fly that thing i constructed, the same happens. also the mousewheel seems to be on too high sens.\n\ni allready disabled aa, ppfx.. no change. setup the sensitivity of some stuff to 0.25 (as described here : [http://steamcommunity.com/app/220200/discussions/0/864974467288867445/?l=german](http://steamcommunity.com/app/220200/discussions/0/864974467288867445/?l=german) )\n\nno change, i even tried the LC\\_ALL-fix. (which diasabled contracts,flags and more ingame.) but. no change.\n\nAnyone around with any idea?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nDan"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T20:40:52Z","Content":"Well, LC\\_ALL is built into the KSP.x86 now so you don\u0027t need it there, but it\u0027s still required for x86\\_64\n\nThe settings.cfg gets changed, so that needs to be deleted, if that doesn\u0027t fix it please post your game logs."},{"CreatedByName":"DanGer","CreatedById":114767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T20:52:19Z","Content":"Yeah, im running 64bit.
