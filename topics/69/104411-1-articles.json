I don\u0027t think the card is too weak, it\u0027s pretty fast and handles high part counts fine."},{"CreatedByName":"ainurakne","CreatedById":140862,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T20:47:53Z","Content":"I have started to notice that too, but only recently, since I started to try out large Mk3 space planes with lots of parts - I never noticed it before with smaller grafts.\n\n(I\u0027ve got GeForce GTX 560 Ti)\n\nI haven\u0027t paid much attention to it, so I am not sure whether it\u0027s GPU or CPU, but it seems that one of them chokes because the calculations performed to visualize said effects are very intense.\n\nSorry, I have no idea how or if this can be solved. Hopefully these effects will be optimized in 1.0."},{"CreatedByName":"waterlubber","CreatedById":119333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T23:38:44Z","Content":"Yes. Is there a way to turn it off?
