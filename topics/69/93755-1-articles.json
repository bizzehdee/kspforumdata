In particular, I\u0027m unable to use the Mystery Goo to do science, which is making early career particularly difficult. I\u0027m able to select Deploy while in VAB/SPH/EVA... but when in flight there is no menu displayed at all when I right click. It doesn\u0027t seem to matter what class my Kerbal is, so I don\u0027t think this is a game mechanic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI posted this on reddit as well, and some there suggested that it\u0027s an issue with the 64-bit version for OS X (which I have had no problems with before).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m on OS X 10.9.5 (13F34) Mavericks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully someone else out there is experiencing this issue and we can narrow down a cause, it seems to be pretty rare (only found 2 other people commenting about it so far).
