If I changed the camera angle, I could find certain angles where this activity would stop and the top of the screen would appear normal, but from most perspectives it was constantly a light show up there. I did not see anything like this while in the main menus, Mission Center, VAB or over the Space Center ... only when I went out to the launchpad and during the whole duration of the ensuing (short) flight. The glitch stopped again when I recovered the mission and returned to the Space Center.\n\niMac 27\u0022 late 2013\n\n3.5 GHz Core i7 x4\n\n16 GB RAM\n\nNVidia GeForce GTX780M 4GB graphics\n\nOS X 10.10.3"},{"CreatedByName":"_Nick","CreatedById":143432,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T10:48:52Z","Content":"Have you tried restarting your computer? Sounds to me like your graphics card has just been working very hard, and your computer can use a restart. This has happened to me before and a restart worked fine. However, I\u0027m not an expert so don\u0027t take my word for it."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T10:57:43Z","Content":"Hi Mystic, there seems to be an issue with OS X graphics drivers and the Unity3D engines built-in anti-aliasing, try turning it off in the KSP settings and see if this solves the problem.\n\nIf this doesn\u0027t help then please provide your game logs and pics of the issue, see the support stickies for more information."}]}
