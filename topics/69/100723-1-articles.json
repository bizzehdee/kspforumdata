That problem was on my heavily modded install, and persist through deletion of all the mods and reinstalling the Game...\n\nThere\u0027re no crashes, just freezing witha black screen between main menus and KSC scene. \n\nLog file here: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/be6odafadrc8e51/output_log.txt?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/be6odafadrc8e51/output_log.txt?dl=0)\n\nP.S.\n\nSorry for my bad Engrish."},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T21:50:06Z","Content":"Your English is fine, don\u0027t worry. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nWhat antivirus or other security software do you have running? It\u0027s sometimes a good idea to add KSP to their ignore lists or whitelists, as they can occasionally interfere and cause issues like this."},{"CreatedByName":"kakxow","CreatedById":137778,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T22:20:31Z","Content":"Thank you very much! \n\nAdding to whitelist (and updating both antivirus and video card driver) solved that problem. That\u0027s a bit strange, IMO: more than 700h of gameplay and suddenly a problem with antivirus w/o any changes.\n\nYour answer was incredibly fast, so I can play an hour or a half before falling asleep!^^"}]}
