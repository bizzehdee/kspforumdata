I can\u0027t even get past one launch without the game crashing. I\u0027ve tried using the launcher to boot the game, and directly booting both the 64bit and 32bit .exe files. The game doesn\u0027t seem to take that long loading, and there\u0027s no lag whenever the game is in use. I don\u0027t have any mods added and I don\u0027t have any other programs booted at the same time as KSP. I also made sure that there weren\u0027t any background processes that happened to be tanking my RAM.\u00A0I\u0027m using a Windows 8 computer, but I don\u0027t know any other specifications about my system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-01T22:24:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe latest release is 1.1.3 so I suggest you update \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-05T17:16:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere were some definite stability issues that are fixed in the most recent version, specifically that were causing random crashing.

A huge storm passed through my area and my internet has been so stupid. I did download the latest version, 1.1.3 and I was actually happy to see my game progress through the first launch. I haven\u0027t been experiencing any odd crashes lately. One thing I still worry about is that sometimes the game won\u0027t last long enough for me to land on the M\u00FCn. Even orbiting is problematic for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-05T20:21:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell if you\u0027re having any trouble with playing KSP there\u0027s a rather good \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/forum/16-gameplay-questions-and-tutorials/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EGameplay questions and tutorials section\u003C/a\u003E, where other members will be glad to help you out \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Atubara","CreatedById":166128,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-05T20:24:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you.
