KSP is one of those rare CPU-limited games, the physics is single-threaded, and physics time is super-linear with respect to part count (physics calculation time increases faster than the number of parts you add). Many people start to see lag in the 250-400 part range, and a 1700-part vehicle is probably going to cause any CPU to grind to a near-halt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would suggest moving your delta-time slider all the way to large time steps: it reduces the accuracy of KSP simulation, but will increase framerate. Even still, I suspect you won\u0027t see a crisp framerate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darren9","CreatedById":58062,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-23T22:32:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately there\u0027s not much that can be done, the only way to run more parts is increase single-threaded CPU performance (higher clock speed or better CPU).
