When you extend landing gear, you should experience drop of speed. Did not happen. Speed inreased instead. When retracting, speed dropped.\n\nSo i can see that you are fiddling with gear drag somehow, but in wrong way ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) In real airplanes is gear used for good braking. It can be also damaged by excessive speed.\n\nAnother thing i noticed is altimeter behavior. Real altimeter has small triangle at the edge for tens of thousands not for hundreds. For hundereds is used a long needle. I am fixing this in cfg file of the altimeter, soiti behaves like real altimeter. Easy to change, think of it ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T08:01:36Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 08:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Supernovy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T08:21:07Z","Content":"Go into the debug menu (alt-f12) and under \u0022aero\u0022 turn on the setting that lets you see the drag of each part in the right click menu.

When you press retract it jumps to 20 and goes down to 10 while retracting. Then it jumps up to 20 when it locks up. I would say Acd values of both models are reversed.\n\nSmall landing gear works correctly, I havent checked largest one yet.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T21:21:29Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 09:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Radam**"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T10:49:20Z","Content":"That matches up with other reports we\u0027ve received, thanks."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T07:51:25Z","Content":"If you aren\u0027t opposed to add-ons, I have a fix for this in my stock bug fixes: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97285](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97285)\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"}]}
