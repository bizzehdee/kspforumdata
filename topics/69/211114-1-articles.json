It does not happen when there is not much going on, but flying into new biomes and especially planning maneuvers while flying a complex rocket that consists of hundreds of parts will cause the blackouts to happen almost nonstop, so I will spend more time in pause with a black screen than actually playing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried adjusting graphics settings. Turning vsync off helped, but did not remove the problem.

So I am actually paying money to always have all the latest updates to all of my hardware. Many drivers (including Nvidia) have been updated during the time that I have been experiencing this problem with KSP. I am not saying this could not be a driver issue. I am saying this is not an issue involving out-of-date drivers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think the log will reveal anything, either. It does not feel like something that KSP is \u0022aware of\u0022 and would record in the log. Like I said, the game keeps running like nothing is wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yes, if this happened with other games, I would obviously be posting on Asus or Nvidia forums. But it doesn\u0027t. And if it was happening on KSP just randomly anytime anywhere, I would suspect cable or connection issues. But it is clearly happening only during certain activity within the game. For example, I could be flying a rocket with no problem, but the second I start planning a maneuver, the blackouts kick in. And it works the other way around: immediately when I am happy with my planned maneuver and close maneuver mode, the blackouts stop. Yes, I tried adjusting the settings for maneuver planning (number of paths shown, how the paths are calculated). Did not help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can also be flying around with the view pointed in this direction and no problem, but if I point it in that direction, blackouts start happening. It seems to be related to \u0022how much is going on in view\u0022. So, let\u0027s say there are lots of rockets orbiting Mun. If I am doing something with the view focused on Minmus, but Mun is also in view, then blackouts happen. If I point the view away from Mun, no problem. The rockets are too far away to be seen from Minmus, anyway, but if the view is in that direction, then they are \u0022in view\u0022, do you understand what I mean?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr, like I said, a simple rocket with only a few parts will not cause problems, but when I am flying my rocket destined for Eve (so hundreds of parts), then I have difficulty getting anything done, because the game will be constantly in blackout. That same rocket I built in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E for hours without a single blackout, but once I am flying it, then constant blackouts.

This is not, of course, the actual fps. It is just the frequency of the signal. In any game and in a moment with intense action, the actual fps may drop, but the signal to the monitor should not.
