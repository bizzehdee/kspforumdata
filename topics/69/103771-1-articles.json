It was due to the symmetry mode being changed.**\n\nI was assembling my latest crapmobile when this bug became apparent. Compare both outer engines in both photographs. The engine is on top of the left wing but below the right wing but the landing gear appears in the correct place on both sides, apparently floating in midair on the left wing.\n\n(click to enlarge)\n\n[![Qjzw0kPm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Qjzw0kPm.jpg)](http://imgur.com/Qjzw0kP)\n\n[![nBGRAZMm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/nBGRAZMm.jpg)](http://imgur.com/nBGRAZM)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-09T17:39:51Z\u0022 title=\u002204/09/2015 05:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by THX1138**"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T21:35:46Z","Content":"Check the symmetry type throughout the ship... sometimes you might start your wings as Mirror, then somewhere along the way switch to Radial.\n\nYou wanna keep it the same from the base of the wing to the tip... otherwise this may happen.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nEdit: Just noticed your edit."}]}
