Attached parts may appear to be attached correctly but subsequent behaviour seems to shows duplicate parts were added that behave according to the wrong symmetry. Occurs in both Space Plane Hangar and Vehicle Assembly Building. Not sure how to work around it at this stage. Making sure that symmetry is kept mirrored when adding parts but still happens.\n\n**Mods/Add-Ons:** None\n\n**Steps to Replicate:**\n\n1. Create a new vehicle in either SPH or VAB. Ensure mirror symmetry is active but set to 1.![qWgvOJO.png](http://i.imgur.com/qWgvOJO.png)\n2. Attach a part (call it part A).![MHHirFU.png](http://i.imgur.com/MHHirFU.png)\n3. Enable two-part symmetry and attach a new part B to part A.![7elw5td.png](http://i.imgur.com/7elw5td.png)\n4. Select part A and move it to a different position. As symmetry is still active, a duplicate is created on the other side, as expected.![UiGM2kI.png](http://i.imgur.com/UiGM2kI.png)\n5. Attach a new part C to any part B. At first glance, part appears to be attached correctly, but closer inspection shows z-fighting on the mirrored part.![3HOItx3.png](http://i.imgur.com/3HOItx3.png)\n6. Note the z-fighting on the mirrored part, which seems to indicate that an extra part was created in the same position as the mirror.![CI9Er8S.png](http://i.imgur.com/CI9Er8S.png)\n7. Try to move part A, and note that there seem to be a few extra parts floating around![RwiCiaO.png](http://i.imgur.com/RwiCiaO.png)\n\nI would expect the subassembly to be mirrored on the other side, just as it is on the initial side, but I\u0027m assuming that there\u0027s some unintuitive interaction happening under the hood.\n\nDebug panel screenshot after deleting and re-adding the wing:\n\n![TncXZQy.png](http://i.imgur.com/TncXZQy.png)\n\nAny workarounds? I\u0027ve only used basic mirroring (no subassemblies) in the past but was hoping to get better top/bottom symmetry."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T17:20:22Z","Content":"Symmetry in the SPH is a little wonky sitheyradial symmetry has been unlocked.
