I\u0027ll build a ship with a manned space pod, and I\u0027ll attach batteries to the fuel tanks to give it more power. But it seems that when it comes to prioritizing power usage, my ship prefers to draw power from the command module first, then the batteries themselves. When I separate my command pod from my fuel tanks preparing for reeentry, I find that I have no power left in my command modules. As a result, I cannot orient my ship so that the heat shield is pointing in the retrograde position, and my ship burns up in the atmosphere. Is this a bug, or am I doing somehting wrong?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-07T20:36:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, it\u0027s consistent behaviour with 1.0.5\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmNxRvfuXPUCK5NrnUyo2HtPJesfKTK7qDqbDcH9non6Mk\u0022 alt=\u0022QmNxRvfuXPUCK5NrnUyo2HtPJesfKTK7qDqbDcH9\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEC using parts will drain from all EC sources equally, and as your pod usually has the least EC it\u0027ll be drained before any other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a flow control on every EC containing part, exactly like with fuel, so you can turn EC usage on pods off until you need it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-08T01:53:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust do a right-click on battery, alt-right-click on pod and do a manual resource transfer of the electricity before you decouple.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MightyOfus","CreatedById":163776,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-08T14:12:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUgh. Forgive me, but that sounds hella frustrating.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nDrawing battery power from all sources below the neck is one thing. If I have four batteries, I would expect them to drain equally. But from the Command Pod? Yes, I could manually transfer power. Or manually turn off power flow from the Command Pod. But should I really have to? Every single mission? It just seems to me that Command Pod power should always go last by default. I can\u0027t think of a scenario where anyone would plan it any other way. It just seems to me that this change puts more work on the player that doesn\u0027t need to be there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
