There\u0027s a mod that adds a part to keep different vessels staying in formation (action groups extended maybe?) when doing maneuvers, and MechJeb can execute maneuvers for you even when on another ship, if said ship is within physics range of the one doing the maneuver; but it will (probably) stop controlling it as soon as it leaves physics range so possibly not worth pursuing that option unless you\u0027re going to EXACTLY the same place at EXACTLY the same time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might want to look into Kerbal Alarm Clock which can set alarms for maneuver nodes, so you don\u0027t miss them, if the problem is that you keep missing nodes because you\u0027re looking at something else at the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso- there appears to be a duplicate of this thread, are you able to delete the duplicate or edit it to say it\u0027s a duplicate?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022200785\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed3974955408\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/194192-is-there-a-way-to-get-a-ship-to-fly-autonomously-while-doing-another-thing-like-flying-another-ship/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:210px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-27T17:30:04Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2020 05:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by jimmymcgoochie\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mech_Jeb_42","CreatedById":200785,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-29T13:11:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found that PRE (Physics Range Extender) works in for extending the physics range and I will try out kerbal alarm clock.

There\u0027s also Astrogator which tells you the time to the next window and can place nodes for you (but requires a bit of manual input to adjust said nodes) and transfer window planner which can show you the delta-V required for transfers depending on when you start and how long your transfer takes- surprisingly there are often windows with low delta-V required that are a lot faster than the most efficient transfer burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbal Alarm Clock is almost a must-have for career mode when you have many different missions going to different places at once and can\u0027t keep track of all those maneuver nodes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for recovering stages- StageRecovery and FMRS are two options that can recover dropped stages, though I think FMRS tends to work best for controlled stages whereas StageRecovery can do anything as long as it has enough parachutes. Both are pretty configurable, and the ability to recover a sizeable percentage of the launch costs early in career mode is a huge benefit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
