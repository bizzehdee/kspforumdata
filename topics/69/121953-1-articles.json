I assume you haven\u0027t touched the game files at all (Specifically the Squad folder founder under Gamedata)? Because that sounds like the game cannot locate any of the mission files. Can you provide an output log (found under KSPData). It\u0027ll help us to find a solution to this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(If bought through the KSP Store)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo upload your Output file, find the install directory (where you installed the game), If you haven\u0027t renamed it then it will be called \u0022KSP_win\u0022 (assuming windows, if your not using windows then its similar anyway). Find that folder, then enter one called KSPData. Scroll down until you see a file called Output log. Then open Google Drive, MediaFire, Dropbox, etc and then upload the file. From there get the sharable link from the website and then control past it here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"yorshee","CreatedById":135011,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-29T15:50:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you in time warp when you access the building?
