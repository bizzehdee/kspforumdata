All the Altimeter data went missing.\n\nI returned to Space Center to find it to was missing, as was Kerbin. I could only see a view of space:\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/2z1B90t.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/2z1B90t.jpg)\n\nFully shutting down game and reloading allowed me to return to the Space Center. It looks fine. I then used the tracking station to go to the aircraft, it is currently on an escape trajectory from Kerbol at 23401m/s.\n\nAlso Jeb died :/\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T00:46:12Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 12:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Llewlits**"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T08:19:14Z","Content":"This happens sometimes.
