When I press play game the curser pops up but thats\u00A0it, all I see is my desktop, I\u0027ve tried uninstalling and reinstalling multiple times and I\u0027ve also reset my computer, nothing seems\u00A0to work. I have a Lenovo laptop with Windows 8.1,\u00A0If anyone knows how to fix this please tell me because I would really like to play this game more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
