Only way I know to mem crash the game stock is to get parts to overheat (the overheat warning gauge on parts has a massive memory leak).\n\nEDIT: If you can get me your KSP.log (in ksp\\_win) and your output\\_log.txt (in your crash folder), that\u0027d be exceedingly helpful.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T22:07:29Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 10:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Captain Sierra**"},{"CreatedByName":"Adester","CreatedById":131235,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T22:07:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E and this is supposed to be a post-beta version...\n\nplease don\u0027t blame ksp that easy. there could be issues with your memory. a virus?
