Thanks in advance.\n\nI was wondering the same thing. I spent about an hour today trying to get the axis settings right. I ran into a problem with KSP failing to properly set up the modemasks (staging/rotation/docking) and had to manually edit the settings file (and engage in a lot of guesswork). I\u0027m not sure if this is a KSP bug or a problem with having KSP in the program files directory (seems unlikely as KSP has never had a problem modifying files there before). A link to a \u0022How to setup a joystick in 1.0\u0022 would be greatly appreciated."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T10:09:03Z","Content":"We didn\u0027t get a key to swap bindings in the end, which is more than a little annoying, I\u0027ll be asking again for 1.1\n\nThe binding is bugged yes, the modes won\u0027t stick if you don\u0027t also rebind the key or axis, so even if you\u0027re using the same key you need to rebind it."},{"CreatedByName":"Tarheel1999","CreatedById":123965,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T10:15:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E We didn\u0027t get a key to swap bindings in the end, which is more than a little annoying, I\u0027ll be asking again for 1.1\n\u003E The binding is bugged yes, the modes won\u0027t stick if you don\u0027t also rebind the key or axis, so even if you\u0027re using the same key you need to rebind it.\n\nTruth be told, I preferred editing the cig file once I figured out what the numbers corresponded to.
