Also, I think the graphics became much worse despite maximum settings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn flight, one ingame second lasted between 3 and 4 real life seconds, even with the small 10 to 20 part crafts you tend to build early on in career mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy RAM is only utilized to less than 70% while running KSP, with KSP only using 2.6 GB or so (I have 8 GB in total). The CPU is only utilized to about 10% (I have an i7-4700HQ processor, i.e. 2.4 to 3.4 GHz Quadcore).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had a modded install before and\u00A0first thing I tried was removing the not yet updated mods. This somehow destroyed the install - I couldn\u0027t load anything anymore, so I reinstalled KSP. Didn\u0027t help either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny Ideas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: 32 bit works without lag.
