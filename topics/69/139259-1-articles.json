It\u0027s just now that I\u0027ve realized they\u0027re the same problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat will happen is, I\u0027ll have a Kerbal on EVA, and I\u0027ll use my jet pack to fly around. Sometimes, when thrusting in one direction, the thruster gets stuck on, and stays on until I click the thruster again, in the same direction, twice. If I do nothing, he will continue to thrust in one direction, I assume until he runs out of fuel, even with no hands on the keys.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLanding on Gilly right now, I had a spacecraft begin rotating out of control. Even with SAS, it just rotates faster and faster. I\u0027m not sure what stops it, because in a panic I just start mashing keys, but maybe it\u0027s the same \u0022click twice in the same direction you\u0027re rotating\u0022 thing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would assume I had Windows StickyKeys on, or some keyboard problem, but this never happens in space, or if it does, I haven\u0027t seen it. It only happens when on or very near the surface of a planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes this happen to anyone else?
