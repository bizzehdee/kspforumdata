It happens just from loading the game I don\u0027t even have to start the game. While sitting on the menu page even the temps climb. It takes only 5 min for my temps to go from the 60\u0027s into the 90\u0027s. I am running it on an ACER laptop with an i5 CPU and NVIDIA gtx 730M graphics card.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have tried making sure the game is actually using the graphics card by going through the NVIDIA control panel (not sure if it actually is though), I have tried limiting the amount my CPU is allowed to use by going through the power management settings but that doesn\u0027t seem to have any effect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rodhern","CreatedById":144074,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-01T22:39:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn one of the earlier versions I used \u0022Kerbokatz small utilities FPSLimiter\u0022, which allowed my fans to not spin as fast (less heat). I don\u0027t need it in the newer KSP versions, but it might be worth a try (?).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ian Luedke","CreatedById":182526,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-02T13:26:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nK.S.P. Is VERY C.P.U. Intensive, due to all of the physics that have to be processed. My guess is that you may have dust or your computers heat expelliation port blocked. You may want to take an air duster can and clean out you exhaust and intake ports. Dust can easily get stuck inside your heat pipes withen the laptop if not cleaned regularly. I would check if that is the issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrLicor","CreatedById":165712,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-02T17:56:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGraphics have (almost) nothing to do with CPU heat, it\u0027s the calculation. KSP is very CPU intensive, it\u0027s its current bottleneck for performance.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA laptap is heated very fast, and most laptops are set to a run temp of 80 degree, when it get\u0027s hotter, it will cool the most, however, when that\u0027s not enough, it will drop performance. Cooling is minimalized when under those temp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"uspilotzzz","CreatedById":182550,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-02T18:16:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I have updated all my drivers and launch ksp through the nvidia utility. I have also checked for dirt and dust and found none.\u00A0One of these has helped keep my temps in check. They still run higher than I think they should though. I have downloaded intel ETX and stress tested my CPU and even running the CPU at 100% for 15min the temps were better than what they are during ksp.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext I\u0027m going to stress test the GPU and see if that is contributing to the heat.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hay","CreatedById":132918,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-02T18:21:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost likely caused by sub-par cooling on said laptop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ian Luedke","CreatedById":182526,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-02T19:02:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019m having a debate weather its sub par laptop cooling or you have some sort of program that runs in the background and causes lag. I still think that you should use some compressed air (LOW PSI or your beautiful laptop will be ripped apart) to blow into the intake and exhaust, because dust will catch on internal circuits and the radiator fins and the tangled mess of heat pipes. That\u2019s just my thought though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat are your idle tempattures? (CPU,GPU)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is your idle usage percentage?

Changing some of the settings made a difference but the biggest difference was from blowing it out properly and getting the dust out. It now runs ksp in the 60-65 degree range.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocketsciences101","CreatedById":182952,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-20T04:37:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a aced to and my would get so hot it would suddenly shut down so I put it literally on a fan to keep it cool and it works\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
