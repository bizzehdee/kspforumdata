This bug is amazing and easily reproducible.\n\nWhen designing a ship in the VAB or SPH, it is currently possible to place fairings so they reach far, far below other parts. This creates some confusion with the game engine because the game will not use a fairing as the base to set the craft down on, thus making the fairings below the ground when they should not be on launch.\n\n**How to Replicate:**\n\nStep 1: Construct a craft such as in image 1, where all the fairings contain nothing and point down from the craft \n\nStep 2: When launched it will settle on the launch surface with the fairings under the ground as in image 2.\n\nStep 3: At this point the craft will do different things dependent on the height of the fairing groups, the presence of launch clamps and whether it is launched from VAB or SPH. Two of these results are demonstrated inf Gif 1 and Gif 2 below.\n\nCraft File: [Fairing Test 11](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3ttczPyBDOnNUYyR29NcjA0NEU/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**Results:** As you can see from Gif 1, this bug will actually dislodge launch clamps due to the fairings wanting to eject from the ground. I\u0027m still exploring what is possible with this contraption but I think it can be leveraged to stop gravity effects on a craft, thought I haven\u0027t narrowed down the direct conditions to replicate it yet. It has something to do with the destruction of the root part, though.\n\n**Suggested Fix:** Give fairings a temporary physics box for launching.\n\n**Resources:** \n\n[Image 1](http://i.imgur.com/RiT0Zk5.jpg)\n\n[Image 2](http://i.imgur.com/80A3Uuk.jpg)\n\n[[gif 1](http://gfycat.com/AcademicIllfatedGoldenretriever)]\n\n[[gif 2](http://gfycat.com/NeatTanBelugawhale)]\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T00:35:46Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 12:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Xacktar**"}]}
