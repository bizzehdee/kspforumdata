Now, duct tape is probably one of the best adhesives around, but when it comes to heavy-duty landing gear on giant planes, I\u0027d appreciate something a bit sturdier. Like, you know, welding. Any suggestions on how to avoid my jumbo jet crumbling to pieces when I gently touch the ground?\n\nNINJA EDIT: I kid you not, I turned on Unbreakable Joints. The landing gear still fell off."},{"CreatedByName":"josh__ab","CreatedById":107365,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T07:58:58Z","Content":"Add struts?

Try flaring harder before touchdown to get a very slow vertical velocity, and you should be fine, whatever the size of your ship is."},{"CreatedByName":"Bilfr3d","CreatedById":75448,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T09:05:54Z","Content":"What is your term of \u0022gentle landing\u0022? For me a gentle landing is about 3m/s vertical speed MAX. Anything that looks to be higher and I try to back off the landing."}]}
