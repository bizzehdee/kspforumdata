I\u0027ve been waiting for a game / simulator like this for decades.\n\nBut, I do have an issue:\n\nI\u0027m trying to do an EVA in the mountains around coordinates 25.7 , -148.3. I\u0027m using an airplane with a drop capsule as pictured below.\n\n[![Dropship.jpg](http://i247.photobucket.com/albums/gg156/KellyCaldwell77/Dropship.jpg)](http://s247.photobucket.com/user/KellyCaldwell77/media/Dropship.jpg.html)\n\nI\u0027ve successfully done this over grasslands, highlands, and the polar ice cap. But at the above coordinates, as soon as the capsule touches down it disappears and the crewman is listed as KIA. I get a clean separation from the aircraft over smooth flat terrain with a decent rate of about 5.4 m/s. If I follow the capsule all the way down, it lands successfully but then my aircraft disappears (I left it for just a few seconds in stable flight with plenty of altitude). \n\n[![Dropship%203.jpg](http://i247.photobucket.com/albums/gg156/KellyCaldwell77/Dropship%203.jpg)](http://s247.photobucket.com/user/KellyCaldwell77/media/Dropship%203.jpg.html)\n\n[![Dropship%202.jpg](http://i247.photobucket.com/albums/gg156/KellyCaldwell77/Dropship%202.jpg)](http://s247.photobucket.com/user/KellyCaldwell77/media/Dropship%202.jpg.html)\n\nI have also reproduced the same problem over the tundra biome around coordinates -80.5 , -44.2.\n\nThe biome for my mountain coordinates is classified as \u0022Mountain\u0022 but the ground looks like tundra to me. That is the only connection I can see between the two coordinates. I can deploy successfully anywhere else. \n\nHave I found a bug here or is there some game mechanics rule that I don\u0027t understand?\n\nThanks for any advice."},{"CreatedByName":"TheMoonRover","CreatedById":136199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T16:40:38Z","Content":"Are the disappearing parts exploding? There\u0027re three reasons that could happen:\n\n1) They\u0027re crashing into something - or the game thinks they are. There is a rare bug where the space centre buildings\u0027 collision meshes end up in the wrong place, but you would have to be within a few km of the space centre for that to happen. Another rare bug is when a ship is incorrectly flagged as underground, which immediately destroys it, particularly if you quicksave when flying very low then reload the save.\n\n2) Overheating, but you would see little temperature guages warning you first, unless you disabled them (F10) or are using version 1.0.0 or 1.0.1\n\n3) Extreme aerodynamic stress if you pull an incredibly tight turn (highly unlikely). \n\nThe plane disappearing could be due to the physics load distance. If a vessel goes beyond the physics load distance (22.5 km from the active vessel in the current version, or 2.5 km prior to 1.0) while in dense atmopshere, it will be deleted. But that\u0027s unlikely after just a few seconds. Are you using any weapons mods or anything else which alters the physics load distance? unmodded - disregard.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-20T16:45:02Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2015 04:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheMoonRover**"},{"CreatedByName":"Moesly_Armlis","CreatedById":112247,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T17:51:17Z","Content":"You might have found the kermuda triangle.\n\nThat vessel is awesome, and it should be named \u0022The Punisher\u0022. Riding in between the four jet engines, disregarding safety, so very kerbal. Do you even turn off the jets before dropping the payload?\n\nAs mentioned by TheMoonRover the game mechanic of the physics load distance is 22.5 km and as long as your vessel remains within that bubble everything should be fine.\n\nPress F3 and it will show the flight log and might reveal what is happening.\n\nBTW welcome to KSP and the forums."}]}
