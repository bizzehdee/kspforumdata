In both cases, after burning at full throttle for just over a minute (1:06 according to my stopwatch), all the engines flame out and say they\u2019re oxidizer deprived. However, when I look at the supplies popup, the ship shows as having plenty of oxidizer and fuel left.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan anyone tell me if this is a case of the ship design getting zorched by an update somewhere along the way, an engine or other behavior that wasn\u2019t explained in earlier tutorials, or just me being too oblivious to see the obvious solution? Am I supposed to jettison the large stage in the middle of a course correction burn? (If so, that seems like a weird ship design to hand newbies like me in a tutorial.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny assistance appreciated!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-12T14:56:28Z\u0022 title=\u002212/12/2015 02:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by meyerweb\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ECleaned up forum migration errors (Unicode and hyperlinking were both botched\u2014sigh)\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ted","CreatedById":26298,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-13T20:11:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoved this thread over to Support.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"meyerweb","CreatedById":135212,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-13T20:19:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!
