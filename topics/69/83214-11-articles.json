Few questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs Linux purely openGL? Can I expect the same degraded performance as in Windows with OpenGL? Because I can tell ya right now the anti aliasing override I specified in nvidia settings actually works. I\u0027ve got smooth edges it\u0027s amazing. But something is still not quite right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if maybe it\u0027s the contrast. But the color of the picture looks off from what I\u0027m used too in Windows.

I also seem to be getting some mild artifacts and there is still a considerable amount of aliasing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo i messed around with the color settings in the nvidia software. Better, but.. still not right. And im not sure if its the product of a little bit of extra gamma, but the lighting in KSP seems to be suffering from poor gradients. When you look up at the sun and when in orbit you can see instead of a smooth color change im getting leveled/blocky gradients.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd i dare say thats the only fly in my oitment right now. I could use a little more AA, but what i have now is much better then what i had in Windows OpenGL. Just this strange coloring/gradient issue. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and yea.. my sound is not too good turns out. Exposions sound like a skipping CDs. Is there any remedy for that? Maybe the Normalizer/Responsivness options in KSP? ( whatever the heck they do.

I thought maybe that was giving me issues so I started with a new file and only changed the very first instance of intel.intel and that by itself did give me the effects I always expect, so maybe changing those other strings adversely affected the known memory leaks?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, I\u0027m now getting slightly better performance and with an hour or two of testing it seems that it\u0027s not trying to write non-stop to HD like it was before. I do have a smaller laptop HD I\u0027m going to try a new linux install with and see how that works there. Maybe I will try XFCE (I do use it, but not on my main laptop, I have it on a real old laptop that I keep in my workshop for streaming pandora, I just don\u0027t like it\u0027s look)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, all these issues I\u0027ve had with 0.90 are on a Lenovo G580 with 8gigs of ram, running Mint 17.1 with Cinnamon. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help, I\u0027ll do more testing and whine about it here \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-26T14:15:22Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2015 02:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Eleven\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"micha","CreatedById":113840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T15:30:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Eleven\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Eleven\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ehtop is great, thanks for that heads-up! \u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe I will try XFCE (I do use it, but not on my main laptop, I have it on a real old laptop that I keep in my workshop for streaming pandora, I just don\u0027t like it\u0027s look)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help, I\u0027ll do more testing and whine about it here \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGlad things are working better for you now!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBtw, you don\u0027t have to replace Cinnamon to install XFCE - you can install both and then select which one you want for a particular session from the login screen. That\u0027s what I do - WindowMaker when I want to play KSP, and KDE when I want to do standard desktop stuff. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t wait for my 8GB of RAM to arrive next week, and a \u0022new\u0022 CPU - a Phenom II X4 965BE. I know, ridiculously slow by modern standards, but should be a nice boost from my current X2 240. Might stay in KDE after that, although tbh I\u0027ve always had a soft spot for WindowMaker..\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
