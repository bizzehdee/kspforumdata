However the female model benefits from various normal breaks to give the shape of the unit better definition when lit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy guess is that when the female suit model was made (an adjusted version of the male one) that some existing normals issues were fixed, but thes fixes weren\u0027t repeated on the original male model.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I was being really picky, I could mention that the base of the boots of the male and female models are inconsistent. The female model appears to have a normal break between the upper and undersides, whereas the male one doesn\u0027t. Maybe it\u0027s just a fashion statement thought.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooks like a straightforward bit of work (I\u0027ve been an art lead in games dev for quite a few years) to make the fixes, plus Jeb and his male buddies will feel so much better after it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo go on... assign an artist a bug on whichever bugtracker you use... you know you want to \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
