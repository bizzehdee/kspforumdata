F10 to do so. They have a known bug that leaks memory like crazy when they appear.\n\nThere are mods that disable the heat gauges by default, some of which apply their own heat warning. If turning the overlays off stops you from crashing, you might want to try one until Squad patch the leak.\n\nI, erm, might have a link to one of my own in my signature."},{"CreatedByName":"MathmoRichard","CreatedById":113752,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T14:42:15Z","Content":"But I\u0027m getting this is space with no overheating at all.\n\nI\u0027m using a MacBook Pro, just about the fastest one in existence.\n\nLol, it just happened again..
