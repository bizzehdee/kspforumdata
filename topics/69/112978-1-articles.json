When holding a sock and a bowling ball in real life, you would expect them to fall at the same time!\n\nIn KSP, the aerodynamic forces on the space craft would be more than on a kerbal, meaning the kerbal would accelerate towards the craft in theory. Unfortunately, the craft falls faster, hence a physics glitch. Please fix!!"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T18:37:33Z","Content":"No.\n\nA kerbal has much less mass so is affected more by aerodynamic forces than the craft, which has more inertia, and dropping a bowling ball and a sock in an atmosphere would result in the sock slowing first.\n\nYou may be thinking of the famous experiment with a hammer and a feather on the moon, that works because there is no air resistance acting on either object.\n\nClosing."}]}
