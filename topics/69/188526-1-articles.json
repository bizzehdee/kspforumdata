It behave properly when the game is running in normal speed. However, as soon as I started using time wrap function, the landing gear instantly sink into the ground. When the time wrap function is cancelled, the landing gear snaps back up with shear force, launching the spacecraft into the air, destroying both the landing gear and part of the spacecraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy game is completely unmodded, and the hardware specification exceeds the recommended requirements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bug is 100% reproducible with the largest landing gear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny one encountered the same bug?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-28T22:14:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJumping landing gear was a common problem in KSP version 1.3.1, and Whale_2 made a mod to work around it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022167015\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed3755486034\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/169206-131-17x-worldstabilizer-bugfix-for-vessels-bouncing-on-scene-load/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:212px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is much reduced since version 1.4.\u00A0 Some people say the mod above still helps, but I cannot confirm that; you can read the thread and see if you want to try it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother workarounds are to turn off \u0027Spring/Damper:auto\u0027 setting on the landing gear that have it, after first enabling \u0027Advanced Tweakables\u0027 in the in-flight \u0027Settings\u0027 menu that you get with the \u0027Esc\u0027 key, and then reduce the \u0027spring strength\u0027.\u00A0 A more direct workaround is to retract landing gear and rest craft\u00A0directly on the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"krakentamer591870","CreatedById":200505,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-29T03:43:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223678738\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022188526\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221569708864\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022162784\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022OHara\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, OHara said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJumping landing gear was a common problem in KSP version 1.3.1, and Whale_2 made a mod to work around it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022167015\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed277769081\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/169206-131-17x-worldstabilizer-bugfix-for-vessels-bouncing-on-scene-load/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:212px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is much reduced since version 1.4.\u00A0 Some people say the mod above still helps, but I cannot confirm that; you can read the thread and see if you want to try it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother workarounds are to turn off \u0027Spring/Damper:auto\u0027 setting on the landing gear that have it, after first enabling \u0027Advanced Tweakables\u0027 in the in-flight \u0027Settings\u0027 menu that you get with the \u0027Esc\u0027 key, and then reduce the \u0027spring strength\u0027.\u00A0 A more direct workaround is to retract landing gear and rest craft\u00A0directly on the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the reply. I\u0027m currently trying the mod first. I also heard that different type of landing gears behave slightly different on eve surface\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I\u0027m 100% certain that the advanced tweaks thing doesn\u0027t work. I already tried adjusting spring/damper strength, it only made the problem worse. Before the adjustment, only the wheels sank into the ground. After disabling spring/damper, the entire landing gear sank. Try retracting the gears sometimes helps, other times as soon as the gear button is pressed, the entire spacecraft explodes or go faster than light in a split second.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, my spacecraft is super heavy, it weighs nearly 1500 ton fully fueled on kerbin. Allows the craft to rest on eve surface with landing gear retracted is quite risky.For example, when I try to lower the landing gear with a fully fuelled craft resting on eve surface, the gears simply shears off completely, and I\u0027m unable to take off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll try messing around and let you guys know the results after I\u0027m done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
