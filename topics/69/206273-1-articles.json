This seems to happen regardless of whether I\u0027m using vanilla or mods and I cant pinpoint anything that might be causing it, could be anything from coming out of time warp, separating stages, and has even happened multiple times just for no reason whatsoever. Sometimes it will happen with no warning at all, sometimes it will be proceeded by the ship beginning to shake for no reason until it shakes itself apart, quick saving has become essential for me as I can pretty much expect this problem to happen to me multiple times anytime I try to launch anything more complex than a tiny probe. A couple things to note is that I do use auto strut a lot, and have tried even mitigating the problem by using normal struts here and there in combination with auto strut to no avail, it also seems not to discriminate between ships where ive clipped parts and ships where ive clipped none it it will happen either way. Does anyone know a way I can stop this from happening to my ships, if I\u0027m doing something wrong thats causing this to happen or if its a bug? I\u0027ve done research into it but cant find anything.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-05T15:36:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScreenshots?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Strike_2.0","CreatedById":213912,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-10T11:54:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel like it\u0027s just a classic kraken attack, maybe use the control from here button thing, that helps for some people\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adsii1970","CreatedById":89014,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-10T12:52:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224073103\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206273\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221641396997\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022156657\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022HebaruSan\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 1/5/2022 at 9:36 AM, HebaruSan said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScreenshots?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022img_69982.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022100.00\u0022 height=\u0022980\u0022 style=\u0022width:30px;height:auto;\u0022 width=\u0022980\u0022 src=\u0022http://cdn.onlinewebfonts.com/svg/img_69982.png\u0022\u003E\u00A0 This.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithout any sort of video capture or even a screenshot, it is hard for us to help diagnose what could be wrong.\u00A0 One thing that can also help is a screenshot of your vehicle in the craft editor (either the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E) so we can look for staging issues.
