Turned in my science for more equipment at the R\u0026amp;D Center. After that I even made a new ship with the new parts. Log in today, continued to make more ships using the new parts, etc. Failed some launches, normal stuff. The stuff I did today was not progress so I wasn\u0027t worried about saving so I just X\u0027s out of the game since I had it in windowed mode. I load the game back up and all the science I had is gone, all the parts are gone BUT the ship I was making with the new parts is there. I can load it and such. I\u0027m really confused.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I have figured out however is the game is loading my last F5 save I did last night before I began my orbit back to Kerbin. All my science is there and I can just redo that to get it back. However I still would like to know if I can fix this instead of redoing this orbit? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIsn\u0027t it odd that my ship with the new parts can load but all those parts and the science tree is gone?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, new to the game...bought it three days ago and LOVE IT! Not even a science guy or space but I have become very interested in space now!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-31T04:42:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShips in the VAB and SPH are separate files, so they remain even after restoring to a past save.

I\u0027d look in the folder and try the most recent SFS files and see if you get lucky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the future, though, it\u0027s a good idea to ALWAYS exit the game by hitting ESC on the Space Center screen and choosing \u0022quit to menu.\u0022 Then once you\u0027re on the menu it\u0027s safe to close the program with the X (or as I do, Alt-F4).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chad711","CreatedById":133904,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-31T05:41:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELesson learned!
