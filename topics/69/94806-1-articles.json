Then the game gets stuck in duel symmetry mode. Then the game locks up. I just posted in a thread about this but I\u0027m keep wondering if it might be a different issue so I made a thread. Anyone else get this. Is this a 0.9 beta issue? It\u0027s making it impossible for me to design ships as I use that alot. Particularly with my space planes. And I only make space planes. 8) Or obsurdely wierd items attempting to reproduce engines/mechanical devices I can use as real world functions for my ultimate mothership design. And those all need lots of symmetry!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this is also happening with other connectors. It seems to be a degrading issue somehow. Is it a memory leak or some other logical error? It seems like once you try it it just gets worse. It also seems to be harder recently to get items to connect. I said memory leak only because sometimes it crashes the game in the end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I forgot. Once of the developing symptoms is it starts to not connect at all. I can get it to duel mode and look like it should connect. But once I hit left click it just connects and disconnects and goes back and never connects. It seems to be a general new problem with connections and the game lining up stuff. after I try to click like this it gets the game stuck in duel mode also sometimes, but this may be temporary. It either goes away when you click on other items a few times or I\u0027m missing that is logic that is supposed to be there.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-28T19:16:41Z\u0022 title=\u002212/28/2014 07:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-29T01:03:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I know, the multi-couplers have always been a bit weird with symmetry. If it\u0027s any worse than it was previously, it\u0027ll be because the editors were rewritten, and likely as not much of the symmetry logic reconsidered.
