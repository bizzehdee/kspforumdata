Everytime I launch or switch to another vessel the game is laging hard ( big IPS drop) for 30sc before evrything become normal and fluid again. So everytime i switch i have to wait 30sc in the pause menu. It do this only in this\u00A0save the others saves dont. I also remember in the begining of this saves it wasnt doing this. I only have a little station on orbit around\u00A0kerbin and 2 little\u00A0relay around minmus and kerbin, it can\u0027t be the fact that i have too mutch vessels flying maybe. I have 0 mods installed the game files are\u00A0clear and reinstalled checked with steam etc.\u00A0I also tried to up and down the graphic settings nothing change and i dont think its beacause of this because it exactly the same thing low or high.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes this happen to one of you ?
