The first time you complete a \u0022plant flag\u0022 or \u0022return science\u0022 mission around another body, the funds often barely cover the cost of the mission (and sometimes not even that). The next time you get the mission however, you can complete it for free if your craft is still sitting there, and the reward does not diminish. I have reaped millions of funds from \u0022flag gardens\u0022 around single landing sites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Part test contracts are still pretty common (~1/3 of total contracts when accepting everything), but are almost exclusively allocated at Kerbin even in the endgame.

Testing a KR-2L in Kerbin orbit gave 796,000 funds; around Minmus 146,000 funds; on the surface of Duna 722,000 funds. Testing the Sepratron I in suborbital flight on Kerbin gave 15,000 funds; in Pol orbit 30,000 funds.
