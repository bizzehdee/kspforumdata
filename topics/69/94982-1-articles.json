I have a video of that happening. I also (in the video too) tried to go into the VAB and SPH, both of which did not work either. I could however load the crafts that I have made by selecting the Launchpad, or Runway, but again when I tried to launch them it would close the list and then do nothing. I closed the game, restarted it, restarted it by just running the .exe instead of the launcher, I tried loading both the Launcher and the .exe file while running in administrator, all of which did not resolve the problem. I have yet to try the patcher or a reinstall, which I am not a particular fan of. Is there anything I can do?\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E Luckily I have a running youtube channel and below is a video of the problem. This was recorded with Fraps which was opened after the game was run and I know the problem if it is run before but the problem occured before. Additionally, after I went and hired a new astronaut, hovering over the buildings suddenly didn\u0027t work.

You\u0027ve likely killed or saved a kerbal who logged an achievement or that was rescued from orbit.
