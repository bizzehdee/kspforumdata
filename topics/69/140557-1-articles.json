If I choose the Decouple Node option, then the ports will be still stuck together, despite game showing there being two separate spacecrafts. If I then go to the Space Center and back to the vessels they\u0027ll either dock and after that ports will have the Undock option, or there will be lots of uncontrollable spinning and exploding. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E At first I thought it may be because of mods that I have installed, but I was able to reproduce the issue on a clean install with a new save. I\u0027m wondering if I\u0027m doing something wrong, or is it a bug, because IIRC I created vessels this way pre-1.0 and they worked as intended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/29680037/KSP%20Forums/Untitled%20Space%20Craft.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECraft 1\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/29680037/KSP%20Forums/Untitled%20Space%20Craft%20Senior.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECraft 2\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/29680037/KSP%20Forums/220200_20160526113537_1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022220200_20160526113537_1.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/29680037/KSP%20Forums/220200_20160526113850_1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022220200_20160526113850_1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tarheel1999","CreatedById":123965,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-26T13:30:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry decoupling in space.

You can\u0027t \u0022dock\u0022 things in the Editor. The \u0022decouple\u0022 option is what you get when you stack something on a docking part in the Editor. When you hit decouple in space the parts separate and slowly drift apart. Have you tried time warping to speed up\u00A0the drift? This works fine in my modded install and so it is probably\u00A0an issue with your ship design or your install.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe camera/exploding parts issue is probably due to precision\u00A0errors.
