Playing career mode. Just managed my first Kerbin orbit and was trying to send my first mission to the Mun. Got a little greedy - have the contract for a fly-by, but also one for testing a couple of components in orbit (one Kerbin, one Mun) so I figured I\u0027d try to build big and achieve all in the same mission .\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Rocket\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E (stages are grouped, I have decouplers/chutes split out\u00A0 to make 7\u00A0actual stages in the game)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EStage 0\u00A0-\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003ECommand module, Bunch of science\u00A0 Service bay containing a\u00A048-7S \u0027Spark\u0027 LFE (to test in Mun orbit - I checked on the launchpad and I can open the bay door and click \u0022run test\u0022).

Looked like I had a nice\u00A0efficient\u00A0transition into Kerbin orbit and almost enough fuel left in the first stage\u00A0to transfer to the Mun. I planned my transfer manoeuvre, stated the burn on time, and then just before it completed my fuel ran out so I decoupled the first stage intending to finish off the burn with the Terrier. However, after decoupling I realised I had zero fuel left in the remaining FL-T400 so at this point was just left drifting in space!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was a huge surprise and not at all what I expected\u00A0so I reloaded the save to check and, sure enough, prior to starting the manoeuvre when I clicked on the individual fuel tanks the stack of 4 in the firs stage were all showing at 0, and the remaining fuel was being drawn out of the tank in the second stage. This means it was being drawn through both the terrier engine and the decoupler to feed the swivel engine at the bottom of the rocket?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nis this right/how it\u0027s supposed to work? And if so is there someway I can prevent it? I assumed that any fuel tanks split by engines/decouplers would remain separated. I don\u0027t have any kind of fuel lines connected that would allow drainage - literally the only connection\u00A0\u00A0between the two stages is the decoupler. What am I missing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if not then should I raise a bug? The reason I haven\u0027t is it seems like such a huge thing that I would have seen it elsewhere in the forums/wiki/issues log, but I can\u0027t find any similar threads.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance for the help.

Though, the game allows you to \u0022crossfeed\u0022 between stages. This means, the previously described restriction will be lifted and engines are allowed to use fuel from tanks in other stages then their own. To accomplish this, you either have to add a fuel line to connect tanks of multiple stages\u003C/span\u003E or by enabling crossfeed in the context menu of the decoupler/separator. While it is unlikely to accidentally add an addition part, you probably enabled crossfeed on the decoupler by accident or without knowing what this will do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou may want to check your decoupler settings for this.
