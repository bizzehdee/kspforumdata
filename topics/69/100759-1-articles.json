I would REALLY like to use my tablet to design ships, because it just seems cooler, and I find it easier to use than a mouse (my opinion and experience)."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T12:43:08Z","Content":"Hi Tetriswizard, it\u0027s most likely that the output from the pen isn\u0027t quite the same as from a mouse, so the Unity game engine does not know how to use it.\n\nFor example the engine could be waiting for a different \u0022move\u0022 signal than the pen is designed to provide.\n\nThis would be a driver issue, or perhaps a mode issue, I suggest checking the tablet software for any options on movement mode such as absolute (pointer is exactly where you place the pen, like a touchscreen) and relative (pointer must be moved into position with the pen, like a mouse) modes."},{"CreatedByName":"Tetriswizard","CreatedById":19871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T09:26:00Z","Content":"Hi Sal, thanks for responding. After setting my tablet to relative mode, I still have the same problem, I right click, and movement of the pen doesn\u0027t register as mouse movement. I wonder that maybe unity detects mouse movement, while my pad sets the mouse position, instead of move the mouse to the position."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T14:11:43Z","Content":"This may be something that is only addressable by changing the code that handles input, I found these on the Unity site.\n\n[Using a wacom for input.](http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/144539/using-wacom-pen-as-input-device.html)\n\n[Unity input docs.](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ConventionalGameInput.html)\n\nIf Unity won\u0027t use the pen in either mode there may be nothing we can do, sorry :/"}]}
