Jumping to x5 warp will change your orbit a lot less than going straight to, say, 1000x warp, so whenever you\u0027re planning to time warp anywhere it\u0027s a good idea to first bump it up to x5 either with the . key or by clicking the first arrow in the top left of the screen, and then speeding it up the rest of the way or using the \u0022warp to\u0022 command/button.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
