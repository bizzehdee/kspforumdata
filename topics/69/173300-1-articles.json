I was working on other things and was not ready to try this new build yet. So did I not read in the release notes for this patch that it fixed the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E menu misalignment?\u00A0 And they recompiled the new unity Shader for Linux? Well I still can\u0027t run in anything but native resolution? When I try to edit the resolution the game locks then I have to Alt F2 and kill it with the task manager. I then go to restart it and i get a blank screen and have to delete my config file or edit it with note and set the resolution to native full screen. 1.3.1 runs fine in any resolution. Just having this problem with 1.4\u002B . Anyone else still getting this or is their something I\u0027m missing with my system? I would like to go back to enjoying playing on my 4K TV but that\u0027s not going to happen until this #$\u0026amp;## gets fixed. I wiped my install and downloaded a clean new version from steam.

I cant play on my main monitor or use my Thrustmaster \u0022yeah!\u0022 . So I was willing to be a little patient and give Squad a chance. I only really bought the DLC to support them. I have zero interest in the mission builder. I was going to stay on 1.3.1 until things got sorted. With it I don\u0027t have to change\u00A0 my second monitor to the primary to play . Then Squad comes out with a real quick patch announcement that no one saw coming. I read the patch note\u0027s \u0022\u003Cs\u003EFixVabmenu\u003C/s\u003E \u0022 \u003Cs\u003EFix Unity shader Mac Linux\u003C/s\u003E\u0022 \u0022Fixed off centre Wolfhound\u0022\u00A0 I thought great let\u0027s give it a try. \u0022WOW I think WOW I\u0027M just totally speechless\u0022\u00A0 Not only is hardly anything\u00A0 that\u0027s\u00A0 listed as fixed working for me! This broke so much more stuff and made it worse! 1.4.2 is a total joke as a bug patch. I just don\u0027t think it\u0027s possible to be more disappointed. Right when I load the game I run into a bunch of graphical glitches that were not there in 1.4.1! Massive texture tearing in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. And I\u0027M ruining V-sync enabled \u0022Tried it all three settings of V-sync And turned AA on and off\u0022 Made no difference. Massive texture Z fighting It was kind of bad in 1.4.1 now it\u0027s off the chart . So resolution bug aside once I set the game up 1.4.1 was at least playable. I brought over a mini Saturn rocket I built in 1.4.1 to test frame rates and check out if a couple of bugs got squashed. Loaded it put it on the pad AND clamps let go------ It drops! LOL New engine plate for engine\u0027s no longer feed\u0027s fuel to said engine\u0027s I rebuilt this rocket a half dozen times to be sure. YEP Works in 1.4.1 broken in 1.4.2. So not to be denied my fraps test I push on ! With new fuel lines run individually to all 9 engines I\u0027m ready for launch. First stage is a go surprise it works. second stage separation and KABOOM. Fairing\u2019s blow up \u0022 No\u0027 No\u0027 Not just blow apart\u0022 But completely obliterate a full Saturn first stage. I had not even fired the second stage motors. Bravo Squad how very Kerbal I have not laughed this hard since the good old .24 days THE KRAKEN HAS ARISEN. Good times People you can only keep on smiling\u00A0 through the pain.

Totally me being stupid and not reading things carefully enough. I guess I need to step back some and cool off. SORRY SQUAD. That being said I think most of this post is justified. No DLC should Ever! Break its base game code so badly. This level of plain bad should never get though testing. And post 1.0 release the game needs to be Engine complete at some point . I bought the DLC because I wanted to support you guy\u0027s. Not because I was really all that excited for the content . Make some more cool DLC to sell us great!\u00A0 Just Please stop breaking the base game. Oh and as a side note. This has nothing to do with MODS.... I have never ever asked a moder when will it be done or said you have to fix something for me ever! This is about a Version release and the accompanying DLC Completely ruining the base game. At least for a minority of players. Hey Linux and Mac users paid money to play the game! I hate to say this but maybe if you guys cant handle it you need to be honest and say 1.4\u002B and DLC for windows platform only? How much of a disaster would this be to the reputation your trying to rebuild if this kind of release was on consol?\u00A0 I feel like I just spent $15 to wreck my game so I could take part in a beta to find bugs for a upcoming XBOX-DLC release. Were really sorry we had a bad consol release\u00A0 We will make it up to you!
