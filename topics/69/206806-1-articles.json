When I set this strategy up (in my case at 80%) in the administration building and then successfully complete contracts, I always lose reputation. This should not happen according to the description of the strategy. No other missions were failed, declined or expired during these periods. Neither did any Kerbal die or any other event occur.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPrecise Description:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I set up the \u0022Unpaid Research Program\u0022 strategy at 80% and then accept a contract that originally would have yielded 10 reputation, 0 science and 1000 funds, the contract will show that I will receive 2 reputation, 3.7 science and 1000 funds. This would be correct.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce I complete the contract, I will instead lose reputation (this should never happen from this strategy), while gaining the correct amount of science and the amount of funds remaining unchanged.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EConclusion:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP does not implement the \u0022Unpaid Research Program\u0022 correctly as described in the administration building.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EExample\u003C/strong\u003E (explanation below each image)\u003Cstrong\u003E:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022szx6k1yzdgg81.png?width=1280\u0026amp;format=png\u0026amp;\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002260.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://preview.redd.it/szx6k1yzdgg81.png?width=1280\u0026amp;format=png\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;s=5b40b3fff86b092a8b03b4b8933cf4b7921ffbf6\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this image we see the state of the game before a contract.
