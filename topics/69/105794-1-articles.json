I do not. Do post your bug, but do not expect quick results. There are many, perhaps a dozen or so, long-standing bugs that the devs have passed over patch after patch. In fact many have been \u0022patched\u0022 by the community via mods, which is probably in part why the devs haven\u0027t bothered.
