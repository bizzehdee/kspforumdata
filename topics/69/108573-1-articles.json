Loading a quicksave from a couple minutes prior does nothing, neither does trying to switch camera back to the craft with the pilot. Game restart and resume lets me see the Kerbin base just fine, but if I try to take command of the minmus expedition, the glitch resumes. Both logs are copied from after I restarted the game and re-encountered the bug.\n\nAny way to salvage?"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T13:07:42Z","Content":"Hi pgiustino, upload your save folder and it might be fixable.\n\nIf you are getting Windows blue screens (stop errors) you will need to disable the automatic restart and get the stop error message,[**\\[Click here\\]**](http://pcsupport.about.com/od/tipstricks/f/automatic-restart.htm)"},{"CreatedByName":"pgiustino","CreatedById":143637,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T15:52:09Z","Content":"Here are the saves.
