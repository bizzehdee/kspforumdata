It maintains the circular orbit but the entire circle accelerates away from the planet. Then I stop time warp, and my apoapsis is rising like crazy and peri is falling at the same rate. If I try to time warp again I get the message \u0022unable to warp while ship under acceleration\u0022 but the engine isn\u0027t even on and I can\u0027t control the direction at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s as though the planet isn\u0027t actually there any more and the ship is orbiting the sun, but in map view it still shows a circular orbit, and is no longer affected by the gravity of the Kerbin, as the planet slowly shoots into the distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI initially thought it might have something to do with the planets being in the wrong position for the date in relation to my saves, but the date shows 2 years x days so it\u0027s not the default beginning date.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease help, I\u0027ve put flags all over the mun, and made successful landing to Duna and Ike, deorbited and E class and landed it next to the VAB and have a huge station in orbit, I\u0027d hate to have to start again.
