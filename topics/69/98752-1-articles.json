The MET clock flashes yellow/green when trying to launch anything (which I read was a physics issue). At first I couldn\u0027t even see any buildings, and the VAB was just a black screen in the middle with items on the left and top. However, after disabling AA, I was able to finally see buildings in the KSC map, and build rockets. But, when launching even the smallest rocket the MET clock flashes yellow/green, and the game is slow and stutters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried turning down the resolution, textures, rendering, etc. I\u0027m on the latest MESA drivers after running dnf update (10.4.3). Searching around I see a lot of people are able to run this game even at 1080p on an Intel HD 4600 (most likely on Windows, though). I\u0027d appreciate any ideas and/or help. Thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-04T15:19:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Yabos, I\u0027d try the \u0022Max physics delta time by frame\u0022 slider in general settings, reducing it can really help \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yabos McGee","CreatedById":137392,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-04T21:20:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi Yabos, I\u0027d try the \u0022Max physics delta time by frame\u0022 slider in general settings, reducing it can really help \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry, I forgot to also mention that I\u0027ve already tried that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
