It was running pretty bad so i did a fresh install of ksp just to remove any remaining files. Now i have a fairly decent pc so i was confused why i was getting this performance, but anyway i went to mun scenario again with the game completely un modded and i was getting the exact same fps on just the stock game. It seems like my fps is low no reason even though my old laptop could run this game fine. These are my specs, im running the game stock with the settings\u00A0 maxed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpecs:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCPU: I7-7700\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGPU: RTX 2060 OC\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n16 GB\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2TB HDD\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klesh","CreatedById":110814,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-03T13:23:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums, Entomo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am curious when you said you did a fresh install of KSP, how did you do that? \u00A0From what source do you get your KSP files?\u00A0My thought is perhaps you\u2019ve left something in there that is pulling from old mod files.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInside you KSP folder you will have a folder called GameData, look inside that. \u00A0 What folders do you see?
