If you place a fuel line too close to its partner it will reverse the direction of the arrows that you intended to route. I fixed it by giving the fuel line more slack. Hope maybe the devs can fix later or there is a mod that can make really short fuel lines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-30T04:44:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPictures would be awesome so we can see exactly what you\u0027re talking about and replicate.
