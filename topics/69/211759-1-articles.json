Plenty of solar panels, batteries, and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E. Launched it as a probe type and flew it successfully until now.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter dropping off some fuel in Munar orbit, I ran it back and picked up a couple rovers and a \u0027delivery system\u0027 for the Mun; the plan was and still is to use the lander (delivery system) to drop the two rovers onto the Mun\u0027s surface and then put together my first base. First, however, I docked it to a temporary fuel depot in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E and used an orbital tug to move the rovers near Steamboat Willie; had to undock the rovers first and then catch them to put them on Willie\u0027s left \u0026amp; right. I then added the delivery lander to the aft, fueled up everything, and tried to take off, only noticing the problem when trying to do the transfer burn.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTesting in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E revealed no balancing problems, so I eventually had the bright idea of checking fuel consumption. Sure enough, both the 100 \u0026amp; 200\u00A0from one of Willie\u0027s corners were draining faster than the others. As well, that engine was showing up as empty in the staging, despite having plenty of fuel and firing correctly. However, for some reason, I can remediate this by setting priority so that the affected tanks and their opposites drain before the other 5 tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure what\u0027s going on; did docking with so many crafts at the fuel depot cause some sort of glitch? Read from a posting about 10 years back that the fuel system was easily confused.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
