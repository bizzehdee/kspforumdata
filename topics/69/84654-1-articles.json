Current sound file continues to play until completed. All keyboard input and mouse clicks are captured by KSP, so no recovery of system is possible, and a hard reset is required. I have had several of these crashed while using heavily modded versions of KSP. Mostly these occured in the VAB, but also one while controlling a craft in orbit around Kerbal. I created a brand new install from the download zip file in order to start trying to track down what I expected was a faulty mod, launched it, adjusted configuration slightly and started a new sandbox game. It got to announcing that time was passing at 1x speed, the birdsong started up, the loading widget in the bottom right froze, and I had to reset my computer again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese crashes seem pretty random to me. They have mostly occurred just as I was changing my viewpoint in the VAB. So I can\u0027t really describe the steps to reproduce it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t mind the game crashing so much if it didn\u0027t lock up the keyboard and mouse so badly. I\u0027ve got other stuff running in the background on my computer, and file corruption is a possibility. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---- Logs / hardinfo ----\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/p5zv0zjc1hq47cv/Player.log?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/p5zv0zjc1hq47cv/Player.log?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/7vcd99l0jty6tee/persistent.sfs?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/7vcd99l0jty6tee/persistent.sfs?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/8y99xz5rxf8hhzz/prefs?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/8y99xz5rxf8hhzz/prefs?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/xrp6d9uh5h4spi9/hardinfo_report.html?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/xrp6d9uh5h4spi9/hardinfo_report.html?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve searched for information about this, and while I find a bunch of threads with similar titles on Google, when I follow the links, I keep getting a message about being unable to view the threads due to access restrictions.
