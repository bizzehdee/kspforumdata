I would like to fix this if I can because I invested a lot of my money in this mission. I can recover, but it will require grinding instead of pushing forward.\n\nAny help would be appreciated. \n\n(Note, I took out the contract 3 in game years before I went to Duna, so it shouldn\u0027t be a timing issue.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-13T00:14:39Z\u0022 title=\u002203/13/2015 12:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jakinbandw**\n  \nChanged tag"},{"CreatedByName":"bakanando","CreatedById":126310,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T23:49:08Z","Content":"Just a couple of questions:\n\nWhat does the information button in map mode says in status?\n\nWhat altitude is your periapsis at?

Any idea how to fix that?\n\n[Edit] So I messed around with my orbit and I found that if your periapsis is below 50,000 you are considered sub orbital even though there is no atmosphere to slow you down.
