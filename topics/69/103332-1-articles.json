Basically the two finger slide doesn\u0027t do anything. Is there a way I can make it work without having to purchase a mouse? My friend using a Mac can, but my Dell won\u0027t.\n\nThanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"wasmic","CreatedById":64885,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T19:16:30Z","Content":"You can se the \u002B and - buttons on the NumbPad to zoom, or the PgUp or PgDn to scroll up or down. If you don\u0027t have a numbpad, I don\u0027t know what you can do - try some different buttons. You might also have to activate or deactivate Num Lk. Hope this helped!"},{"CreatedByName":"thekiltedduck","CreatedById":140419,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T19:55:44Z","Content":"Thank you so much! Time for some real science now!"}]}
