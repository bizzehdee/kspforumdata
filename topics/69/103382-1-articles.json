So all I can do is give you the standard spiels...\n\n- So, make sure that you have granted an exception for KSP for your virus scanner, so that it isn\u0027t interfering.\n\n- Make sure the files are not set to Read-Only.\n\n- Try running it directly from KSP.exe\n\n- If you currently have (looks like it\u0027s in C:\\Kerbal Space Program\\), or have ever had, your copy of KSP installed to a place such as Program Files, Documents, or on the Desktop, then COPY and paste it somewhere else. If you move it, windows will still interfere. (This has been the culprit in several of these crash problems lately.)\n\n- Make sure your video drivers are up to date.\n\n- Make sure direct x is up to date.\n\n- Try using the -force-opengl flag (might cause graphics problems)\n\n- Kill or disable as many other programs as you can before running KSP.\n\n- Try another fresh download and install. Again, make sure to not put it in a windows protected area.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"crwydryny","CreatedById":140455,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T11:59:39Z","Content":"thanks I\u0027ll give those tips a try later, the current install was a fresh download (i figured it could have been a corrupted file when I updated as that has happened with other programs before) but that had no effect.\n\nand yes I did try booting directly from ksp.exe as well as launcher.exe \n\n closing all other programs was one of the first things I tried \n\nit\u0027s installed in c:\\kerbal space program, which is the only place I\u0027ve had the program installed since I first downloaded it. the only other copy I have is the 0.25 version I downloaded after the crash which is installed on a seprate hard drive (which works fine with no errors)\n\nI\u0027ll give the -force-opengl flag a try later and double check the read/write status of the files."},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T15:38:18Z","Content":"In addition to the -force-opengl flag, you might try reducing the texture quality.
