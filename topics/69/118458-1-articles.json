There is the problem that landers for the Mun are usually high on the rocket and have legs retracted, but planes often have gear deployed on the launch pad and runway. You can\u0027t just decide based on the runway/SPH either because you can make craft launch on the pad with landing legs (as opposed to launch clamps or just sitting on the engine). They chose to have the button assume the the gear/legs were deployed, again, a minimalist approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started a mod to more intelligently determine the state the button should be in. The idea was to find the first set of legs/gear and decide based on it\u0027s current state. So the first leg or gear part you place on the craft would be the deciding factor for whether the button is lit. In most cases it would be correct, the exceptions would be if you had a plane carrying a Mun lander, for example, and even that could be worked by carefully placing the gear and legs in the right order. Sadly, I\u0027m having compiler/debugging issues with my setup. I\u0027m not sure it will get out before the Unity 5 update (and who knows, Squad may obsolete it by then).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-14T16:44:40Z\u0022 title=\u002208/14/2015 04:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T17:24:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot just that but SSTO spaceplanes carrying landers would be destroyed if the legs deployed when the gear was raised.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not a big deal to press G twice when your rocket reaches the Mun compared to rapid unplanned disassembly on the pad/runway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T17:51:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENot just that but SSTO spaceplanes carrying landers would be destroyed if the legs deployed when the gear was raised.\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not a big deal to press G twice when your rocket reaches the Mun compared to rapid unplanned disassembly on the pad/runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrue, but that can be easily corrected.
