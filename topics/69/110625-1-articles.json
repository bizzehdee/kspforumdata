It happens when your velocity is Not a Number, often due to an EVA kerbonaut hitting a planet or moon at high speed. The game tries to tell where your kerbal is going, sees \u0022potato m/s\u0022 and dies. The NaN WILL propagate if you manage to interact with NaNed objects, ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating_point#Exception_handling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating_point#Exception_handling)) so it\u0027s normally safest to consider the save devoured by the Kraken. You might be able to manually edit the save file to ensure every object has valid parameters, but the game will delete affected ships/kerbals/etc in an attempt to prevent the spread.\n\n[Jebretary](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/72212-Jebretary-Automatic-Version-Control-%28backups%29-for-craft-and-saves-v0-4-0) is a good program to automatically keep backups of your saves, so that in the event of a kraken attack you can revert to a safe state.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-24T17:51:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2015 05:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SAI Peregrinus**"}]}
