Today, I was going to launch something I assembled in the VAB, so I clicked on the button to take me to the launch pad. But then it froze for a few seconds, and this showed up:\n\n![teg18fe.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/teg18fe.jpg)\n\n(In this particular incident, I had Kerbal Engineer installed, **but the freezes still happen even if there are no mods**)\n\nAfter I rebooted, CCleaner notified me of a giant MEMORY.DMP file. Was it a \u0022memory leak\u0022? (Also note my lack of a proper graphics card)\n\n![7Dm1rzg.png](http://i.imgur.com/7Dm1rzg.png)\n\nI then removed Kerbal Engineer and tried to play again. **A problem still happened with stock KSP, and for no particular reason.** I successfully launched my rocket to orbit, but as I was switching between map views, it froze. After a few minutes, I didn\u0027t want to wait until the inevitable BSOD, so I just turned off the surge protector.\n\nI\u0027ve read that there is an issue in which the temperature gauges cause memory leaks. But they never appeared, and I turned them off with F10 before I pressed space bar.\n\nI\u0027m sorry, but I don\u0027t think I can play KSP anymore if this keeps happening.\n\nedit: Also, my graphics drivers are already up-to-date.\n\n![U9N4MWu.png](http://i.imgur.com/U9N4MWu.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-14T06:28:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2015 06:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pipcard**"},{"CreatedByName":"Fel","CreatedById":57121,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T01:12:33Z","Content":"The watchdog timer failed to break a loop; that indicates a hardware problem.\n\nBasically, KSP crashed, yes... but your system called an interrupt to gain access to the core KSP was running on; and your processor appears not to have responded to said interrupt.\n\n**Are you now, or have you in the past, over-clocked your processor?**\n\n(Memory dump is just a dump; usually if you know what you\u0027re doing (and have access to KSP\u0027s source) you can use that to diagnose the problem. Of course, the debug logs are generally better.)\n\nI\u0027m not certain of a good stress test here, I suspect the processor is going past the maximum thermal operating point at which the noise factor is low enough for it to keep operating without faults. Since your processor is both a GPU and a CPU in the same package, and both are being stressed when you encounter these errors, it is likely that simply stressing the CPU won\u0027t cause issues.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-14T02:01:09Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2015 02:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fel**"},{"CreatedByName":"Pipcard","CreatedById":2541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T03:07:08Z","Content":"I have never overclocked at all.\n\njust a question: is it because the insides of the computer are dusty?
