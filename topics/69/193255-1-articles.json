Some background: bought and downloaded from steam, have put in 25 hours so far. I had a decent amount of the tech tree unlocked with a balance of 102 science. I was returning from the Mun with a Man Rock to complete an active contract that I had taken up. While in orbit, I time-warped so that I could get to my maneuver node quicker. Well I get impatient and manual time warped since it looked like my new trajectory would provide me with a gravitational assist from the mun to a closer orbit around Kerbin. When did this I went to far in the warp and collided with the Mun. Right before the collision I tried to load the game again so I could re-do the gravity assist. In doing so, my entire file was somehow overridden. I started back to a previous game state in which I had nothing unlocked and all of my progress had been wiped. This was disheartening because I was finally making good progress. Can you help in fixing this issue?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
