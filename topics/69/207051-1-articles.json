It flipped out on reentry so I reverted to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E was suddenly here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022159.57\u0022 height=\u0022984\u0022 style=\u0022width:512px;height:auto;\u0022 width=\u0022617\u0022 alt=\u0022k1GlsOx.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/k1GlsOx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis explains the instability, but it would have been nice to have known this was the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Etrue\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E beforehand.
