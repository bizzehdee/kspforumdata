I landed succesfully but when I tried to EVA, I knocked over my lander and basically nose-dove into the surface with my Kerman. Now, no matter what I do, it\u0027s just a black screen. I can see the GUI like the nav-ball and stagin, but I can\u0027t see my craft or the galaxy-map thing. It does it even when I am at the space station but it is just fine at the menu screen.

You\u0027ll have to restart and likely if you visit that ship or kerbal they will disappear or the game will lock up again. You can give it a try though, sometimes it recovers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESadly there isn\u0027t much else we can do, other than some save file manipulation to rescue your kerbal. This doesn\u0027t happen to often, but is usually triggered if they land on their helmets, or hit the ground funny while in a rag doll state (as you found).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably not the answer you were hoping for...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"yoyocambo","CreatedById":136663,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-27T01:59:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELuckily, I had quicksaved at my apoapsis before I tried to land on Minmus so all I had to do was reload that and everything was fine.
