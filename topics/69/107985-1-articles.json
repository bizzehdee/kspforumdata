After that it works normally. You can then remove the 2nd part if you just wanted an L shape or something.\n\nI\u0027m guessing (some of) the surfaces are inside out, but it gets so little use no one\u0027s ever gotten around to fixing it."},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T08:09:12Z","Content":"I just checked and the side nodes on the not-rockomax micronode are indeed inverted in the config. Workarounds are to either use the rotate gizmo after placing in order to turn the part the right way, or edit the config to swap the signs of the 1s in the right, left, back, and front nodes."}]}
