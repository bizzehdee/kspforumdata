I\u0027ve had some problems too. For example I was testing a shuttle design by taking it off like an airplane to test cross range capability, and when I was accelerating the whole thing spun out. I\u0027m not kiddin, it spun out about two or so times. So we\u0027re all having issues. I think the wheels might be clipping in some way.
