Craft file at [http://leteckaposta.cz/665485466](http://leteckaposta.cz/665485466) screenshot at [http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=433795755](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=433795755) Note the tailfin placed exactly behind the jet engine.\n\nWhen I start the plane\u0027s engine, the plane doesn\u0027t move, unles the tailfin is actuated. F3 report also tells me the tailfin has been damaged (which I expect and definitely is not bug). When the engine is left to run at max power for about a minute, the tailfin suddenly explodes and the plane instantly starts moving. When yaw control is used (with the tailfin still attached), the plane jerks, rolls partially and starts moving with reduced speed.\n\nI would think that in reality, the air would flow around the tailfin mostly undisturbed (unless the tailfin would be used to steer). In KSP, it looks like the thin fin blocks the exhaust. Is this a limitation of the aerodynamics model, or is it some kind of bug?"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T18:56:58Z","Content":"Uh, this is how the game works, sorry, if you block the thrust they won\u0027t work.\n\nSome engines, like RCS thrusters don\u0027t cause damage so are unaffected, but most engines in KSP just won\u0027t provide thrust while blocked.\n\nSo yeah, it\u0027s a limitation of the game, it\u0027s been like this since the very early days so is unlikely to change, but we can still do some neat stuff like propel Kerbals through the air using rocket thrust, as they are separate \u0022vessels\u0022 ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T19:02:59Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 07:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sal\\_vager**"}]}
