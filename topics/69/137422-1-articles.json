Stick itself works fine, pedals act as though they are off calibration and throttle is completely non-responsive. The buttons on the throttle work but the throttle itself does not. I use this setup with other games so I know the hardware works. I was using a Thrustmaster HOTAS X in KSP before and it worked fine and I am using the same bindings I had for it so the bindings should be correct. I am using Vanilla KSP 1.1, though the problem existed in the previous version as well. Does anyone know how I can fix this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-20T17:05:53Z\u0022 title=\u002204/20/2016 05:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Netskimmer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadded some tags\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m1sz","CreatedById":93466,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-20T09:55:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI stopped playing KSP for a long time, mainly for this reason... :-(, no propper joystick support for advanced joysticks. I own a Saitek X-55 and the only thing I could do to play the game was using the Advanced Fly By Wire mod. As far as I know, it\u0027s not updated to 1.1 yet, and I hope it will!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Netskimmer","CreatedById":144822,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-20T17:03:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is unfortunate, one would think that controller support would be a high priority in a game that is, in many ways, a flight sim. Hopefully they will focus on things like this now that the major update has been released. I\u0027ve been using one of the hat switches on the throttle to control the throttle axis in game. It\u0027s not much better than using the keyboard, but I guess it\u0027s something. Hopefully they will fix the problem at some point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-20T19:53:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you using them natively or with a Control Manager config that binds them all to one virtual joystick?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Netskimmer","CreatedById":144822,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-21T01:49:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222525887\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022137422\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221461182039\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002275006\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NathanKell\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, NathanKell said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you using them natively or with a Control Manager config that binds them all to one virtual joystick?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is my next step.

The throttle axis does work now, but neither the mini-stick nor any of the hat switches on the throttle will bind to anything. I tested them in the Control manager and almost everything works there. The POV switch does not seem to work when I test it under the mapped virtual controller, but it does work in direct mode, so mechanically, it seems to be fine. All other switches work in both direct and mapped mode. KSP just doesn\u0027t seem to recognize them. The switches on the stick itself bind properly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
