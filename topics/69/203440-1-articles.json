I\u0027ve encountered this issue where i am unable to click anything in the pause menu. This happens specifically\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eonly\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Ewhen i have successfully either landed an\u00A0\u00A0aircraft or put a spacecraft into orbit. I can\u0027t save the game, i can\u0027t load the game, i can\u0027t exit to main menu and i can\u0027t go back to space center. Even when i press recover vessel, nothing happens (which obviously isn\u0027t part of the pause menu). The only thing i can press is resume game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can however strangely enough press back to space center or exit to main menu when the aircraft/spacecraft is in flight.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help would be appreciated \u003Cspan\u003E:)\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
