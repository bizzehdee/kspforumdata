Since 1.1 I have a weird issue that causes the game to \u0022stutter\u0022 every 5 seconds or so. I searched on reddit and the forums and the only answers I found were mod-related. So I went and put my game back into vanilla state, just to be sure (only used EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements anyways) but the stuttering still occurs. Well it\u0027s not really stuttering, it feels like the game pauses for 1-2 frames every 5 seconds. It doesn\u0027t matter how big the vessel is, tried it with a small plane as well as with a 400 part behemoth, no difference, the stuttering occures regardless of the craft, position (I tested landed at runway, in flight at Kerbin and low Kerbin orbit and the Mun).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anybody experienced the same issue and is there a known solution?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBroco\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-21T14:55:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222527909\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022137602\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221461249769\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u00224320\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Broco\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 minutes ago, Broco said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anybody experienced the same issue and is there a known solution?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot with KSP but MSFS had this all the time.

Several times a minute, the audio spikes too, making crackling sound every time it happens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore, I though the issue is with my laptop and no multi-thread support in the old game engine. But with 1.1, that is surely fixed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis happens both on unmodded and modded KSP installations, it seems to make no difference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApart from these lag spikes, I have great performance on 1.1. By now, I suspect that some external program might induce these spikes. I have tried disabling antivirus, defragmenting hard drive. Didn\u0027t help.\u00A0I\u0027m running Windows 10 64bit, basically a clean install with antivirus, and bunch of programs that I use. Maybe one of them is the culprit, but I can\u0027t narrow it down.\u00A0No other games exhibit these lag spikes, just KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy computer is a\u00A0Lenovo Z500 laptop. Not\u00A0a gaming machine, but runs KSP smoothly without problems except for these spikes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone experienced this before? Is there any external program known to cause this behavior? I can provide any detail necessary. Just keep in mind, that, as I said, this issue troubled me since 0.90, and since then, I have re-installed Windows a couple of times, as well as KSP itself, tried both clean and modded versions, and so on. The problem never went away.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you in advance. As I said, if I missed some detail I should have included, just tell me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mutex","CreatedById":106937,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-24T16:19:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo they lag spikes stay constant, or do they get worse the longer you play?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aluc24","CreatedById":152712,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-24T16:40:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222536432\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022137984\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221461514798\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022106937\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mutex\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 minutes ago, Mutex said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo they lag spikes stay constant, or do they get worse the longer you play?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, they are consistent.
