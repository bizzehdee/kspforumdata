I have made a model to test it on Kerbin so I have added mk1pod and decoupler or seperator on rover so later I can deatach when kerbal change control pod. but as soon I click on decouple whole cubic octagonal strut structure breaks so structure deatach from wheels and all other parts and fall down. but also decouple didn\u0027t even decoupled and I can even ride that like it nothing happened even if structure does not exist anymore because it has fallen out only maybe if some wheels have fallen out but it all works normal so I have like half invisible rover. also decouple and mk1 pod are still on it\u0027s place but it is not possible to decouple again. This is really funny and very annoying problem because it happen no matter which decouple or seperator I put. Seems like some major bugs with that cubic octagonal strut and decouples. It is interesting because that never happened to me until now.
