The thing about these orbit contracts is that you have to build the satelite AFTER you accepted the contracts. So I accepted the contracts and build a (even for hard mode) cheap rocket that would give me lots of funds and science! worth it rite? no.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter my Satelite got into orbit with plenty of fuel and science bits to make my day, i accidently switched to another satelite in map view. From this point I was unable to switch back to my mun satelite, or even to the space center! So after 5 minutes of pressing useless buttons I had to restart my game (Alt\u002BF4).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter I restarted my game all my contracts were gone! ALL OF \u0027M. The once I was going to accept, the once I was working on (the oh so important accept before launching a stupid satelite contracts, and ALL of my already completed contracts).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you might expect, this is quite frustrating, since this satelite had half of my funds into it. And now I can only get the explore the mun contract back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anybody else had this had this issue? I would hate to see that I\u0027m the only one with this problem!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease let me know.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T01:14:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, that is an odd one.

I tried to get the focus back on my satelite but after lots of useless spamming I gave that up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried something else: Spam left-click on a different satelite, hoping the focus would go to that satelite (as long as it\u0027s not Kerbin). Spamming this satelite it in map view it then switched to that satelite with lots of lag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that, my camera kept zooming out and there was very little I could do. So I pressed Alt\u002BF4. After restarting my game all my contracts were gone. that\u0027s pretty much it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess there is little to do about it. First time it happened in over a year of kerballing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for listening to my complaint (or reading I guess).

Not sure what\u0027s gone on there at all, unfortunately. You can usually switch focus back to your craft using Shift\u002BTab (make sure the navball is not visible in map mode to prevent throttling up by accident) in future... :/\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arsonide","CreatedById":32604,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T12:54:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, without a log it is hard to guess, but I only know of one instance when all contracts can disappear. Possibly two. Tell me, did you use the debug menu at all when you were acquiring these contracts? (The menu that pops up when you hit alt-f12)?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
