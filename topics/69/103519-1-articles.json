I entered the time warp on a different vessel so I could warp faster. When I came back to my vessel of interest the engines were on and when the loading finished the engines were suddenly off. At that moment part of the payload exploded (the wings on some attached gliders) and an explosion happened in space where there wasn\u0027t even any vessel or (known/expected) object to explode.\n\nWhen I go back to the pre-time warp quick save, the exact same thing happens. Engines are on and then switched off and stuff explodes. I [uploaded the quick save to my dropbox account](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1918347/Eve%20glider%20transfer%20pre-warp.sfs) in case that helps."},{"CreatedByName":"THX1138","CreatedById":113955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T14:54:33Z","Content":"This game\u0027s quirks are so confusing! After attempting to solve the problem by editing saves and failing, I went back to the original save (the one I posted above) and while the engines were on while they should not have been, no part of the ship exploded! There\u0027s obviously more to ships exploding out of time warp than what is contained within the save. My computer was also switched off since yesterday so that\u0027s uncontrolled-for."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T17:24:31Z","Content":"Sometimes, when you run into engines (even if unrelated to the engines), it can cause something like this to happen. Especially with exploding ships, restarting KSP is often helpful.\n\nI\u0027m glad it worked itself out. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"}]}
