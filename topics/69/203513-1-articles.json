However by doing this after leaving the Mun the craft is constantly shaking and cannot be time warped. When checking the map it says that the craft is landed on the Mun which is clearly not true. Below is the only noticeable error in the log which is even weirder since I don\u0027t have any cubestrut part on my craft so I\u0027m not sure why it\u0027s spamming this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022xjBJL6k.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002252.41\u0022 height=\u0022239\u0022 width=\u0022456\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/xjBJL6k.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-02T18:56:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis \u201Clanded while flying\u201D thing is common when you break solar panels on the surface- the broken panel pieces are on the ground, so the game incorrectly thinks the whole craft is still landed when it isn\u2019t. You can fix this by editing the save file, but if you\u2019re not sure how to do that don\u2019t even try- you could end up corrupting the file and lose your save. Try freeloading a save when the lander is still landed, then using EVA construction remove any broken solar panels (or radiators) from the craft, save, then reload the new save- it might help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
