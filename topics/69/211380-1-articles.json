There\u0027s no \u0022throttle hold\u0022 thing in KSP, and it\u0027s normal for the throttle to stay at a certain value if you neither press shift nor ctrl (if that\u0027s what you meant). I don\u0027t think I have enough info to help with the no control problem yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy \u0027xplosions!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
