I\u0027ve not touched the key bindings for staging;\u00A0I\u0027ve ensured that I\u0027m not\u00A0in warp when I try to stage; there\u0027s no purple light in the lower left corner; I\u0027ve ensured I\u0027ve not pressed Alt-L, and even when staging fails and I try pressing Alt-L it doesn\u0027t start working. I\u0027ve rebooted and started a mission fresh from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, gotten into orbit no problem, set up my maneuver node, warped\u00A0to the node, stopped the warp well in advance of the node, started my burn, and when it\u0027s time to stage mid-way ... nothing. I have to manually decouple, then manually activate the engine. Of course, if I\u0027m planning to decouple during a landing or re-entry sequence, it\u0027s even more disruptive. Restarting the game from scratch, or rebooting SOMETIMES resolves it temporarily, but I shouldn\u0027t have to reboot in the middle of a game just to get staging to work.\u00A0Is this just an on-going bug - I\u0027ve seen it in both 1.9 and 1.10, and seen it on numerous threads elsewhere as I\u0027ve tried to find a solution. What the HECK is going on? What have I missed? What else can I try to fix this?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-09-05T15:34:56Z\u0022 title=\u002209/05/2020 03:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 5, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by maddog59\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Espelling correction\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BadOaks","CreatedById":156496,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-05T16:57:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat sounds really frustrating.\u00A0The only thing I can think of is the \u0022insert\u0022 key.
