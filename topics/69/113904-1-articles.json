I uninstalled KSP (also deleted Steam folder manually) and reinstalled the game. I\u0027ve started it, made a new default sandbox game, went straight into the VAB and placed an orange tank, on which I mounted approximately 32 radial parachutes (Mk2-R). I notice extreme fps drops doing this.\n\nHere my persistent and log\n\n[http://www./download/z2gn9a1jn42qjir/radialParachute_exception.zip](http://www./download/z2gn9a1jn42qjir/radialParachute_exception.zip)\n\nThe game seems to throw a million exceptions.\n\nI hope this post is better! Cya\n\nedit: \n\nI\u0027ve narrowed it down a little more. Loading the Kerbal X craft in the VAB causes no issues allthough it has an parachute equipped. I can click the parachute, remount it nothing happens. The NullReferenceException seems to be an editor issue because when I click any parachute in the editor menue on the left I get exceptions thrown. I only need to click it for this to happen, no need to mount it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-23T20:52:06Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2015 08:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KerbalEssences**"}]}
