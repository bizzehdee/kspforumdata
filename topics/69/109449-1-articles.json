Every time I start the game the window is always back asking me if I want to send the info about my game to help Squad. It doesn\u0027t matter if I say yet or no, it always comes back. Also when I change my choices the whole window flickers in an unhealthy way. [http://i.imgur.com/emYAXc3.png](http://i.imgur.com/emYAXc3.png)\n\nSomething similar when I physical time accelerate, it acts like it\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve ever time accelerated and warns me about the ship falling apart. I tell him \u0022Don\u0027t warn me again!\u0022 But every time I start up the game again, it comes back... is this a known issue? For reference I\u0027m using 1.02 on Steam, Windows 7."}]}
