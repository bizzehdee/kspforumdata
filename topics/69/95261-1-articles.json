But their functionality is still that of the starting level (max 30 parts / vessel, max 2 simultaneous contracts etc.) So effectively i am permanently stuck with the starting buildings. I have tried restarting and making new saves on various settings but the problem persists. This is rather gamebreaking so i guess it\u0027s back to 32-bit for now and hope that it works.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-01T14:59:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s an issue we\u0027re aware of. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt present, 0.90\u0027s Career mode is seemingly only playable with the 32-bit executable. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
