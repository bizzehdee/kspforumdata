Steam said the game was up-to-date but when I start it up the version is v0.90.705 Beta. I went to my Steam library and deleted all game files. I then went to the Kerbal directory in explorer and deleted the folder so nothing was left behind. I then rebooted, opened Steam and told it to reinstall Kerbal. After install the game is still on v0.90.705 Beta.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone know how to get this up to the current version?\u00A0I tried to contact Steam support but it keeps telling me to contact Squad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TrendyGuy","CreatedById":157492,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-23T16:17:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFixed it.

Possibly it\u0027s getting the latest beta version which is actually older than the current release version?
