I re-installed the game and that didn\u0027t work, and I wiped the save data from the steam cloud and that didn\u0027t work, no log folder appears in the game folder when it crashes, and the game used to work fine. I looked at steam posts and couldn\u0027t find anything similar to this problem either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kapitalizing Every Word","CreatedById":212780,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-06T11:09:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould you share your system specs?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RawrTheDinosawr","CreatedById":203099,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-06T14:18:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224028726\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022204707\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221630926593\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022212780\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kapitalizing Every Word\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Kapitalizing Every Word said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould you share your system specs?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIntel(R) Core(TM) i5-7400 CPU @ 3.00GHz\u00A0\u00A0 3.00 GHz processor, 8gb ram, windows 10 pro\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kapitalizing Every Word","CreatedById":212780,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-06T20:56:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt looks good maybe you should try uninstalling and before you install again delete the folder of KSP in the steam version it is in steam/steamapps/common\u00A0 there might be mod files chilling somewhere or something making conflict\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
