I cannot set the axis bindings. When I click on \u0022throttle axis\u0022 etc to set a binding nothing comes up. This is for all axis of any mode (flight, vehicle, etc). I can assign actions to joystick buttons, just not assign axis since no set dialogue appears.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a Saitek x52 Pro. \u00A0I had previously been using this joystick with a KSP mod called \u0022advance fly by wire\u0022\u00A0that eliminated the large of amounts of lag with the joystick that this game has (its a known issue with this game). \u00A0Since the mod now fails to load after the patch (super bummed about that), I went to set the stock game controls in hopes that the lag would be remove,\u00A0and discovered\u00A0this issue.
