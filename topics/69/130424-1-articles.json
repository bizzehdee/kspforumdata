However, I also have a good old Saitek AV8R joystick too which I prefer for flying planes in KSP. However, if the steam controller is detected by KSP, it seems to override any joystick settings in the game and only allow me to use the controller. In the settings menu it shows as \u0022not found\u0022 for axes I\u0027ve set on my Saitek. Ideally I\u0027d like to swap between the two but really I should just be able to use the Saitek without unplugging the Steam controller. Any ideas how I\u0027d achieve this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-21T17:52:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/109487-floatingmongoose/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022109487\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/109487-floatingmongoose/\u0022\u003E@FloatingMongoose\u003C/a\u003E, does it still say \u0022Not found\u0022 after restarting KSP with both controllers attached?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FloatingMongoose","CreatedById":109487,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-22T09:15:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt does still say \u0022Not found\u0022 when I start with both controllers attached.
