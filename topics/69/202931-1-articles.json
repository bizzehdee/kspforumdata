If so, right click KSP in your Steam library, click Properties, click the \u2018local files\u2019 tab in the window that opens and then \u2018verify integrity of local files\u2019. You might just have a broken installation, it happens sometimes and verifying the files can often fix it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
