KSP is still 32 bit on OS X, so can\u0027t actually use more than 4GB, but having 8GB means that KSP can get the full 4GB if it needs it, without fighting against the 0.5GB-ish used by the OS itself, and typical 0.5GB-ish for random desktop toys and small apps, and typical 1GB-ish for Safari with a bunch of tabs open.\n\nIf you don\u0027t do heavy stuff with mods and complexity inside KSP, and don\u0027t run lots of apps in parallel with KSP, you won\u0027t see much benefit from extra RAM."},{"CreatedByName":"kithylin","CreatedById":130653,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T23:39:50Z","Content":"It really depends.

It can be like reading a medical web site, and convincing yourself that you\u0027ve got swine flu, ebola, and the bubonic plague, all at the same time, instead of simple food poisoning.

KSP runs very nicely on older Macs, if they were high spec at the time. I\u0027ve tried it on a 2007 iMac which was the very top model Apple produced at the time, and it runs quite nicely. Core 2 Extreme 2.8GHz, 4GB RAM, ATI Radeon HD 2600 Pro 256MB, 24\u0022 1080p widescreen. All that\u0027s needed is to turn the graphics down, and KSP is very playable and enjoyable on it. (And, obviously, make sure that it\u0027s not competing for system resources with something else in the background.)\n\nMacBook Pros are all fairly high spec for whatever era they come from, so it\u0027s most likely just a case of needing to match the graphics options to the hardware, rather than needing to buy a new machine, unless it\u0027s older than about 2010 vintage."},{"CreatedByName":"Aerindel","CreatedById":109952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T02:10:51Z","Content":"This is a 2012 mac.Where would you start making cuts when it comes to settings? \n\nSystem specs are 2.5 Ghz intel i5, graphics Intel HD 4000 1024 MB"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T03:03:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This is a 2012 mac.Where would you start making cuts when it comes to settings? \n\u003E System specs are 2.5 Ghz intel i5, graphics Intel HD 4000 1024 MB\n\nHalf res textures can make a huge difference, as it\u0027s a quarter of the texture data (e.g. 300x300dpi is a quarter of 600x600dpi).\n\nBasically turn everything down/off, and see how it performs. If the result is good in terms of speed, carefully think about the options and slowly turn up the ones that feel most important, until it starts to get too slow again. You might find particular options have a big performance penalty, while others don\u0027t seem to slow it down much at all. With a bit of patience and trial and error, you should hopefully find a sweet spot that balances performance and quality."}]}
