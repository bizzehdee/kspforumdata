However, I see the fairing folder in the game date \u0022part/aero\u0022 forder.\n\nI already have reinstalled KSP, I have verified my game data using steam and I\u0027m now not using any mods.\n\nSearched the web but didn\u0027t find anyone with a similar problem.\n\nDoes anyone have an idea what might cause this?\n\nThanks Everyone\n\nTioz\n\nInformation:\n\nSteam Version\n\nbuild id = 00840\n\n2015.05.01 at 01:18:35 CEST\n\nBranch: master\n\nWindows 7 64 bit\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T16:37:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 04:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tioz01**"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T16:40:36Z","Content":"Believe your issue is only due to not knowing exactly what to look for.\n\nEnter the Editor (VAB/SPH), select the \u0022Aerodynamics\u0022 tab on the left. There you can find 3 parts:\n\n- AE-FF1 Airstream Protective Shell (1.25 m)\n\n- AE-FF2 Airstream Protective Shell (2.5 m)\n\n- AE-FF3 Airstream Protective Shell (3.75 m)\n\nThose are the base plates for fairings to develop. When placed, you can then choose how large and high each vertical section of fairings would be above the base (just need the text for [LMB] to turn green for fairings to be valid)."},{"CreatedByName":"Tioz01","CreatedById":142560,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T16:45:53Z","Content":"Oh sorry.\n\nI didn\u0027t find them at first and checked the manufacturer in the cfg file and found \u0022FlooyD Dynamics Reseach Labs\u0022\n\nSo I used \u0022Filter by Manufacturer\u0022 and chose FlooyD and it seems, that only the fluid ducts are correctly shown in this filter.\n\nMy mistake I\u0027m sorry"}]}
