I had an old science mode world that I played in before so decided to play in that save. I played a brief travel to Minimus and came back and wanted to recover the science points I had earned. When I pressed Recover Vessel, my vessel was taken and no GUI screen appeared telling me that I got any science points and I didn\u0027t receive any science points. Furthermore, whenever I recover a vessel now, all of my Kerbals are transferred to the Lost category of the recruitment area. I have tried the same thing again and nothing changes, I also tried recovering a different vessel in a different area but the same problem occurs. Also, I dont have any mods installed and my current OS is windows 7.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bloody_looser","CreatedById":95664,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-23T21:33:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStart a new game.
