But wait! I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s not causing the issue! When I open up windows game controller settings, I can see the troublesome axis (throttle) is being detected. I have also confirmed that it works in other games. However, it is not being detected within KSP. I have tried binding throttle to pitch, and it works just fine. When I try to bind throttle to the actual throttle, the game simply doesn\u0027t detect it. I\u0027ve tried editing settings.cfg to the axis (axis 7) that the throttle shows up as in other programs, but it still doesn\u0027t work. Any help would be much appreciated.
