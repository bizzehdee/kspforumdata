It may be that it has finally surpassed the amount of physical ram on your computer. What that means is that your operating system might be using virtual memory, swap things out of memory an onto the hard drive. This is a slow process and can cause problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a couple things you can do to reduce KSP\u0027s memory footprint. The first thing to try would be reducing your texture quality in the settings option of the main menu. There are also mods that can help reduce the memory requirements... Of course this all assumes that memory is your problem... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr it could be your physics time steps have changed in 0.25 if you let it generate it\u0027s own settings.cfg.
