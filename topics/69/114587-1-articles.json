When I got this same error (and it happened a lot), I had to reduce the screen resolution and turn anti-aliasing down to none. I\u0027m running an older Radeon HD5700 series card with 1GB of DDR5 memory.\n\nI\u0027ve since returned the AA to its previous level (x2) and haven\u0027t experienced a crash since. There may be other graphics effects that might impact this phenomenon but I haven\u0027t played around with it too much. I\u0027m happy it\u0027s stable and without doing any research, I don\u0027t understand most of the graphics settings anyway. Time to do some digging, I guess.\n\nMy 2 cents worth."}]}
