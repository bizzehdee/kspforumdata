What\u2019s going on?

Running the game with the default settings was horrible, getting the same stuttering and lag all through. I was able to launch a Kerbal X, but it was a slideshow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdded the \u0060-force-opengl\u0060 argument, and it seems a lot smoother. Launched a Kerbal X, in a new sandbox game, with all default settings. The MET timer flickered between green and yellow a fair bit, but the game ran smoothly all the way to orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-17T06:20:57Z\u0022 title=\u002201/17/2018 06:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 17, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by stibbons\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
