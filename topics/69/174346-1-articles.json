Last time I played was a few days ago (before the update I believe) and whenever I try to boot up the game now it will tell me it crashed and give me an error report. I\u0027ve already deleted all my mods, reinstalled the game, and verified the game files. I also tried shutting down chrome to see if memory shortages were causing the issue but it still happens. I have tried both 64-bit and 32-bit versions and they both crash.
