The problem I\u0027m facing has been bugging me for some time now and I can\u0027t find any discussions on it anywhere.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m playing version 1.3.0.1804. I don\u0027t have any mods installed, I\u0027m strictly against them. I know that in this version single use experiments like mystery goo and materials bay can be reset by a scientist on eva(no need for labs). I\u0027ve done it already with my mk1 rover. Recently built a mk2 plane with a mk2 cargo bay and loaded it with all science equipment including a goo canister and material bay.I tested the design on the runway, and sanlie was able to restore both the spent experiments(he didn\u0027t even have to move. I just eva\u0027d him and left him hanging on the cabin door. He was able to restore from there). However when I flew the plane to a different location (some grasslands near the arctic), the game no longer recognise sanlie as a scientist. The plane is landed and sanlie is standing on top of the materials bay, but still can\u0027t do it. When I right click the bay or goo canister, \u0027restore\u0027 is available, but clicking it gives \u0022only scientists can restore inoperable modules\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI must admit that between the testing on the runway and actual flight there was a few design changes. One of the change was to assign running of all experiments to a custom action group. Could that interfere with the restore-ability of the experiments?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-04-21T15:28:35Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2019 03:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by John Honai\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EGot the name of the kerbal wrong.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-21T18:30:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like a bug rather than a gameplay question, and so your thread has been moved to Support.

Compare Sanlie to another scientist and see if anything jumps out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-23T01:34:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you haven\u0027t already restarted KSP by this point, I would try that first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that, I agree with 5thHorseman in that the next step is to check out the save file.
