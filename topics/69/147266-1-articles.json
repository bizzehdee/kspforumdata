I think the problem was with the docking ports and I forgot to close the game and restart after decoupling the craft from its mother ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe docking port issue appears to still haunt 1.1.3, I notice that engine fairing do not decouple from the ports, and characters and walk through them as if they are not there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI cannot be sure, but what did manage to work is that I pulled the gear from the lander section and put new gear on (LT-1) and it worked this time, reorbited, separated, went to space center, then reloaded the craft, no problem, gear landed at 5 m/s and could be retracted and extended without incidence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
