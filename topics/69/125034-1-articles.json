But sure that has a price, more CPU cycles required to handle all this. Low framerate can be either caused by the physics (the engine takes too long to complete complex computations) or by graphics (complex scene to be rendered). Given what changed in 1.0.5, I would bet the issue is with physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no magical solution to this issue. Some improvement can be expected by changing the \u0022Max Physics Delta-Time per Frame\u0022 setting, a best value for your system may be found.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReal improvements are expected with KSP 1.1, where multithreaded physics should be a reality thanks to the new Unity 5 engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in case you noticed some signs of downgrade (relative to 1.0.4) that could be tied to a specific problem, more info would be needed to determine what is the cause: could be a routine is taking excessively long and could be optimized to perform better thanks to the info you may report.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn that case, would be helpful if you uploaded a specific game situation (a savegame when the issues occur) and provided directions to recreate the situation from that savegame (e.g. enter flight mode with a specific vessel, do some specific action with that vessel). Could be useful to also provide your settings (upload your settings.cfg) and output.log (from KSP_Data), provide info about your system (CPU, RAM), could upload a pic of the KSP screen when framerate issues are occurring with the debug menu open (Alt-F12) and the performance tab selected.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MLWostal","CreatedById":134330,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T23:12:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs I too am having issues with stuttering since 1.04 and now, with 1.05 being even worse, what should I be doing with Max Physics?

I would actually check the performance tab (from Debug menu) to find the FPS ingame, and if too close to the Minimum FPS, would try tweaking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I can certainly tell, the \u0022Max Delta-Time per Frame\u0022 controls the worst case condition. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENormally KSP should complete all physics calculations within the time for the next frame to display. Let me say that is when the time indicator is green. The actual FPS shown on the performance tab would then be higher than the minimum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen running out of time, KSP starts to delay the next frames. That setting tells how long the interval between frames can arrive. Of course the longer the interval, the less accurate and less responsive KSP becomes. Less accurate makes KSP choppier, less responsive means any input is affected by lag. I\u0027d be safe to tell then the time indicator shows yellow. The actual FPS drops to the minimum, and the minimum FPS = 1 / \u0022Max Delta-Time per Frame\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the extreme, calculations require even more time than the Max Delta-Time allows. I am of the idea (but can\u0027t confirm without seeing the code) frames may actually be skipped at that point. Red time indicator should be representative of this situation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut to stay on the simple, a lower Max Delta-Time setting (e.g. 0.03 s) makes for a very smooth, accurate, but also slow-motion run. It could be best when flying a complex vessel with lots of parts, to avoid physics forces to get too large and bring spontaneous disassembly. Certainly the indicator would be almost always in the yellow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA higher Max Delta-Time setting (like 0.12 s) allows large intervals, so KSP is less accurate and responsive, but also would run faster. As the Minimum FPS is then allowed to be lower, a green time indicator would more probably show; however the number of actual FPS doesn\u0027t increase, only the time between each frame. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, the setting is more affecting our experience with the game, rather than solving framerate issues. We can\u0027t exclude physics routines in KSP, that would be a way to reduce the time taken to perform calculations. Some parts are excluded from physics interaction (their config has \u0022PhysicsSignificance = 1\u0022) to diminish the number of parts requiring calculations. The scenery, beyond graphics rendering, always requires CPU time, so limiting scenery elements is always useful. Deleting debris helps, showing data (either from stock KSP windows or add-ons) requires more CPU time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real improvement remains the ability to use the full power of modern CPU, that Unity5 should allow with multithreaded physics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T14:07:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you didn\u0027t copy over your old settings file, there\u0027s a good chance that\u0027s behind the problem.
