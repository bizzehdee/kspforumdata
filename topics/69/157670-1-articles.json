Fresh, clean install of Ubuntu Gnome 16.04 and a newly extracted install of KSP 1.2.2. I\u0027ve also tried with 1.2 with the same problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI start KSP and I get the loading screen and it does it\u0027s thing. However, once the main menu loads, KSP crashes and I get logged out of the OS. Not sure if it\u0027s the xserver that\u0027s restarting or what. I\u0027m including the last bit of my ksp.log file. If there\u0027s a way to post the whole thing, let me know. This is the only part that I see that has anything that looks bad.
