RCS nozzles by themselves will do nothing if they don\u0027t have \u0027RCS fuel\u0027 (monopropellant) to fire.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHave you actually turned on RCS? \u0027R\u0027 is the default key for that, it will light up a green R on the top left of the navball - which is off by default. If you\u0027re not seeing the telltale white puffs from the RCS nozzles when you try to steer, they may not be working because they\u0027re off or have no monoprop to fire.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhile RCS is very good for turning a ship in space, it is very weak in the lower atmosphere. You don\u0027t state the size of your tank and main engine, but for most combinations, if your rocket is firing full throttle upwards, RCS can have a very hard time changing a straight-up course. A reaction wheel like dangerhamster mentioned, and/or a few winglets with control surfaces, are generally better choices for steering a rocket through the lowest part of the atmosphere.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou don\u0027t mention where you placed the RCS units. If you placed the units very close to the CoM (eg. a generally encouraged configuration -for space- is a single ring of RCS units around the CoM), the RCS units will have very little leverage to turn your rocket against the mighty thrust of the main engine.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou mention that you can click on the SAS buttons, so I am assuming lack of electric power is not the issue or those wouldn\u0027t work either. (SAS won\u0027t work without electric charge)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIf none of this is applicable, explain more in detail what parts you used for your rocket, or post a screenshot. It\u0027ll help in trying to figure out what\u0027s happening.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
