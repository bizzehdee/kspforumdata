No i dont have any mods, I have reinstalled it three times, booted my laptop. Checked task manager, no memory and heat problems. And no it didnt produce any crash report or log files.\u00A0Please help, ive been playing this for more than 2 years and have alot of nice things in my world. It kinda liquides me off knowing i cant complete my goals in the game right now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-13T11:17:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt will always produce log files unless you specifically told it not to.
