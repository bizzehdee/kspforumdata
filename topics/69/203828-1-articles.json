In my unmodded ksp everything works fine, except the fuel cells. I tried to attach them to anything\u00A0 possible but when I launch the vehicle and start the fuel cell(s) nothing happens. Is there something that I\u0027m missing? help\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-15T12:15:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo your fuel cells have fuel? If not then they won\u2019t work. Check that you a) have liquid fuel and oxidiser for them to run and b) that the fuel can flow to the fuel cells, without something like a decoupler in the way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre your batteries already charged up? If so then the fuel cells won\u2019t run- they don\u2019t operate when the battery capacity is at 95% or up\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
