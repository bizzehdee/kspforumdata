Even after I go well past the horizon of Kerbin and even Duna, the communication link remains completely normal.

Atmospheres can bounce signals slightly so the atmospheric one defaults to being set slightly lower. A value below 1 can lead to signals travelling through the visible terrain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
