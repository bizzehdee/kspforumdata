The first one is intended, fuel is drained evenly across all tanks in a stage when using Jet engines. Unless you lock the tank, not sure why you don\u0027t want to do that."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T17:49:59Z","Content":"Try pressing R to toggle between radial and mirror mode when fitting struts, also don\u0027t try to fit struts to a rotated rocket, make sure it\u0027s at its default facing in the VAB (the open door should be on your right)\n\nCenter of thrust is off with some radial engines, because the thrust line for those engines is non-vertical, and KSP uses the first engine in a symmetrical group to determine thrust vector, they will work normally however."}]}
