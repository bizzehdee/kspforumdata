However these ones are not exposed, not saved with settings. It would take making a few more lines in the stock KSP code to implement the read, write, assign by default functions for those keys just like done for all others (and remove the hardcoded bindings). Nothing complex, I did something similar with add-on code; however it remains with KSP devs to agree this is a worthwhile change and find that little time it takes to implement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
