The splashing water reverberates on the fuselage, amplifying the sound. I have a video from a ditching, if you are interested. The pilot died, however (this was not depicted one the video - it happened on rescue - sadly). So, not exactly for the faint of heart.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, other than that, yes.
