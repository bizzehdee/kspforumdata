Not something I would think of! Have you tried a Juno nosecone?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I\u0027d think that the answer is that when an\u00A0engine is in it\u0027s proper location, that it is completely out of the airstream. So you either need a clever and\u00A0complex airflow model that calculates the microenvironment around the part and has reasonable drag values -- or you program it up using the same airflow for all the parts and then put really low drag values on things that sit at the back end of the jet/rocket. And KSP currently does the 2nd.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
