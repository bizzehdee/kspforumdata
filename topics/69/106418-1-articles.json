It\u0027s a fairly complex craft for stock, I might be afraid to mess with it when just starting out with KSP. I think the \u0022why doesn\u0027t this work\u0022 question would likely be encountered on-orbit, not at a critical time of craft operation. It\u0027s not \u0022broken\u0022 until you activate the stage with 4 O-10 engines, and wonder why you don\u0027t get very far. \nHopefully the player notices the upper right resource panel says that it has lots of monoprop, and from there right-clicks the tank. The next big hurdle for a new player, is realizing the red circle-slash icon is a button you can click. (Maybe its covered in a tutorial, I haven\u0027t done any of the new ones.)\n\n Some landers descriptions/info tell you that the launch vehicle isn\u0027t included; the Kerbal 2 is a \u0022trainer\u0022 rocket not meant to get very far. But, the Leastar A1 description is a bit sparse for what it can do: \u0022SSTO is overrated, payload capability and comfortable seats are all the rage these days.\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T00:27:55Z","Content":"HarvesteR made this craft, he made the Aeris4A as well, that should tell you a lot :/"},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T01:26:44Z","Content":"I learned something from it: it\u0027s possible to attach more than 1 SRB, to a single radial decoupler.
