Or it could just be a bug. \n\n Anytime a separator is connected to a faring base when it is separated the fairing is automatically released too. Can anyone confirm this? \n\nAlso, I discovered a heating bug. I will post a video so you can see what is happening and try to recreate it. \n\nParts are overheating on the pad and exploding. It seems to only happen when the fairings are used like in the video.\n\n Maybe someone can test too. I am using no mods.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/DdS4E-pFVbM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-23T02:07:46Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2015 02:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Majorjim**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T23:38:15Z","Content":"Well, I haven\u0027t found any bugs yet, but I see a misspelling in your post:\n\n1.03, instead of 1.0.3. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Jon144","CreatedById":80626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T23:44:14Z","Content":"I found a major bug.
