The craft will remain charged without needing to open the service bay doors.\n\nFirst pic shows the panels inside the bay with the doors open. Second pic shows the doors closed, the solar panels context menu still shows that they are in direct sunlight (with only a slight reduction in sun exposure). \n\n[![aBdVofGh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/aBdVofGh.jpg)](http://imgur.com/aBdVofG)\n\n[![pjTvneDh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/pjTvneDh.jpg)](http://imgur.com/pjTvneD)"},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T02:57:30Z","Content":"I want to re-quote this for humor purposes, and to show others have wondered about this question, as well.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E OX-STAT Photovoltaic Panels inside a fairing or closed cargo bay should not generate power.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Solar panels work by taking in bay particles, which are generated through either explosions (like in the sun) or cargo bays. Of course, Michael Bay movies produce enormous levels of said particles, thus solar powered devices are especially useful in a theater during their showing... but that\u0027s kinda beside the point. Anyhow, panels in bays, due to the bay particles, should ALWAYS produce power, even when in a planet\u0027s shadow.\n\u003E (just kiddin\u0027. I think it\u0027s nuts too...although I\u0027ve been abusing the heck out of it for S\u0026G. I also thought that the game was supposed to account for that already?)"}]}
