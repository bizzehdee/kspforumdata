My spacecrafts tend slowly\u00A0rotate along the \u0022velocity axis\u0022 for no apparent reason. I\u0027m not talking about the rotation you get when aligned with the Normal/Anti-Normal velocity vector, this happens regardless of what vector the craft is aligned to. It happens outside the atmosphere, I\u00A0build my crafts as symmetrical as possible and it happens with all of my spacecrafts.\u00A0I have a \u00A0couple mods installed, but this happened\u00A0before I installed any mods with a fresh install of 1.1.3. Using the trim function counters it, but this isn\u0027t really a solution. It\u0027s far from a game breaking issue, but it is quite annoying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone else encountered this issue?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-11T21:11:43Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2016 09:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Mjarf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"T-Bouw","CreatedById":21500,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-12T07:49:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you have a joystick/gamepad connected?\u003Cbr\u003E\nSometimes I have the exact same thing happening and that was the cause.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou can see your (roll) rotation gauge being slightly off centre when \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E is off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mjarf","CreatedById":16666,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-12T16:08:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use keyboard only, I can try and connect a different keyboard to see if it may be an issue with my keyboard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SinBad","CreatedById":158888,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-12T16:20:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might have a loose part rattling around somewhere. Check that your previous stages detached as intended and didnt leave behind anything that detached and got hung up somewhere. Parts attached to your vessle wont collide, but parts no longer attached can, and in unity\u00A0 (4, dunno about 5) that tends to cause a continuos force to be applied that is often out of proportion to the expected physics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheck any payload bays as well. The heat mechanics do odd things and often a low heat tolerance part inside a bay somewhere pops because a high tolerance part decided to dump its heat into it. Whatever was attached to it then rattles around causing the same kind of collision errors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
