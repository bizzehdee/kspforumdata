I just started playing and after having sent up 5-6 rockets I can no longer recover the vessel once landed. They are unharmed and I have even tried doing an EVA once landed, but everytime I attempt to recover or return to spacecenter I get the message \u0022No Target\u0022.

And I can\u0027t do anything once this error occurs and restarting just means I get the error the next time I land.

Since you are using windows, the log file in your case will be in KSP_Data\\output_log.txt. Also, I\u0027ve linked the thread below. It will also tell you how to take screenshots and such. I would say in your case, a log file, a screen shot, and a description of how you are trying to recover will be best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92230-%21%21%21-PLEASE-READ-BEFORE-POSTING-%21%21%21-Stock-Support-Bug-Reporting-Guide\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92230-%21%21%21-PLEASE-READ-BEFORE-POSTING-%21%21%21-Stock-Support-Bug-Reporting-Guide\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
