If I leave the tracking station and then re-enter I can select other vessels again until I chose a particular one (base on the m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn).\n\nI had the same issue with another base, but could resolve it because I had a rover close. \u0022Flew\u0022 that rover and switched to the base. Now I can use this base again from the tracking station.\n\nHowever the other one is still not accesable. A workaround might be to fly something close and do the same trick. (Not tryed yet)\n\nI think this is related to antoher issue ... In the Austronaut Complex I am missing almost all my Kerbals flying on any vessel. Only one of about 10 shows up in the assigned tab. Also, even if fully upgraded I have a max of 12 now, but the description from the outside (right click on the bulding) did read \u0022fully upgraded\u0022, \u0022unlimtted number of Kerbals\u0022 earlier, after the upgrade. Suddenly I can\u0027t see this either when right clicking the building.\n\nAs with the post before I was using a save from the (steam) version before 1.0."},{"CreatedByName":"strobelix","CreatedById":142046,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T18:06:43Z","Content":"Update I could fix it!!\n\nActually it was related to the the indexes in the presistence.sfs file of 2 Kerbals ...\n\nThe log file lead me to the solution (unfortunately it\u0027s overwrtten now and I can\u0027t post the exact entries) ... there were some NullPointer and index out of bound exceptions and the it stated something about the base, actually the name, and that the crew is not the same person as it is in the roster.\n\nAfter carefully examine the module having the lines (names are just of the top of my head)\n\ncrew = Kerwise Kerbal\n\ncrew = Robert Kerbal\n\nAnd in the roster entries I had \n\nidx = -1\n\nfor both, comparing it with another module where for 2 crews idx=0 and idx=1 I thought this might be the problem.\n\nSo I went back to the roster entries for this 2 specific Kerbals and put idx=0 for the first in the module (Kerwise Kerbal) and idx=1 for the 2nd (Robert Kerbal).\n\nAnd voila after saving the file and starting the app. They show up again in the Astronaut Comlex as assigned and all others show up again too. Also I can read the info on right click again and the restriction to 12 Kerbals disappeared. Also I can fly the base again from the tracking tracking station.\n\nI hope this helps."},{"CreatedByName":"Yllier","CreatedById":107767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T20:11:45Z","Content":"Thank you for your replies.![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) I launched another ship and did as you did: switched to the ship in map mode.
