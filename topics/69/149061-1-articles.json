You can do this by going to your steam library, right clicking Kerbal Space Program, going to \u0022Local Files\u0022 then clicking \u0022Verify Integrity of Game Cache\u0022. Then check how KSP plays then. \u003Cstrong\u003EIf though the KSP Store, \u003C/strong\u003Edelete KSP (you can keep your save games) and reinstall it and then check again.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLastly, go into the location of the KSP install (local files under Steam) and find \u0022KSP_Win\u0022 (or \u0022KSP_OSX\u0022 for Mac and \u0022KSP_Linux\u0022 for Linux). Then once you find that main folder, go to \u0022KSP_Data\u0022 and inside that find a file called the \u0022OutputLog\u0022, take that file and upload it to Google Drive or Dropbox and make sure to link it to use (in the case of Google Drive, make sure it \u003Cstrong\u003Eis\u003C/strong\u003E set to share).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce we have that information we can begin moving to help you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
