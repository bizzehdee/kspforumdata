Not sure if the extra cost of the tailcone and decoupler is saved in fuel savings or extra payload, that will vary by design, I think, but it would seem to be a useful technique for planes that stay in the atmosphere at high supersonic speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-16T02:09:08Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2015 02:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Red Iron Crown\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mic_n","CreatedById":27054,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T03:24:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENicely done.
