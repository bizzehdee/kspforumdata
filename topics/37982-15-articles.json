The Block I will have an RL10B-2 engine on the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (aka Delta Cryogenic Second Stage), while Block II currently lists two J-2X engines on the upper stage. Block I will use 5 segment solid rocket boosters derived from the Space Shuttle SRBs, while with Block II it is undecided as of now. However, in 2015 NASA will announce who will win the rights to produce the boosters for Block II, whether it be the dual F-1B Pyrios boosters from Dynetics and (now) Aerojet Rocketdyne, or advanced SRBs from ATK. I am going off of most of these specs from NASA\u0027s website; I have noticed while doing research that Wikipedia, while very good for many rocketry fact checks, is unreliable for the SLS.
