In physics terms, there is no wheel, just a stick pointing in one direction, and the ground has to be perpendicular to and at the correct end of it. The shape isn\u0027t round, nothing rolls, the physics model has very little in common with what you would recognise as a wheel. The stick can be telescopic and spring loaded, for suspension (which doesn\u0027t really work properly unless the load on the suspension is precisely correct for its settings). It essentially abstracts away the entire concept of a wheel to just a contact point with some parameters to simulate the behaviour of a wheel in terms of forwards/backwards friction and sideways friction.\n\nSo, it\u0027s very likely a huge amount of effort, most likely requires abandoning Unity\u0027s wheels, and literally re-inventing the wheel. Of course, it\u0027s possible to fully simulate a round wheel which rotates, but that would be a massive computational task (i.e. high potential for lag), in comparison to the highly simplified and restricted model currently used."},{"CreatedByName":"THX1138","CreatedById":113955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T12:25:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The way standard Unity wheels work, this is impossible.

If those sticks are implemented the same way that Unity does it, most of the problems still exist if you\u0027re not close to perfectly perpendicular with one of them, but the overall physics of the wheel simulation got a lot more complicated (paging the lag monster\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6).\n\nFrankly, wheels play such a minor role in a space exploration simulation game, that I don\u0027t see the cost:benefit. The wheels we have are good enough for normal usage. A broader range of landing gear would be nice, using the existing perfectly functional and simple Unity not-really-wheels, but that\u0027s all we really need.

Driving fast in low gravity environments, over very rough terrain (which is the typical circumstances for flipping a rover) is not realistic. The Apollo lunar rover design speed was 8mph, with an unofficial lunar land speed record of 11.2mph. 8mph is approx 3.5m/s.\n\nI strongly oppose spending development time on replacing the Unity wheel module. Unity wheels have their flaws, but can be made to perform perfectly well for all reasonable purposes which are currently in scope for KSP. There are far more important and useful things for Squad\u0027s limited development resources.\n\nDriving like a maniac in low gravity is out of scope, in my opinion, so up to the mod community if someone wants to implement a far more complicated (and therefore very likely far more laggy) wheel physics module, or implement GTA-Mun."},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T15:04:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So, it\u0027s very likely a huge amount of effort, most likely requires abandoning Unity\u0027s wheels, and literally re-inventing the wheel.

The wheel physics code has to run potentially hundreds of times per second, additional complexity is not something that is desirable in there. I also don\u0027t believe that it\u0027s even remotely important to change the behaviour of the wheels, as they work just fine for normal purposes; they are perfectly adequate for KSP. There are far better things for Squad to be working on.\n\nAlso, remember that once you modify standard Unity behaviour, you own it in terms of support, and progressively lose the benefits of using an standard game engine to start with, upgrades to a newer version of the engine can become harder work, etc.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E But if the \u0022wheel were reinvented\u0022, then this new wheel would have the desired functionality without requiring any more calculations than the old wheel design.\n\nNope.
