She is an outsider. And literally lost her entire world. In a way I can relate because I departed a high control group with family still active members.... which naturally means limited or zero contact as the leaders instruct them to do toward former members.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. She is kind of reckless and overconfident.... because she\u0027s one of the most powerful people on the planet and virtually unstoppable. I was that way more in my youth but older-me realizes risks are indeed risks and not excuses for ego-tripping.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. She is naive and inexperienced and has a tendency to make mistakes. Again that was me in my youth, but I still recognize the need for experience to grow nowadays.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeyond all that, the comic has several heartwarming slice of life moments and even humor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExamples of this are below:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis one follows Supergirl seeking to make amends for past mistakes by visiting several friends and aquaintences she felt she messed up in some way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022main-qimg-c04101adb8c21b0aba1fd953d8d214\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022153.70\u0022 height=\u00221200\u0022 width=\u00221041\u0022 src=\u0022https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c04101adb8c21b0aba1fd953d8d214a8\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis one is hilarious but she means well... and yeah...
