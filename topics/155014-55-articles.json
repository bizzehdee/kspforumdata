Both of them keep trying to climb straight up to get to their default altitudes (~5km for JDAMs, ~7km for HARMs). Since they kept losing altitude to make up for the loss of speed when climbing straight up, I activated guard mode on both to speed things up a bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe jet with HARMs performed fine after that, although it did fly straight over the enemy and get shredded by AA. The jet with the JDAM loadout, however, would line up for a target, go in, and then pitch up 90 degrees. Then, it would continue the flip because it was going slower than the minimum speed, and it would run away because it was taking fire. It would repeat this over and over, and it never even dropped a single JDAM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I tried running the scenario again, but this time with fewer craft and with the debug lines/labels enabled.

The next state \u0022 Reach for the stars\u0022 is a similar thing but vertically.

I tried several different versions of my Super Hornet, and I tried the BDA AA test plane (set the default altitude to max: 8500m). All of them still tried to go straight up when there was an enemy craft nearby (note: debug label, during this, says, \u0022Target position is below minAlt. Adjusting by [distance to my set default altitude]\u0022). All craft involved would pitch up and go straight up until, in the case of the test plane, they got there, or, in the case of my planes, they stalled a few times and for some reason decided to actually attack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, sometimes when they would go on an attack run, the jets would go straight at the enemy craft, without selecting a weapon, and they\u0027d just pass over harmlessly.

The Super Hornet seems to be the only craft with the problem, but I can\u0027t fathom why it would have this problem. When manually controlling this aircraft, it\u0027s completely stable. There\u0027s no problem with the craft pitching too far up when I pitch up, which is what I would think would be the cause of the problem. When controlling it, I can turn \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E off and it flies just as smooth as it does when \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E is on.

In my case, the AI drops below 80m/s and it continues the flip so that it can extend and regain speed. It usually does this several times, and it may eventually line up correctly, but by that time it would probably be dead.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBelow that, the AI does relatively fine when bombing.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe angle of climb an AI uses depends on the default altitude and the presence of enemies. If there are enemies, and the altitude is high, it will go up the fastest way it knows how: like a rocket.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem that I\u0027m trying to address here is the fact that the AI performs strangely when it\u0027s set on the higher end of the default altitude scale and it\u0027s going against ground targets. I think that some anti-ground weapons are meant to be used from higher altitudes, but this problem makes that difficult; bombs seem to be useless above 3km, and if a jet is set to a really high altitude, it has trouble actually reaching that altitude. I understand that most of this could be solved by spawning the attacking jet very far, letting it gain altitude, and then going to the battle, but it takes time, and some people want to have a quick battle. Plus, the jets will lose altitude during attack runs, and they\u0027ll screw up eventually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope this isn\u0027t a stupid problem or some oversight on my part.
