It only illuminates the side facing the planet, so it only reflects the light of the planet. What you mean (your pic of starship) is a reflection from the surface of objects like rockets themself. This can only be done by the stock reflection (if a part has silver or gold foil) or Textures Unlimited. It\u0060s the only mod for reflections like this. Restock is not compatible with it. At least there are no configs for it. Only some parts with silver or gold foil have stock reflections.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
