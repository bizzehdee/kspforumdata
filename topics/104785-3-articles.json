Me myself would not charge for my mods. Main reason is that I use Modding for KSP to learn how to program, never intended for me to make money off the investment of Learning. Two charging for a mod introducing many challenges to a modder. Right now if I have a minor bug or something is not right in the code this is a learning experience that I use to get better and can take my time to do it better. Since the mod is free the expectations from most end users are not that high on this issue. But on the other hand if I charged for this mod, those same issues would be demanded to be fixed right away. And rightly SO!\n\nI\u0027m your basic back yard Mechanic. I didn\u0027t know squat about programming when I started Mission Controller. I have learned on my own (no schooling) along the way I have been helped yes by other modders. But for the most part Lots or reading and late night coding.

In my case not so true."},{"CreatedByName":"Fel","CreatedById":57121,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T00:15:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Modding costs money - When you figure in everything from electricity, the food you eat, to the price of the software that people use to create mods, it\u0027s not cheap. Though there are many open source and free pieces of software you can use to develop mods, most don\u0027t compare to commercial products.\n\nThe open source community routinely debates that. For programming, command line mono is really \u0022good enough\u0022 everything else (syntax highlighting, jump to compile error) can be done with various adaptable IDEs. For modeling and texturing, I\u0027ve never met with a straight answer. Open source advocates claim that their open source software equal to or better than commercial software; commercial claims open source is \u0022unprofessional\u0022 and worse.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Modding takes time - You guys are comparing how long it takes a mod creator to make something to how much money they\u0027ll get in return. One thing you\u0027re forgetting is the amount of time and money they spent on the education to create mods. Learning how to mod in KSP is NOT easy, I know, I\u0027ve tried.\n\nIf I could, I use to be in a different community where people had a fear that other people would steal their assets; someone came along and provided a 15 dollar \u0022service/program\u0022 that claimed to protect the assets. Looking at the demo, I found all the service did was attach a self-extractor to a zip archive; and it didn\u0027t even bother to encrypt it. I showed you could use 7zip to extract the \u0022protected\u0022 contents with ease... his fix was to remove part of the PK header, to which I wrote something to put it back in and found he STILL hadn\u0027t encrypted the contents. Few weeks later, someone else picks up the task, provides a free version of the deal, and the \u0022Supply \u002B Demand sellout\u0022 ran away.\n\nThe point is that there are quite a few mods in KSP that do \u0022how did you do that\u0022 things, that are really just a matter of knowing how to read documentation. Other times it is a matter of knowing how to find interfaces in the undocumented code provided \u0022class descriptions\u0022, though only a few times is it a matter of finding interfaces in the non-human readable parts. Examining these interfaces takes time, but, with human readable code, they\u0027re often self-documenting. The \u0022odd fix\u0022, however, takes longer because you don\u0027t know what the interfaces are actually doing, just what they appear to be doing.\n\nBut, if we go back to what I was initially trying to say; people can be impressed by the simplest of code. People will, of course, be arrogant and yell and scream about how much \u0022time\u0022 gets invested in a project... but at the same time the person was initially investing time for her own amusement. Being first on the scene, or being a monopoly, doesn\u0027t grant you RIGHTS.\n\nIf modulemanager, something that really only uses SQUAD\u0027s provided interfaces, pushed as a \u0022for pay\u0022 application and managed to gain acceptance into the modding community thus ending up with mods that have commercial dependencies and all that muck, and someone went and wrote a free version of the same plugin, what do you think would happen to the community? What I mentioned isn\u0027t the only time I\u0027ve seen it happen; and sometimes it can get down right ugly between the two. Even consider now, if modulemanager decided to switch to paid and had a prohibitive license protecting his code. What it does is simple, but now you open the door to claims of ip infringement and the even messier aspect if anything from his code can be found in original code on the boards. This stuff gets nasty really really fast.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Other people are already profiting off the labor of modders - While it may be a labor of love to create mods, that labor gets turned into cash somewhere down the line, whether it results in more sales for Squad or websites like Curse who hosts those mods. It\u0027s money.\n\nThis is a \u0022piece of the pie\u0022 argument, I presume. Something that really should be pointed out is that the reward modders get is \u0022official content.\u0022 Modders spread information about the game, people absorbing the information buy the game, SQUAD uses the money to make the game \u0022better\u0022 (because that is subjective), modders use new features in the API to create new features for the game.\n\nYes, quite a few plugins have been abandoned; more so when they have restrictive licenses that prohibit people from forking the code. Other times it is just a matter of no one wanting to upgrade it. Money doesn\u0027t really change this. Someone who is bored of the game and offering minimal updates to the code to keep it working isn\u0027t the type of person you want maintaining a mod. I respect that people should reserve the right to prevent people from copying their mod while they\u0027re actively developing it, but code segments that sit around doing nothing helps no one and SQUAD has made the decision to respect the original License in these matters.\n\n\u003E Take a look around at what this \u0027open source\u0027 movement has created. Even the Apache Software Foundation, one of the most non-profit non-profits you\u0027ll find, realize the need for money. Here\u0027s their 990 from 2013. They took in over 1.2 million. Why? Because even labors of love cost money. Mozilla for you who think Firefox is a labor of love? $25 million. Even GitHub, where most modders store their code... has a for-profit business model based off these labors of love.\n\nYou\u0027re assuming that the open source movement is actually as altruistic as they claim they are. Non-profit is just tax code, which given open-source communities are complaining that EVERY project doesn\u0027t apply because it \u0022Can be beneficial to people who want to learn about programming in x language\u0022 creates a problem. Mozilla/Netscape is born from a commercial company; taking the new route because of Microsoft\u0027s actions with I.E. Thank MICROSOFT for Firefox ;p\n\nOpen source isn\u0027t the best way to make capital, and open source companies DO hire professionals to add features or check the codebase for problems... but in some of the more altruistic parts, what features get added is directly proportional to how much funding they get, and they\u0027re very open about the goals being pursued. More so talking about Octave and the occasional time I\u0027ve perused the boards, where they tell us how much it would cost to hire professionals that they talked to for features being requested."},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T02:40:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Modders spread information about the game, people absorbing the information buy the game, SQUAD uses the money to make the game \u0022better\u0022 (because that is subjective), modders use new features in the API to create new features for the game.\n\nSo, what you and all the others who are for completely free modding are saying is, it\u0027s OK for Squad to make money off KSP and it\u0027s OK for anyone like Curse, who Squad authorizes to make money off KSP, and it\u0027s OK for Steam to make money off KSP, but it\u0027s not OK for those who actually love this game to the point that they\u0027re willing to spend their time and their own money to make the game better... to make money off KSP.\n\nI want you to look at Wordpress. It\u0027s now one of the largest CMS, if not THE largest. I don\u0027t think any of you can argue that the \u0027modding\u0027 community killed it by getting paid for their efforts. Rather, just the opposite. Wordpress thrives because they allow those who put their sweat equity into making it better to earn a living. They\u0027ve even extended it with every version encouraging people to write plugins, themes and widgets for it.\n\nI don\u0027t know if any of you have been to the grocery store lately, but the price of food is not getting any cheaper. I mentioned that I write shareware. The reason I haven\u0027t written anything for KSP is because it doesn\u0027t put food in my mouth. Yes, I enjoy the game, I enjoy taking a break and creating challenges, spending time with the KSP community on the forums, making videos and tutorials, etc. I do all that for free. I could do a lot more if I so desired, but I don\u0027t. I don\u0027t put my coding capabilities into KSP because I need to eat and coding is work and food costs money. Squad has decided that only those who have other means of sustenance can use their forums to distribute mods. Now if you make gobs of money and have gobs of free time, make all the free mods you want. I certainly won\u0027t stop you. But, I dunno about most of you, I\u0027m not independently wealthy enough to do that.\n\nDon\u0027t get me wrong. There is a place for free mods. KSP wouldn\u0027t be here without them and I wouldn\u0027t be playing KSP without those free mods. And just like Wordpress, there\u0027s a place for free plugins and themes. But there\u0027s also a place for those who write commercial plugins and themes for Wordpress and there\u0027s a place for those would love to create mods for KSP full time but can\u0027t because they need to eat too.\n\nHere\u0027s a hint, guys. Every game dies eventually. I\u0027ve been gaming for well over 30 years now and not one single game I played 15 years ago (I still have a few from 10 years ago) is still in my library. It\u0027s taken Squad 4 years just to break out of beta. While they\u0027ve done a stellar job for an indie, that tells me they don\u0027t have a lot of manpower. If you want this game to go beyond just the hand full of planets you visit now, if it\u0027s going to survive the test of time, and if this game is going to expand beyond just the community of enthusiasts that we are, mod developers are going to need to spend a lot of time and money developing for it and they\u0027ll need to eat too.\n\nWe can have the best of both worlds. Free and paid mods.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E So that\u0027s my take on charging for a mod. Some modders are professional though and do produce A\u002B mods and just might deserve the payment option. In my case not so true.\n\nI agree, I suck at mods. Blender kicks my ass. But, I\u0027m good at writing code and making apps. I\u0027ve made a few parts for KSP and had no qualms about giving them away. I made them for me and if someone else can use them, great. But before I sit and write 5,000 lines of code making some app or website based around KSP, I wanna know who\u0027s buying my dinner.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I think that the modders who\u0027ll make paying mods will just make themselves more broke than they are now ... \n\u003E People can donate for a good mod, but when it comes to buy, they\u0027ll just get it from somewhere else.\n\nNot true. There is no alternative to mods like Jeb, and KAS. Every single day millions of people spend a $1 or $2 on useless stupid apps for their phone. I\u0027d have had no problem paying that for a good KSP mod.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E On the other hand, when you buy a product, you agree to a EULA. I challenge you to find anywhere in, oh, say KSP\u0027s EULA, where it says Squad\u0027s obligated to fix things. Why would (paid) modders be? ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nIt\u0027s not in their EULA. But they\u0027d be obligated for the same reason Squad is. They like their job and they like to eat.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Modders should ask for donations, not sell their mods, because they are simply unable to give a GOOD feedback for all the people who\u0027ll buy their mods. Because guys, when you PAY for a mod, you don\u0027t say \u0022please\u0022 when you ask for a fix, and this, modders can\u0027t take it or bear it for a long time.\n\nAnswer these two questions and you\u0027ll know why donations don\u0027t work.\n\nHow much money have you spent on commercial software? $\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nHow much money have you donated to software developers? $\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nAnd you think because they take donations they\u0027d be more likely to respond to \u0027please\u0027? Let me clue you in. When you make money, or better, make a living off customers, you learn to fix what\u0027s broken or you don\u0027t eat whether they say please or not.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-26T02:49:52Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2015 02:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist**"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T02:45:10Z","Content":"I think Squad will have a harder time if this is implemented.

You want a full overhaul, make your own game!\n\nHere\u0027s some history for you. The Wright Brothers didn\u0027t invent the airplane. They didn\u0027t invent the wing nor did they invent the internal combustion engine or the propeller for that matter. What they did do was to modify all of those things, invented by others, to make human flight possible. Go look through Google patents. Humans have been making money by modifying the work of others for a very long time. Want another example, go search for patents on the yo-yo and see how many \u0027mods\u0027 you find. And be glad people do modify the work of others otherwise you\u0027d still be living in a cave and beating your dinner to death with a stick.\n\nIt seems you have no problem with mods, it\u0027s the money part. I assume you have no problem with Squad profiting off these mods that others create? You realize all these mods influence the KSP buyer\u0027s decision... they definitely influenced mine. How about Steam? You know they don\u0027t sell copies of KSP for free... right? And sales are influenced by the modding community... right. So, do you have a problem with Curse profiting off of these mods? Squad turned the hosting of mods over to them and you know Curse is a for-profit company. Do you have a problem with GitHub profiting off these mods. It\u0027s where many mod creators deposit their source code... and you know GitHub is a for-profit company too. And you have no problem with Google, or Bing or any other search engine making a tiny little profit off the searches for these mods by pitching ads at their visitors... do you?\n\nBut you do have a problem with the person who MADE the mod profiting? Really???? It\u0027s OK for everyone else except the person who made the mod to make money? Are you actually saying that? It\u0027s what Squad and all these other game companies who forbid profiting off mods are saying. It\u0027s OK for us to make money off your work, but you can\u0027t make money off our work. Does all this profit being made by everyone except the mod creator honestly seem fair to you?\n\nI nowhere said I want an overhaul of the game and I\u0027m truly happy the guys at Squad are making money and that they\u0027re enjoying what they do. I\u0027m glad my posts on these forums are in some very small way helping them make money. I\u0027m glad to do it because I love the game. But I\u0027m also saying, these mod creators, who go beyond forum posts and screen shots, whom everyone else manages to profit off of, should be given the opportunity and the option to profit as well.

Supporting modders can only lead to some modders being able to invest more time and effort into creating quality mods. Modders have driven much of the innovation in the games business over the past 10 years, an era where big publisher games were fairly stagnant due to the last console generation and a decreasing appetite for risk. I see this all as evolutionary steps towards a future where there are many more content creators earning a living than there are today, and the quality and richness of the games and entertainment experiences explodes. I think those opposed need to stop worrying that they will not be able to afford the games they love, as most mods and experiences will be free, and paid mods will have to compete with free. We all need to embrace a future where there will be more talented people working harder for longer at making amazing experiences for us all. We should embrace a world in which people have the option to try to earn a living doing what they love for outcomes that we love. Win win.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nFurthermore, I think that many of those who feel strongly negative about this need to examine their emotions and understand that this is not only could be a net positive for everyone, but that removing choice from mod authors and dictating that they should not earn money to support their modding work is based in fears and assuming the worst of everyone. This is not healthy, live your life with openness and kindness and give people the benefit of the doubt. Despite what the hysterical 24 hour news cycle would have you believe, most people are decent folks just like you trying to figure out how to spend more time doing what they love. If they make product that is not worth the price, no one will buy it. I encourage you to consider making competing free mods if you fear the paid mods, the competition between commercial software and open source software has been a massive net positive for us all."},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T16:00:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The real tension will probably be between the people who try to turn modding into a living and the people who are still doing it for free, because the former will always see the latter as some kind threat that is keeping the sales volume down.\n\nTension? Good thing most people consider this \u0027tension\u0027 to be good for business otherwise you might very well have uploaded that post via punch-card. \n\nThere are many free and paid pieces of software that compete with the shareware I wrote. People still purchase mine because I offer a quality product at a competitive price. I even go so far as to list every single product on the market that does compete with mine, free or otherwise, with links to their website, right on the website where they purchase mine.\n\nFor every piece of shareware on the market, odds are, there\u0027s at least one freeware product that does the same thing. The free guy doesn\u0027t care if there\u0027s competition since he has nothing to lose. The shareware guy knows that he has to make a product superior to the free stuff in order to convince people it\u0027s worth the money. Tension? No. Competition. You, the consumer, end up with a wider selection and better quality products than if everything were free.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E How is that extortion ? Do we put a gun on you back and ask to click and donate ?\n\nWell, it\u0027s not extortion. But, I understand what he\u0027s saying. It can get bad. I\u0027m not sure how old you are but back 25 years ago, shareware authors tried an experiment to get people to pay for their product. Authors would release one, fully functional version of their software and then, nag the utter crap out of users trying to convince them to buy... hence nagware. Fortunately, it didn\u0027t work well. The sad part is, history repeats itself. Web developers are having to learn this lesson the hard way. Go visit any content heavy website, like CNN or ABC news and odds are, you\u0027re going to be bombarded with popup advertising.\n\nSorry if I\u0027m somewhat hijacking this post but as you may have guessed, I\u0027m rather passionate about this topic. I was about to start this exact thread when I found this one. I\u0027d love to write software that enhances the KSP experience and I have already experimented with several ideas.

It has nothing to do with how much effort you put into the product, it\u0027s how badly the consumer wants it and how many flavors of that product are available to the consumer.\n\nYour argument is that everyone should be able to play a game EVERY way possible without cost and that the game developer should reap a profit off those who enhance the game. Reality: you have many who abhor the idea of playing KSP with anything BUT stock parts. And you have many who play KSP with 100\u002B mods. You and I are just as different as every mod out there. You play your way, I play mine. And Squad IS profiting from those mods now by the simple fact that they exist. They know this which is why they opened the game to modding in the first place.\n\nAnd I could turn your suggestion around and say the modders should be upset that the game developer is selling their product based on the fact that mods enhance it and they\u0027re getting 0.00% of the game\u0027s sales profit.\n\nSolution: Game developers profit through increased sales based on the fact that mods exist. Modders profit based on the fact that more potential customers are created each time the game sells.
