I was searching for a way to hide/delete animated portraits of kerbals in right bottom corner, cause they\u00A0hit\u00A0my fps,\u00A0and i find this \u0022.cfg\u0022 here\u00A0on forum.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E@PART[*]:HAS[@INTERNAL[*]]:FINAL\n{\n    !INTERNAL,* {}\n}\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScripts works, fps is rock stable and smooth. But\u00A0obviously there is some problem. Eva button is dissapired with those portraits. So, is there a way to do eva\u0027s without that button? I google a lot and dont find anything. Is there is a chance that someone will make a simle rudimentar mod. Something like:\u00A0press button x or toolbar button, shows up menu\u00A0with list of kerbals on whessel, pick one, done. I dont know nothing about Unity. I dont give a clue how to\u00A0\u0022part, internal,\u00A0final, internal\u0022.\u00A0If its was Skyrim,\u00A0I would come up with something )).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr maybe there is another way to rig off those portraits without losing eva? Without those portraits in dx11 mode i have zero loss fps and -40 - 50% memory usage. With portraits and dx11 i loose 20-30 fps, depends of situation. Opengl cut in half my fps. So this is the only way to play RRS-RO.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-05T23:22:47Z\u0022 title=\u002203/05/2016 11:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 5, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by vgamble\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ExplorerKlatt","CreatedById":107424,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-06T05:50:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can left click on the crew hatch and Eva that way.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sebi.zzr","CreatedById":81294,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-07T05:12:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello,i\u0027m using this patch,it keeps the portraits but without fancy IVA,it also helps me for the pods that don\u0027t have any.But i never tested how much impact has on FPS,because the game runs pretty smooth for me.I also play with force dx11,for memory reasons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E@PART[*]:HAS[#CrewCapacity[\u0026gt;0]]:Final\n{\n    %INTERNAL\n    {\n        %name = Placeholder\n    }\n}\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
