In the kerbal universe, gravity is a force applied by gravioli particles. These are material manifestations of quantum energy that are attracted to matter. Planets exert a strong pull on them. The pull of gravioli particles towards a planet pushes on spacecraft in orbit of that planet, forcing them towards the surface. Negative gravioli particles have the opposite interaction with matter and harnessing them would lead to anti-gravity technology. This is why the kerbals have a sensor for it. The problem is taht it is repelled from matter, thus always being pushed away by the presence of the detector, making the search pointless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FFFFFF;\u0022\u003EThis is complete and utter BS made up on the spot.
