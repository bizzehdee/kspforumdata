It\u0027s a mac thing, actually just a folder with stuff inside, stuff that are not meant to be used by end users (but thats not really the case for KSP), and because of that, mac\u0027s file searching tool (Spotlight) does not show anything inside app bundles unless you search directly inside them, which is a \u0022feature\u0022 i hate. Because those dll files are in my app bundles, they should be in KSP\u0027s app bundle too, so i (manually) searched, and they are. So i found out the \u0022KSP_Data\u0022 you said is the equivalent to the app bundle in mac.
