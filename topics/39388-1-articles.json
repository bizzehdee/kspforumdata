Basically this part should have an aircraft related function that the new SAS doesn\u0027t. I suggest the ability to pin it to a point on the NavBall, rather than whatever reference frame the standard SAS uses. This way we might, for example, pin it to the horizon so that the aircraft doesn\u0027t nose-up as it moves across the globe as it will with the current system. Of course, this should be separately toggelable (either action group, context menu, or as a separate key) , as needs might change when, say, your SSTO reaches orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sean Mirrsen","CreatedById":3873,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T14:15:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll or most SSTO parts have been said to be scheduled for a complete overhaul at some future point, so nobody is likely to work on the existing ones much. And the custom-length fuselages and varied fuel mixes are best fixed with customizeable parts, such as the tweakables system that\u0027s coming up sometime in the next few updates (I think), and dynamic parts like the dynamic wings and dynamic fairings in the Mods section. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue here is the combinatorial explosion - say you have three fuselages. Mk1, Mk2, Mk3. You also have transitions between them. And they all hold only fuel. That\u0027s five parts. Now you add custom-length parts, tripling the count of the standards - eleven parts total. Now add the standard fuel mix variant - \u003Cstrong\u003Etwenty-two parts\u003C/strong\u003E. A standard component page being four wide (I think), that\u0027s anywhere from a whole page to two-thirds of one, devoted \u003Cem\u003Ejust\u003C/em\u003E to fuselage parts. And then there\u0027s parts that hold no fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you get tweakable dynamic parts instead, you just keep the adapters, and have the three fuselages, like before, that you can adjust to any length, and fill with whichever fuel mix you want.

Honestly the stock \u0022fixed\u0022 wings create all kinds of issues with designing a craft around them, same goes to intakes (radial ramjet intakes would be great, the b9 pack has them as well). Being able to shape wings as you see fit is simply much, much better that I can\u0027t imagine how I managed to make planes without them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yes, I think sooner or later we\u0027ll see Artyom or C7 working on some new cockpits and spaceplane parts, also tweakables would help a lot for the oxidizer issue. Probably not before the aerodynamics model get reworked though, my guess is that implementing that would also be done around the same time as re-entry heat, as both systems would probably share some of the framework.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Comrade Jenkens","CreatedById":59544,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T15:45:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe spaceplane parts will probably have a complete overhaul in the near future. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E With each update they seem more and more dated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen they were introduced though they were amazing. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
