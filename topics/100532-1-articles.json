As the air leaks out, the internal pressure drops and his body is exposed to a vacuum, we watch in horror through his faceplate as he swells, and explodes.\u003Cp\u003EA somewhat similar scene is in the 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, \u0022Total Recall.\u0022 In that movie, Schwarzenegger leaves the pressure of the habitat of a Mars colony and begins to blow up like a balloon in the much lower pressure of the Mars atmosphere, not quite a vacuum. He is saved by the creation of an entirely new atmosphere by an ancient alien machine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe question is, what happens to the human body in a vacuum?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, the body won\u0027t blow up. Your blood won\u0027t boil, either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a number of things about being in space, in a vacuum, which could cause harm to the human body. You wouldn\u0027t want to hold your breath. This would cause lung damage. You would probably remain conscious for several seconds, until the blood without oxygen reaches your brain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be pretty darn cold, but the human body doesn\u0027t lose heat that fast, so you\u0027d have a little time before you froze to death. It\u0027s possible you could have some problems with your eardrums, including a rupture, but maybe not. It would be worse if you had a cold, and were stuffy headed, with no way for the pressure to equalize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could get a bad sunburn, and you might actually swell some, but not to Arnold Schwarzenegger, \u0022Total Recall\u0022 proportions. The \u0022bends\u0022 are also possible, just like a diver who surfaces too quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile your own normal blood pressure will keep your blood from boiling, the saliva in your mouth could very well begin to do so. In 1965, while performing tests at the NASA facility now known as Johnson Space Center a subject was accidentally exposed to a near vacuum (less than 1 psi) when his space suit leaked while in a vacuum chamber. He did not pass out for about 14 seconds, by which time unoxygenated blood had reached his brain. Technicians began to repressurize the chamber within 15 seconds and he regained consciousness at around the equivalent of 15,000 feet of altitude. He later said that his last conscious memory was of the water on his tongue beginning to boil.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe human body is amazingly resilient. The worst problem would be lack of oxygen, not lack of pressure in the vacuum. If returned to a normal atmosphere fairly quickly, you would survive with few if any irreversible injuries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere have actually been cases of parts of astronauts bodies being exposed to vacuum, when suits were damaged.

You have other holes in your body- your ears, your butt, your eyes- and those need to be plugged too. The sphincter isn\u0027t going to be able to hold back the vacuum of space when it can barely even hold back a large burrito. Additionally, you might have a difficult time exhaling- because your chest is exposed to vacuum. When you load it up with air, that will be a lot of lbs per square inch pushing it outward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, let\u0027s say that you had just your arms and legs directly exposed to vacuum. You could probably survive like that for a fairly long time, if you could get a fairly airtight seal around them and replace any air leaking out. It probably wouldn\u0027t be very comfortable though. I believe there was an account of someone who got their entire hand exposed to vacuum for a pretty long time and suffered no ill effects at all.

This forces blood out of their lower torso, and combined with the flight suit that puts pressure on their legs to the same effect, blood is forced upward in the body and to the head, delaying blackout and maximising tolerable G-force.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArguably it\u0027s similar, as vacuum causes blackout by forcing oxygen out of you, and thus the brain doesn\u0027t get enough, while high-G forces blood away from the brain and so oxygen isn\u0027t available, but the breathing technique is to prevent such from happening. And should not be attempted in vacuum - your throat is not capable of holding back 14 psi of air pressure trying to escape, and you\u0027ll just damage your lungs and throat trying to fight it.

I suppose there would be alpha particles too, but not as many as protons, I would guess. Then there would also be x-rays (by the astronomical definition of x-rays/gamma rays which does not consider what the source of the photon is). And also, there would be ultraviolet, though it doesn\u0027t take much to protect against ultraviolet. I suppose there would also be small amounts of antimatter- for example, we\u0027ve spotted a big cloud of positrons being ejected from the galaxy\u0027s core- but I don\u0027t know how much of those would be present in our neighborhood. Probably not a WHOLE lot, but we do know that Earth\u0027s magnetic field traps a small amount of antimatter so maybe you could have locally \u0022high\u0022 concentrations of it. However, I would think that the effect of antimatter would be roughly equate into an increased flux of gamma rays, because antimatter particles convert to gamma rays upon interacting with regular matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe good news is that there shouldn\u0027t be any direct neutron radiation, I think, because I believe that free neutrons have short lives, so you only get neutron radiation when something is locally producing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there\u0027s also another problem, a BIG problem- secondary particle showers. Basically, an extremely energetic particle hits some part of your spacecraft and creates a shower of high energy particles (kinda like a relativistic shotgun blast), and these secondary particles can be of just about any kind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd just to be complete, really, you could get just about any element as cosmic ray. I said protons and alpha particles because they\u0027re the most common elements in the universe (hydrogen and helium), but there ought to be iron nucleus cosmic rays, oxygen cosmic rays, etc... I suppose there are even plutonium cosmic rays. Plutonium has a short half-life (20000 ish years for the longest-lived), but when it gets accelerated to 99.999...% the speed of light, time dilation should allow it to survive a trip of many billions of light-years. Actually, one of the first proofs of time dilation was the observation that unstable particles have much longer lives if they are travelling very close to the speed of light.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-24T22:04:19Z\u0022 title=\u002202/24/2015 10:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T22:38:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe effective heat of space on a human varies depending on where it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the enemy ist really the cold so much as it is the lack of pressure...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T22:58:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehey everyone... the topic was about how fast you lost heat in space.. not what can kill you faster under your own assumptions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit start from a basic that you have oxygen... so how fast the the body lose heat. that was the question..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T23:09:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat answer requires data we don\u0027t have.

Jerry Pournelle often used these elastic suits in his fiction, and I was determined to find out exactly why we weren\u0027t using this awesome idea. Well, they worked great...almost. NASA worked on them for several years, but eventually gave up and assigned the research to MIT, to see if they could solve the two remaining problems:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) The suits take literally hours to get into. The astronaut\u0027s essentially wrapping seven layers of Ace bandages, applied with lots of tension, over every inch from the neck down.

Testicles don\u0027t like being individually wrapped really tightly, and if there was any gap left at all the testicle would painfully expand into it. They couldn\u0027t work out any sort of cup design that\u0027d hold against the pressure difference and not be too painful to wear. In his novels, Pournelle thought women\u0027s breasts would be the problem, but they said it was just like a sports bra.
