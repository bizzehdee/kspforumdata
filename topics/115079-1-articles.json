One spaceplane is for Duna, and the other Ike, and this will be a two-kerbal mission. The flight plan is essentially to launch at the prime launch window for Duna, put in an orbit, have Valentina fly the spaceplanes one at a time, gather rocks and data, return to the vessel. After the missions are complete, she will then fly back to Kerbin in the Spaceplane with the LV-N while Jagie will say behind and conduct research in the on-board laboratory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Remember, I\u0027ve never left Kerbin\u0027s gravity well, so I\u0027m not entirely sure what to expect)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgbox.com/XFrcSwrl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022XFrcSwrl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgbox.com/pzEQ3B2o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022pzEQ3B2o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgbox.com/Dl68iHoO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Dl68iHoO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgbox.com/bLCVgX4Q.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bLCVgX4Q.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgbox.com/OCzHzIQM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022OCzHzIQM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe results of my trip:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Nj-0_odsrI?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-21T00:36:58Z\u0022 title=\u002207/21/2015 12:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Edax\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbimbibble","CreatedById":77859,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T00:40:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see two potential issues.
