A single radio wave comes into being at a point exactly 20m from your forehead, aimed directly at the ground. Luck, however, seems to have an abysmally cruel sense of humour. Radio waves rarely touch atoms in the air, their wavelength tending to be so large it passes atoms by fairly easily. Today, we are not so fortunate. That single radio wave strikes an atom of oxygen dead-on, with pinpoint accuracy, causing \u003Cem\u003Ejust enough\u003C/em\u003E of a disturbance to break the molecular bond that held it together with another oxygen atom. These two free oxygen atoms quickly collide with other oxygen molecules, forming ozone. In another nigh impossible occurrence, these two ozone molecules then collide together, sandwiching a stray atom of uranium-235. The ensuing nuclear reaction initiates a chain reaction with some nearby hydrogen, causing a very small but very powerful explosion that quickly grows into a miniature mushroom cloud almost 50m high, enveloping you in a matter of instants after the initial wish was granted. You don\u0027t even have time to move before your entire body is seared and burned by an excess of radiation, burning your skin, blinding you, and causing severe genetic damage. You are found the next day in the middle of a field, on the edge of a small crater, with burns covering your entire body. Despite being rushed to hospital, there is nothing the doctors can do; the genetic damage guarantees your death.
