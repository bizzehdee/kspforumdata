Likely, the vessel would have had to have been repaired in space or it would not have survived reentry, having lost a large section of wing and its nosecone.\n\nBelow are excepts from the mission log.\n\n**VA FLIGHT LOG - INDIA X-RAY TWO**\n\n\u003E ![20AxI.png](http://i.imgur.com/20AxI.png)\n\u003E ![ucQOt.png](http://i.imgur.com/ucQOt.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![LySih.png](http://i.imgur.com/LySih.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![huRwg.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/huRwg.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![1ITQT.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/1ITQT.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![ZTKha.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ZTKha.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![TaqL0.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/TaqL0.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![mxnj7.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/mxnj7.jpg)\n\nVeto Aerospace has notified the families of the three brave astronauts. May Navigator Siglin, Commander Nedmy and Pilot Rondrin rest peacefully in the great Vehicle Assembly Building in the sky.\n\nIssues have been raised over the safety of the *Ibis X* class, given both spacecraft to make Minmus landings were destroyed in the process of returning to Minmus orbit, and whether *Ibis X3* should be sent back to Kerbin - the craft is still currently orbiting the smaller ice moon, awaiting commands from Mission Control. IX2 seemed to be in a better position to land at the time, though no ice lakes were below the daylight side of its orbit.\n\nVA would like to assure all interested parties that the *Ibis X* is *not* an inherently unsafe spacecraft. The *Ibis X1*\\\u0027s destruction was caused by pilot error, as Pilot Bobvis Kerman failed to deactivate the SAS - something that could happen for any spacecraft, although admittedly not a problem for most rockets.The *Ibis*, being a spaceplane, has a different set of takeoff protocols. The loss of X2 was caused by its landing on the rocky and steep slopes of Minmus\\\u0027 mountains. Its mission was crippled as soon as it touched down and lost a wing, though the loss of the nose cone and with it the RADAR did nothing to help.\n\nFuture VA missions to Minmus will be strictly controlled to prevent landings over mountainous regions. Takeoffs may use mountains as launch ramps, but launches should not be attempted from mountain summits."},{"CreatedByName":"Twinky827","CreatedById":17455,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T23:42:02Z","Content":"Red...

Unfortunately, that kind of publicity \\\u0027stunt\\\u0027 [for lack of a more accurate word] can heavily backfire, such as how the corporation has lost the cost of two *Ibis X*s from its own profits, and the loss of the astronauts is bad PR, as well as a social disaster.\n\nLog timings indicate the explosion followed seconds after the loss of the vessel\\\u0027s primary engines.
