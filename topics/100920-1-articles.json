Science Revisited Revisited builds upon their original work.\n\n* * *\n\nScience Revisited Revisited aims to be a lightweight and modular rebalance of the stock science system. These adjustments aim to make science gameplay more dynamic, while preserving the stock gameplay feel.\n\nThe work is built entirely through Module Manager patches. The edits it makes are also completely modular in nature. This allows users to pick and choose the changes they want to apply.\n\n**[Download at SpaceDock](http://spacedock.info/mod/317/Science%20Revisited%20Revisited)**\n\nPatches Included:\n\n- **Revised Crew Versus EVA Reports:** Switches low space and flying crew reports to make them biome-dependant, while making the same EVA reports biome independant. No more hanging off the sides of cockpits to get that \u0022flying at kerbin\u0027s mountains\u0022 data or EVAing every two minutes in low munar orbit. Somehow this makes more sense.\n- **Reduced Transmission Penalty on Data:** Science that is simple data is much more effectively transmitted. Recovering the instruments is still mildly helpful. Temperature, gravity, barometer, accelerometer, and atmospheric data are currently affected\n- **Increased Transmission Penalty on Experiments:** Significantly nerfs the already low transmission rates for materials studies and mystery goo.\n- **Increased Transmission Penalty on Surface Samples:** Significantly nerfs the transmission value of Surface Samples. Compliments the experiment nerfs patch discussed above.\n- **Science Lab Rebalance:** Increases the Science Lab\u0027s weight to a more volume appropriate 5 tons. Increases lab\u0027s data and science storage. Rebalances several mod-added labs similarly.\n- **Probe Telemetry Science:** Adds a very low value experiment to all command modules. This data is representative of the telemetry data needed to pilot the vessel.\n- **Microgravity Experiment:** Replaces the hitchhiker\u0027s stock crew report with a new, slightly more valuable \u0022Micro-Gravity\u0022 Experiment. Good flavor. Also adds the experiment to a couple mod added habitats.\n\n**Plays Well With Friends**\n\nThere is built in support for Porkjet\u0027s Habitat Pack, Lack\u0027s Stock Extension, Roverdude\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E mod constellation, Kerbal Planetary Base Systems, Dmagic Orbital Science, and Nertea\u0027s Near Future Solar \u0026 Stockalike Station Parts Expansion. In addition, most ballance patches are automatically applied to all relevant parts. (A mod doesn\u0027t have to be listed here to be compatible; this is simply a list of mods that Science Revisited is explicitly aware of.)\n\n**There is one suspect incompatibility at this time: Station Science 2.0. See thread post 61 (page 3 by default) for more information and a potential fix.** Please report any further incompatibilities either at a balancing or at a functional level.\n\n**[Full Album](http://imgur.com/a/Da1MX)**\n\n![hyrlPLa.png](http://i.imgur.com/hyrlPLa.png)\n\n* * *\n\nThis work is an adaptation of the original work of CaptRobau.

Reviving this was already a slippery slope for me as well. It all started when I wanted that eva patch. And then I needed the transmission rate rebalances too. And I may as well rewrite them to make them work with all my modded parts. But I\u0027m getting more science from probes: I need to balance that. Less science from materials. Now I need the lab. oooh! that hitchiker experiment is shiney! shoot, lets throw in the solar nerf too. while we\u0027re at it, lets make it modular. now lets add probe science. Now lets write compatibility patches for a bunch of stuff...
