While release dates are never certain--I know that things can change, or be delayed, ... However, it would be cool if someone has a rough guess at when a release for the different systems are planned. (Again, I know that things can change.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is cool to see how this game has been growing in popularity. I have been playing the demo for quite a while and I was really happy to finally be able to buy the full game. I wish Squad and the KSP team a lot of luck in getting this game out in more formats. While as players, we care deeply about the game and we continue to look forward to seeing this game grow and I know that for the developers, getting paid for their efforts allows them to continue to develop this and more great games. Console releases could be a good thing--handled well--and can continue to increase the popularity of the game. I set this game along Minecraft in terms of it\u0027s potential for both profit for the company and enjoyment of the players. Both games also tie heavily in their user\u0027s creativity and I think that is one of the big draws of these games for us--to tap into our imaginations as we build stuff and have fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-12T04:51:50Z\u0022 title=\u002211/12/2015 04:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by thesmokindeist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EPoor grammer...sheesh\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T06:11:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESquad hasn\u0027t given us much information on the console versions of the game other than that they\u0027re planning on releasing it for the PS4, Xbox One, and Wii U, and that they\u0027re working with another studio (Flying Tiger) who is doing all the work porting the game to the consoles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe don\u0027t have any information on how the console versions will compare with the PC version, or when they might be released.
