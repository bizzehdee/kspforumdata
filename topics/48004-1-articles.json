Our scientists were disappointed that not only were the best deposits under water or at high latitudes, there were none in the immediate vicinity of KSC, except for a large but low grade deposit just offshore to the south.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next best locations to mine Kethane were the moons, Mun and Minmus. After having an unsolvable systems glitch where only a single scanner can be operable in Kerbin orbit at any time, the decision was made to send a large scanner to Minmus with a large fuel tank so it would be capable of making many orbit inclination changes. Getting such a payload there turned out to be AARP\u0027s longest, most failure filled R\u0026amp;D program to date, but the resulting launcher proved to be very useful for the next phase.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlan Aerospace Recycling and Packaging next embarked on a project to design vehicles to mine the newly discovered resource called \u0022Kethane\u0022. But simple landers won\u0027t do, noooo. They should be mobile! Also, designing a vehicle to reach the Mun is easy-peasy so we shot for Minmus instead because any rocket that can reach Minmus can also reach Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe initial design, dubbed \u0022Krover\u0022, is quickly scribbled out on a drink coaster in the CAD department\u0027s cafeteria then hastily assembled - Neglecting such niceties as lights and ensuring all the wheels were on straight. During drive tests it first goes off the back end of the pad, then wants to constantly swerve to the right. \u0022Just keep bumping the joystick to the side, not like it can drive too fast on Minmus without crashing. It needs to be in space ASAP!\u0022 After a surprisingly short series of test flights on top of the Minmus scanner launcher, Krover was on his way to Minmus. It was extremely difficult to drive, was slow to fill its Kethane tank, ran out of power in the dark and our remote operators complained they couldn\u0027t watch it work at night without any lights. However, they did eventually find a way to remotely correct the rotation of its two crooked wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter filling Krover\u0027s tank and launching it back into Minmus orbit, our attention turned to the Mun. A second Krover was assembled but with the 3x2 panels changed out for 6x1\u0027s and two RTGs and a pair of small Kethane scanners were added after the chief janitor (and engineer) said \u0022Instead of sending a separate satellite and rover, why not use the rover as the satellite to find the green stuff, then land it on a good spot?\u0022. The suggestion was met with such enthusiasm that once again lights were forgotten and unfortunately the crooked jig used to mount Krover\u0027s wheels was reused. It was also decided that the changes merited a new name, Kleveland.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new vehicle used a lot of fuel landing, even though the Minmus Intercept* stage was used for the initial deorbit, came down on a steep slope and was impossible to move without it violently swerving and tipping over. It also did not have enough fuel to make it back to Mun orbit, let alone complete a rendezvous. Our dream of having the same rover design for both of Kerbin\u0027s moons was dashed. After some quick BOTC (Bottom Of The Coaster) calculations, it was decided to allow Kleveland to crash and start over with a fresh coaster for a Mun mining rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Called such because it was required to finish the intercept at Minmus but ended up being weight carried to Mun.

Much of Kleveland\u0027s central stack was kept, with the addition of 2 more RTGs for a total of 4, and two 3x2 panels. The girders were laid out in a straight direction, which eliminated the wheel attaching issues of the original design. LIGHTS! Someone finally remembered the lights. Placing the drills fore and aft presented a problem of where to locate the engines and fuel tanks. The new girders were ideal for laying down a pair of tanks and 10 small engines were mounted in various locations. The new arrangement was powerful enough to lift Kleveland 2 in Kerbin gravity right from ignition. \u0022Overpowered? Don\u0027t know the meaning of that word.\u0022 was heard more than once from members of the design team, along with a \u0022YES! This ought to work on both moons!\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe general appointment was soon dissed as the new design also showed itself to be a fuel hog, burning too much on the way down to make it back up from the Mun. Having confidence in the basic layout, several attempts were made with changing the tanks out for stretchy ones, pulled out to the limits of the size of the rover and trying to limit fuel burn by turning some of the engines off but it made no difference, it\u0027d always burn over half the fuel on the way down so there was no way this design was ever coming back up with a full Kethane tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was nothing for it but to add a Kethane converter to a Mun mining rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring a strategy meeting it was decided that the original Krover-Kleveland design was too limited and that unless the wheel problem could be solved it was pretty much useless even for Minmus. Kleveland 2 would become the prime design for Minmus and a modified version with a Kethane converter would be dubbed Kleveland 2M (M for Mun).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA small converter was wedged in between the top of the battery and a shortened docking port support girder and after debugging the fuel flow from the converter to the side tanks (enlarged stretchy ones from the Kleveland 2 tests) a 2M was duly launched to Mun. By this point in the program, nobody was surprised that it worked, but more calculations (this time on a 2A/2B ruled writing pad) showed it to be an inefficient way to loft Kethane from the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurning to a fresh sheet of paper, a design was sketched for a 2M with the stretchy tanks stretched a wee bit farther and a large converter installed. It was named Kleveland 2Ma then abandoned on the (writing) pad as an even less economical way to lift 4,000 units of Kethane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EThe next step was proceding immediately to Kleveland 3M with two 4,000 unit tanks in tandem on top of an oversized bi-coupler with a single large drill a stack of large batteries, a large converter, 7 RTGs and lots of solar panels. Balance problems despite COM and COT being aligned (it flipped and tumbled down the pad ramp the one time it was tested under power), the need for even more wheels and the problem with it falling apart as the struts vaporized when the rover was staged off the bi-coupler doomed it.\u003C/span\u003E (Note: The preceding paragraph never happened, just check AARP\u0027s files, there\u0027s nothing there on this design.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next step was proceeding immediately to Kleveland 3M with a single 8,000 unit tank, two large drills, the wheels and girders from Kleveland 2, more batteries, 6 RTGs, a large cnverter and a lot of 6x1 solar panels should have the 3M as a useful workhorse of AARP\u0027s Kethane mining system. Despite its greater weight it has shown in simulation (that would be using Hyperedit) to be capable of lifting 8,000 units of Kethane to a 15KM Mun orbit from a surface altitude of less than 3,000 meters, with what should be enough fuel left for a refinery rendezvous. If not, just convert some of the onboard supply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt only remains to build a launcher capable of actually transporting a Kleveland 3M to the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDone! Using the vertical external mounting properties of the large drills, small diameter tanks were extended down from beneath them, either side of a Rockomax 64. That pattern was continued down to the booster stage, which is a hybrid asparagus/parallel staging style. The three upper stage engines do not share fuel. The side engines stay on through circularization then a fuel tanker is docked to top up everything. Once the Transmunar Injection burn is finished, remaining fuel in the side tanks is transferred to the big tank and the side tanks and engines jettisoned. Didn\u0027t have to clean them up, the transfer trajectory had them hit the Mun dead center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the other part of the program, the orbital refineries are simple and completely unremarkable.

A refinery expansion has also been built, but with a 4,000 unit tank, six giant panels and two standard docking ports on its sides.

Odd thing is, that tank is drained only after the side tanks empty. Haven\u0027t had to tap it yet in \u0022real\u0022 use but did during \u0022simulation\u0022 flights with Hyperedit. If fuel gets that low by the time orbit is achieved, it\u0027s not going to make rendezvous with the refinery. The fuel in that tank gets transferred to the refinery\u0027s tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3M has six cylindrified RCS tanks. For the trip after next I may leave two of them empty. Less weight should save a little fuel. Even with having RCS on for the full landing, ascent and docking it doesn\u0027t come near to running out. Still crazy that the same two engines used by 2M can lift 3M just as easy with everything full. Kleveland 2 is just grossly overpowered with its 10 little engines. I should fill its Kethane tank and see if it can still lift on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext step? Perhaps a rover capable of lifting 16,000 units of Kethane? Going to have to figure out a way to do it with the tanks laying down or some way to make it no taller than Kleveland 3M.

With Large Rover onboard it\u0027s 499 parts and lags a bit until the first stage drops. My first use of Quantum struts. They hold the third stage rock solid with only 4. I put six on top of the third stage to hold the rover, which is perched on with a radial attachment so the connection is pretty small.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany of those parts are struts binding the first stage together. I tried using Quantum struts but for some reason they wouldn\u0027t keep it together and using them to bind the first and second stages together only resulted in them popping the connections when physics kicked in and the rocket settled on the pad.

Hmmm, still have some headroom with the lighter payload, could pull those stretchy tanks out a bit and still get to orbit with the second stage on... The second stage is the core of the first stage used to launch all the previous rovers and the big scanner satellite to Minmus. Hooray for the new subassembly feature! Made the launcher build much easier for Large Rover since I already had a powerful stage that won\u0027t rip itself apart, only had to debug the first stage. But for some reason, one of those Skippers and its orange tank will sometimes rip loose with the heavy Large Rover as the payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7345/10400044856_7c88f8135f_z.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210400044856_7c88f8135f_z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-21T10:03:14Z\u0022 title=\u002210/21/2013 10:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Galane\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
