Early in the tech tree you would have the ability to lower or raise the pressure in the tires in the SPH but not whilst flying or in the air ... This would change as you advance in the tech tree so as to provide the ability to adjust the tire pressure in flight to accommodate for landing surfaces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust a thought\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
