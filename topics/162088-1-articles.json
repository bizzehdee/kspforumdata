Like most SSTOs I build it had no testing to ensure it could make it there and back. I ended up using many many gravity assists to get myself out there. I want to put 4 clips, each a flyby, into a 2x2 formation so the video can show 4 at once instead of a whole bunch one at a time. Does anyone know how to do this? I use movie maker.

Its video editing utilities allow for all kinds of things, from placing multiple video tracks on the same screen to synchronising video and audio.
