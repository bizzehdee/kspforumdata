Once speed hits about 50 m/s attempt to level off and point directly pro-grade (this will probably take several attempts). Then throttle up to max. I have been unable to successfully decelerate, although it is possible to become airborn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter finishing my testing with this boat, I then tested these air intakes (attached to structural pylons) for suitability as pontoon landing gear for aircraft. It does work, and while I wasn\u0027t able to take off again because my engines kept getting knocked off by the water when surfing at about 8m/s a well designed aircraft should be able to take off and land from the water easily with a structural pylon/air intake pontoon combination.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jman508","CreatedById":122550,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T17:25:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei think my recon boat could get up to somewhere aroud 175 m/s and the speed variant ( also known as removing the science/cargo bay and adding moar engines) could hit roughly 360 m/s but i tried to turn and it disintegrated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"skepticon","CreatedById":111470,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T17:59:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jman508\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jman508\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ei think my recon boat could get up to somewhere aroud 175 m/s and the speed variant ( also known as removing the science/cargo bay and adding moar engines) could hit roughly 360 m/s but i tried to turn and it disintegrated.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWater in KSP is like an event horizon \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deutherius","CreatedById":125381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T19:05:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jman508\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jman508\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ei think my recon boat could get up to somewhere aroud 175 m/s and the speed variant ( also known as removing the science/cargo bay and adding moar engines) could hit roughly 360 m/s but i tried to turn and it disintegrated.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you play with FAR or NEAR installed?
