Once speed hits about 50 m/s attempt to level off and point directly pro-grade (this will probably take several attempts). Then throttle up to max. I have been unable to successfully decelerate, although it is possible to become airborn.\n\nAfter finishing my testing with this boat, I then tested these air intakes (attached to structural pylons) for suitability as pontoon landing gear for aircraft. It does work, and while I wasn\u0027t able to take off again because my engines kept getting knocked off by the water when surfing at about 8m/s a well designed aircraft should be able to take off and land from the water easily with a structural pylon/air intake pontoon combination."},{"CreatedByName":"jman508","CreatedById":122550,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T17:25:10Z","Content":"i think my recon boat could get up to somewhere aroud 175 m/s and the speed variant ( also known as removing the science/cargo bay and adding moar engines) could hit roughly 360 m/s but i tried to turn and it disintegrated."},{"CreatedByName":"skepticon","CreatedById":111470,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T17:59:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E i think my recon boat could get up to somewhere aroud 175 m/s and the speed variant ( also known as removing the science/cargo bay and adding moar engines) could hit roughly 360 m/s but i tried to turn and it disintegrated.\n\nWater in KSP is like an event horizon ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Deutherius","CreatedById":125381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T19:05:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E i think my recon boat could get up to somewhere aroud 175 m/s and the speed variant ( also known as removing the science/cargo bay and adding moar engines) could hit roughly 360 m/s but i tried to turn and it disintegrated.\n\nDo you play with FAR or NEAR installed?

At least in Stock KSP. I\u0027ve found that at speeds above 60 m/s, on water, strange things happen and drag seems to drop to similar to at about 5,000m.
