I assumed getting into obit would be my biggest challenge, but it turns out I was wrong. After I separate the last stage, leaving the ring without any engines or maneuvering ability other than RCS, the craft will slowly start shaking until it eventually explodes. This occurs whether RCS or SAS is engaged or not, and did not happen when I originally separated the engines. I had time to admire it and take a quick screenshot, but now when I go back it will inevitably destroy itself. Luckily I have an auto-save file of the craft prior to separating the engine, so I will hopefully be able to dock a small living section to try to maintain stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I was just curious if this has happened to anyone else or if you can tell me any reason this may be happening. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/Ss0SK#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/Ss0SK#0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-31T17:47:42Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2015 05:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Steelsunoa\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-31T17:27:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPart clipping would be my prime suspect.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fearless Son","CreatedById":133397,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-31T17:28:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy first thought is, \u0022Do you have something clipping?\u0022 Because a ring like this has to have some non-standard attachment points somewhere. I am wondering if what is happening is there is a bit of a \u0022bounce\u0022 happening from clipped parts trying to separate, and it is introducing a harmonic physics response. That is, as it tries to bounce apart, it pushes the parts next to it, which then try to snap back against it, which then makes it bounce harder, etc. It would be a little physics glitch that would turn a minor force into a major one, given enough time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe aerodynamic and thrust forces might have been enough to overwhelm the harmonic forces while it was on ascent to orbit, but once it was parked and idle, well...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Steelsunoa","CreatedById":135938,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-31T17:52:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis was my first thought as well, but I checked the craft file in the VAB. I attempted to avoid any clipping, the ring is just four quarter circles that technically don\u0027t ever touch at the four intersecting points. I kept them stable with the \u0022spokes\u0022 and failed to use any struts that did not originate from the center of the circle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I just disabled all of the torque and this seems to have solved my problem. The \u0022Advanced Inline Stabilizer\u0022 it seems is the culprit here! Perhaps the placement of them, one on each end, was causing some strange rocking motion as it attempted to stabilize the craft. Phew!

I think the \u0022bounce\u0022 was happening due to the lack of lateral struts across the circle. So the four sections had small downward arc since they are not perfectly center on the fuel tank. Without the stabilizing action though they seem to sit together just fine.

So the whole ring is unstable cross-axial (across the flat plane of the ring). I\u0027m happy for you that turning off SAS fixes it. Sometimes the rigid bodies will still feedback on themselves.
