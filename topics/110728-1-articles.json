I \u0027ve tried everything! Fins, no fins, less fuel in the lower tank to bring the COM up, turning at 70m/s, turning at 100m/s, turning as soon as I leave the pad, turning at 1km. Everything. It used to flip at 6-7km high, but then I adjusted the thrust so that I wouldn\u0027t reach Mach 1 until I was 18-20k up. That way I made it past the 6km up to maybe 28km up, by veeeery carefully following the prograde (\u002B- 10 degrees) but at that point if I tried to move outside the market it would flip like a dart being thrown upwards. Since I couldn\u0027t move upwards, the rocket started to experience heat effects from its speed. All these were of course possible only because SAS was on. Even the thought of turning the SAS off, would send my ship spinning wildly into every possible direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI \u0027ve tried pretty much everything posted in the forums, including checking the PF to see if all components were shielded.

Fins and more weight help to a degree, but what you need is a heftier payload to make it truly as if you\u0027re throwing a dart. On a dart, the heavy part is at the front, and when it\u0027s thrown the weight is keeping it on course, the rest of the dart being used for stabilization. This is what you need to think of when building a rocket in FAR, and even in the new aerodynamics system. Once your stage is smaller it\u0027s not so much of an issue because you\u0027re out of the atmosphere, but try making your probes heavier and it should work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T03:45:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDisclaimer: I don\u0027t know anything about FAR, but I\u0027m guessing these stock 1.0.2 principles may help you\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClose to prograde generally means inside the green circle, or at the tip of the outer hashes in extreme cases. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA quick summary I posted previously:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESpinning out of control essentially comes down to a contest between drag and control.

Little deviation and rocket flips over. I solved it by turning on RCS ports that I had for docking anyway I had ridiculous amount of propellant.
