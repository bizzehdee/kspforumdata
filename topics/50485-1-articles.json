Grab its fuel line and feed it into the first set of asparagus rockets, and then use the highlighting of radial decouplers when hovering over the icons in the staging to determine which set is the newly-added one. Once you\u0027ve identified it, add a new stage below the stage that has both sets of radial decouplers in it, and move the new set into this new stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The third set of asparagus tanks are copy-pasted from the second set and need even less maintenance; just place, add a new stage for them, and move the radial decouplers into that new stage so they\u0027re set to fall first. After that, strut it up (tip: fuel lines act as struts, and bracing works best if you do at least 3 sets radially plus one strut array coming down from above to join the tops of the tanks to the central stack).
