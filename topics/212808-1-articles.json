The steam hardware survey suggests that less than half of GPUs meet the minimum requirements and something like 3% on Steam meet the recommended requirements and that a good number of people on Steam still have something that has less than or about 50% the graphics performance of minimum requirements.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo yeah, I have a laptop with bidirectional voltage throttling on the CPU and a 1050 Ti. The recommended GPU is RTX 3080. The minimum GPU is RTX 2060. These have performances at graphical tasks on the order of 3-7 times mine if it could run full throttle without dropping CPU performance into the MHz range, which it can\u0027t.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey either need to greatly improve the graphical and other performance or allow extremely severe cutbacks of settings to boost the performance because currently, from the looks of things, I probably have 10% the sustainable GPU power it recommends and 25% the minimum requirements.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhile I have to say the recommended settings are at least more honest than KSP 1\u0027s recommended settings if the goal is even remotely smooth frame rates, they are sufficiently high that unless they are reduced, it will be years before most people come anywhere close to having that level of hardware performance.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-06-01T05:36:35Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2023 05:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Pds314\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Infinite Aerospace","CreatedById":230192,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-13T08:32:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224243331\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022212808\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677385160\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022206920\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DarkBrave_\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 2/26/2023 at 4:19 AM, DarkBrave_ said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust wait for the developers to make it more performant.
