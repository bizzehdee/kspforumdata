I\u0027m still a very grid-oriented person, but the spacing is ultimately determined by what you set the spacing values to in the workbook (so if you wanted rows to be staggered like a row of bricks, for example, you could).

It\u0027d help a ton if you could come up with a list of technology advancement nodes you want to use: things like wood \u0026 steel -\u003E aluminum -\u003E composites for structural or whatever. They would encompass countless parts depending on their application. I could try to come up with nodes myself, but it would be unlikely to fall in line with your original thoughts on how to categorize things for ETT.\n\nDoing a couple quick tests, I should be able to use the magic of ModuleManager to apply these on a grand scale, covering all parts regardless of stock or mod so long as they fit certain criteria.\n\nMy first thoughts for stat improvement is: new-50%, improved-80%, advanced-100%; this would provide for a very notable improvement in functionality on existing parts as you progress through the tree, but would need to make sure it doesn\u0027t cross any practicality thresholds. Certain types of tech may need more or less than 3 improvements as well, but it seemed to me a good generic starting point.\n\nFirst Thoughts of Improvement Types:\n\n- Structural Materials (mass, impact tolerance, g-force tolerance, heat tolerance)\n- Thermodynamics (heat tolerance, ablator per mass, heat transfer rate)\n- Charge Density (electric per mass ratio)\n- Combustion (thrust, fuel efficiency)\n- Cryogenics (liquid fuel/oxidizer per volume, mass)\n- Gyroscopics (force per mass of reaction wheels)\n- Software (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E modes)\n- Hydraulics (gimbal range, piston efficiency and max force)\n- Electromagnetics (servo/rotor efficiency and max force, generator/alternator efficiency, wheel efficiency)\n- Aerodynamics (drag, max lift)\n- Chemistry (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E efficiency, fuel efficiency)\n- Analytics (science efficiency)"},{"CreatedByName":"TheNerdMobile","CreatedById":170161,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-06T03:05:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7 hours ago, Probus said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Yeah.

I was using the cost of each item to narrow them down then putting them in separate nodes to isolate which was which. Squad parts just didn\u0027t do that.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E All fixed now.  I am also using [@Galileo](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/150430-galileo/)\u0027s JNSQ with a campaign game to help tweak, balance and verify compatibility.\n\u003E \n\nThanks!
