Thanks for looking in.\n\nI decided to start this thread because it seems that no where I look, I cannot find a standardized and **up-to-date** tutorial or guide to modding KSP. I have modded for Minecraft, Rimworld, and TF2. I wanted to go in depth with KSP and began with what I knew:\n\n- Start with a Blender model at the scale of (1 Blender Unit = 1.25 KSP Units).\n- Add a node\\_collider object to the Blender model\n- Add a .cfg file to where your model is\n\nBam, you are done. I was lied to.\n\n**This topic\u0027s goal is to have the community engage in creating an** ***understandable*** **modding tutorial.** Any help that you can afford and give to this topic will be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks! And happy modding/flights!\n\n-SkyeRangerDelta ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T20:29:17Z","Content":"Good start!\n\nI\u0027d say skip the 1.25 bit--it\u0027s always best to model at the exact size you want, and use rescaleFactor = 1.0, then to have an implicit 1.25x rescale."},{"CreatedByName":"michaelhester07","CreatedById":96470,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T20:55:13Z","Content":"**Tool chains**: If you have your own tools all the better.\n\nModels:\n\nGimp, Blender, Unity 4.2.2 (for animated textures), KSP Part Tools\n\nPlugins:\n\nVisual studio 2013 express for PC (free).

The panel bump and diffuse go together and should be used with the KSP Bumped Diffuse shader. Once you mark the panelbump in unity as a bump map it will show you the final resulting look.\n\nThe best part about these textures is that since you made them you own the rights to em and could sell them. They have nothing to do with Kerbal Space Program or its licensing since you don\u0027t even touch those parts until the final model is done.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T14:24:30Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 02:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by michaelhester07**"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyeRangerDelta","CreatedById":143259,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T15:01:37Z","Content":"**Thanks!**\n\nThis will help me alot.
