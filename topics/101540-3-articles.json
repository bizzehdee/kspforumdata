Aside from the fact that having a powerful 5m LV-30 engine at no research cost could be considered cheating, I think that the tweakscale is a must to reduce memory usage and parts count. I hope tweakscale will be integrated into some offcicial update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGOOD WORK!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pellinor","CreatedById":85299,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T23:23:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Yemo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Yemo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI m wondering if the procedural parts - tweakscale bug is related to those problems.\u003Cp\u003EBasically you take a procedural structural element (or fuel tank or whatever) and attach a part to it, for example the stackQuadCoupler (from one 1.25m node on top to four 1.25m nodes at the bottom). Then you TweakScale the stackQuadCoupler to 2.5m, save the vessel and reload the vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happens now is, that the stackQuadCoupler clipps in the procedural part, as if the original not tweakscaled size was used for positioning the part and only after that the model is upscaled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the stackQuadCoupler is downscaled to 0.625m, it leaves a large gap, instead of clipping into the procedural part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow it gets interesting: When you use the adapterLargeSmallQuad (from one 2.5m node to four 1.25m nodes) instead of the stackQuadCoupler, that issue does not exist. You can rescale the adapterLargeSmallQuad as much as you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe main difference between parts which show that problem and parts which do not show the problem is, that the problematic parts have an offset node_stack_top, while the unproblematic parts do not have an offset node_stack_top definition.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEg\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EstackQuadCoupler: node_stack_top = 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EadapterLargeSmallQuad: node_stack_top = 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice the 0.5 from the stackQuadCoupler. If you change that into 0.0, the node is within the part model, but the attachment bug does not appear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is also the case with all other parts. Those with such an offset have the problem (like basicJetEngine) and those without offset do not show the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso notice, that the problem only exists for the node with which you attach the tweakscaled part to a procedural part (which is usually the node_stack_top).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus attaching procedural parts to tweakscaled parts with offset nodes is no problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m quite convinced that TweakScale did no part moving when I reproduced the bug on loading (in the editor). So my guess is either procedural parts does the faulty moving or the position is already wrong in the craft file. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a quick look at the procedural parts code and found some keeping of offsets that might conceivably get messed up if another mod unexpectedly moves nodes or parts. But that\u0027s just a vague idea at the moment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe strangest thing is that it also affects other nodes, but the error is always the top node offset. So if I put the quad coupler upside down and attach it with a bottom node, I get the same gap between the parts. It looks as if the top (or the first) node is somehow special, which is not apparent from the code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUpdate:\u003C/strong\u003E the bug seems only to happen when loading a craft in the editor. When I reattach the part, save and launch, the position in flight stays correct. So my guess is that there is a translation done if (!flight), that should only be done when modifying some part but not on craft loading. TweakScale already works this way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn procedural parts, the call writeMeshes-\u0026gt;Moveattachments-\u0026gt;forceUpdate-\u0026gt;doTranslation-\u0026gt;target.Translate on craft loadigng seems to do the faulty translation. If I comment out \u0022target.Translate\u0022, the quadCoupler stays in the right place on craft loading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUpdate:\u003C/strong\u003E Created an \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Swamp-Ig/ProceduralParts/issues/118\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eissue\u003C/a\u003E for procedural parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-11T14:16:14Z\u0022 title=\u002204/11/2015 02:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pellinor\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hellion13","CreatedById":66719,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T13:18:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst experience with tweakscale was through an abortive RSS build i was failing at.
