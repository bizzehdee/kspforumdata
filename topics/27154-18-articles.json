SpaceX uses MMH \u002B N2O4 for the Draco thrusters as RCS on the Dragon and upperstage, and then cold nitrogen thrusters as RCS for the first stage. RF doesn\u0027t currently have the option for Nitrogen RCS so I was just using monopropellant. I think RF should allow the tanks to hold RCS fuel though because you can just think of it as a smaller tank/bladder held inside the skin of the main tank. They wouldn\u0027t just slap an external tank on the outside. Currently the tank type is set to Default, what tank types can hold RCS?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Agathorn","CreatedById":99662,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-28T15:25:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHe changed this in the last update:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E*Non-SM, Non-RCS tanks can no longer hold monopropellant.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-28T17:23:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scripto23\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Scripto23\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERF doesn\u0027t currently have the option for Nitrogen RCS so I was just using monopropellant.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe latest version of RF features Nitrogen specifically for cold gas thrusters.
