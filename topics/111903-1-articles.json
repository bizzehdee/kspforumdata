I love both those mods. Incidentally, ORBITEC is trying to establish a standard for spaceship running lights: Aviation-style red/green on the sides, two white strobes at bow-topside, and one amber strobe at stern-bottom.\n\nedit: OP, do you use TweakScale? I also like making smaller versions of the standard lights.

Never heard of TweakScale. Does the drag go down as you decrease the size, so you could put a bunch of them on a ship? Also I\u0027m using Windows 8.1, so does it use much RAM?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-03T23:53:13Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2015 11:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DarkGravity**"},{"CreatedByName":"Beowolf","CreatedById":48927,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T00:40:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So far the only mods I\u0027ve tried are KER and Chatterer.

Most of my lights start life inside fairings, though I do like a \u0022Welcome\u0022 light over capsule hatches.\n\nShouldn\u0027t use much RAM, since it doesn\u0027t add any new parts. It\u0027s the new parts and textures in mods that eat your RAM.
