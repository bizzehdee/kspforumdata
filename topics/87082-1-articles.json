I\u0027m a complete boot when it comes to modding for KSP, so forgive my ignorance. I\u0027m trying to find an external debugger or memory reader for KSP or Unity based games. Essentially, I\u0027m trying to find an external application that allows me to view the memory stack as assets/configs/references are loading when booting KSP, as well as analyzing memory footprint using certain mods. Any ideas? Many thanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
