Mars does as well, however whenever you see blue skies on the *surface* of Mars, that\u0027s because they have been white-balanced so they look like Earth colors so they are more comparable to Earth geology. The skies of Mars are, in fact, orange-brown and not blue (except at sunset and sunrise where it *is* blue, and sometimes when there\u0027s water ice clouds that makes it purple-ish.\n\n[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy_on_Mars#The_color_of_the_sky)"},{"CreatedByName":"Poodmund","CreatedById":128643,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T22:59:56Z","Content":"Curiosity Rover selfies can help visualize how the horizons look from Mars\u0027 surface.\n\n[**Link**](http://dougellison.smugmug.com/Landscapes/Curiosity/i-h8tgjCn/0/X3/sol_613_MAHLI_selfie-X3.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"blackrack","CreatedById":104258,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T23:17:16Z","Content":"Systems with multiple atmospheres visible at the same time are the prettiest\n\n![gtXO0q0.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/gtXO0q0.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"V8jester","CreatedById":136093,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T23:46:10Z","Content":"Oh the potential ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Its really going to be great when we can have multiple planets with scatterer at the same time.

But rather than keeping you all waiting, I thought I might as well release what I have now. As it\u0027s already not too bad. The big feature being multiple planet support.\n\nA few things to keep mind:\n\n-Ground and high orbit both look beautiful but the transition between is ugly and wonky, I\u0027ll work on this.\n\n-No custom textures release at this time, so Kerbin will look more bland than some of the screenshots I showed\n\n-I deleted Jool configs by mistake and I\u0027m too tired to re-do them now, so for now everyone has to make do with the light-blue-green Jool and the blue-green Jool. DO NOT COMPLAIN.\n\n-Duna has some horizon artifacts\n\n-Laythe is reusing Kerbin\u0027s config\n\n-RSS compatibility is dodgy, for some people (including me) it works, for others it doesn\u0027t, it\u0027s something I will fix soon\n\n-The mod should use 300-400mb of RAM and OpenGL but not more, this may be further slimmed down later.\n\n-The mod no longer uses .xml files for the planet settings, instead each planet has it\u0027s own settings in it\u0027s own folder in a settings.cfg file, it now has both the config points and the atmospheric properties settings. The config tool hasn\u0027t been updated for this yet so you may need to copy the relevant values manually if generating new settings\n\n-Affected planets and at which distance they get loaded and unloaded is stored in a new PlanetsList.cfg file\n\n-If generating custom atmos, the extinction shader may break, I wrote on this, some values seem to work fine.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Also, I ran into the bug where the extinction/tint shader wouldn\u0027t work with custom configs, it seems it\u0027s triggered by some atmosphere height values, using the values currently used for Kerbin (Rg = 600000, Rt = 608490.4, RL = 608632, HR = 10, HM = 1.2) and changing the color values works fine which is weird (keep in mind these are\u0027t the default values of the config tool).\n\nI believe this is a problem with the extinction shader so I\u0027ll look into it later.\n\nI will be uploading a build to Kerbalstuff in a few minutes.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-15T20:26:47Z\u0022 title=\u002211/15/2015 08:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by blackrack**"},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-15T20:28:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Is there any way to get rid of the \u0022banding\u0022 that occurs at certain altitudes?\n\nLooks like my question got lost in the cogs somewhere."},{"CreatedByName":"blackrack","CreatedById":104258,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-15T20:30:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Looks like my question got lost in the cogs somewhere.\n\nFor now, no.
