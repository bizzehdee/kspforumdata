A KSP dream. On Laythe, there were statues. Each depicted a Kerbal, dressed in Royal garments. There was a king, a queen, and some Dukes and Duchesses in one cluster. And, about 70 metres away, one statue of a Kerbal princess, all alone. I interpreted this, as a Royal Kerbal family were very annoyed when their daughter left them to marry a commoner (Jeb, maybe?). So they sent her out, and killed the commoner. The land of the area was odd as well, as it was a river, the Royal family on one side, and the princess on the other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: This could be an Easter egg.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-20T15:51:11Z\u0022 title=\u002201/20/2014 03:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Rainbowtrout\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tery215","CreatedById":89094,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-20T12:38:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDressing Kerbals in-game would be a very limited feature, you could only do it inside spacecraft and at Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(a specific science report says that the atmosphere of Laythe is toxic)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rainbowtrout","CreatedById":60253,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-20T13:52:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Estatues\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, maybe they took the statues from Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
