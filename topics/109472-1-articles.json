Ie. not supporting this tree structure etc. when making rockets, rocket-mosh-party at the end is more than anoying.\n\nI saw problems but not like you are seeing.\n\nThis may help you:\n\nThese are what I try to control speed (by grading I mean speed increases constantly with altitude no Oh gee im at 10001 meter let me push this thing up to 260 m/s.\n\n1 to 1000 meters = 100 m/s\n\n1000 to 5000 meters = 100 to 160 m/s respectively and graded (85\u0027)\n\n5000 to 10000 meters = 160 to 220 m/s respectively and graded (80\u0027)\n\n10000 to 15000 meters = 220 to 260 m/s .........(75\u0027)\n\nAfter 15000 usually at maximum throttle, and 2\u0027 per 1000 feet. \n\nSFRBs\n\n The SFRBs have changed markedly. Some may be too powerful and tip the rocket over as they loose fuel. The output thrust of the SFRBs can be reduced and burn times increased in the VAB.\n\n To prevent over throttling use a combination of SFRBs and LfOX engines and down throttle the LfOX engines and SFRBs reach the end of their fuel.\n\n Tall SFRBs need winglets\n\nMy experience.\n\nI built a simple 600L (aerodynamic) rocket tank last night in Blender and unified it into the game. put a LV909 on it and a tuned down half-height SFRB with no fins an put it into space on its maiden flight. (didn\u0027t even tamper with the drag parameters in the cfg). So basically the game is not hideous. When 1 if first came out and I did not realize they have changed RT-10 and BACC I ran into tipover problems, but quite honestly I had bigger tip-over problem with 0.18 to 0.22 so . . . . . . I built a BACC with very low drag and it always tipped over. The reason is that as it runs out of fuel all the drag and weight are at the top of the vehicle, this stuff all wants to be close to the ground. So now if you have a booster, it has only drag from its side (minimal) and from the flange around the nozzle. The drag is all at the front of the rocket, and yes this is a problem in RL two, watch some of the german ro\n\nOh and I don\u0027t use FAR or NEAR, Mech Jeb is my only vice, other than a few tank mods and my own creations."},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T14:11:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 1 to 1000 meters = 100 m/s\n\u003E 1000 to 5000 meters = 100 to 160 m/s respectively and graded (85\u0027)\n\u003E \n\u003E 5000 to 10000 meters = 160 to 220 m/s respectively and graded (80\u0027)\n\u003E \n\u003E 10000 to 15000 meters = 220 to 260 m/s .........(75\u0027)\n\u003E \n\u003E After 15000 usually at maximum throttle, and 2\u0027 per 1000 feet.\n\nThat\u0027s not really necessary anymore. Using a reasonable start T/W ratio (~1.6 atmo to 2 usually goes well), start a very early turn (it\u0027s viable to go 85\u0027 at 1km), and otherwise keep the rocket locked to the apoapsis. You should start youir gravity relatively early and then just keep the rocket inside the airstream to lower drag. With a well build rocket and a good flight path terminal velocity is so high you don\u0027t need to slow down.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T14:17:41Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 02:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Temeter**"},{"CreatedByName":"Linear","CreatedById":26619,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T14:42:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This moment when some people realize game is actually easier with FAR than stock.\n\nYeah, FAR got a large stigma for being hard.
