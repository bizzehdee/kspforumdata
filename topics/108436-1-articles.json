Using both can lead to mystirious behaviour! You can however use the parts that are not included!\n\n**Why a fork and not just update the Monkey parts?**\n\n I don\u0027t use all of his parts, so I only made an update of those I use.\n\n In the process of updating it became clear that some things needed to be changed completely to work with 1.02 or because i wanted it different, so a fork seemed in order.\n\n **No pics no clicks?**\n\nThere you go!\n\n![bMQ4E8d.png](https://i.imgur.com/bMQ4E8d.png)\n\n**Where to get it?**\n\n Version: 1.0.2\n\nKerbalstuff: [https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/772/ORION%2C%20Monkey%20Business%20Inc.%20Parts](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/772/ORION%2C%20Monkey%20Business%20Inc.%20Parts)\n\n**OK,OK but why???, what can i actually build with them?**\n\nHow about a satellite with integrated return stage with not a trillion of tanks attached to go to the mun or beyond...\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
