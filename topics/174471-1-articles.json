After that I would reopen ksp and most of the time It worked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRecently I accidentally uninstalled all mods that use module manager, and I had to tediously go through my mods and re download what I could remember. After getting fresh installs for most of my mods and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E saying I had 8 less than before (45 to 37, not sure what the 8 are) I figured ksp might run better. Quite the opposite happened, now every time I try to load any save ksp stops responding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is easy for me to recreate, ksp 64 bit works fine loading, the menu works, I can delete and create saves. But once I try to load a save, it starts to, then the loading icon in the bottom right freezes and so does ksp. 32 bit does not work, I\u0027m assuming my mods are over the memory limit. I tried to isolate the problem to a specific mod, but it seems almost random. Eventually after splitting the mod list in half again and again\u00A0I could get it to a point where I had multiple different mod groups that worked fine, but together they won\u0027t. I tried my best to find where two or more mods are conflicting but was unable to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is the log after I created a new career game, then tried to load it:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/0o9oyb1nkxs4lp6/output_log.txt?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/0o9oyb1nkxs4lp6/output_log.txt?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
