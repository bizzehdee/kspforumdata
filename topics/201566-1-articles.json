(I tried google but I could only find\u00A0the Saturn V\u0027s very very outdated\u00A0analog computer inside a ring like housing).\u003Cbr\u003E\nShould I allocate the flight computer parts\u00A0inside the forward skirt of the upper stage? Or, inside the fairings just below the Payload Attach Fitting and why ?\u003Cbr\u003E\nDo rocket upper stages have feed lines and do they also house and connect wires and other equipment or do they just act as feed lines for oxidizer/fuel ?\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn KSP we have decouplers to separate different stages. Do interstages act as decouplers/separation system ? I mean do they separate the stages like the way decouplers in KSP do or do they just serve as Structural Support and housing for the upper stage ?\u00A0 Also, are interstages made of composite or aluminium ?\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhy are Payload Attach Fittings shaped like conical shells and are Payload Fairings attached to the PAF or is there another mechanical deployment\u00A0mechanism they are attached to ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese are overviews of the cryogenic upperstage project I am working on. It currently has the Payload Fairing and the payload attach fitting and the tank is a 5.6m tall tank. The current configuration has the flight computer sitting just below the PAF and the flight computer is slightly raised by a spacer so it doesn\u0027t clip with the payload fairings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext step of the project will be adding an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E module integrated with monoprop tanks at the aft section of the upper stage tank for attitude control.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI currently am UV mapping the parts that are ready for texturing but I am still learning how to texture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002251105085053_a5c70c19c9_b.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51105085053_a5c70c19c9_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u002251104852441_68219d2613_b.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51104852441_68219d2613_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
