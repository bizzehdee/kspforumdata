So leave links to the KSP website and anything that\\\u0027s not your work.\n\nFrom a legal side it\\\u0027s kind of a grey area. A lot of people have monitize \\\u0027let\\\u0027s plays\\\u0027 and have earned a living off it, but that\\\u0027s normally a deal with YouTube and the Let\\\u0027s player. Firstly you have to have enough views to make it worth while. Youtube won\\\u0027t even consider it unless you have the numbers under your belt. \n\nFrom a developers perspective, it\\\u0027s more like free advertising. Do be warned though, it\\\u0027s never happened from memory but developers and publishers do have the right to send cease and desist orders, so don\\\u0027t be a jerk about it.\n\nAlso the most popular \\\u0027let\\\u0027s player\\\u0027s play a wide variety of games. Their options, views, and personality are the content, not necessarily the game they play. YouTube won\\\u0027t give you a cent if it\\\u0027s just game play with music over the top.\n\nHave a look at Youtubes partners program here to learn more about it.\n\n[http://www.youtube.com/yt/creators/partner.html](https://www.youtube.com/yt/creators/partner.html)\n\nWhat will get you into trouble however is selling merchandise with copyrighted material you don\\\u0027t own.

This only applies if you are in the US.\n\nI find the [Stanford University guidelines](http://fairuse.stanford.edu/Copyright_and_Fair_Use_Overview/chapter9/9-b.html) very useful, although there are many others. Fair Use law in the US is purposefully vague. \n\nFactor 1: Purpose and Character\n\nSimply by playing the game and demonstrating its content, you have not transformed or added to the original work in a significant way. Adding commentary and instructional content that uses the gameplay video as a reference rather than the core of what you are presenting will strengthen your argument for use of the game content.\n\n Factor 2: Nature of the Copyrighted Work\n\nIt\\\u0027s an actively published work. No question about it.\n\nFactor 3: Amount and Substantiality\n\nAnything worth making a Youtube video about is a substantial portion of the copyrighted work. It also qualifies as \u0027the heart of the work\u0027 if it\\\u0027s a core component of the game (in a sandbox game like KSP, I would qualify most gameplay video that would draw large numbers of viewers under this category.)\n\nFactor 4: Market Effect\n\nYour videos do not diminish the saleability of KSP -- in fact, they probably increase it -- This factor is not much of a concern for your videos.\n\nIn conclusion, you achieve 2 of 4 fair use criteria. This means that a fair use defense of content is questionable and would almost certainly result in a court hearing if you were sued under US law. Unless you solidly meet all 4 fair use criteria or solidly meet 3 and believe that you satisfy the fourth in good faith, I recommend seeking permission of the copyright holder before using any content under the auspices of fair use law."},{"CreatedByName":"illectro","CreatedById":763,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-25T14:44:28Z","Content":"As someone who\\\u0027s been making KSP Youtube videos for almost a year ([http://www.youtube.com/user/szyzyg?feature=mhee](https://www.youtube.com/user/szyzyg?feature=mhee) ) here\\\u0027s my experience.\n\nThe EULA posted in public does not give people permission to monetize, however depending on the content, and the reviewer sometimes videos are approved for revenue share, and other times they are removed, getting too many removed from rev share will make future videos harder to monetize since the number of rejections is weighed when they review it.\n\nSo I\\\u0027d establish a decent catalog of good videos without rev share and then contact Squad directly for permission."},{"CreatedByName":"DrBurst","CreatedById":22302,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-26T00:45:17Z","Content":"What about asking for donations?"}]}
