I just felt that the restriction would ensure that we get people who have been active on YouTube for a little while, and so they\u0027ve gotten the hang of making good content (audio/video quality, commentary, etc.) You\u0027re right, though, it would be kind of hypocritical to set that standard when a bunch of the people already involved are under 100 subs. Especially since most of the submissions have been pretty cool.

I don\u0027t mind switching people around in the order if they have their module ready, but without it I think it\u0027d just get messy. With a smaller group we\u0027d be able to do away with the build order, since we can figure out exactly who\u0027s building what in a relatively short amount of time. This way we\u0027d have everyone building modules that complement each other, rather than a bunch of useless and/or similar ones. With a bigger group, though, I feel like it\u0027s necessary to maintain some order. Can you imagine if we had all the people involved upload everything within, say, a week of the project phase starting?
