The solar panel end is made so that I can continue adding power modules to the end. The center hub has two more docking ports besides the senior. The arms on the dock end have lights. It pretty much floods whatever is in the bay. I was going to try to make long arms that extend length-wise along whatever is in the bay, but they proved impossible to dock, so I opted for this.
