I know what you mean with the sensors array. I never played a lot of Multiplayer in the original (only the occasional LAN battle) so I\u0027m not sure how the sensors array work in it corresponding to remastered. In remastered, sensor arrays only work so long as you have a mothership. If the enemy destroys your mothership and hides while he still has a mothership and his \u003Cem\u003Eown\u003C/em\u003E sensors array, he can warp around just outside your FOV and hide for literally hours. Even if you \u0027ve destroyed literally all of his ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat design of hyperspace does sound really fun \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. I know why the kept it the way it is though. If it was like this in HW1 and HW2, the remastered game should have it too. And I agree. Though it could and probably would be funner with that style of warp, this version has its merits.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T14:33:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECustom maps in the original multiplayer were awesome.... You could have players start with a kadesh mothership or a turanic carrier as their mothership - fully functional as far as being able to construct ships* and dock and refuel fighters. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The ships it could construct were the standard ships a player could construct, starting with a Kadesh mothership didn\u0027t allow you to build swarmers or MultiBeam Firgates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was some bug where resource collectors could only use a docking port once to drop of resources, and then would just sit by the ship, waiting, so the work around was to give each player a resource controller ship, and make sure players used that instead of the mothership as the drop off point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot exactly what you\u0027d use for a ladder game... but it was fun to have a 4 player game, 1 player starts with Turanic ships, 1 with kadesh ships, 1 with taiidan, 1 with Kushan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo further add to that variation, I liked to make maps where a player had a sizeable compliment of interceptors with the property assigned to them that hides them from long range sensors.... so you could use them to attack an enemy resource operation by surprise much earlier than one could field cloaked fighters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also liked huge maps that made hyperspace jumps really required (like so huge a scout would run out of fuel crossing between resource spots)... and starting the motherships in one area, with carriers at other resource spots, the intention being that the carriers skirmish first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for ORB that I mentioned, the ship AI needed some work, the first few versions lacked some really basic functionlity for team play.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) The travelling vs combat formation thing was nice in theory, but when you want to retread, it was stupidly painfull watching your ships try to form up in one big travelling formation. There was no UI to set formation size, so you\u0027d need extreme micro, or you could edit a file (without breaking MP compatiblity) to get your ships to form formations of a certain size... which I did so I didn\u0027t have my ships trying to form into formations of 20 before moving in/out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat editing a formation size file was needed, and gave a gameplay advantage, was poor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was more to the ship AI that was bad... but that was one of the worst aspects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Allied players ships still collided as if they were ramming enemies.... allies sending resource freighters to the same asteroid base resulted in the exiting ships colliding with the entering ones, and trying to harvest the same asteroid as your ally just resulting in massive collissions that cripple your fleet\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was fixed... but damage to the multiplayer aspect was done, multiplayer was crippled by low numbers of people playing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) No team-chat... seriously.... ......\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you wanted to discuss strategy with your ally in private... or anyone (such as in an FFA game) you had to do the ridiculous work around of using your ability to rename a ship.... you basically make your ship name a sentence, and tell the intended recipient to read it... so of course, you have to make sure only your intended recipient is within sight radius of your ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) That ship renaming.... cool but also exploitable. Sure it was nice to give your capital ships (of which you couldn\u0027t produce nearly as many as in HW) a unique name.... but when you start renaming soe of your interceptors as Interceptor:T (the variant packing powerful anticaptial ship torpedoes)... and the only way the enemy can distinguish is to focus the camera on the individual interceptors (the icons were the same, though the 3d models were different, and actually allowed you to visually see how many torpedoes a fighter had remaining), I think there\u0027s a bit of a problem... they should have had a seperate way of displaying ship class, and ship name.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t mind it so much as when used with capital ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI once came across an Alyssian Unarmed Carrier (default name: Triumph) with my first Malus Destroyer... but the player renamed it as \u0022Glory\u0022 (the default name for the Alyssian armed carrier, which had double the EHP, and nearly double the DPS of a destroyer, on top of being able to just ram it and survive with minimal damage)...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI initially retreated... I thought i was ahead of him in reseach and economy... maybe was he rushing a carrier and thats why he couldn\u0027t put up much of a fight for the center spot... but then thought... wait a minute... the icon isn\u0027t showing a shield bar... and there\u0027s no way he could have a carrier at this time even if he was rushing one (if it was my 2nd or 3rd destroyer out, I might have believed it).... zoomed in on the carrier... it lacks the weapon turrets and additional plating of the armed varient... ahahah, clever... but I\u0027m still going to attack...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt did buy him maybe 15 seconds....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn for my part, with the hyperspace capable ships. You couldn\u0027t just upgrade existing capital ships to jump drives, you had to build entirely new ones. So you could harrass with them, but were typically stuck to a slow frontal attack assuming that you had a sizeable fleet before getting hyperspace tech (at least until attrition \u002B expansion results in your fleet becoming mainly hyperspace capable).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I didn\u0027t want to harass with a lone destroyer... particularly as it couldn\u0027t jump again for a while, and the enemy may have fighters packing torpedoes by then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027d just troll with my first hyperspace capable ship or two.... start to open a portal as if I was going to attack... and cancel before the ship jumps... wait for the recharge, do it again.... and repeat until I actually made it a real attack. (and if they fell for the tricks earlier, I could have attacked elsewhere with my main non-jump capable fleet and thus the enemy fleet would lack fighter cover)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also liked the active/passive sensor system, where you could power down ships to hide them from the longer ranged passive sensors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ability to capture enemy ships and use them to advance your technology or unlock a ship your race normally couldn\u0027t build was also nice. Malus had the Interceptor:T variant (which required \u0022antimatter torpedoes\u0022 research), and the anti-matter torpedo heavy fighters (in addition to the normal torpedoes of a lower tech level), Alyssian had only the normal torpedo heavy fighters. But if the alyssians captured a malus ship with antimatter torpedoes, they could build the alyssian inteceptor variant, and the heavy fighter variant with higher damage torpedoes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELikewise, the Malus could capture an Alyssian cloaking ship, and then make their own cloaking ships....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToo bad that the cloaking devices were pretty much worthless. They didn\u0027t last long, could only be activated with a full charge (like the hyperdrives), were mutually exclusive with hyperdrives (no jump capable cloaking capitals - except the storyline Aldar ships), and ships couldn\u0027t fire while cloaked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cloak barely lasted long enough for your ships to get out of active sensor range and then power down to hide from passive sensors... and not even that long if they spent half their cloak time just getting into a 20 ship travelling formation.... junk. Nothing like the awesomesauce of HW\u0027s cloaked fighters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the Alyssian destroyers were pretty much inferior to the malus ones. Malus destroyers could get all 4 beams on target relatively quickly in pretty much any scenario.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlyssian ones could only fire 2 turrets at a ship above them... and the capitals always stayed \u0022level\u0022 (its space.. with... pitch up!) to an arbitrary plane. So if a malus destroyer attacked from above, it would handily defeat an alyssian one... and the game was ussually decided around when the first destroyers were on the field.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere were some mitigating factors... a Malus carrier could only get 3 of its 6 beams on a single target, but an Alyssian one could get 4 of its 5 beams on a single target... if the target was above it... so the alyssian destroyers should attack from above, and their carriers from below.... *ugh*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMalus got capital killing torpedo fighters, alyssians got worthless cloaks and ships with tactical achilles heels...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf an alyssian payer survived long enough.. the top tier tech upgrades did get them 20% higher shield regeneration, which would make the difference in an even capital 1v1, and their fighters would be superior with a 20% ROF upgrade and a 25% missile damge upggrade....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if they survived long enough for the high tier assault carriers to come out.... for some reason, a Malus assault carrier always won a ram against the alyssian one with most of its armor remaining... so... yea... poor balance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, HW was much better gameplay... but if I were a game designer, I would have incorporated aspects of ORB into a HW sequal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo some extent they sort of did... they replaed the salvage corvette with the marine/infiltrator frigates of HW 2.... the boarding pods of the vaygr one are particularly reminiscent of the way you could capture enemy ships in ORB (not that its a particularly original concept to have space commandos...)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-04T14:42:53Z\u0022 title=\u002203/04/2015 02:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KerikBalm\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
