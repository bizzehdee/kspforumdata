I managed to do something and lower it enough so I could get a normal orbit around the moon, but the thing is, all of this was on my first stage. Normally, I would\u0027ve been using my nuclear engines by now. I ignored it, and eventually was about to land on the moon before I had a chance to use my middle stage. So, I decoupled everything and started the landing process. When I was about to land, my moon lander went through the ground. I thrusted up and it went through the ground again, I tried to land again but the same thing happened. Eventually, I just gave up and let my moon lander drift through the mun\u0027s ground and then explode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no mods installed, either.
