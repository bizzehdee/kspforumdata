Would say, depends a lot on what you like to have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, mod manager. My suggestion is to go with KSP Mod Admin (if you use windows).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReality mods: sure you should look at Realism Overhaul, or to begin with RSS. Very tough, however. I like to use other mods that enhance specific aspects and bring variety to the stock game (yes, \u0022stuff to do\u0022). My list of mods that can\u0027t miss include FAR, DRE, RT2, TAC LS, SCANsat, MCE. For stuff, I like L-tech, Cacteye, Kethane, Interstellar, Extraplanetary Launchpads. Plus a lot more just to add beauty or features.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the above mods and those I forgot (sorry, I use so many I can\u0027t really list them all) are listed here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55401-Community-Mods-and-Plugins-Library\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55401-Community-Mods-and-Plugins-Library\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus, a suggestion: try one mod at a time, getting all at once is overwhelming. And, if something is wrong with your way of installing mods, you will not have a hard time to discover which mod it was causing trouble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuggy mods: please note each mod was delivered for a specific KSP version and developed without full knowledge of possible incompatibilities with other mods. Issues may always be found, when using a different KSP version or a combination of mods different than the ones already tested. Wouldn\u0027t call those bugs, however. If you stick to using mods tested for the version of the game you have, you will avoid a lot of issues, and the few that still may emerge will probably be already debated in the respective threads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal frontier: would say yes, best use it with a new game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-09T17:28:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDeadly Re-entry is a must for realism.

Unless something has changed in the last week or so, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s being actively supported. I\u0027d hold off until it\u0027s support gets a bit more solid. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also love TAC-LS, a life support mod.

Go futuristic, ie. do stuff that has not yet been achieved by us humans: Interstellar mod, Modular Kolonization System, Kethane, Porkwork\u0027s Habitat pack, Extraplanetary Launchpads, LackLuster Labs, Near Future packs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Go for moderate realism: Ferram Aerospace Research, Deadly Reantry, Real Chutes, TAC life support. Since FAR changes the way the game is played (realistic aerodynamics mean that asparagus-staging no longer works and you need to build tall, aerodynamic rockets like in real life), you need Procedural Fairings and KW Rocketry and/or NovaPunch with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Go for full realism: Realism Overhaul. Makes everything real-size (stock Kerbin is smaller than real-life moon) and therefore much harder. Very nice to have, but also very challenging and pretty tough to get to install properly. There are part packs such as FASA which let you recreate real-world space programs if you are into history.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings that are overall useful in any case (mostly utilities): Kerbal Engineer Redux, Floor It, Procedural Parts, Crew Manifest, Kerbal Attachment System, Kerbal Alarm Clock\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are also some part packs for building space shuttles (B9 aerospace, Kerbal Shuttle Orbiter) and space stations (Fustek, Kosmos)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Edit:] I second diomedea\u0027s suggestion to avoid adding too many mods at once. Do it gradually to get used to what they offer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, a suggested solution for major game-changing mods (like the Realism Overhaul, and to a lesser degree FAR): You can maintain two separate installations of KSP, with different sets of mods (or one with mods, and another without any of them, as you please). Personally I have two installations of KSP, one combining approaches #1 and #2 above, and another for Realism Overhaul.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-10T16:17:27Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2014 04:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Hattivat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
