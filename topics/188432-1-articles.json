I couldn\u0027t see any proper antimatter fuel tanks or anything close to that matter. AS a result,\u00A0became impossible for me to make any warp ships with sufficient power. I have no idea what is happening, and I have re-installed the mod a few times. This issue\u00A0of missing parts also resonates with a Jump Beacon mod located\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/82612-104-esld-jump-beacons-dev-06a/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.
