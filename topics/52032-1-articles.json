For example, I\u0027ve seen that the estimated dV to return from the Mun is 1km/s, but this is assuming an equatorial landing, correct? The idea being that from the equator you can burn nearly directly retrograde to the Mun\u0027s orbit for a minimum-dV return. From a higher (or lower) latitude though you can\u0027t because you are correcting for the inclined launch site (at least you are if you burn directly east or west from your landing site). So here\u0027s a question: is there a direction you can burn from a high/low latitude LZ that still takes roughly 1km/s dV to return to Kerbin?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEssentially, imagine that Jeb is (hypothetically, of course) landed on the Mun in a crater at approximately 45deg N latitude with just about 1km/s left in his lander. Burning due east would place him on an inclined orbit that does not apply all the thrust retrograde to his Kerbin-relative velocity. Should he instead burn to the south-east to correct for the inclination, or would that waste more dV on the inclination change than you pick up by applying the remaining thrust along the proper vector?

With equatorial orbit, you can burn for Kerbin with minimum dv anytime. With inclined orbit, you can do such burn only when part of that orbit is parallel to the mun\u0027s orbit, i.e. two times per mun\u0027s orbit around Kerbin (and you\u0027re exiting along this parallel part).

The MINIMUM inclination is the latitude of your starting position and you can make this rather worse if you try hard enough. The higher your inclination, the more delta-V it takes to get back into the equatorial plane, so it\u0027s usually best not to mess with this until you\u0027re in space. So just take off heading east, which will give you close to the minimum inclination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, usually it\u0027s no problem coming home from Mun from even landing on Mun\u0027s south pole. Sure, it takes a bit more delta-V to achieve Munar orbit because you don\u0027t have the rotation helping, but it\u0027s not enough to make a difference. Nor does this make an appreciable difference in getting back to Kerbin. Just burn prograde on the side of your orbit facing Kerbin until you get Munar escape and find yourself in a huge ellipse cocked at some crazy angle to Mun\u0027s orbit. All you have to do now is drop your Pe to about 30km in Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere and you\u0027re guaranteed to land. And you do this with a retrograde burn at your Ap. Because the Ap is out as far as Mun, this usually takes only a dozen or 2 m/s. And that\u0027s all the burning you need to do. It might take you 3 or 4 days to get home but you sure don\u0027t need much fuel to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if you want/need to get back into an equatorial orbit after an inclined launch, that\u0027s going to cost you delta-V. It\u0027s best to do plane changes as far from the planet as possible, but pushing your Ap out there also costs delta-V so it\u0027s something of a wash. Thus, if you\u0027re going to land at high latitudes and need to get equatorial again, you need to plan for this and pack some extra fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: When transferring anywhere, it\u0027s very easy to change your inclination for very little delta-V either just before or right after the SOI change as you approach the target. You\u0027re way far from the planet so it usually takes less than 10m/s to give you any inclination you want. So, let\u0027s have no more accidental landings at high latitudes \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alistone","CreatedById":60032,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-05T23:47:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only additional deltaV added is from the slower \u0022rotational speed\u0022 of the surface you are on.

There are two points where it intersects Mun\u0027s surface. You want to lift off directly to/away from this point, i.e. establish an orbit which will go above both these points. You don\u0027t need to care about your inclination. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEstablish an orbit and place a maneuver which will lead you to escape Mun\u0027s SOI. You want this escape to be against the Mun\u0027s orbital velocity and to be parallel with Mun\u0027s orbit at the place where it escapes the SOI. There you can adjust your burn to already lead to Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. While adjusting you need to move the maneuver along the orbit to keep the escape parallel because the angle by which Mun\u0027s gravity will deflect you will depend on the amount of delta-v you apply. Notice that if you do it right, the orbit around Kerbin will be only very little inclined, the inclination will not be given by delta-v you applied but only by your offset above/below Mun\u0027s orbital plane where you exit its SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-06T00:25:53Z\u0022 title=\u002211/06/2013 12:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Kasuha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jsfalconero","CreatedById":89120,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T04:00:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBlast!
