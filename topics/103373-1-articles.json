Whenever I attach an engine in the VAB or the SPH they fire constantly. It just started happening. I think it started when I added a Sub Assembly to a build and now it happens for everything! In addition to this, the engine doesnt appear in the Staging on the right. I have to wait until launch to sort out the staging.
