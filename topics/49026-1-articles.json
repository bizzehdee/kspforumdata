I got the Kethane pack about a month ago and had to ask the exact same question. When you click on it in the VAB, it\u0027s description is rather vague. Anyways, I had to try it (purely in the name of \u0027science\u0027). I put one on the back side of pod with a ladder ,so the poor kerbal can get close to it. (make sure you have an empty kethane tank). I put it on the launch pad, EVA\u0027d the kerbal, (I think it was Bill) Had him climb the stairway to Kerbal heaven, right clicked on the \u0027Waitnonostop\u0027. I then clicked on the only option it gives you, BLEND and to my horror Bill disappeared in a cloud of smoke!
