To save the RAM of course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few days back, I was getting MAD crashes, mainly in the VAB, but also in-flight. I have a LOT of mods, so I wasn\u2019t too chagrined, but it seemed to be getting worse, so I did some digging through my output.log.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere were some nullreferenceexceptions and some other erros, mainly only of a couple of types it seemed. I don\u2019t know emough about these things to be able to identify any mod-related issues from what I saw. But I did see \u201Csteam\u201D appear a few times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I thought \u201CIs KSP looking for some handle or other from the steam program, and not finding it, getting upset?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I now start KSP via steam, and for the last couple of day have had ZERO
