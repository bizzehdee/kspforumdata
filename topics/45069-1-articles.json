More lift is indeed what a plane sticking to the runway needs however the runway is a special case. With an angle of attack of zero the wings generate absolutely no lift at all. Whats worse is that if there is a fractional downward angle, say by the front landing gear being slightly higher (even a miniscule ammount) which causes the nose to point down, then you end up generating lift INTO the runway (counter intuitively, but think about when you point the nose down mid flight, or perhaps roll 180 degrees whilst pointing up, the effect is the same conceptually). The solution is either more control surfaces, which on command input will generate a large Torque in the right direction, or to angle the wings upwards slightly using alt\u002BWASD, which assures the wings are in fact generating lift upwards. Adding more wings naievely without adjusting the angle of attack will not affect a solution and in some circumstances may make the problem worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you fall off the end of the runway the torque allows the wings to point upwards and they suddenly generate lift, which is why the plane suddenly flies perfectly. With smaller aircraft the problem isn\u0027t noticeable because the control surfaces induce a very large torque relative to the mass so you can pitch up easily, then generate lift off the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BubbaWilkins","CreatedById":57993,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-06T19:14:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EChevron covered most of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if it flies at all, then the first and foremost issue is landing gear placement. Your rear landing gear need to be near/slightly behind the CoM. This allows them to serve as a pivot/leverage point for your control surfaces to push the nose into the air. With the gear configured in the images, all your control surfaces are doing are pushing the landing gear into the ground harder.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-07T00:36:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESeems like Id have to start over again mostly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt flew once, with all engines full on the runway to gain enough speed and youre right, it only took off as the runway ended.
