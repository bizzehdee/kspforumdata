Once there, you fire a kind of harpoon drill at the lunar surface, which burrows and anchors itself into the rock. A thin fiber (something like dental floss, just a more sturdy material) connects the harpoon anchor to the L1 point station. Then, you attach the spent rocket stage to another such tether and carefully extend it back towards earth, a whole long way. More than half the way between L1 and Earth, in fact. Once there it becomes the counterweight, and Earth\u0027s gravity keeps the tethers straight. Because the Moon is tidally locked to the Earth, there is no rotation, and simple tether tension keeps the L1 station perfectly in place without a need for stationkeeping. From then on, you can deliver further construction materials to the L1 station. Tiny robots would crawl along the tether and draw additional fibers, one after another, to reinforce the tether. Once this has been done enough between L1 and lunar surface, you can start transporting cargo up and down, reinforcing the ground anchor and construct a base around it. The L1 station itself could be expanded into a whole spaceport with fuel depot and maybe even a permanent crewing. Virtually the only downside to this plan is the fact that the ground station can only be placed directly below Earth/Moon L1, not anywhere else on the lunar surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe guy started a company to make this concept a reality, but unfortunately it\u0027s been bumbling around for a while without any real progress being made.
