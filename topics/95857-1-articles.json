If you may not already know, these are the quests where you must test a part while in orbit and within the Apsis numbers listed. For example: Test this Decoupler in Kerbin orbit. 81-112 km. I have entered orbit and I always activate the part while within the range of the apsis conditions, yet they never complete. Is the range strictly saying \u0022these numbers must be the apoapsis and periapsis?\u0022 They are not worded as such, and the new satellite positioning quest do explicitly say those are the ranges you need, and i always fulfil those, but not the test in orbit quests. What is it I am doing wrong or missing?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-06T19:49:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou must be at an altitude between those two numbers, also, are you activating the part through staging, or by right clicking and run test?
