I realized that I needed some first link from the Command Center. So I had to use a manned ship to take up the first satellite. No problem. But not understanding and getting my head around what RemoteTech mod was doing made it a little confusing. After a while and through some experimenting, I finally got my head around the gist of it all and think it\u0027s a pretty nice system. I would have thought though that the dipole antenna would transmit further than only a million meters. A dipole is actually pretty sensitive for longer wave signals if you take into consideration of metal structures that can throw off the SWRs and whatnot. The long whip can reach 8 million, so the dipole should probably reach about half that. Depending on the frequency used. And since the dipole is smaller it must be using a higher frequency and therefore would punch through the ionosphere better. But hey, I\u0027m rambling again. Point is, these things make it a little frustrating for the newbie, but their function is definitely worth the learning curve.

I put all those in storage about 20 years ago. I\u0027m just remembering from my old HAM days. Some of the basic things are a little hard to forget. I think you have the antennas feel pretty good, but the dipole, in my mind is set a bit weak. And whips wouldn\u0027t catch much air to break them off but will burn off real fast in a re-entry type situation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d doubt the game engine is going to allow you to mimic real antennas and radio propagation much. Nor simulate ionosphere reflection for lower frequencies. Basically, a whip antenna for space travel, let\u0027s assume you want a full wave antenna (highest frequency possible for a given length antenna), and based on the appearing length of the whip, I\u0027d say you are at about 90MHz. Well into the FM band of common radio. So you wouldn\u0027t have ionosphere bounce and reflection problems at that frequency. To receive any good signal from say the Moon\u0027s distance, you\u0027d need a good \u0022Moon Raker\u0022 antenna (one with many direction focusing elements, sort of like a large TV antenna but with vertical and horizontal elements). You\u0027d need about 500 to 1000 watts for HAM operator type transmissions or maybe about 100 watts for NASA and super sensitive and tuned equipment. That is if you using a 90MHz transmission for the long whip. Higher frequencies (the kind reflectors and dishes use) can use way less power because the energy is focused more. But in the game (RT mod), you have more power being used for bigger dishes and to get further. This is common misconception about radio. To transmit, you need power but it can come from a small antenna. Even the smallest dish can transmit across the solar system given enough power. Probably about 200 watts at 10Ghz. But to receive from long distances, you do need large dishes. The large reflector is like a large magnifying lense for radio waves. You have to gather more of that energy to focus it onto a small little wire inside the feed horn. The bigger the dish, the more energy you collect (provided it\u0027s shaped right).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get more immersive on RT, we need movable and tracking antennas. I know, that\u0027s probably not an easy thing to do. But it\u0027s something that would bring out the coolness of RT. And the dishes, should have at least point in the direction of where you want to communicate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that is the maker of RemoteTech to do most of that. But as far as RO is concerned, If it were up to me, I\u0027d just make the dipole go about 4 million meters and make the dipole and the whips stick a little better to their mounting, but weaken the heat factor perhaps. (I have not tried a re-entry on any of these yet, so I don\u0027t know if they burn up too quick or not at all)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-18T12:16:01Z\u0022 title=\u002208/18/2014 12:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Bothersome\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shurikeeen","CreatedById":114554,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-18T13:46:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy I need ~4000 m/s delta-v to get 100x100km orbit around Kerbin?

I put all those in storage about 20 years ago. I\u0027m just remembering from my old HAM days. Some of the basic things are a little hard to forget. I think you have the antennas feel pretty good, but the dipole, in my mind is set a bit weak. And whips wouldn\u0027t catch much air to break them off but will burn off real fast in a re-entry type situation.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d doubt the game engine is going to allow you to mimic real antennas and radio propagation much. Nor simulate ionosphere reflection for lower frequencies. Basically, a whip antenna for space travel, let\u0027s assume you want a full wave antenna (highest frequency possible for a given length antenna), and based on the appearing length of the whip, I\u0027d say you are at about 90MHz. Well into the FM band of common radio. So you wouldn\u0027t have ionosphere bounce and reflection problems at that frequency. To receive any good signal from say the Moon\u0027s distance, you\u0027d need a good \u0022Moon Raker\u0022 antenna (one with many direction focusing elements, sort of like a large TV antenna but with vertical and horizontal elements). You\u0027d need about 500 to 1000 watts for HAM operator type transmissions or maybe about 100 watts for NASA and super sensitive and tuned equipment. That is if you using a 90MHz transmission for the long whip. Higher frequencies (the kind reflectors and dishes use) can use way less power because the energy is focused more. But in the game (RT mod), you have more power being used for bigger dishes and to get further. This is common misconception about radio. To transmit, you need power but it can come from a small antenna. Even the smallest dish can transmit across the solar system given enough power. Probably about 200 watts at 10Ghz. But to receive from long distances, you do need large dishes. The large reflector is like a large magnifying lense for radio waves. You have to gather more of that energy to focus it onto a small little wire inside the feed horn. The bigger the dish, the more energy you collect (provided it\u0027s shaped right).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get more immersive on RT, we need movable and tracking antennas. I know, that\u0027s probably not an easy thing to do. But it\u0027s something that would bring out the coolness of RT. And the dishes, should have at least point in the direction of where you want to communicate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that is the maker of RemoteTech to do most of that. But as far as RO is concerned, If it were up to me, I\u0027d just make the dipole go about 4 million meters and make the dipole and the whips stick a little better to their mounting, but weaken the heat factor perhaps. (I have not tried a re-entry on any of these yet, so I don\u0027t know if they burn up too quick or not at all)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour numbers are (essentially) correct, but actually high. Voyager, at 15 billion km (15Tm) uses what NASA generally refers to as a 20w transmitter and the highest number I can find is 23w with a 3.7m dish to the 34m DSN on Earth. Even the early Russian space probes topped out at about 100w radios, but they tended to have a radio for every system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemote Tech is designed to add challenge and complexity to a game, and does a good job at that, but it doesn\u0027t remotely model real life to the point that I\u0027ve considered removing it from my RO install a few times. Some of that is because of RT and some of that is because of KSP. The entire satellite network to use deep space probes is... well... inherently flawed, but on the other hand there\u0027s no other reason to launch satellites so I kind of like it. (Earth should effectively have unlimited range antennas and range should only be determined by the antenna on the spacecraft and there should be a different calculation of Earth - Spacecraft and Spacecraft - Spacecraft because Earth has bigger antennas and better computers and thousands of watts to throw at transmissions).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as targeting dishes, Kerbal has no way to, say, send a low powered signal to go to 3-axis stabilization (and has no idea of any other kind of stabilization) and also no way to plot that stabilization in regard to point in space (ie point at Earth). RO lets you just say that a dish is targeted at a location. I\u0027m okay with that workaround.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy personal feelings about RT: I like that it forces you to think about communications, I just think it forces you to think about them in a way that is nearly incompatible with RO\u0027s mindset of not just making a more realistic KSP but we seem to be headed almost toward making a real space sim. RT implements them in a gamey way, and the one concept that it implements that more follows reality is the signal delay, but there is no way to really build an entire mission in current tools (kOS comes close, but runs into both its own issues and KSP issues). Ideally we would want an RO specific communication plugin and I am not even remotely volunteering to write it with my current workload. It\u0027s a little bit like requiring Kethane to produce fuel for your rocket because fueling rockets at the start was actually often hard, you could be modeling that exotic fuel is hard but you\u0027d be modeling it in a gamey way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERadio engineering aside\u003C/strong\u003E: I can orbit pretty much anything with a dipole using a [steep] loft trajectory and have actually never made a manned flight in RO because I\u0027m uninterested at this time. You either have something not configured per RO (such as didn\u0027t get the RT settings config that changes distances and puts earth stations at launch points) or you aren\u0027t making a steep enough ascent to stay in line of sight of your launch facility. Steep ascents were pretty much the name of the game in early rocket testing to deal with that and then came downrange radio stations. AIES also has an antenna that I\u0027m pretty much addicted to for near Earth flights that has an always active and an extendable mode. The RO specific RT settings also allow more antennas is better so you can always just, very realistically (no offense, Red/NK, I did read your commentary rationalizing it as more equipment, bigger antennas, etc but Omni.... truly omni doesn\u0027t actually matter about antenna size and RT (yes another niggle about RT) treats antennas as truly omni) add more antennas to get more range.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Woopert","CreatedById":84274,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-18T19:28:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jandcando\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jandcando\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt would seem FASA crashes the game at the moment.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re probably out of memory!
