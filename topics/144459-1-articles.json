Yours is a very light plane, and the standard suspension settings are for a medium heavy plane -- so your suspension is too stiff. That, combined with a Unity joint bug, makes your plane bounce.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the answer is: in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E, click on your front gear, set the spring to .5 and set the damper to .5 -- then save it and give it another shot at launching.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-24T20:50:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222689262\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022144459\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221469374868\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022123426\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Branjoman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, Branjoman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello, I am having a small problem with a plane I have built.
