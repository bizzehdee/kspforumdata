Veteran KSP player here. I\u0027ve done a lot of bonkers stuff in this great game, but designing -- and controlling -- anything with off-balance thrust is still harder than absolutely anything else I have done in this game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the entire time I\u0027ve played KSP, I\u0027ve struggled with designing and flying vehicles with off-center thrust vectors, EG an STS-styled space shuttle. I\u0027ve designed and flown a few of these, but the most manageable versions were all\u00A0pre-KSP1.0. SSTU offers a beautiful set of building blocks to make a ship, but there\u0027s still a ton of limitations from the core mechanics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. The display for thrust vectors and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E during vehicle design seem to not be useful for something like this; I have to eyeball it, by rotating the camera until the thrust vector is aimed right at the camera, and then I have to gauge whether the thrust vector \u0027ball\u0027 is lined up centrally with the Center of Mass. Maybe I\u0027m totally missing something, but this \u0022eyeball it\u0022 method seems to be the only option in this case? I can\u0027t even find a mod which will draw a ray along the thrust vectors so I can see if it properly intersects \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E. So it seems the only option is to eyeball it, throw it into a test flight, revert, eyeball it again, test again, etc. There\u0027s got to be a better way, even if it\u0027s through a mod, but I\u0027ve never found a mod that will allow me to either do this -- or better still,\u00A0just let me hit a button or a key to rotate the engine to align it to the center of mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. During flight, the space shuttle\u0027s main engines would gimbal themselves towards \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, to account for how the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E would change as fuel burned off (despite the stack being engineered to keep the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E change as in line as possible with the center of thrust, it still moves). KSP of course doesn\u0027t have anything like this stock, but I also can\u0027t find this behavior in any sort of mod. Being able to keep the engines gimbaled to a changing center of mass is a critical ability of the space shuttle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Navigation in KSP is always aligned through the control part\u0027s forward\u00A0vector. I\u0027ve found some older mods that give better handling options, but I\u0027ve never been impressed with them. In the past I\u0027ve usually tucked a probe core between the SSME cluster and angled it along the thrust vector, and use it as a control point, but again, this is just a very eyeball-and-test process. I can\u0027t find any mod that offers a \u0022control from thrust vector\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve watched users voice these same frustrations for 3-4 years and I\u0027ve not seen any good options besides \u0022wrestle it to orbit by manually doing things that the computer would be doing a thousand times a second\u0022 which is ultimately more frustrating than fun, to me. I\u0027ve managed to get perfectly stable and flyable shuttles in the past, but only after spending dozens of hours making tiny, tiny changes to part positions.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-09T22:32:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1 \u0026amp; 2) \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E Build Aid will show you all kinds of uneven torques for both dry and full tanks, and recalculate in real time.
