How much living space is *required* (if any)? What\u0027s the purpose of the station? Is it a fuel depot, or maybe a Karbonite orbital refinery? How many antennae do you need? How many craft do you intend to dock at once (bearing in mind that more craft = more parts = more lag)? TLDR: add nothing that you don\u0027t have an immediate use for. Don\u0027t add things speculatively.\n\n**2) Modularise**\n\nOne of the problems of an early-game station is you don\u0027t have access to things like gigantor solar arrays, or big batteries, so you can end up with dozens of small parts being used to take their place. If you\u0027ve got this problem, consider a power module, a detachable section that you can later swap out for something with less, more powerful, parts. If you use mods, have a separate section for each task, e.g. crew quarters, power, life support storage and recycling. This approach gives the added benefit that you can later split the station into two, if it\u0027s becoming unwieldy.\n\nWith this sort of design ethos, you can have a functional, modded station (e.g. Station Science, TAC-LS, Karbonite) that performs useful functions, and has only 50-100 parts. You may get a little lag if you move a big ship (e.g. SSTO) into docking range, but it won\u0027t be horrific ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T10:41:36Z","Content":"Hide your auxilliary and small guest vessels inside hangars. \n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/88933-0-90-0-Hangar-v2-3-1](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/88933-0-90-0-Hangar-v2-3-1)"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T11:24:46Z","Content":"I had a 900 parts space station around Laythe.
