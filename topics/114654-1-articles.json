One thing that can help: when you\u0027re attaching a fuel tank (or SRB) to a radial decoupler, slide it down as low as it can go and still be attached to the decoupler. That is, you want the decoupler\u0027s attachment point to the radial-thing-being-decoupled to be as high as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoing it that way means that the separation force from the decoupler will be applied above the decoupled thing\u0027s center of mass, which will tend to make it rotate \u003Cem\u003Eaway\u003C/em\u003E from the central craft, which provides a nice natural separation. (I\u0027ll sometimes get a message that my radial boosters collided into each \u003Cem\u003Eother\u003C/em\u003E after separation, but I\u0027ve already discarded them so I don\u0027t care.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if your central rocket isn\u0027t already activated (i.e. if you\u0027re not asparagus), make sure that your central rocket is put together in the same stage as your radial decouplers. In other words, when you hit the space bar, you want your central ship\u0027s engine to ignite at the same time that your radial decouplers fire. Don\u0027t put it in two stages (i.e. you don\u0027t want \u0022separate decouplers, pause, light engine\u0022). Reason: you want that central ship accelerating hard away from the decoupled boosters, to minimize their chance of bumping into it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wisnoskij","CreatedById":143705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T16:50:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Snark\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Snark\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERegarding chutes: There\u0027s a UI on the chute that indicates whether it\u0027s safe to deploy.

Shallow re-entry, where most of your speed is horizontal, rather than vertical. You want to go round and round Kerbin until you are going slowly, rather than plunging straight towards the center of the world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimple way of doing that is have your perapsis between 28k and 32k meters above the surface when you hit the atmosphere. Aim to miss Kerbin, not hit Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, so now we have your craft re-entering the atmosphere in such a way that it doesn\u0027t explode from heat, and has plenty of time to slow down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou want to have enough parachutes so you are travelling under 7m/s when you touch down. I\u0027ve found that means 1 kg of parachute for every 15 kg of craft, or 0.1 tons of chute (one radial chute) for every 1.5 tons of empty weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen do you deploy? When your speed is below 250 m/s. With the shallow re-entry profile, most of my craft get below 250 m/s by 6000m off the ground. Depends on how aerodynamic your craft is. If you need more drag, consider air brakes or landing struts - extending them will increase your drag. Deploy them after all the flaming graphics have stopped, to keep them from burning off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etl:dr: 1 radial chute for every 1.5 tons of craft. Set your perapsis for 30km. Deploy your landing gear after the flames have died down. Deploy the chutes after your speed is below 250 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(1) And compression.
