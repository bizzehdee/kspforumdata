Just wanted to take a min to reintroduce myself as I\u0027ve been gone from this forum for some time. I loved playing KSP and coming up with new creations to launch into space. I had just completed a series of Munar exploration missions and assembled a space station as well as a few other mission when things at work started to get busier and busier. Eventually work and life in general won out leave not much time for video games, so I kinda stopped playing for awhile \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E. That was back in August. I kinda forgot about the game for awhile after that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen a few weeks ago I saw on Steam that they had added the asteroid capture missions, and my interest was reignited \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E and I picked up right where I had left off. Before I took a break from the game, I had designed a Mun Base to assemble on the Mun, but I hadn\u0027t got as far as designing a launch vehicle to get it there. Well thanks to a few of the new parts my Mun Base is now where it belongs and assembled on the Mun and my first Munar colony is up and running! I even incorporated the new Mobile Processing Lab into the design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t wait for whats next. Perhaps Minmus, or Duna, maybe even an asteroid base. And I can\u0027t wait to see what kind of crazy creation everyone else is coming up with with the new toys we\u0027ve now got in the parts bin!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5258/14013875514_43ee7977f8_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214013875514_43ee7977f8_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2896/14014531975_cdcbb67c78_o.png\u0022 alt=\u002214014531975_cdcbb67c78_o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-26T04:02:25Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2014 04:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by OUScooby\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-26T04:25:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome back, OUScooby. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xaelath","CreatedById":106084,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-26T08:05:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome back!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s an awesome Mun Base!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
