But, well...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday someone shows me a small craft he make for a flight to Eve. I notice he attach a dozen of Radial Air Intake around the Fusalage so he can use turbo engine to reach a higher altitute. At that moment I think this guy saves a lot resource. But when I check the wiki, I am shocked. The price for one Radial Air Intake is 1000! Which is even more expensive than the Turbojet Engine. Actually it is more expensive than most of the rocket engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I read more about the price on wiki. It seems the price for parts are quite unreasonable. An EAS-1 External Command Seat is 800 when a Mk1 pod is only 600.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am wondering if Squad want to make career mode, will they reconsider the price? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I found the tables on parts page of KSP wiki have some wrong numbers, especially about price. Anyone know how to fix it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-12T08:04:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStock prices are completely wonky, in part because they aren\u0027t used at this time.
