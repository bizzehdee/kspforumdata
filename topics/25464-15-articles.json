Then Nelemy replanted the flag by the bunkhouse module. So, after a couple long and harrowing days, the boys settled down to sleep.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThompbles: \u0022Guys, I\u0027m going to need some help tomorrow working out the consumables situation.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKurt: *yawn* \u0022No problem.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldner: \u0022I told Hellou I\u0027d take her up into the hills to study the rocks.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThompbles: \u0022That will have to wait a while.

So our plucky kerbals would be having an extended mission on Laythe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut in the meantime, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E crew started making modifications to the ships that were being finished off for the next armada to Laythe. The flight of the interplanetary crew transport ship that would have brought the replacement crew out to Laythe was cancelled, but the new SCIENCE Base and other equipment would be sent out unkerballed to Laythe for use by the current crew.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNOTE: A recent thread on the KSP forums showed how much lag increases when you have lots of other ships, flags, and debris in your save file (even when it is outside the rendering range of the active ship)... and it was a surprising amount. I have a LOT of old ships and \u0027debris\u0027 (parts of ships that I\u0027ve deliberately left as markers on planets or in orbit...I often delete actual debris) in my save file (with about 145 \u0027flights\u0027 on the list). This would explain why I was getting so much lag with ships that I really didn\u0027t think were all that big. So, anyway, I decided that in order to reduce lag, I would do all the construction and interplanetary transfers of the next ships in an alternate save file that was time-synced to my main game file. Then after the ships were moved to Laythe, I would paste them into my main save file at the appropriate game time. And indeed, things went much smoother this way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027ll notice in the pictures below that I also installed the \u0022Visual Enhancements: Clouds \u0026amp; City Lights\u0022 mod. I generally like to play with vanilla parts, but I don\u0027t mind mods that make things look cool without changing the game play. The clouds \u0026amp; city lights mod hasn\u0027t given me any problems while playing the game (other than making it a little harder to target landings through the cloud layers).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo... on to the ships! Below are four launches of Reusable Rockets to assemble Ship #1 in Kerbin orbit: Nuclear tug; extra fuel tanks; Nuclear tug; and an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E spaceplane plus a marine operations rescue vehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022EhH6yJU.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EhH6yJU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow is a better view of the payload carrying the spaceplane and marine rescue unit into orbit. The spaceplane can carry two kerbals, and it\u0027s powered by a single turbojet (two ram intakes) and four of the small Rockomax 48-7S rocket engines. There is one Mk1 Fuselage for jet fuel, plus an FL-T400 and two FL-T200 tanks for liquid fuel/oxidizer. The craft is a biplane to give it extra lift -- unlike typical spaceplanes that take off from Kerbin full of fuel and land back on Kerbin mostly empty, this spaceplane has to be able to land with almost a full fuel load (since its fuel is kept in orbit).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022gfpq3SG.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gfpq3SG.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnder the spaceplane is the NAMOR 20 (New Automated Marine Operations Rescue) vehicle. For a long time I\u0027ve been concerned that I had no way to rescue kerbals from the oceans of Laythe (unless they happened to crash land between DogFish and Dansen Island). I was never able to get the hang of \u003Cem\u003Ereliably\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Elanding and launching a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E aircraft from the surface of the ocean, so I designed the NAMOR instead. It is a \u0027hopper\u0027 powered by two jet engines, and can carry two kerbals a considerable distance (enough to get them to an island for rescue by BirdDog, if not all the way home to Dansen Island). It lands on the ocean using parachutes (once you\u0027ve used the jet engines to hover over to the correct location). It has two Rockomax 24-77 engines (with two FL-T100 tanks) to deorbit the NAMOR to the rescue site. It has two FL-T200 tanks to fuel the jet engines -- and I decided to implement \u0022tweakables\u0022 a little early by manually editing these tanks to hold only liquid fuel and no oxidizer. Even before this tweak (so still carrying around a lot of oxidizer as deadweight), versions tested on Kerbin were able to takeoff from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, land in the ocean offshore to perform a \u0022rescue,\u0022 and then fly across the ocean to the big peninsula (which I call \u0022BigKorea\u0022 because of its shape), and land safely. So I think the range will be sufficient for rescuing kerbals from any spot on Laythe... although one hopes that there will never be a need to use this vehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow, Ship #1 is fully assembled in Kerbin orbit, and the four extra fuel pods (brought along to top off the tanks) have been jettisoned. So this ship is a double-tug arranged in a \u0027train\u0027 configuration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00227K0ZX2Y.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7K0ZX2Y.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow we see the start of assembly for Ship #2 with the launch of a Nuclear Tug and extra fuel tanks (the purpose is to bring lots of fuel out to Laythe, since the boys at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E still haven\u0027t developed the hoped-for equipment for mining fuel on other planets). The extra fuel tanks were docked to the rear of the Tug, and then the Refueler Topper was used to refuel the Tug (which had to use some of its fuel load to get into orbit) before being jettisoned and returned to land west of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022RDffpjq.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RDffpjq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother Reusable Rocket sent a second Nuclear Tug up to become part of Ship #2. The new Tug first docked to the rear of the stack, then separated its lower fuel tank. The stack was then rotated so the new Tug could be docked to the front of the stack (rolled 90 degrees so the nuclear engines of the Tugs don\u0027t interfere with each other). The main payload will go on the front of the train, and fuel tanks can be dropped from the end of the train when empty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KK1Cnuf.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KK1Cnuf.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow, the main payload, a new SCIENCE Base, was sent up on a Reusable Rocket and docked to the front of the train. This SCIENCE Base has two Hitchhiker modules stacked in the center to represent the new Large Science Lab module that is expected in version 0.23, as well as a Science Junior and Mystery Goo container. There are also modules for retrofitting BirdDogs for SCIENCE. Yes, yes, I know that the game will refuse to play SCIENCE with me in sandbox mode, but that won\u0027t stop me from having fun with SCIENCE parts. The two side Hitchhiker modules were, of course, filled with more equipment and consumables for our intrepid explorers on Laythe. There is also a small service rover attached to the side of the Base that will be used on Laythe. In the rightmost part of the image, the Refueler Topper was jettisoned and the completed Ship #2 was ready to send to Jool...once the transfer window arrives.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022dnJD6dd.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dnJD6dd.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EField Trip\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack on Laythe a couple weeks later, Aldner and Hellou prepare for a short expedition into the hills so Hellou can break some rocks. The radiation levels have fallen faster than expected -- Hellou surmises that this may be due to the thin gas torus that Laythe creates around its orbit from molecules that escape its atmosphere. Because of the low escape velocity of planets and moons in the diminutive Kerbol system, this gas torus would be thicker than expected in a similar situation in our own solar system. And collisions with the molecules in the gas torus would help clear out the high energy particles from Jool\u0027s radiation belts at the radius of Laythe\u0027s orbit.

But, in fact, the main arrangement of islands on Laythe may not be due to volcanic formation. The huge circle of islands on the opposite side of Laythe is clearly an impact feature. The big grouping of islands on this side of Laythe could have formed here as a result of the shock waves from that giant impact being focussed to the far side of the moon.

The train has twice as many nuclear engines that a single Tug payload, but it also has twice the mass with all that extra fuel, so the Jool-transfer burns were like normal (about 1,940 m/s delta-V, and I broke the 20-minute long burn into two burns of about 10 minutes each. The first half of the burn used up the fuel in the bottommost tank (fuel was not simply draining from that tank, so I waited until after the burn and transferred fuel around, then dropped the empty tank). You can see the pretty clouds and city lights on Kerbin in the picture showing the dropping of the tank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022d4srWgG.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/d4srWgG.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022JxeXGK8.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JxeXGK8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimilarly, once Ship #2 was out near apoapsis, I sent off Ship #1 for its first burn.

The next fuel tanks ran dry during the plane shift burn and were dropped in inteplanetary space. Then I did a little tweaking of the trajectories (using good old conic draw mode 0). At the end of maneuvering, the remaining drop tanks were about 81% full on each ship (and the rest of the Tug tanks completely full), so a lot of fuel would be delivered to the Jool system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022EpsAO4u.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EpsAO4u.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSoon after the Kerbin-to-Jool window closed, the Jool-to-Kerbin transfer window opened. Instead of sending Hellou and Emilynn back as originally planned, I just sent back Tugs for re-use. Below, a double set of the most recent Tugs (docked so I could transfer them as a single ship) were first sent off into an orbit with an apoapsis between Vall and Tylo (then circularized). From there, the Double-Tug boosted for Kerbin, which required about 1,400 m/s of delta-V. The fuel for these maneuvers came from the small side tanks (the main tanks were mostly empty before the return maneuvers started).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Eznn2F1.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Eznn2F1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022oMOi08U.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oMOi08U.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can also see in the map view image above that there were still two other older-model Tugs waiting in orbits between Laythe and Vall. These two Tugs were also sent off back to Kerbin. For simplicity, I built the plane change maneuver into these burns, since Jool was fairly close to a Jool-Kerbin node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00220Rx6DJu.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0Rx6DJu.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce free from Jool\u0027s sphere of influence, I did some fine targeting (using conic draw mode 0) of the trajectories to approximately aerocapture altitude at far-away Kerbin (as seen below). All of these transfer maneuvers were done by cutting these ships\u0027 data from the main save file and pasting them into the alternate save file that I was using to do the transfers without living in Lag City.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022xiMBp0q.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xiMBp0q.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter all the transfer burns and targeting, I had the orbits shown below.

As the two ships approached the Jool system I did some fine targeting. Both of the ships were coming in on trajectories that allowed direct-to-Laythe aerocaptures, so I did things the easy way and brought them straight to Laythe. First in was the train carrying the new SCIENCE Base on a trajectory that swooped around Jool and encountered Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gKrzhCf.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022gKrzhCf.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship came in to Laythe for aerocapture over the BAIF Ocean targeted at an altitude of 20.2 km. The aerocapture resulted in an orbit with an apoapsis of 709 km. On the way out to apoapsis I did a plane chance burn of less than 100 m/s to correct inclination to 0 degrees (where Laythe Space Station lives at 80 km), and at apoapsis I did a burn to raise the periapsis partway out of the atmosphere. Then an aerobraking pass lowered the apoapsis to 90 km, where I did a circularization burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Rpacl34.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Rpacl34.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/puZhld7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022puZhld7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext the ship with the Spaceplane/NAMOR payloads came in.

Hellou was the first to take off (so that there would be a pilot on the ground at either end to help fly by remote control if needed). Her flight back was at a little higher altitude than her flight over, so it used only 31 units of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eMPCcuN.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022eMPCcuN.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou landed safely and drove the BirdDog over to GasStation 2.

It\u0027s tricky, but possible to do this, and you get a speed of around 475 m/s at the standard 1/3 throttle setting...but it requires pitching the nose of the BirdDog up to 45 degrees to get enough lift at that altitude and throttle setting. Emilynn made the trip using 32 units of fuel, so it was not an improvement over Hellou\u0027s more standard flight profile (at least over that distance).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5UOEnea.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00225UOEnea.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/c5Q7jHw.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022c5Q7jHw.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a celebratory dinner that couldn\u0027t be beat, our kerbals retired for the night.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022It sure is nice having the girls back with us.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurt: \u0022Yes, indeed.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022Just think, Dudes...new ships, orbiting just 90 km overhead.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Hey, Nelemy, I found some more cases of yellow mush in the back of the storage shed if you want some tomorrow.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022Oh, hey... cool, Dude.

So I\u0027ll let them do a little cutting and bending later to build another shed. Also, it\u0027s sitting in the area often used as a landing strip, so they\u0027ll want to drag it out of there in any case. (And its landing location was between the two groups of ships that I have separated by 2.5 km to reduce lag...so that it was a real bother switching between ships later on because I would end up jumping to this debris and jumping to the group of ships.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nakvwav.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nakvwav.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen Aldner and Emilynn reached the base, they found that the two wheels on the downhill side had blown out on landing despite having the landing legs to take up the shock. As long as the base was tilted in an advantageous direction, they dropped off the little Runabout rover from the side of the base. (After that, they fixed the wheels of the base.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/niRdcET.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022niRdcET.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eao2r0F.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022eao2r0F.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, Emilynn drove the Runabout over to Laythe Base 1 (where she and Hellou were living).

Note that the two Hitchhiker modules in the center were to represent one of the new big SCIENCE Lab modules (I don\u0027t know yet if they are of similar mass). The two side Hitchhikers include a living module (I assume Hellou and Emilynn will move in there to get away from the smell of old socks in the Laythe Base 1 module), and a module with lots more equipment, supplies, and consumables.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/c7kAmEx.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022c7kAmEx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo...what about that stuff hanging off the side booms? That\u0027s SCIENCE to retrofit the BirdDogs. Nelemy drove BirdDog 3 down from the other base area and carefully lined it up under the right boom (the landing leg on that side had to be folded up beforehand so the plane could come in straight). Then the double Mystery Goo package was dropped from the boom onto the docking port of the BirdDog, which then backed away. BUT WAIT, you may say... How are they going to be able to refuel the BirdDog with that Goo package on top? Fear not: The BirdDog can drive back under the boom, then extend its nose gear, and the Goo package will dock back in place on the boom. Then the plane can be separated to refuel and return to grab the Goo again. And since I have a Big Lab Module (or so the center Hitchhikers represent), the Goo can be refreshed as needed. Yes, yes... as before, I know the game won\u0027t actually let me have SCIENCE fun in sandbox mode, but that won\u0027t stop me from having fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GbNox7U.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022GbNox7U.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DoAheLU.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DoAheLU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurt drove down in BirdDog 4 and lined it up under the other boom...and received a SCIENCE Junior materials exposure bay.

Aldner and Emilynn would be the ones to test the spaceplane, and they flipped a coin to determine who would get to fly it down by remote control...and Aldner lost, so he got to fly it down. Lost? Yes...because that meant Emilynn would get to pilot the spaceplane on its first test flight to orbit. When the spaceplane separated from the Tugs, it took the supporting structure with it to clear it away from the top of the NAMOR marine rescue vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JOCgcYS.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022JOCgcYS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow is the retro burn (sorry...it\u0027s not a great image). The four Rockomax 48-7S engines fire backward between the upper and lower wings. Once the plane was on an entry trajectory, the support structure that had held it to the ship was jettisoned so that it would be destroyed on entry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2yeHe0V.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222yeHe0V.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AZj5p3h.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022AZj5p3h.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe spaceplane went through the entry flames as it approached Dansen island (no radio control was possible when it was enveloped in plasma...it was on autopilot for that stretch). After the entry plasma dissipated, the plane was passing over the Fido Bay area at over 11 km, so Aldner banked into some turns to bleed off speed and then come back around. The thing does not handle as well as a BirdDog...maybe because it is heavier, or maybe because of the different CoM/CoL relationship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dV9AgWD.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022dV9AgWD.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jpm2p2n.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jpm2p2n.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe turn around lost more altitude than expected, so Aldner fired up the turbojet to bring it closer to base, but cut the engine as soon as possible to save fuel. He landed the plane safely about 5 km away, higher up the slope than they normally land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Z9jcZrq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Z9jcZrq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner and Emilynn hopped on the Runabout and drove out to the spaceplane\u0027s landing site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PuRmHEH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022PuRmHEH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/r7WYhM5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022r7WYhM5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022You\u0027ll be the first to pilot it, Hawk, so you get to name it.

Some girly-goddess name?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022Nope. She named it Ladyhawk. I\u0027m really looking forward to flying her.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter they arrived at the Ladyhawk and gave the spaceplane a quick checkover, Aldner backed the Runabout under the nose of the plane and Emilynn raised the nose gear to dock the two vehicles. I really like being able to drive my BirdDogs all over the place with their rover wheels, but I didn\u0027t want to add the weight and dragf of rover wheels to a spaceplane. I also didn\u0027t want to have to burn up precious jet fuel to drive the plane around on the ground (even with the easier steering that the steerable landing gear will allow in version 0.23), so I designed the Runabout to drag the spaceplane around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2rRwQ7r.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222rRwQ7r.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, Aldner and Emilynn brought the Ladyhawk to a stop next to Laythe Base 1 (between Laythe Base 1 and the SCIENCE Base). When the nose wheel of the plane was lowered, it lifted the Runabout up off the ground a little ways...then the ships were separated and the Runabout dropped to the ground and was driven off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3UF5Yau.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223UF5Yau.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FpYPE2i.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FpYPE2i.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that they were back at the base, Aldner and Emilynn gave the Ladyhawk a complete check of all of its systems (after dragging out all the boxes of supplies that were stuffed into the cabins, of course). Below you can see Emilynn and Aldner climbing on board. It takes a jump to reach the bottom of the ladder to the cockpit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Lj84iXO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Lj84iXO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game thinks Aldner is sitting horizontally in the lander can, but of course I contend that the interior has been rearranged so that he is sitting upright. The picture below shows his re-oriented view out the side window (with the canard visible).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DisAmpw.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DisAmpw.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn and Aldner will test the Ladyhawk later. It used a bit more propellant that I expected during retro burn, but I think there is enough to return to orbit. We\u0027ll see. I had a method for adding more fuel for the deorbit process, but I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d need it so I didn\u0027t include it (but I am sending it along with the next ships to Laythe). Below, the results of my labors so far: new SCIENCE Base, new SCIENCE on BirdDogs, new SSTO spaceplane, and the little Runabout.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/v04hG3S.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022v04hG3S.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, Thompbles was juggling some things in orbit. The NAMOR-20 was left with one fully fueled Tug (so it could be shifted around as needed and dropped anywhere on Laythe). The X200-8 fuel tank under the NAMOR is empty -- it was there mainly as a place to mount the four refuler pods that got dropped back in Kerbin orbit, and to carry extra fuel for the trip. The other Tug was separated and will be kept in orbit as a fuel reserve for now (and sent to the Laythe Space Station eventually).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/L0yt18g.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022L0yt18g.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe two-Tug-train that dropped off the SCIENCE Base was rendezvoused with the Space Station and docked to the center Senior port on the bottom. Most of the fuel from these Tugs was transferred to the tanks on the Station (except for enough fuel for the double-Tugs to return to Kerbin later). After these recent deliveries, the tanks on the Station are nearly full, so there is a good amount of fuel in orbit for multiple Ladyhawk test flights, a possible return to Vall, and other future projects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/InAOu0P.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022InAOu0P.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now, the double-Tug will remain attached to the Space Station (which is getting pretty laggy). While doing the rendezvous for the new Tugs, I decided to attach the old Laythe Tug 5 to the Station so that it could be used for any mission in orbit requiring a standard docking port (originally I had separated it in favor of keeping the Tug you see docked on the left side that had lots of extra probe bodies added for extra torque...but now that the old ASAS module of Tug 5 creates torque, it\u0027s a lighter, better tug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3ZpSWAH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223ZpSWAH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK...so I\u0027ve been writing this instead of playing with version 0.23 (I did get a download of 0.23 started in the meantime), so I\u0027ll end this here and go play with the new version.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T04:44:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SpaceSphereOfDeath\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SpaceSphereOfDeath\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENice to see this hasn\u0027t been abandond\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople gave me lots of reputation and feedback after Part 20, so I had to keep writing more. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T07:09:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou are an inspiration to us all \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
