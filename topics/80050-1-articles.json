When a Kerbal suffers a fatal Kraken attack or dies after experiencing a not-fatal Kraken attack, he gets listed as KIA, not MIA. That seems to be normal game behavior in my experience. Maybe not INTENDED game behavior, but it always seems to happen in my experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHOWEVER, it\u0027s also been my experience that unless you have respawn turned off, such victims respawn at KSC almost immediately. For instance, one time Bob fell through Mun\u0027s surface during a bad rover wreck. I switched to the other Kerbal who\u0027d been in the rover and Bob briefly reappeared in T pose on the surface nearby, then almost immediately exploded. Dead. Gone. In front of witnesses. The rocket came home without him. And when I recovered the rocket and went back to the astronaut complex, Bob was there on the Available list like nothing had ever happened.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GigaG","CreatedById":8013,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T16:01:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EConsidering that I sorta need Jeb (moral support, I just love the guy) and that this is unintended behavior, would it be cheating to ressurect him?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T16:51:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GigaG\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GigaG\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EConsidering that I sorta need Jeb (moral support, I just love the guy) and that this is unintended behavior, would it be cheating to ressurect him?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s no such thing as cheating in KSP \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Volcanix","CreatedById":117245,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T17:23:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GigaG\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GigaG\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EConsidering that I sorta need Jeb (moral support, I just love the guy) and that this is unintended behavior, would it be cheating to ressurect him?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I don\u0027t think it would be cheating because resurrecting Kerbonauts doesn\u0027t really help you out in the game, does it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GigaG","CreatedById":8013,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T17:25:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt increases my own morale, I guess.
