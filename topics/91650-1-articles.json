My thoughts were that there is just so much (ie: very little) that you can do with a sweet potato as it turns to mush. So I was wondering what type of research can be done in concern of vegetative growth in space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPossible (MOD) projects:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Hydroponic module to test how much water is actually needed in a microgravity environment and if a sealed moist environment would promote good vegetative growth without the need of an actual supply of water at the roots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Sunlight requirements. Which filtered glass color on a module greenhouse would promote plant growth and which colors hinder plant growth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Fruit sugar research: Would growing fruit in a micro-gravity environment change the natural development of fruit sugars in the plant. Like would oranges be bitter or super sweet?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Ambient radiation effects on plant tissue: Research potential to see what effects that ambient space radiation would have on living plant tissue (which need sunlight) and to see if later generations of the plant adapts genetically adapts to the radiation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Growth potential of plants: Is there a standard increase in size of a vegetable grown in micro-gravity versus regular growth on Earth? I think we should measure plant growth to see if there is indeed a statistical growth standard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(post your research idea\u0027s on how we can study plants in space)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Sasami (^___^)/\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-30T17:32:23Z\u0022 title=\u002211/30/2014 05:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Sasami_TN\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EzinX","CreatedById":118288,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-30T19:35:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll of the things are fairly well known to biology and don\u0027t need a lot of expensive space-specific research. At the cellular level, gravity is a negligible force, and most of your questions can be trivially answered with ground experiments or just checking the literature for past research. More useful research would be full up testing - using what we already know about plants, and using what we already know about recycling systems, build an actual life support recycling system and test it on the ground heavily. Then, once the design is reliable in testing on the ground, launch one into space and test it there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"QuesoExplosivo","CreatedById":102949,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-30T20:25:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022EzinX\u0022 data-cite=\u0022EzinX\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAt the cellular level, gravity is a negligible force\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not negligible (gravitropism, for instance), but most plants do fine without it.

While into this first posting, the idea occurred to me that successive plant generations grown in a radioactive environment may show genetic adaptation in a way that researchers might could learn from toward applying that knowledge for astronaut travel in space. The plants around Chernobyl can be a reference source, but there are other forms of radiation in space that could affect plants at the cellular level. It would be a nice bonus to find out that plants can heal themselves of a form of cellular \u0022cancer\u0022 and apply that toward a human cure of cancer.
