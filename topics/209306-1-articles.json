It\u0027s not in the optimal direction, but it is still enough to get to Minmus. In contrast, for an intercept speed of 3000 m/s (for instance, when coming from Jool), the change in velocity is only 200 m/s. (If this assist is performed on the way to or from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, it\u0027s not in the optimal direction either, which might explain why you\u0027re only saving 100 m/s.)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, as \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/139655-terwin/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022139655\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/139655-terwin/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Terwin\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0pointed out, if your relative velocity is too slow, you can\u0027t get as much out of the gravity assist either.
