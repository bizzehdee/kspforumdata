Not because it\u0027s easier to lift, but because it will then be modular and therefore editable. My station looks nothing like what I initially planned (not that I did a hell of a lot of planning) because I\u0027ve been adding/removing/moving parts. If I hadn\u0027t made it modular I would have been stuck with the original design, which was ok, but doesn\u0027t work for what I want now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EETA:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is my main lifter design (the nuke engines at the top of the pic are part of the payload), it\u0027ll get 80T to LKO. It\u0027s not the most efficient design, but it\u0027s pretty simple. It\u0027s pretty stable until the asparagus boosters drop off and I lose a lot of struts.

The orange tanks are \u0027stitched\u0027 together at the joints, and there are struts at the top, center and bottom of the boosters. I also generally strut the payload to the boosters and some trusses at the top of the center stack. That doesn\u0027t help the lifter stability, but the connection between the lifter and payload tends to be weak, and that helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-14T22:17:43Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2013 10:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Noticeably FAT\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerekL1963","CreatedById":57091,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T22:47:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Edberg\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Edberg\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone got any rockets i could download and learn from?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse the forum search function to find Temstar\u0027s Zenith series boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T10:08:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Edberg\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Edberg\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThanks all!
