I think if you were to build a shuttle certain improvements must be made. A proper abort system must be considered is one of my main concerns. That being said and I love the space shuttle, its not really necessary. The internatonal Space Station has proved that although the space shuttle was key to building it, a shuttle is not necessary. The russian segment were launched on proton rockets and then manned by soyuz. Soyuz are still being used. The most efficient way to get people to and from the space station is a capsule. Orion, Dragon, and CST-100, all can hold 5\u002B people. Cargo to orbit is done with Dragon, ATV, Cygnus, Progress, and more. So everything can be done with out the space shuttle and at a much lower price tag. So what I am trying to get at is, why would someone want to make a new space shuttle? The only viable use would be for tourism and that I am 100% behind. Still capsules would be more efficient. You can\u0027t leave LEO with a shuttle so going traveling past LEO off the table with a shuttle. So could it be done? Absolutely! Should it be done? Not really money can be spent much more efficiently elsewhere to space travel. Will it be done? Most likely no.

I consider a small shuttle to be nothing more but a winged pod. A bigger version like the NASA\u0027s space shuttle is one approach for a second stage recovery (not full recovery of course). I don\u0027t see why the basic concept is such a bad idea. Of course there were many problems with the final design, some of them as a rsult of decisions that didn\u0027t follow the initial idea to reduce the costs per launch. Too many capabilities and the real price of recovery are a big part of the problem. The originally expected price of a shuttle mission wasn\u0027t too bad, it just wasn\u0027t possible to get even close to those expectations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike others mentioned, a reusable first stage with sane recovery costs could make the whole design a lot more economic. The shuttles SRB\u0027s \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eturned out to be very expensive to reuse and landing equipment in the ocean isn\u0027t the best approach to minimise costs (salt water does bad things to your shiny high tech equipment...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe external tank turned out to be not cheap at all, but I don\u0027t see how that part could be avoided on heavy shuttles without building something like a buran (which is arguably even less economical, cause I don\u0027t see a way to recover something the size of an energija). Maybe this gets less of a problem with a more specialised -\u0026gt; lighter shuttle. But I won\u0027t bet on it and in the end, not even space x will be capable of reusing second stages within the next years (more likely the next decade).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, the shuttle\u0027s heat shield was an aspect that definetly needs to be worked on. If a similar design should ever be considered, the maintenace costs need to be reduced significantly. There is an interesting concept that has been tested by the DLR (german govermental aerospace organisation, partner/member of ESA) called SHEFEX. It\u0027s basic idea is to minimise the variants and shapes of panels used in a reentry system. The space shuttle used a vast number of very specific parts which resulted in high costs and very limited on board repair capabilities.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T09:38:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Motokid600\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Motokid600\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe only reason I can see to have a shuttle is for if one day we decide to have a women carry a baby to term in weightlessness.
