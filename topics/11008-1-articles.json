Its control surfaces will mess with you, and this can seriously upset it. However, using gimballing engines, and putting the orbiter stages at level with the shuttle will make a lot of difference. The biggest problem you are having is that all your engines are in the centre, and far below the shuttle - this gives the shuttle a very high centre of gravity, resulting in tipping over. You need to bring the centre of gravity to, well, the centre of the ship, and then you need to make the ship as short and wide as possible. Imagine the difference between trying to balance a stick on a stick, and trying to balance a frisbee on a stick. Clearly, the frisbee will be easier - because it is short and wide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can also recommend removing the ASAS, and adding normal SAS to each of the orbiter stage collumns. If you don\\\u0027t want the orbiter fins moving, then don\\\u0027t have ASAS. Normal SAS should compensate. This does mean you can\\\u0027t use gimballing engines, but gimballing engines are less powerful anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BillWiskins","CreatedById":12285,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T14:34:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYar, it is more the concept I was after as well, though I will not deny a certain desire for aesthetic similarity... \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hebdomad","CreatedById":16474,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T14:47:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\\\u0027t think weight balance is the issue here but I\\\u0027ll give the regular SAS a go. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I think I might have to do some recording and research so I can give some feed back to Squad on this issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt shouldn\\\u0027t be as hard as it is.
