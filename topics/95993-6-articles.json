Yes, having a half second glitch every ten seconds must be really annoying but, contrary to what you claim, this issue does not affect everyone to the same extent. For quite a lot of people (probably the majority though it is impossible to be sure) the garbage collections do not introduce annoying pauses, either the pauses are so short that they are much less annoying, the frequency of the pauses is much less or some other aspect of their setup makes them less noticeable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Fixing\u0022 this issue really requires that the whole of the codebase be gone over to eliminate as much garbage creation as possible and to reduce the number of live objects in the heap that the garbage collection must scan. This is a very large job and carries the risk of introducing all sorts of new bugs. The only way to increase the priority of this issue is to provide evidence that it is more serious (and fixing it will provide more benefits, both to players and to Squad themselves) than other issues the devs are working on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I would really like to see is for some people that claim not to see these annoying glitches to run the test I described (keep the pod rotating while the graph does a complete cycle including at least one peak) and then provide a screenshot of the graph.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022basic.syntax\u0022 data-cite=\u0022basic.syntax\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI would mentally prepare for no refinements to GC issues in the forthcoming 1.0.3 patch.
