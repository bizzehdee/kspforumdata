It\u0027s a fairly complex craft for stock, I might be afraid to mess with it when just starting out with KSP. I think the \u0022why doesn\u0027t this work\u0022 question would likely be encountered on-orbit, not at a critical time of craft operation. It\u0027s not \u0022broken\u0022 until you activate the stage with 4 O-10 engines, and wonder why you don\u0027t get very far. \u003Cp\u003EHopefully the player notices the upper right resource panel says that it has lots of monoprop, and from there right-clicks the tank. The next big hurdle for a new player, is realizing the red circle-slash icon is a button you can click.
