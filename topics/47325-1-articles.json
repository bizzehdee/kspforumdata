All goes well, velocity, speed, landing gear, everything is fine. That is until I try to touch down. The craft just sinks into the Munar surface. Shortly after it is completely submerged, it explodes. I can thrust out if I do so in time. But I cant get the ship to rest on the visible surface. I have dropped a small unmanned rover via skycrane onto the surface, and it was fine. This has just recently come to light as I am just beginning manned landing attempts.
