So the stock LV-N has been switched over to using hydrogen.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurious to use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E in an NTR engine, I have been fiddling around with a\u00A0modded\u00A0engine that attempts to emulate an issue that an NTR using kerosene propellant would probably encounter: carbon buildup. To attempt this, I have made the engine bimodal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nOne mode is high thrust, ~600 isp, uses \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E and produces carbon buildup. (actually ablator, as I\u0027d rather use existing resources)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe other mode is low thrust, ~200 isp, and uses Oxidizer and the buildup/ablator.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nMy intent is to have an engine that can use the dense \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E,\u00A0rather than LH2, but suffers because of it, having less stellar isp, and requiring periodic cleanings/flushings using Oxidizer to burn away carbon-rich buildup\u00A0from thermally broken down kerosene.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have used a method to cause buildup that I know to be faulty: both modes have ablator as a propellant, but in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E mode, its ratio is negative. So as the engine burns \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E, the amount of ablator increases, as it burns Oxidizer, it decreases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I have run into an issue. Once the ablator reaches the maximum amount storable in the engine, it doesn\u0027t shut off, as I would like. I know that this is because using a negative ratio for propellant is a no-no, and it\u0027s not checked when a propellant runs max, only when it runs out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone have any tips on how I can get the engine to run only until the buildup is at the maximum amount, and shuts off once there?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sciencek","CreatedById":157616,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-15T19:14:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone have any suggestions?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this is the wrong forum for this sort of discussion, then I will happily make a new post in the correct place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
