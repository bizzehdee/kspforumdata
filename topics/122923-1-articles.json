I downloaded the demo and after 1 death and six additional launches I finally managed to build a rocket, take off , run out of fuel, land and recover my vehicle. That was fun! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am just about to buy the full version but yesterday I came across something called KerbalEdu. As its over 50 years since I did a science lesson I thought it might add to my kerbal experience to do some learning as well. Can anyone tell me if the KerbalEdu version of the program is essentially the same as the KSP one except for the additional educational bits? If anyones tried it I\u0027d welcome your thoughts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReggae\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-13T09:40:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello Reggae, and welcome to the forums.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAFAIK KerbalEdu is targeted toward classrooms, but I don\u0027t have any direct experience with it myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find the forums to be an interesting place to learn a whole bunch about rockets and orbital mechanics among other things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-13T13:24:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, you can probably learn everything in KerbalEDU on the forums.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
