The great news is that I think BROKE core is developed enough that the only real thing to do to get this to a playable state is writing up some [Funding Modifiers](https://github.com/magico13/BROKE/blob/master/BROKE/IFundingModifier.cs)!\n\nBROKE has been set up to make it easy to write new \u0022Funding Modifiers\u0022 (things that modify the funds level, like funding from the government [a positive modification] or Kerbal salaries [a negative modification], on a regular interval). I\u0027ve written [an example Funding Modifier](https://github.com/magico13/BROKE/tree/master/BROKEExampleFundingModifier) that should hopefully make it pretty clear what you have to do. Just compile it as a .dll and place the .dll next to the BROKE.dll in the GameData/BROKE folder, and BROKE will handle loading it and calling all the methods at the right times. I\u0027ll probably write up a tutorial for it some time, to make it even clearer, but until then please ask questions if you have them!\n\nSo if you can think of something that should adjust a player\u0027s funds on a quarterly or yearly basis, either write up a Funding Modifier, or at least mention it here and maybe I or someone else will write it up.

Is this intentional?\n\nI wasn\u0027t even aware loans were implemented yet (I haven\u0027t worked on that code at all), nor am I aware of how to even take out a loan. That doesn\u0027t sound intentional though, so hopefully jkortech sees this and can confirm. Consider loans to be very WIP at the moment."},{"CreatedByName":"baldamundo","CreatedById":138417,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-21T21:57:50Z","Content":"In the original mod there was also the bug where if you typed in a negative number to the repayment field, you\u0027d get free money - so may want to check for that as well ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-21T22:01:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E In the original mod there was also the bug where if you typed in a negative number to the repayment field, you\u0027d get free money - so may want to check for that as well ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nI believe loans are being handled as normal Invoices, in which case you don\u0027t pay them off separately. Negative numbers in the payment field currently are implemented as \u0022Pay the maximum possible\u0022. We should add the option to pay off some of the remaining balance on a loan above and beyond the required payment, so I\u0027ll make sure that\u0027s included somewhere. Loans will likely have their own GUI in addition to the main BROKE GUI."}]}
