I am going through the tutorials and Docking is most challenging to me!\n\nNow I can encounter then match velocity with the target ship. However I still have a major problem with finally docking with it. I checked here and did find lots of useful resources. HOWEVER, they all assume that you can switch to the target ship, and turn it towards to the rescue ship.\n\nI am doing the training session of KSP. The docking training has a target ship which you can switch to (e.g. by pressing [ or ] ), BUT you can NOT turn it. It seems the RCS is broken.\n\nSo my question is, how to dock with a target you can not control? The target ship is spinning around (even it is slow), and there is no way to follow it. To me it is impossible to use RCS jetting around to catch that spinning docking port...\n\nAny comment is highly appreciated. Thanks a lot!"},{"CreatedByName":"Rfmeijboom","CreatedById":91078,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T11:29:46Z","Content":"The spinning is the only thing that makes it a bit more difficult.\n\nFirst you should learn to dock with another stationary vessel without switching to it.\n\nThe way I do it:\n\n- Match alignment with the target\n\n- switch to locked camera view\n\n- move the camera so you look at the back of your ship.\n\n- Use RCS translation until you are aligned with the docking port.\n\n- cancel relative velocity and move forwards.\n\nI build my entire [space station](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122878-Construction-of-my-orbital-space-station) without ever switching to the station to align the craft.\n\nOnce you get the hang of docking like this, you can do the same with a spinning target.\n\nAlign yourself with the plane of rotation of the target (so the docking port will pass in front of your vessel in every rotation.\n\nThen aproach to within a few meters and when the docking port is almost aligned move forwards a bit.\n\nThere probably are better ways to do it, but this is what I do and I know it works.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-05T11:34:48Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2015 11:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Rfmeijboom**"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T11:30:01Z","Content":"If the RCS is broken, what about SAS?

It lets you form a docking attachment with a target wherever it happens to connect. \n\nMatch velocities so your ship is centered \u0022over\u0022 the axis of rotation of the other ship - you can view your ship from behind and see the other one turning clockwise (or anti) and your ship is directly opposite the point that it\u0027s turning around.

Turn off SAS or whatever mod may be stabilizing you and move in at 1 to 2 m/s while matching rotation (Q and E) with the target. Hum the Blue Danube Waltz...\n\nBoom, you dock and as an extra bonus, if you hit the center your ship\u0027s thrust is aligned through the target\u0027s center of mass, so you can maneuver.
