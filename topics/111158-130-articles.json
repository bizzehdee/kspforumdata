Or somehow else?\n\u003E \n\nWe have three choices. We can hard delete it, but we only ever do that with spam posts or buggy things which can\u0027t be saved, such as huge error log files which are causing forum glitches. We don\u0027t like to do that, though, because it doesn\u0027t leave a record of what has happened. Most often we \u0022hide\u0022 posts, which leaves them where they are and visible to moderators, but normal forum members do not see them. For the really nasty stuff, we have a subforum, not accessible by normal forum members, where we can move things for storage and possible later reference."},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-21T07:04:45Z","Content":"[@Vanamonde](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/27914-vanamonde/) Dude... what happened to your banana?
