If GPU passes the tests, then I would create a new, separate KSP stock only install, reduce graphics settings to minimums, and verify that issue still exists. Then re-install the latest video drivers for your GPU. If possible, completely uninstall existing drivers. Then install the latest drivers from the manufacturers website. I know very little about ubuntu, but I would think troubleshooting a video card would be a similar process no matter what the OS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"s10w10rr1s","CreatedById":107143,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T00:25:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ebump. still no solution and i am itching to play on linux.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
