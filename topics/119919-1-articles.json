The first definition of real also fits. However, the second and third definitions of real propose two questions: \u0022Are we faking this?\u0022 and \u0022Are we important?\u0022 I wouldn\u0027t, by my own observations and opinions, say that most people on this forum are false in their zeal for games, be they computer, board, card, or etc. However, I think that the entire gaming community and even history is the jury on whether or not we are important. To answer this question ourselves would brand us self-important, and self-importance leads to self-destruction. If I were on the outside then I would class us as not important, after all we are an incredibly small community playing a game that is vastly outclassed by such games as Word of Warcraft, Call of Duty, or one of the many popular video games on the market and that are still being played. We have very little, if any effect on the gaming industry, and I don\u0027t think we\u0027ll ever get to the level of a medium-large publisher such as Valve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApart from the dictionary definition, there is also the cultural effect of labeling something real. In the context of gaming, real would probably mean having a lot of experience in a wide range of genres and styles. There may also be time commitments and levels of skill that would have to be achieved to meet a personal or group standard of a \u0022real gamer\u0022. But, in conclusion, I think it depends on what the definition is, how you apply it, and who you\u0027re talking to if you meet the definition of \u0022real gamer\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Columbia","CreatedById":135031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-02T06:55:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf it doesn\u0027t go against Community Rules, can I take a look at the video?
