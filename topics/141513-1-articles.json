Now I\u0027m playing on Science Mode and I want to land a Kerbal on the Mun, but I have a problem. I\u0027ve built a rocket that can easily reach Orbit and even the Mun. But as soon as I add landing struts to the \u0022landing part\u0022 I can\u0027t seem to launch the rocket from the launchpad straight up. Without the struts reaching orbit is easy, with them I just can\u0027t manage because the rocket starts tipping straight away... Is it normal that the landing struts have such a large impact? And what can I do to fix the problem? Maybe I am attaching them wrong, but I tried to balance them out and everything.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow some screenshots of my rocket with and\u00A0without landing struts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for your help!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithout landing struts:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mGlgCdQ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mGlgCdQ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith 3 landing struts:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XruCvrt.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022XruCvrt.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith 6 landing struts, symmetrical to the tanks below:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WcA3Vo8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022WcA3Vo8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ibanix","CreatedById":147140,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-09T19:48:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe landing legs (\u0027struts\u0027 is used by most players to mean the struts that hold ships together) may be causing excess drag.

I don\u0027t use landing legs in 1.1.2 at all, because of the issues (I tend to use wing parts for landing legs instead). However, I think I see that you have some actual struts in there, too. And I can tell you for a fact that struts sometimes have a bug that makes them have large off-center masses which will cause your ship to veer. It may be that the landing legs have that same off-center mass issue that struts do. I don\u0027t think this is an issue with your rocket design -- although snark\u0027s suggestions are good ones in general. But all I can suggest is to trash the legs and land on something else until the leg issues are resolved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpitfireJoe","CreatedById":165340,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-10T11:02:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for all the suggestions!
