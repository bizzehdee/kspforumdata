Cute little thing, it was one of my most successful sleepers: even though it didn\u0027t generate that many comments (and let\u0027s face it, it wasn\u0027t terribly practical, it had a high part count, fuel consmption, and not so big payload) both it, and especially the base I built with it, have gotten close to 2k downloads, even though they also got pretty outdated a couple of versions ago. I doubt you remember the first one, though: that was like 0.19 or so! Anyhow, the Eagle lookalike has gotten to be one of \u0022my things\u0022, which is curious considering I haven\u0027t even watched the show it\u0027s made from, and the think the whole design, while pretty, is pretty crappy \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E. But this is KSP, I am pretty decent with the building tools, and the part selection now allows some pretty cool stuff. So without further due, the most sci-fish of my ships yet, and this time it turns out to be damn useful and powerful: meet the Eagle MkV! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/YmTMYJ8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YmTMYJ8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022YmTMYJ8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo launch vehicle this time! Just good old fashioned air hogging, thrust, and lots of fuel. I\u0027ve got to say, the performance has me a little worried: while getting a more than decent payload of about 20mT and the same payload dimensions as the old one, it is still capable of going to Munar orbit in a single stage to refuel there! The amount of fuel you use to drop the cargo on the Mun and get back up is truly ridiculous, BTW (as in, no need to put any fuel on the two main tanks). And sure, it SSTO\u0027es from kerbin with 20mT loads mainly because of the unrealistic airbreathers, but check this out: it also gets 2km/s with full LFO mix in non-oxygenated atmospheres! So Duna SSTO is also covered, as well as most moons. There are chutes in case you have difficulty nailing good landings on airbreathing engines, too, though you can use the rocket setting on the RAPIERS to have a quicker response time. And of course you can use the nukes for incredible efficiency, so this can actually haul more than what you put in the bay between planets, thanks to the rear-facing docking port. Like, say, a whole base pack (sold separately! right now all you get is the fuel dump):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/ijskXmL\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ijskXmL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ijskXmL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you can guess that the testing implied plenty of landings on Mun. I\u0027m setting a new base there with one of these babies, and probably make a lot of money in the meantime with all the contracts... only this time I got to a very scenic location. Would you believe I got a kethane deposit right there? Anyhow, if you don\u0027t play with that mod, don\u0027t worry about the fuel bill that much: so fay I\u0027ve spent less than one orange tank in dropping three of the base modules! It also has tons of little details like a universal port in the bay, or one hanging from the CoM, so you put all kind of things there to suit your needs, or a landing light system that is synchronized with the landing gear without you doing anything and put in a separate action group so you don\u0027t deploy the landing gears in the payload by accident. It helps that I\u0027ve been playing with it on and off for months! I have gone straight from MkIII to MkV due to game versions catching up on me... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E Anyhow, I think it was worth it, and hope you do so too!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/60gMGwy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/60gMGwy.png\u0022 alt=\u002260gMGwy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/Gu7LbJi\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Gu7LbJi.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Gu7LbJi.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the huge tank size means that when you have a fuel source (and we are getting a stock one soon, right? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E) it makes a more than decent tanker. So a true jack of all trades that will service any needs you space program might have. Want to have a satellite put into orbit cheaply? It might have a huge capital cost, but with an Eagle you only use fuel. Build base on Mun? Just say where and put an orange tank in orbit so it can refuel. take some modules to Laythe to set up a colony there? I\u0027ve got you covered, just a matter of gas. Need a Kethane tanker to service said colony? Just build a kethane module for it, and this will also do it in it\u0027s spare time. Some scientific surveys on Duna\u0027s icecaps? Again, just stuff things in the cargo bay and have the depot system set up. If there ever was a definitive ship, ladies and gentlekerbs, I think this is it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and if anyone needs a flight plan, I could write it up... but as a VTOL SSTO, it\u0027s pretty darn simple: get quickly to about 25kms up and make a speed run there, to a target flameout speed of about 1,400-1,500m/s at 27kms where you switch the RAPIERS to rocket, then above 32kms or so the jets give out.

First, control from the docking port on top of the ship, and activate turbos and RAPIERS. You shouldn\u0027t touch the nukes before it\u0027s time to circularize orbit!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen start up vertically until you reach about 10kms. From there to 20kms, tilt slowly down so that your vertical velocity stays under 200m/s, and you pick lateral velocity. When you go over 20kms and the air start getting really thin, pitch down even more to bring your vertical velocity to 50m/s or so, so that you have time to speed up to 1,500m/s or so before the turbojets start whining about lack of air at about 26kms. When they do, press \u00224\u0022 to switch the RAPIERs to rocket mode, but keep the jets going until they start flaming out. By the time the jets give out, you should be be at 1,800m/s (surface) and with an apo over 50-60 kms. A bit more push with the RAPIERs to get the apoapsis to about 70, and then you can switch the control point to the crew cabin and light up\u0060the nukes for circularization and efficient in-space propulsion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
