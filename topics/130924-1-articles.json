I would like to talk about a feature that I am waiting for, for quite some time now. This feature I dont think is (correct me if I am wrong)\u00A0implemented in the game yet and it\u00A0will enable the player to tick the box at the start of a new game which will add\u00A0a whole new different gameplay into KSP. This feature is where devices have connection with the main base and each other. A bit like RemoteTech I think. This will add a whole new realistic feature into the game also allowing the satellite antennas to be more useful.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022raENChN.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/raENChN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-28T16:34:16Z\u0022 title=\u002201/28/2016 04:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by DPPCGaming\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-28T16:45:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello DPPCGaming, you may be interested in\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/developerarticles.html/development-relay-r172/\u0022\u003E this article\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DPPCGaming","CreatedById":157750,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-28T17:05:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh thanks man I didn\u0027t know\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
