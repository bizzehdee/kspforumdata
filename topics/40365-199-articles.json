Their primary use at a low tech level is either powering thermal turbojets or generating a large amount of electricity. The 2.5m and 3.75m unupgraded reactors have superior T/W with LFO over stock LV-Ns, although they are larger and heavier and have a lower ISP. The 3.75m can even match the LV-N in T/W using pure liquid fuel, which gives you superior ISP (915s vs 800s).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese numbers are all considering Uranium-powered reactors.

I stuck them all in the last few nodes along side the various stock parts as appropriate ie xenon tanks together etc. I\u0027ve also made a few other changes/additions. The orange tanks in the image are actually just liquid fuel rather than fuel \u002B oxidiser. I also added a couple of argon tanks etc using the xenon tanks as a template.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe easiest way to add the changes needed is to look at one of stock parts and copy the research lines into the various configs. I used editpad as it allowed me to do the changes to many files at once. I can\u0027t find a license for the mod so I\u0027m not sure where we stand distributing the changed configs. I suppose you could always use module manager to make the changes, but I\u0027m not that familiar with it, and the only reason it\u0027s in my install is because interstellar uses it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERuss\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NotunMojarGame21","CreatedById":67216,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T07:50:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, the forum has 497 pages so far...I can\u0027t find out how to and where the answer to my question would lie.
