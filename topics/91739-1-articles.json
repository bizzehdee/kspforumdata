That\u0027s problematic sometimes, when you want to change the orientation during flight, or with rovers or VTOL spacecraft. This is critical for MechJeb\u0027s Rover Autopilot and Translatron, for instance, and I often find myself having to awkwardly stick a probe core or docking port somewhere in order to be able to use it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would love to have a mod that can change the craft\u0027s orientation by 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 in any axis, or at least a single small part that can do it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-01T19:36:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree, a mod or setting in a mod would be nice...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut here\u0027s a thought, in the mean time...What about setting up an action group command for the \u0022Control from here\u0022 toggle on the part(s) you need to switch between?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you have me thinking if that would work, cuz I sometimes initiate hi-speed maneuvers before remembering to switch, which leads to all sorts of destruction...lol\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lodestar","CreatedById":101720,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-01T19:58:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think you can set an action group for the \u0022Control from here\u0022 on stock KSP.

Due to how \u0022vessel orientation\u0022 is the same as the \u0022Control From Here part orientation\u0022, just renamed, you have to switch to a part with a different rotation to achieve the effect you are looking for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lodestar","CreatedById":101720,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-01T22:18:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat isn\u0027t really a workaround for the issue, since it still requires an extra part to do that.
