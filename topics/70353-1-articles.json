In career mode, with ~2/3 unlocked. Having just unlocked nuclear engines I decided to get ambitious and send Jeb to Duna (and bring him back too.) I went with a two ship design, a Tug ship to go there and back, and a lander to land on both Duna and Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Tug consisted of 4 LN engines and Fuel tanks, an SAS wheel, monopropellent, RCS thusters solar panels and lots of struts. A docking port at the bottom of the centeral fuel tank is where the lander attached. If all went according to plan the Tug would end up in orbit of Kerbin, just needing to be refueled for later missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn lander I ran into my first issue, how much power would I need to get from the surface to orbit and docking. I could find the dV, but wasn\u0027t sure which engine would be required to lift the 8-10 ton lander. I decided to go big and used the LT-45, just to be sure. The lander was designed so I would only need the engine to deorbit. On Duna I would need a short burst right before touch down to ensure a safe landing, but most of the slowing would be by parachute. On Kerbin, the parachutes could do all the work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gVB0MGw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022gVB0MGw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, some words about me. First, I play stock, no mods, not sure if I\u0027m just to lazy to install them, or to stubborn. Next, I am not the most efficient flyer. I always seem to burn more fuel than probably most others. This leads me to bring along more fuel, which leads to needing more power, which leads to needing more fuel.....yes it\u0027s a viscous circle. Also I think I tend to overbuild things, part of the fuel thing I suppose. But I never seem to trust that something so small, with so tiny engines and so little fuel will actually get there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now my talk begins. I had a surprising successful first launch. I launched it all as one unit, and with the Tug so much heavier than the lander I worried about the stress on the docking port. But struts and bracing down to the launch vehicle took care of it first try. I even had enough fuel left in the launch vehicle for a 2 second burn on the escape.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut here our first issue was encountered. Duna was not in the optimal position. I was too late. Instead of ~45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 it was closer to 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. Oh well, go for it, I should be OK, I always bring extra fuel. OK, after initial burn I was close, my mid course correction got me an intersect, at this point I was starting to worry about the fuel, I had burned an awful lot. OK, inside Duna SOI, but way off, didn\u0027t realize my inclination was so off, I was way below the planet and not going anywhere near it. Another long burn to get into orbit, and a second to circularize it. At this point, nope not going home, doubt I could get back out of Duna space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell lets do the lander and see how that works since were here. Unlocked, deorbit, landed, everything worked right, yeah. Took off, got my orbit close, got the inclination matched, tried to get close to Tug. Oops ran out of fuel still no where close to Tug. Also noticed small design flaw, the lander was suppose to have 2 sets of RCS thrusters, one at each end of the ship so I didn\u0027t have to worry about unintended torque if they didn\u0027t line up with the CoM. The bottom set is missing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo After all this fustration I reloaded and earlier save and set the whole thing to a fiery death. I did end up having pity on Jeb and brought the lander down safely just before the water claimed it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vRgUkIV.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vRgUkIV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo was it all me?

Your TWR starts at about 6 and ends up at 20. You could use 5 x 48-7S\u0027s, one on each fuel tank and one on the main lander and save yourself 1 ton of weight.
