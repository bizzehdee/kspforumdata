Let\u0027s put it to a challenge!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here you are with a fledgling space program. Pity nobody\u0027s heard of you or allocated a budget, though. Sure, you could work diligently and spend weeks sending out explorer after explorer to boot up your program, but why wait? How far can you get in EXACTLY FIVE FLIGHTS?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs your starting scenario, select \u0022Hard Mode\u0022 and set starting funds, science, and reputation to zero. Obviously feel free to prototype your missions before flying for real -- whether this means trying first in sandbox or turning Revert back on doesn\u0027t matter to me. Your game should be 1.0.2 Stock. Informational mods are fine in the VAB, but turn \u0027em off in flight. Otherwise MJ and friends negate too much of the downside of the Tier-0 Tracking Station. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, the only rules are, get as far as you can with your five flights. If you roll it out on the Launchpad/Runway and hit Spacebar, it counts, even if it\u0027s just a \u0022Test on the launchpad\u0022 contract. To make things clearer in your screenshots or video, name your craft like I do below, \u0022Number One\u0022 through \u0022Number Five\u0022 or something similar. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: RULES CLARIFICATIONS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Yes you can revert or use quicksaves if you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* You get to deploy five crafts from the VAB/SPH, period. A pod that rolls around the KSC still counts as one of your \u0022flights.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESCORING: The interesting variable is how far you got, not how rich you got. So scoring will be by experience. Refer to the Experience table here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Experience\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Experience\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour score will be the highest experience award any of your Kerbals would get over the course of your missions. So if you got a Kerbal to Kerbin orbit, you get 2 points. If you planted a flag on Duna, you get 12.5 points, even if they haven\u0027t gotten the XP yet because the return craft would be Number Six.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the first contestant to submit a finished campaign also nearly maxed out this method of scoring, you also get a tie-breaker score. Ties are broken by total XP accomplishments for your entire program -- that is, add up the highest XP accomplishments per SOI just like the game does, but total it as if your entire space program was executed by a single Kerbal. So if Jeb went to Laythe but Val also orbited Mun at some point, your headline score is 20 points (Flag on Laythe), and your tie-breaker score is 40 points (Kerbin orbit \u002B Mun orbit \u002B Kerbol orbit \u002B Jool orbit \u002B Laythe flag).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd in the interest of not relying TOO heavily on the \u0022Jeb can come home on flight 6\u0022 rule, you get a 20% bonus to the tie-breaker score if all Kerbonauts are recovered back on Kerbin after five flights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my take, to give you the idea. As you see, I manage to get set up to farm almost unlimited funds, but only make it to Mun orbit.
