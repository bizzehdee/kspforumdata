At first i was able to run many missions, using revert, quickload, spacecenter, etc. Now it happens every single time. the game is unplayable. I also use realchutes but regardless, because most of my constructs don\u0027t even have the stock chute on them. Some had been in orbits doing survey (SCANsat) and were fine, now... all craft whether new or older designs suffer this. Also if I separate a lander from a Cmd Module in an orbit - when i return to it after landing - I find it has blown up, and all that usually remains is just the module and no crew.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehopefully someone discovers this soon.
