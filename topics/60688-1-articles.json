It started out with about 10000 m/s deltaV, and with my limited experience in interplanetary travel I managed to establish an encounter with the planet with a periapse of 40 km, so I can use the most of the Oberth-effect. But when I created the node for a braking maneuver at PE I was shocked: it required 5500 m/s deltaV!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this normal being in the inner kerbol system, and I came in at the fastest part of my orbit around Kerbol, so orbital mechanics say I should be pretty fast, which I was: not much inside Moho\u0027s SOI I was flying at around 6100 m/s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut still 5500 m/s seems harsh.

There are two things I\u0027ve figure out so far to help reduce your delta-v requirements. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first is common to any planet and it looks like you did it, which is try to get your PE as low as you can before you even enter Moho\u0027s SOI. With tweakables you can lower your engine output to as little as 5.5% (this can be changed in flight, not just in the VAB) which gives you the fine control to adjust your PE while still days or weeks away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second thing which will probably shave about 1000 - 1500 m/s off the capture is to try and get your inclination matched up to Moho\u0027s for your encounter. If you do it during your mid course correction it will probably only cost 200-300 m/s, though you might need an extra orbit before the encounter. Basically think of it like docking, when you reach Moho you\u0027re going to need to zero out the relative velocity and make your orbit match Moho. Now you\u0027ll get an assist from Moho\u0027s gravity but the ratio of that assist compared to your very high orbital velocity will be much less then you get with other planets farther out. Coming in on an incline means you\u0027ll have to cancel out all of that \u0027vertical\u0027 velocity, and your velocity being so high the vertical portion will be high too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-22T04:05:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/61478-Oh-bugger-Injection-burn-at-Moho?p=835667#post835667\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGo maccollo!!!\u003C/a\u003E - A post from a couple of months ago, with instructions on how to get to Moho for just 4,000 m/s of delta-V.

You should be able to get from Kerbin orbit to Moho orbit for around 5000 m/s without too much trouble. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best advice I have is to completely ignore Moho\u0027s position relative to Kerbin\u0027s. Just start the transfer burn from Kerbin so that you touch Moho\u0027s orbit near its closest approach to the sun. Then treat the encounter like a docking rendezvous. It might take a few orbits to get everything lined up, but this way you can ensure that you get an ideal encounter with Moho, one where your solar periapsis matches Moho\u0027s and you meet at that point.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technion","CreatedById":85380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-22T07:32:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe transport I took to Moho was built for my Jolean tour.
