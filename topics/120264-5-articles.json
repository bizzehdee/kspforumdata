Because why? If we drop the travel time to a less absurd number, then the transfers might become visible. Wouldn\u0027t you just constantly send mines wherever you might suspect a possible threat? Again, the universe and politics need to be established in advance to make sense of any space warfare scenarios. Modern notions of warfare would not predict that navies in the age of sail would work so very hard to take ships as prizes, for example.
