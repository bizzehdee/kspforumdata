The first thing after a reboot and self-test... reacquire signal from Control. You engrave into the most durable possible storage all of the info needed to restore power to antennas, aim them at known stations, and lock on.

It may just use too much power to run continuously. So you always include a low-bandwidth channel, an entire, distinct subsystem. This may not even have ability to report, although it should report status, at least. What it certainly can do is hear MC, even under very difficult conditions. It may only be able to hear the commands: \u003Cstrong\u003EWake Up! and Turn On Your Big Ears!\u003C/strong\u003E But the probe will not be \u003Cem\u003Edead\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you simply do not spend $10 million to put up a probe and as soon as it goes around the Moon, you lose it.

Suggest you trash it altogether. We already have a flight computer; it\u0027s called MechJeb; and it\u0027s in constant use by many players. You need to get in there anyway because MJ, now, simply ignores signal delay. Write a MJ submodule, get that working properly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the endless juggling of RT2 antennas, comsats, and stations... no, just no. I absolutely endorse the demand that one launch sufficient comsats to maintain control: \u003Cstrong\u003EIf you want to talk to, or hear, your robot probe then a path from MC to the probe must exist and each link in the path must be a straight line not passing through any celestial body. \u003C/strong\u003EAbsolutely. But let the computers embedded in the network decide how to route the signals. Do not ask me to dedicate any more dishes!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand that the game engine really isn\u0027t sophisticated enough to aim, physically, a dish directly at another dish a billion meters away. I fear an attempt was made to substitute, for this realistic requirement, the funky requirement to dedicate a dish to a single target. Bad idea. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s an oddity of the core KSP game that not more than one craft is \u0022active\u0022 at any time; and then there\u0027s a gray area defined by physics range: Within a radius of a bit more than 2 km, other craft are pseudo-active. If this were not the case then there would be a clear motivation for multiple antennas on comsats, with multiple probes all transmitting reports, receiving new programs, or sending HD video of that leaky pipe aft. As it is, and as RT2 is now, I find it very hard to justify a comsat containing 24 huge dishes. But it\u0027s either that or spend all day re-dedicating the dishes I do have, instead of building and launching rockets. This stinks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis stinks all the more because a single omnidirectional antenna seems to be able to handle infinite bandwidth -- one omni can control a thousand probes within its range. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA reasonable compromise might well be to take note of how many active links terminate at a given comsat or relay ship; and call this the vessel\u0027s load. If the total bandwidth provided for a given range falls below load, then comms at that range degrade. Then this can be fixed by adding more dishes or omni antennas. Then the distinction between dishes and omnis becomes a little less distinct, as in real life, where the chief difference is \u003Cem\u003Ecapacity\u003C/em\u003E, not dedication. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIn sum: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERT2 does not look sexy, provides player with no new capabilities, extends nothing, makes nothing easier, gives nothing, yields no science.

I absolutely endorse the demand that one launch sufficient comsats to maintain control: \u003Cstrong\u003EIf you want to talk to, or hear, your robot probe then a path from MC to the probe must exist and each link in the path must be a straight line not passing through any celestial body. \u003C/strong\u003EAbsolutely. But let the computers embedded in the network decide how to route the signals. Do not ask me to dedicate any more dishes!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand that the game engine really isn\u0027t sophisticated enough to aim, physically, a dish directly at another dish a billion meters away. I fear an attempt was made to substitute, for this realistic requirement, the funky requirement to dedicate a dish to a single target. Bad idea. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s an oddity of the core KSP game that not more than one craft is \u0022active\u0022 at any time; and then there\u0027s a gray area defined by physics range: Within a radius of a bit more than 2 km, other craft are pseudo-active. If this were not the case then there would be a clear motivation for multiple antennas on comsats, with multiple probes all transmitting reports, receiving new programs, or sending HD video of that leaky pipe aft. As it is, and as RT2 is now, I find it very hard to justify a comsat containing 24 huge dishes. But it\u0027s either that or spend all day re-dedicating the dishes I do have, instead of building and launching rockets. This stinks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis stinks all the more because a single omnidirectional antenna seems to be able to handle infinite bandwidth -- one omni can control a thousand probes within its range. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA reasonable compromise might well be to take note of how many active links terminate at a given comsat or relay ship; and call this the vessel\u0027s load. If the total bandwidth provided for a given range falls below load, then comms at that range degrade. Then this can be fixed by adding more dishes or omni antennas. Then the distinction between dishes and omnis becomes a little less distinct, as in real life, where the chief difference is \u003Cem\u003Ecapacity\u003C/em\u003E, not dedication. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIn sum: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERT2 does not look sexy, provides player with no new capabilities, extends nothing, makes nothing easier, gives nothing, yields no science.

There are things that RT2 does that doesn\u0027t make sense. Fun to play with setting up commsat relay networks, but network management too quickly becomes a chore to perform.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Aiming\u0027 dishes is the biggest hassle for any large network. And as a player, being only one person simulating the task of thousands of engineers and techs, \u0027set-it-and-forget-it\u0027 and automation are key factors I look for. Personally, I like the operational cone, but there are some things that need to be pointed out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost importantly, the dish is the receiver. When beaming a signal, you don\u0027t need to bounce it off a reflector, you just beam it. The dish is used to refocus an incoming signal so you can boost a faint one to recover from attenuation. In this manner, the ability for a satellite to listen is independent of its ability to talk. Of course, most functions of this manner are engineered to complement each other. But it should be noted that larger dishes/arrays are better at listening to faint signals because the surface area of the reflector gives it more signal to focus on the reciever. Which means that you can use a huge dish on the ground to receive a satellite\u0027s weak signal, but only a small dish on the satellite to receive power from a ground antenna/array with powerful power amplifier systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I were to change dish behaviors, I\u0027d make them reflect this. Dishes would have two features. One being signal receive boost, and the other being a tweakable power level. I\u0027d have to review actual receiver dish dynamics to see how the FoV cones behave, but this would be my first \u0027tweak\u0027. Then you can set up tiny satellites in orbit with powerful transmitters (Solar Panels are going to get more important) talking to ground, but small reflector dishes because they don\u0027t need to recover much signal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, this would require the addition of a \u0027signal strength\u0027 function and free space attenuation over distance. In this manner, an antennae no longer has a fixed \u0027range\u0027. But rather, \u0027range\u0027 is determined by a combination of the signal power of the transmitter, and the size of the receiving dish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this got reworked into remote tech, I would suggest a simple GUI menued calculator that lets the player find the communications ability of any combination of dishes and power levels. The headaches that would occur otherwise...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if this change were to occur, omnis would require reworks as well. Transmission and reception are independent functions. You don\u0027t actually transmit on the same antenna you receive on. Otherwise, your Xmit signal would burn up your receive channel right at the electrical connection. So any given commsat would require two omnis for full comms. One to transmit, and one set to receive. (In real life, Xmit and receive occur on two different frequencies so the having an Xmitter next to a Rcvr doesn\u0027t result in the Rcvr just being jammed.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t get into forcing the player to set frequencies or play with bandwidth. It might be fun early on, but that gets too close to becoming a chore for my taste when you have expanded networks. If frequencies and bandwidth are to be handled, let RTech handle said function in the background and automate connections. Players have a hard enough time understanding current RTech-2\u0027s mechanics. Don\u0027t force advanced telecommunications theory down their throat. I\u0027m coming up on the end of my electronics degree plan and I\u0027m thinking that would be a little too much like Work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut anyway... for Omnidirectional Antennae, they would need two (three, technically) tweakables functions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: On/Off obviously. Antenna needs low power for receive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Switch between Rcv and Xmit so players can define the antenna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: Xmit Power level. (On an exponential electricity usage curve.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnless of course, the antennae are tweaked to show two of them. The Always On one is a good example of this. And since Omnis all effectively behave the same way, you don\u0027t really need to have two dozen different types aside from choices in style and maybe methods of how they deploy when turned on. (The only real purpose of different length omnis is that you need a longer antenna for lower frequencies. But like I said, I don\u0027t want to subject players to a college level communications course just to play a game.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if one asks why dishes can Xmit and receive at the same time, but not omnis, I should point out that a dish already IS technically two antennae. If you look at a satellite dish, the horn sticking out in front of it has a receiver facing the dish itself, and the beam is fired out the feeder horn on the part facing out. At least, on dishes that actually do transmission. Your DISH network Satellite Television dish bolted onto the side of your house doesn\u0027t transmit, so you won\u0027t see that just walking outside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the next thing I\u0027d speak of is aiming dishes. Like I said, I need to review reflectors to see their actual FoV mechanics, but believe it or not, just because the main uplink is down doesn\u0027t mean the device can\u0027t hear you. If we switch to power attenuation models instead of current models of fixed range and aim, then technically all you need is raw power from the Xmitter to at least \u0027ping\u0027 the satellite or in the case of interplanetary distances, your probe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can PING the satellite, you can give it a command, even if it can\u0027t talk. If you have the right device on board, you can get it to lock on to the timing signal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExplaination: On at least military satellite ground dishes, the feeder horn has a receiver built into it that allows it to lock on to a satellite via a weak timing signal. Using four signal detect pads, it evaluates the difference in signal strength across the pads and turns the dish so that the signal levels are even across all four. If we assume that such a component is built into even the most rudimentary probe or satellite, then you should be able to force feed any probe a signal that it will go \u0027oh, I see that\u0027 and lock onto it.. IE \u0027aim\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, there\u0027s control. I know an \u0027established connection\u0027 is a two-way street, but a probe is really just a ten million dollar RC car at its most basic. So long as you can transmit TO it, you should be able to at least control it... Though you don\u0027t get feedback in real life on what you\u0027re actually doing. (Not an issue with typical KSP though unless we force it by say, blacking the camera out.) But if it can\u0027t get a returned signal, you can\u0027t say, get science back from it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt must also be considered that at interplanetary distances, \u0027established connections\u0027 aren\u0027t. Not in the way the IT industry understands them anyway. Packet exchange occurs, but it\u0027s not the fast back and forth of TCPIP. It takes seconds to minutes to receive the data packet and then transmit it back across the void. Communications is less like the internet\u0027s traffic streams, and more like two people passing notes back and forth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo really, all this being said... I think the \u0027model\u0027 being used for Remote Tech should be based on power and attenuation. Forget playing Mr. Bandwidth... As neat as that might be, that becomes a headache and I don\u0027t think such a niche mod should be more niche than it already is.

So my thoughts on the topic, the major problem of RT2 in particular and KSP in general that it offers challenges without proper tools to deal with them, i.e. all stock KSP offers challenge in interplanetary travel with very basic tool of maneuver nodes to solve them, same here RT2 offers potentially very interesting and in a way realistic gameplay mechanic with very limited tools to cope with new challenges. And freqent answer for those who are find such a gameplay way too challenging there is a short answer \u0022just get better in the game\u0022. This paradigm should be changed first of all since games are played for fun and entertainment challenges they offer shuld be within the grasp. So here is my thoughts what shuld be changed in RT: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Antenna alignment - There is way too much managing the antennas in the RT2 gameplay right now. As I mentioned before this shuld be automated or simplified in some way. Automatic alignment system, wider signal cones that allow to target Kerbin successfully outside of kerbin SOI e.t.c.

And I believe that investing more of human\\hours on the current flight computer is a waste of time. There is a MechJeb with just everything RT2 player needs. So only thing is required is to add the support for MechJeb to work without the signal by the preprogrammed path. It will solve many things such as landing or launching probes on and from non atmospheric planets with time delay enabled. As well as orbital rendezvous and even docking. Having the MechJeb support will basically allow time delayed gameplay. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

Introduce the signal straight concept, it is very strange that in RT2 mod there is no signal straight. This will help people more intuitively understand the signal loss as well as potentially can lead to some improved gameplay mechanic (i.e. low signal=longer science transfer time and higher energy consumption).

Something like that is simply too ambitious for the manpower we have available. When we took over the project, Remote Technologies Group decided to go with small, incremental changes to the existing mod rather than starting over. It\u0027s less flashy. It means no single release will fix everything. But it gets results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, to echo what Cilph said above, please post \u003Cem\u003Especific, well-contained\u003C/em\u003E changes (e.g. \u0022I want satellites to pick targets intelligently\u0022 rather than \u0022I want you to redo everything\u0022) to GitHub or, if you really can\u0027t set up an account, this forum. Specific goals are something we can realistically act on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, replacing the flight computer with MechJeb. Some of you love MechJeb. That\u0027s great. But other players hate MechJeb, and I mean really hate it. It\u0027s one of the few mods that get branded as \u0022cheating\u0022. While we would like to see MechJeb integration in the future (and I have no idea whether it\u0027s really as simple as \u0022just write a MechJeb module\u0022, as two people above have claimed), we will never, ever, ever make it so that you \u003Cem\u003Emust\u003C/em\u003E have MechJeb to play RemoteTech. That would just alienate too many players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs the built-in flight computer broken? Yes, but it can be fixed, and more easily than some of you seem to think. It\u0027s one of the big things we\u0027ve been working on, actually. The recent update has already made the computer much more accurate at executing complete burns. We\u0027ve got an update to RCS support in the works (using code from MechJeb, in fact), and getting more precise (and more stable) pointing will come next. So please bear with us just a little bit longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the most common complaint in the last 20 posts is that RemoteTech requires lots of micromanagement. This, I\u0027ll admit, is a serious issue -- because the current rules were not designed to require lots of micromanagement. Clearly, something\u0027s not working as intended.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ve already gotten a couple of specific suggestions to make things better. One is dish auto-targeting (there\u0027s a discussion about what exactly that should entail on \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/RemoteTechnologiesGroup/RemoteTech/issues/107\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis GitHub thread\u003C/a\u003E). Another is making cones behave more consistently and intuitively (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/RemoteTechnologiesGroup/RemoteTech/issues/13\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/RemoteTechnologiesGroup/RemoteTech/issues/14\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E, and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/RemoteTechnologiesGroup/RemoteTech/issues/27\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E). Yet another is adding connection diagnostics (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/RemoteTechnologiesGroup/RemoteTech/issues/31\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I would like to see from the community, however, and I\u0027ve asked this before, is \u003Cstrong\u003Eexamples\u003C/strong\u003E of how your networks are set up at the moment. How many satellites do you use? How many dishes? Where are those dishes pointed? Most importantly, \u003Cem\u003Ewhich part requires ongoing management\u003C/em\u003E? Knowing how RemoteTech actually gets used by the average player will help us improve the game rules much more than merely saying \u0022RemoteTech requires juggling\u0022 as if it were obvious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that covers about everything.
