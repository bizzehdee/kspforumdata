The transmission would be an insurance to get a little something, even if the return to kerbin goes bad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample : I take a few samples of the Mun\u0027s soil. I can transmit my team\u0027s observations on it, (or transmit the results of the science lab\u0027s analysis), that gives me a little science, but i can still get the samples back on kerbin for further study of it (and then, get the remaining science point).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy would my soil samples disappear when i transmit my in-space study of it ? I should always be able to take it back to kerbin to study it with better equipment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-26T11:13:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnswer 1) Kerbals use Wonkavision to transmit their experiments\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnswer 2) You are absolutely right and it makes no sense whatsoever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are really two types of experiments: Physical and Data. Data experiments should transmit back for 100% (what extra data can we really get from a thermometer by getting it back to the space center?) Physical experiments should allow you to transmit back for some data, but you can\u0027t get the 100% return unless you return the sample. However, transmitting a little should NOT destroy the sample.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is even more important now that Science Jr\u0027s and Goo containers \u0022break\u0022 on their first use. You are being actively discouraged from transmitting data, even more so than you are because of power constraints.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aleis","CreatedById":62823,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-26T16:20:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyour not really being discourged from transmitting data. since it\u0027s a lot easier to make a one way mission than a return, particularly if it\u0027s a surface observation.
