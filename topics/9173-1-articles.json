I came up with a crude way of doing it that you can read through in that plugin\\\u0027s source. Ultimately I was setting vessel.transform.position to the desired world position vector, but I believe I found that if you did this to a ship that was loaded and running physics, only the command pod would teleport, and as a result the ship would be decapitated. But I found that if you set vessel.transform.position for an unloaded, on-rails vessel, the whole ship would teleport. So I devised a hacky solution where I had the teleport code change the active vessel to a distant vessel, causing the original vessel to go on rails, then code running on the distant vessel would teleport the original vessel, then switch back to the original vessel. It took some care not to crash the game doing this, and it wasn\\\u0027t particularly smooth or reliable, which is part of the reason I haven\\\u0027t worked on that plugin in a while. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut likely my failure to find a good way of doing this is due to my complete ignorance of how Unity works.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zorkinian","CreatedById":3197,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-05T05:35:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBingo!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe_Duck, thanks for the insight.
