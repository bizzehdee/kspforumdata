But the way it\u0027s laid out is simple, Small converter on top, not attached to a tank, fuel lines run from it to a fuel crossfeed capable truss, more fuel lines run from the truss into a flat 2.5 meter tank, then from that tank out to the 4 tanks my engines are attached to. Again the fuel balancer mod makes sure all tanks fill evenly while I\u0027m converting. I also have a Quantum Fuel Transfer mod on it so I can land a tanker next to it and produce fuel and ship it up directly if I want, as well as a Merlins Kethane transfer device on it so I could fill other kethane tanks. (Still playing around with how exactly I want to run this)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-22T21:29:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I\u0027d like to see in a future update: A simple, very light, radially-attachable GPS-like device that shows the scanner map.
