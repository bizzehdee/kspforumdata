This actually performed better than I expected. Btw, this rocket is taller than the VAB-- even when editing it I have to tear off parts and set them to the side in order to be able to see what I\u0027m doing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are five stages:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Lift-off. Eight SRB\u0027s, attached to the rocket through decouplers and crisscrossing support beams, bring the rocket to 1000 m above Kearth and 50 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Initial boost. Four LFE boosters use sixteen tall tanks of fuel to bring the rocket to 250 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Secondary boost. Four heavy LFE\u0027s use twelve tall tanks of fuel to bring the rocket to 1k m/s and out of the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Primary thrust. One heavy LFE uses five tall tanks of fuel to bring the rocket to 3k m/s and escape velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Secondary thrust. One NERVA engine with one tall tank of fuel. By the end of this stage, the rocket is traveling at 8k m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, I\u0027m quite happy with the latest KSP experimental release. Before support struts and the stability changes, I\u0027m not sure that a rocket this tall would\u0027ve been possible. Has anyone seen one this height?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_Barrett","CreatedById":3206,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-11T22:41:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou are lucky strut connectors exist, they are right above the tri-coupler \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dvd","CreatedById":3452,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-12T03:23:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tim_Barrett\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tim_Barrett\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are lucky strut connectors exist, they are right above the tri-coupler \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EYes. I\u0027m aware of that, they are doing their purpose: Keeping the rocket from falling apart. There are in fact numerous crisscrossing strut connectors on the SRB\u0027s. The amount of force put out by them tore the rocket apart multiple times before I figured out exactly how many extra supports I needed.\n"}]}
