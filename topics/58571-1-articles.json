I\u0027ve been lurking around the forums for about the last four months, ever since I\u0027ve started to become glued to KSP. And, I have a question. I don\u0027t know if this is the correct sub forum for this question or not. If it is, good! If not, then I\u0027m so sorry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am a computer engineering student, and I\u0027m looking for a side project to take on. So far, I\u0027ve noticed that there is not a mod manager for KSP. My question is: is there a mod manager currently released or a mod manager currently being developed? I ask because I do not want to put several weeks worth of work into something only to find that someone else already did it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Faark","CreatedById":69775,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T07:39:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/36-Tools-and-Applications\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETools and Applications forum\u003C/a\u003E does contain a few of them, though i haven\u0027t tried any of them myself. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64058-PROPOSAL-Package-Manager-style-for-KSP-Mods\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThat guy\u003C/a\u003E also was recently writing about creating another mod manager.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T18:08:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep, there seem to be two major players so far: KSP Mod Admin \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/26031-Win-KSP-Mod-Admin-v1-3-6-Mod-install-with-2-klicks\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/26031-Win-KSP-Mod-Admin-v1-3-6-Mod-install-with-2-klicks\u003C/a\u003E and KSP Mod Manager \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/13155-Win-With-Auto-Updater!-Kerbal-Space-Program-Mod-Manager\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/13155-Win-With-Auto-Updater!-Kerbal-Space-Program-Mod-Manager\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use and recommend KSP Mod Admin...Regular updates, and LOTS of nice features...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-03T18:10:01Z\u0022 title=\u002201/03/2014 06:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Stone Blue\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
