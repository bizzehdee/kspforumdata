This is being done on a new science save, but given just enough science to unlock the whole tech tree at the beginning. After finishing the tree in 1.0 career, it\u0027s easier not to have to worry about money anymore, but with the benefit of being able to do science experiments unlike in Sandbox. For a bit of backstory, the original four Kerbalnauts are older now, having served as astronauts in the Mercury/Gemini era.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAqua Space Program\u0027s first challenge is the Apollo Applications Program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We choose to go to the Mun, not because it is easy, but because... well, it is easy.

It can lift about 15 tons to LKO, and its most important application, for now, is to test the upper stage and Eddy CSM that will be used in the Mun program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DKUaDhg.png\u0022 alt=\u0022DKUaDhg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first scheduled test is a pad abort test. The LES performs flawlessly, carrying the pod off to the side and out of harm\u0027s way. The parachutes, however, didn\u0027t work the first time. It was determined that the protective cover must be not only separated from the pod, but split before opening the parachutes. This problem was quickly fixed, and the rocket was deemed safe for liftoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Back in my day, we didn\u0027t have any of these fancy safety measures!\u0022 -Jeb, watching the test\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EST-01: Spring Tide 1 and Eddy CSM first manned flight (Apollo 7 equivalent)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Spring Tide 1 rocket lifts off with a three Kerbal crew: Sidely, Ronvin, and Virny.

It carried an operational CSM with unmanned capability, and a dummy lander for weight. The rocket boosted to LKO on the first and second stages, and the third stage performed the de-orbit burn. The stages separated shortly before re-entry, and before separation of the capsule, the unmanned core auto-deployed the parachutes (I set them to deploy at a certain altitude/air pressure and staged them with the service module, since the probe core is on the service module and not the capsule)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh yeah, let the unmanned probe get a soft water landing, when I get bumped on land.

It carries the same dummy lander for weight purposes. The third stage proves more than adequate to boost the rocket to a Free Return trajectory to the Mun. After separation, the CSM establishes a Munar orbit and orbits five times before heading back to Kerbin. Re-entry from this higher altitude uses up more of the shield\u0027s ablator but is well within safe limits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EST-04: (planned to be) LM test flight\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mission will be the first to carry the operational lander, and also the first night launch. The rocket is prepared for liftoff, but immediately upon engine ignition, the first stage explodes! The LES is used to carry the crew to safety. This was probably a kraken attack caused by the slight clipping of the first two stages and the larger number of parts on the finished rocket with the real lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh no, we\u0027re gonna die! ... Wait, we lived?\u0022 - Milzie\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EST-05: First Mun landing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMuch to the objections of the ST-04 crew, their contract specifies one complete mission, so they have to fly this one. Much to the objections of the safety engineers, there weren\u0027t enough Spring Tide M rockets budgeted to use another one just to test the LM. Extensive simulator and ground testing have \u0022proven\u0022 that the LM is ready to go for a Mun landing. The Spring Tide M first stage is hastily reinforced with additional struts. The crew lifts off without any problems this time, and the components of the mission all perform flawlessly, setting the lander down on the Mun in one piece. The rover and science package decouple and are pushed away from the lander\u0027s base. After taking a photo with the flag, the landing crew, Beriella and Lenbree, take a ride in the rover. Though a bit slow, it can climb the hill of the small crater they landed in. Just after pausing to take an overview picture of the crater, they go over a bump in the terrain, there is an explosion on the rover, and connection is lost with KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Come in, landing crew! Are you there? Milzie, can you talk to them?\u0022 - Gene\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Their comms are jammed at the last known frequency.

One orbit later, they dock with Milzie, who was probably sobbing uncontrollably. She was always the melodramatic one on the mission (the other two might be BadS or just have high courage and stupidity). So, I fixed some NaN\u0027s in the persistent file and the rover was back, with no damage. They drove back down to the lander and left the Mun with no further issues.

A launch into Kerbin orbit could utilize existing rocket hardware and distract the press from the (so they thought) disaster. The Spring Tide M rocket was prepared with the upper stage removed and the crewed craft replaced with a small space station and a telescope mount, based on the lander\u0027s upper stage, that could later use RCS to move itself to the side of the station. Unlike a certain space program in an alternate universe with higher delta-V requirements, this station deployed perfectly and is waiting in orbit for its first crew. The mission was hailed as saving the reputation of the Aqua Space Program, though it was really the news that the Kerbals on the Mun were safe.

Its top stage replaced the large lander cans with smaller but heavier Mk1 pods. The small rover was also upgraded, with a wider wheelbase. The crew chosen for this mission was Derus, Alnica, and Meldin. The ship made it to the Mun and braked into orbit. The lander crew plotted a course that would take them down over the MOLAB, which landed in the East Crater. They were off target by about 6 km, so their small rover was used to drive to the larger lab. They took a short drive in the MOLAB, complicated by the fact that the brakes action group wasn\u0027t working at all. The rover left the East Crater and stopped. The two crew then took out the LLES hovercraft in the MOLAB\u0027s rear compartment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a quicksave simulation, they rode it to orbit, to prove it was capable of rescuing them in case of a lander ascent stage malfunction.

It docked and was able to refuel from its larger monopropellent tanks.
