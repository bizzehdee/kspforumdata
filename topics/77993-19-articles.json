There is no \u0027Run Test\u0027 option given. Will try another \u0027test part contract, see whether that works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave just tried the Sepatron 1 test, multiple times. Never any \u0027run test\u0027 option on a right-click. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Erelevant info: I\u0027m running the latest version of Linux Mint, 32-bit version. Clean fresh install of KSP 0.24, then with the Kethane and MechJeb2 installed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll appears to be working fine, except the test contracts. I was ensuring that parts were flown within the parameters given by the contract. With the Sepatron 1 contract, I tried initiation both by the normal next-thing-in-the-stack process, and also by manual intervention (clicking onto the part and setting the thing off). In neither case did I get a \u0027run test\u0027 option on a right-click. Will see if Alt or Alt\u002BWin (which is what I have to do to transfer fuel) works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUPDATE: No, there is NO \u0027right click\u0027 on part to \u0027run test\u0027. Kenbob5588, that was an unhelpful comment, and sidetracked me from where teh real problem lay, unfortunately. The problems I had were caused by a couple of things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Initially, It hadn\u0027t been clear to me that the conditions given for the contract had to be present before the part to be tested was started. I;d somehow gained the impression that so long as the part was operating whilst teh ship was flying within the stated regime that that was what mattered. In this I was incorrect. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. In the Sepratron tests, I hadn\u0027t noticed that the Contract had not remained pinned open - and the LVT45 one was dropping down instead. I didn;t notice this at first due to the red text on slate grey background. I would regard this as a bug - if I click on a contract, I want the durned thing to stay open at THAT contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have now managed to test the LVT45 and complete the contract, but getting to this point was quite an excercise in frustration...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think tea is required. And possibly cake. :-)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-20T12:02:56Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2014 12:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Esme\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-20T10:31:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, the game style has certainly changed, for the better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething from Reddit...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dxNfzbj.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dxNfzbj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E... i\u0027m suffering from a bit of VAB fatigue though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-20T10:56:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bsalis\u0022 data-cite=\u0022bsalis\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYeah, the game style has certainly changed, for the better.\u003Cp\u003ESomething from Reddit...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dxNfzbj.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/dxNfzbj.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E... i\u0027m suffering from a bit of VAB fatigue though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022Science\u0022 craft looks wrong, far too little asparagus staging on that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022Career\u0022 craft looks about right \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
