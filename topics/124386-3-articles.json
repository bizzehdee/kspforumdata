We\u0027ve been using jet engines in ways that would void warranties anywhere else. It\u0027s kind of like \u0027increasing fuel density\u0027 by clipping tanks together. It just ain\u0027t realistic. In that sense, this change is a positive step.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, it does feel a bit like options are being taken away from us. Those engines really were useful, and part of it was because of their compact nature. You could sneak a couple jets in here and there to augment thrust without too much trouble. Since the new engines are gonna be so unwieldy, we won\u0027t have as many ways to use them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat kind of sucks, but then again, it forces us to get creative. I know better than most that VTOLs don\u0027t have to rely on jets (as my sig demonstrates). The jets were super efficient, and easy to spam, so they were super attractive for us VTOL designers, but their low thrust made them a hassle to work with. Now we have actual incentive to use other methods of getting airborne. Vernor engines really are powerful, and you can stick them anywhere to keep things balanced. They\u0027re a great option. I\u0027ve got my fingers crossed that the new tiny jets will work sort of the same. If their turbines are proportionally small, they could work well as place-anywhere thrusters.
