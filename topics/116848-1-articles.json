It literally, has just worked (typical) but now I\u0027m just frustrated and angry at the game. Is it possible that multiple docking nodes cause other docking nodes to malfunction?

It sounds as if, though you\u0027re coming in pretty well for a docking until the last minute, you begin to lose control when you get too close to the docking port. Fine-controlling things is *hard*, especially with misplaced (or absent) RCS thrusters or not enough/too much SAS. I\u0027ve played KSP for thousands of hours, and I still don\u0027t have it down to a science.\n\nThat being said, without any images or videos, it\u0027s difficult to diagnose your problem. For all we know, you could have installed one of the docking adapters upside-down (which is a *very* common problem, believe it or not). Can you please give us a little more information to work with?\n\n-Upsilon\n\n[EDIT: It sounds as if your problem is actually a known bug with the game that causes docking ports to not want to connect.
