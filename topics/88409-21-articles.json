(All RCS, for example.) The Generic Thrusters do (they\u0027re basically just big RCS anyway). Dragon01 pointed out the LMAE did (we need to fix that in RO), and there are some others. But in general you\u0027ll want to use either RCS, or sets of small solid motors as ullage motors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe upcoming RF will make this easier by disabling natural diffusion when you\u0027re under any thrust at all; right now it\u0027s very hard to ullage heavy stages without, say, solid ullage motors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the simple answer is: yup, you make it stable with RCS and then ignite. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T22:52:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECrossposting here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably the hardest thing I\u0027ve ever done in KSP: Use an unguided, solid TLI burn to get a lunar impact.

The probe was a 20in X-Ray core plus 4x Comm16 and a couple 1kg science experiments in addition. The TLI stages were 1x Baby Sergeant and then 6x Baby Sergeant. I had to create a maneuver node of precisely the correct m/s delta V from the kicks (it took some doing to figure out how much kick the decoupler gave too...) The whole Agena\u002Bkick\u002Bpayload was spun up by onboard RCS about a minute prior to TLI, then separated at T-10 (i.e. no more yaw/pitch/roll, just ability to stage), first stage fired at T-7, second at T\u002B1.
