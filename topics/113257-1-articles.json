Even though the spaceplane itself is an SSTO, switching from jets to rockets is analogous to staging boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo as with a rocket, first I build the essential mission payload package (cockpit, docking port, RCS fuel, SAS, probe core, antenna, electrical stuff, plus whatever cargo and/or passenger space). This wad of parts needs sufficient rocket dV and TWR to reach orbit from where the jets die and then either rendezvous with a station or de-orbit, so now I start adding the LFO tanks and rocket/RAPIER engines to the payload. I use either MJ or KER to make sure I have the TWR and dV necessary for this \u0022stage\u0022. If you assume the jets will give you about 1200-1500m/s, then the rockets will need to add about 1000m/s to your speed to reach LKO, plus say 500m/s more for orbital maneuvering. However, given atmospheric drag and Isp effects, and the fact that I haven\u0027t yet added jet fuel tanks, wings, landing gear, etc., I need at least 2000m/s for this \u0022stage\u0022 at this point in the build. More is helpful. Also, TWR with full LFO tanks needs to be at least 1.5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: If using RAPIERs, you\u0027ll probably have to right-click on them and change them to rocket mode so you get the proper numbers in MJ/KER. Don\u0027t forget to switch them back to jet mode before proceeding further.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile building the payload/rocket \u0022stage\u0022 of the spaceplane, I also use RCS Build Aid to manage my CoM. Ultimately, I want the full and empty CoMs to correspond so that trim doesn\u0027t change during flight and RCS translation when docking doesn\u0027t cause rotation. Also, it would be nice if the CoM was near the middle of the cargo bay so that moving things in or out of the bay doesn\u0027t hose the trim. So I rearrange the order of the parts in the core until I get close to what I want, bearing in mind that when I add the jet fuel tanks, wings, and whatnot later I can fine-tune CoM position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK so now it\u0027s time to build the jet \u0022stage\u0022. This consists of LF-only tanks, intakes, wings, and (if needed) separate jet engines, plus landing gear. Also lights, ladders, and whatever other doodads you want. You don\u0027t need a whole lot of jet fuel but you do need a TWR of at least 1.3 with full tanks (more is better), and remember the \u0022precooler\u0022 intake part holds some. In general, for a Mk2 or smaller spaceplane, a single Mk1 fuselage LF tank \u002B 1 precooler \u002B 1 shock cone intake per jet/RAPIER is sufficient for both ascent and any atmospheric flying you need to get back to the runway. Again, use RCS Build Aid to manage your CoM during construction, then adjust wings to put the CoL where it needs to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe final touch, once all the major components are in place and the CoM is how you want it, is to add the RCS thrusters. Again, use RCS Build Aid to balance them out so you don\u0027t get undesired roll when translating.

(IE can you dive quickly) If you only experience issues when diverging from prograde, you need to either increase control authority (add more surfaces) or decrease craft stability (move CoM back and/or CoL forward). The other less common cause is torque caused by engines, check CoM alignment with thrust vector (RCS aid does this well)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor air breathers conservative planning dictates 150 LF units per engine. For accent and landing. My gut says a real number is half that. The amount needed is dictated by flight profile. Note landing LF and tweak downward as needed.

Keeping the fuel in there makes it a reasonable heat sink for the compression heating the nose receives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also avoid using direct node attachmentof my cargo to the body. A reaction wheel is connected to the body and batteries and docking port to that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thermal mass of Mk3 is high, if you see a heat bar on them, you need some measure to avoid heat redistribution before you can cool off. What gives a 2.2 k part heat bars melts 1.2 k parts!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mic_n","CreatedById":27054,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T22:09:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s kinda what I\u0027d expect, which is why it\u0027s surprised me as much as it has. With a very similar design/layout with mk3 parts to the very successful mk2 planes I\u0027ve made (which admittedly do wind up putting a temp bar on my probe core which is tucked inside a service or cargo bay), the heating seems quite considerably stronger. I guess the larger, heavier plane is going to be generating more heat to begin with, but I\u0027d hoped it\u0027d all stay fairly proportional.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you say, I have a tank (actually, a Mk3 -\u0026gt; 2.5 adapter), a 2.5 service bay with probe core and some batteries, then the 2.5 -\u0026gt; 1.25 adapter, then a ram intake on the nose. I actually wound up putting a pre-cooler in there in an attempt to soake up a bit more of the heat, with very little impact. Main body is 3x cargo bays, some fuel scattered around the back.. power comes from 8 ramjets and 5 spikes. It\u0027s basically a delta wing config.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI similarly like to keep fuel up the front to keep the COM stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll put up some screenies and a .craft if it gets annoying enough and I can\u0027t sort it out \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-22T22:17:23Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2015 10:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mic_n\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
