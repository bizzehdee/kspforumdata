Using Mechjeb is NOT cheating at all. It is a very useful tool in game, it really really is. It can tell you things that you will not know w/out it. No one ever said you have to use Mechjeb, even I am saying you do not have to. I am saying you should consider it. You paid your 22 bucks or so to play, and play how you feel is right for you. But, I would suggest you get it, just to see what it can offer up. You can fly any mission you wish with the unit on the rocket and use it for data like vessel mass, your vessel\u0027s dV, or, your orbital information, especially useful if you want to put something into orbit around Kerbin and have it have exactly a 6h00m00s orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should be proud of what you have done, as it is not easy, even WITH mechjeb.
