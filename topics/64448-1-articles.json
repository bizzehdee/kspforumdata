YAY!!! Ticker tape parades were in order, general celebrations happening all over Kerbin. Well, until we realized that poor Jeb didn\u0027t have enough fuel to get back home. Many attempts have been made with the limited amount of fuel to figure out a trajectory home, but I haven\u0027t been able to get under about 1 million KM distance from Kerbin on a return flight. With only about 220 Delta-V in the tanks, we appear to be stuck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo a rescue mission is being planned in order to try and get Jeb back.
