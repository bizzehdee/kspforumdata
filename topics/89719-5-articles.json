As you developed, you could pay to expand the building to be larger and therefore support larger rockets and more ambitious projects. I mean, a barn is cool and all, but if it has the same function as the high-tier VAB, i don\u0027t really see the point. Why upgrade your facilities if they give you all you need in the first place? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, rejig the tech tree so you get tiny parts first. Make them rubbish, but capable. The VAB could start as a converted storage warehouse, small but has the height for the construction of small 3m tall sounding rockets. Get initial science with small SRBs and atmospheric analysis, and build up from there. The launch pad is a flat concrete slab, and the rocket is driven out on the back of a truck-trailer. You watch the launch from a small bunker, and R\u0026amp;D is a little office building overlooking a few large hobbyist telescopes. Linus and Werner share their offices with several bumbling interns, and you see them knocking things over in the background of the info screens. Because the tracking station is little more than a amateur observatory, you can\u0027t see the planets properly and orbits are badly approximated. Subtle, reserved stuff like that. I dunno. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2sYmSMm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222sYmSMm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AaOI3QR.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022AaOI3QR.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Y15WqOm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Y15WqOm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat last image is a early control room for ICBMs, for example. Small, clearly insufficiant for a fully fledged space program, but not a barn or rusted cars. With all the references to space history in the game, i don\u0027t see how a converted launch silo would do the game any less educational justice. A grain silo doesn\u0027t really fit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"White Owl","CreatedById":10849,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-09T13:53:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EImagine how this would look if the trailers resembled classic \u002740s Airstreams.

It was my dream to work in game art design, until life circumstances made it no longer viable as an option. Modeling is a craft, and it\u0027s sad to see so little craftsmanship go into this.
