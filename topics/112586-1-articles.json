I have noticed lag before when playing KSP that does get particularly bad when terrain is in view. In the past I used a mod called LoadOnDemand that brought the game up to tolerable levels; alas that it\u0027s no longer supported as of 1.0.x. Your next best bet is a mod called Active Texture Management - the Basic level brings my box to a tolerable level, and it doesn\u0027t look too much like dreck (unlike the Aggressive Level, which you should utilize if your manufacturer\u0027s label is written in Cuneiform). I\u0027m assuming you\u0027ve also turned down your graphics settings; they don\u0027t have to be at the bare minimum levels, but they should be down there a bit. I don\u0027t have the game where I can play it right this second but I can look to see where I\u0027ve got my settings, if that kind of information would be useful to you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThought I had a link to ATM somewhere...guess not. Going to have to dig it up. If you run a Google search for \u0022ksp atm\u0022 it\u0027ll be the first result. Pay attention to the instructions and realize that you\u0027ll come close to melting your CPU on the first load, and its going to take a while. Like, start loading the game, go off and play Monopoly, A\u0026amp;A or maybe a game of Catan with a three-year old, and come back to play KSP when you hear the theme music two hours later...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsed to play the game with just 2 GB installed.
