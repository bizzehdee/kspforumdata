Someone out there paid for this game and has only 4GB of RAM. They paid for it based on the specs listed.

It doesn\u0027t matter if it\u0027s half the community or 1 person, they paid good money for the game. The only way to viably introduce a system spec change without causing an uproar is to include it as part of an optional expansion.
