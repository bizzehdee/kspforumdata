I can move into orbit fine now i have done it multiple times but I accepted a mission called \u0022Position satellite in a polar orbit of Kerbin\u0022. I can move the Apoapsis fine but can not figure out how to move the periapsis. Also recently i found out i cant use batteries for the power which wont allow me to do the mission for about an hour because i need to unlock my first solar panel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbit Specifics \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApoapsis-4,031,524 meters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeriapsis-2,643,811 meters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInclination-90 degrees\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELongitude of ascending node-63.7\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArgument of periapsis-131 degrees\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does give me the orbital path i need in the map so really all i need to do is match the orbital path. I can move the Apoapsis to 4,031524 meters easily, but aligning myself to the correct orbit is a challenge, that doesn\u0027t matter though because i cant get the periapsis out to 2,643,811 at all. Also is I seem to be unable to move the satellite around without the engines burning, I assume this has something to do with the unmanned probe as I have never ran into that issue before and i do have well over enough electricity and i can see it using electricity when im trying to position it but it doesn\u0027t move without the engines burning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI figured it out after hours of trying, the forums are a great way to learn something when stuck and im shocked at how easy it is. all i needed to do was create a second node after my first, which will push my periapsis to a farther distance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T10:57:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the point opposite to the desired periapsis just burn retrograde.

The Ap/Pe positions on your orbit will change depending on where on your orbit you burn. If you, for example, burn prograde at a point on your orbit, that point will quickly become your Periapsis, since the opposite site has been heightened and become the Apoapsis; in other words, they are \u003Cem\u003Ealways\u003C/em\u003E at exactly opposite points on the orbit. Similarly, burning retrograde will cause the apoapsis to shift towards your position, since every other point of the orbit is shrinking while you burn retrograde. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor these contracts, where the Ap/Pe have to be in fairly specific locations, I\u0027ve found it best to first get into a stable orbit around 100km or so, then look at your target orbit. Either burn at the position on your current orbit that matches the apoapsis or periapsis of the target orbit (preferably slightly before, to ensure you get the position fairly close).
