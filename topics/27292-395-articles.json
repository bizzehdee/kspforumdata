(No one was more surprised than the administrator; you know what they say about preparing budgetary proposals for the annual review.)

They had a payload approaching in orbit and no way to dock it.

They could send up another tug...but that would require a complete re-design, a process on the order of several weeks, and time pressure was on. Besides, they had a perfectly good tug in orbit already, if it could just be re-powered.

That\u0027s much. Now the 4 NERVAs only had about 2000 m/s left. But no time to discuss, the KSC had to start the retrograde burn till the asteroid was still near engough to the perisapsis.
