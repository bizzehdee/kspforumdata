Do you get one dot per 300 posts?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think I started in version 0.19 or maybe 0.20. I immediately threw myself into mods, hitting that RAM limit hard, though it took me several weeks to become familiar with what was going on and exactly what *was* causing all these crashes?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have always had the idea in my head for what I want my ideal KSP career to look like. I want to explore the bodies expanding out from Kerbin starting with Mun\u002BMinmus of course, next stop Duna and Moho, each time sending an unmanned mission followed by a manned one. Then mining and supply operations to enable longer-range missions to the outer planets and the exploration of Jools moons. I know you dont need a station\u002Bsupply infrastructure to do this but I wanted to anyway, it would make things more exciting and I could launch more elaborate missions. Spaceplanes would be used to refuel my near-kerbin poutposts just to mix things up. Then with the advent of the outer-planets mod, my mission edxpanded to include the ultra-long-term goal of a heavily equipped, manned mission to a nearby star (which even though is kerbally-scaled, still represents an incredibly daunting mission.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you can imagine, that represents a career of at least 6 real months, or possibly a year.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have never gotten past the manned Duna mission phase.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvery time, a new update would come along (or in some cases, merely be threatened) and as the type of person who cannot let a feature go ignored, a new version always means\u00A0a new career for me. I could never, for example, have continued my career to completion when research and science have just been released. Neither could I continue playing with my build knowing that 64-bit was just around the corner, unlocking the terrible pressure oft he hard RAM limit. Then the trials and tribulations of release and v.1.1, 1.2 etc...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven when a new version borks some things, I cannot ignore new features, fixes and other things, I just do not have it in me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my career as yet goes unfulfilled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I am still hopeful!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving not played a proper career attempt since around v1.0, I am still awaiting the point where I can jump back in. I cannot do so yet - Not only are there still some severe issues here and there, the mod list is still recovering from the release of 1.2 and hotfixes are still being produced. I do not predict a new career until at least spring of 2017, perhaps later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut one day....one day soon...my build will be complete....there will be no groundbreaking new features for a forseeable 6months or so....and the modding community will have had ample time to absorb the changes wrought by various hotfixes. All the mods I want will be inter-compatible. I will have the right mix of realism mods, visual mods, extra parts and extra features.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am not impatient. I could wait another year. Or another 2 years or more. There are other great games to play in the meantime. But one day. One day it will be perfect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am thinking I probably should have saved this speech for rep grand...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-13T12:30:29Z\u0022 title=\u002212/13/2016 12:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 13, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by p1t1o\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"monstah","CreatedById":95210,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-13T12:49:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat?
