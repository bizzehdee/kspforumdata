KSP already demands a lot of memory simulating aerodynamics and other physics, imagine having to simulate water as well.\n\nPeople have been saying this for as long as I have had the game, and yet there still exist plane parts that aren\u0027t for SSTO\u0027s. Now that we have contracts, it\u0027s obvious by the contracts we receive that some of KSP is actually meant to be exploring Kerbin by air and land. Visiting Gregnor\u0027s coral reefs would make as much sense as visiting BillybobBubba Kerman\u0027s lake. Why not go fiddle with water a bit? Make water less destructive if nothing else, I hate stuff vaporizing on contact when it would survive on land. If you want to do even more, make lightweight empty parts like the structural mk1 fuselage have good buoyancy, and then add deployable or inflatable floatplane gear. No need for battleships and rudders, the aero parts can be used to steer. No need for complex hydrodynamics right away, just let us try this."},{"CreatedByName":"Fancyboots","CreatedById":147990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T03:17:43Z","Content":"Thanks for replying! Kerbal space program IS focused on space, but it is also focused on exploration. There are a few Easter eggs on kerbin, after all. Hydrodynamics are not that different than aerodynamics. Water is just heavier, that\u0027s all. It should not take that much memory if you slightly merge the two systems. Think of it as a Y. The bottom part is the simmularity, and the split is where the system factors in the differences, like weight. Also, a couple of new, specialized parts won\u0027t hurt."},{"CreatedByName":"Wallygator","CreatedById":97357,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T18:22:57Z","Content":"Space exploration is also concerned with exploring undersurface seas on other planets/moons.\n\nCondemning a suggestion to include hydrodynamic parts is slightly luddite in my opinion. \n\nIts a good idea... just needs to be balanced and aligned with the concepts of space exploration rather than naval conquest."},{"CreatedByName":"Coyote27","CreatedById":141964,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T09:34:11Z","Content":"I\u0027d like to be able to splash aquatic rovers down on Eve and Laythe..."},{"CreatedByName":"KrazyKrl","CreatedById":65849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T16:20:12Z","Content":"I posted about this a long time ago too.
