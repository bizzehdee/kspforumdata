The fix described a few pages back (bottom) may need to be applied.\n\nThe rings are not exactly centered because it\u0027s only one pixel of 2048 vertical pixels (exactly the middle would require two pixel). This could be solved with 4096 vertical pixels but it seemed a little wasteful regarding the RAM.\n\nThe ring-feature will be available for Sarnus too but it will take time to figure out how much layers are needed/possible. It could easily fill 100 layers but the game will probably run as a diashow in this case.\n\nI did not have the time to land on every body with every cloud-mod installed, so if something looks odd please report it here.
