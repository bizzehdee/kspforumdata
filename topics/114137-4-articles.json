This is pretty much hydro. other realistic source is liquid gas, yes buying from another country is the best solution today. this might not work so well if both uses solar and wind. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif it only responsible for parts of you power needs it works nice, wind in good places provides pretty cheap power.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
