I wasnt claiming more CO2 is absorbed than is released. That would be crazy talk. I was referring to this statement YOU made:\n\u003E The reason it seems we are absorbing CO2 into the oceans 3x faster than we have been releasing it on average since 200 years ago is because we have not been releasing it at a steady rate, but rather, exponentially.\n\u003E \n\u003E Capeesh?\n\nOk, not sure if I understand but let me try.\n\nYou are saying since now we have 800gt in the atmosphere (instead 550gt before fossil fuels) we are capturing 5 Gt extra (trees and sea) by year, so in case we stop with the co2 emissions, the co2 will go back to the normality? \n\nIf that is your logic, then yeah.. it should happen like that. But if we keep with the co2 emissions then it will trigger some chain of events that even if we later stop, it will continue to rise and nobody is sure if can be stopped.\n\nIn fact calculations show that even if we stop now with all the emissions, the heat will keep rising by 30 years if I remember correctly.\n\nBecause it will take a time to absorb that extra co2 in the atmosphere, also the heat absortion due sun light takes time, seas are huge capacitors.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The data I have seen does not cherry pick anything, but uses the raw data to show that global average temperatures have decreases since 1998.

You have different seasons all with their different cycles and micro changes in the sun radiation and earth orbit, you also had weather.\n\nWhat I mean.. you have energy... but energy sometimes may be heat, and some others may be kinetic, etc.\n\nYou have that same energy that is in constant change, but you are only measuring temperatures.\n\nAlso you dont have a thermometer in each part and deep of the oceans and the atmosphere, some times the heat rise over the big majority of your instruments, sometimes down, some times is deep in the oceans, etc.\n\nBut you dont need to follow the local trends, you need to follow the general trend, and is rising without question.

What always gets me about these discissions is that climate change deniers are basically conspiracy theorists. A guy claims that his instrument can\u0027t measure temperature with the requisite accuracy and suggests that no instruments can, therefore the science is bogus... But the science is peer reviewed. If what he says about measuring temperature was true, wouldn\u0027t an expert in metrology have pointed it out already, thereby tossing the whole idea of climate change into the trash bin? \n\nAuthoritatively and definitively disproving an entire field of research\u0027s fundamental premis would seem to be an excellent way to make a name for one\u0027s self, wouldn\u0027t it?

This, in turn, introduces a lot of noise into our measurements. Thus, (1) how can we be sure the earth really is warming **on average** if we dont have a good average temperature measurement (the areas of ocean we dont measure might be cooling due to changing ocean currents) and (2) if other factors introduce so much noise (such as solar activity and whatnot), what makes us so sure that even if the earth is warming, that it isnt being caused by these non manmade sources?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E But you dont need to follow the local trends, you need to follow the general trend, and is rising without question. And not only rising.. is rising in the same value expected due our current co2 levels,\n\nThe fact that it is rising in concert with our current CO2 levels is almost certainly no accident i.e. the modelers adjusted their values to make it so. There is a lot of guesswork in these huge climate models, since, as you can imagine, the global climate is very complex. Thus, modelers have to make assumptions and often fit their models to observed results in order to \u0022calibrate\u0022 the model. Thus, these models might be great at predicting present performance, but using these models to extrapolate can introduce serious uncertainties and errors. If you look ten years ago at the predictions of what surface temperatures should have risen to by now based on CO2 levels, we have fallen short of those, which, despite recent article\u0027s claims, indicates that 15 years ago, we didnt fully understand the earth\u0027s climate.

I follow this since a long time, something I notice over the last decade, is that every time, predictions and studies contain extra details with less uncertainty, but the real issue, is that the new predictions are not in the center margin of old predictions, in fact new prediction are in top or exceed the worst case of old predictions, that is scary, more if we saw the half of the world who still think global warming is a conspiracy from little green guys (kerbals).\n\nIPCC has reduced their effect estimates. \n\nGlobal warming is an real effect, anybody who says otherwise is trolling in best case, earth is warmer because it has an atmosphere. \n\nHow large the effect of more co2 in the atmosphere is is an more open question, note that we can not predict the natural long time variations who is introducing an serious error margin. \n\nCO2 levels is much easier to work with.\n\nGlobal warming should introduce an fairly stable effect related to co2 level. now put the natural variations as noise on top. \n\nNow just looking at the temperature graph the last 150 years without knowing anything about how global warming works except that the temperature rises with co2 level and we assume an linear relationship we can come with some estimates we can come with some conclusions. \n\n[https://www2.ucar.edu/sites/default/files/news/2014/201301-201312.png](https://www2.ucar.edu/sites/default/files/news/2014/201301-201312.png)\n\nWorst case scenario is that all of the temperature increase from 1970 to 2000 was caused by global warming and the the 15 years of stable temperature is an natural cooling who negating global warming. \n\nThis is plausible it will mirror the cooling period from 1940 to 1950 or 1895 to 1910. This will give an global warming of 0.8 degree from 1970 to 2015.\n\nBest case scenario is if we was in an natural warming period from 1970 to 2000 similar to the one from 1910 to 1940, now add global warming on top and the global warming effect will be more like 0.2.\n\nMost plausible scenario is something in the middle. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E you know we can not derail the topic, never mind.. eat it ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_greenhouse-gas_emissions_of_energy_sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_greenhouse-gas_emissions_of_energy_sources)\n\u003E \n\u003E Dont worry, nuclear will be still usefull for the next 5 to 10 years.. after that there is not point to keep making them.\n\nWhy not make more nuclear? only thing who might replace it is fusion."},{"CreatedByName":"arkie87","CreatedById":103434,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T06:04:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 1) There is a whole branch of science that study measuments, is a science and is exact.. You can calculate how big is your error (with the exception of human error).\n\nI am well aware of this. If the error from thermocouples/temperature measurements is only random, then the error from so many measurements will be zero! No? (But it is not zero in the graphs)...\n\nError from **noise** cannot be quantified, unless you know ALL the sources of the noise. Do we know all the sources of the noise? Do we fully understand how the climate works? \n\n\u003E \n\u003E 2) You will always have a chance to be wrong.. but I guess lately that chance is 1 vs 99. It can be only a coincidence that all evidence points to the same place? yeah.. but unlikely.\n\nSee above regarding accuracy and noise and below regarding modeling\n\n\u003E \n\u003E heh, you are saying that all scientist in the world are cheating with this? How they change the values from the real data they receive? Nobody review their works?\n\u003E \n\u003E This is the same that **PakledHostage** explain, scientist compete a lot between then, there is nothing more rewarding for a scientist than prove all other wrong.\n\u003E \n\u003E And right now all others is the vast majority by far.\n\nIt\u0027s not cheating. They have full disclosure on what assumptions and simplifications they make in their models (they have to make assumptions and simplifications or else they wouldnt even be able to start), but how to model this complicated a phenomena is not easy. When making a complicated model such as this, you often take past experimental data and \u0022calibrate\u0022 your unknowns in the model to match (i say this as someone who has done expensive modeling work on the PhD level). It\u0027s not always possible to obtain values for these \u0022fudge factors\u0022 from theory or direct measurement (**especially** on the scale of the globe), so they have to use average values which need to be calibrated. They do not receive any \u0022real data\u0022 for this modeling work; after all, one requirement of all models is that it **needs** to be independent from experiment (except in the case of initial conditions). \n\nAs someone who conducts extensive modeling, I know full well it\u0027s limitations and drawbacks. I don\u0027t believe modeling results all the time, especially when the modeling task is **so complicated** that their is no way it could have been done completely correctly. I have seen, in my field, people not really being so careful and rigorous with the values they use for models. I have seen people use incorrect values (knowingly) because the values for their condition werent available in the literature; and then future people use those values not realizing they are not physically accurate (which then requires the use of \u0022fudge factors\u0022. People assume modeling work is straight from heaven, and if the computer predicts it, the computer knows everything, and it must be true. But the computer is only as accurate as the equations that are programmed into it, and the equations programmed into it are too complicated to be completely physical, so it relies extensively on correlations, assumptions, and simplifications....\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Read my answer to 78stonewobble.\n\nRead my answer above regarding the accuracy of modeling...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E predict climate change trends is easy.. predict local effect on short periods of time is not.\n\nPredicting climate trends is not easy. They are numerous feedback loops (some positive, some negative), many capacitances, convective terms (which themselves are affected by changing climate/temperature) etc... Predicting short periods is even more difficult...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E But that theory of the pacific ocean if you read the actual paper, has a lot of evidence, also you can see the same \u0022hiatus\u0022 every 30 years aprox.. in your same graph.\n\nThis just goes to show my point that the climate scientists and modelers dont yet completely understand everything. Their could easily be additional negative feedback loops that resist climate change or large capacitances that havent yet been tapped (like the pacific ocean). \n\nFurthermore, how on earth could people claim the surface temperature is warming, without measuring the surface temperature of the whole globe? They are basically saying that yes, the surface temperature has been warming, but it stops every 30 years, because it has to pause to warm the pacific. Wait, werent they measuring the pacific ocean temperature already when they said the surface temperatures were warming? I\u0027m confused...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Well in that case I really hope you become a climate scientist to help to fill that uncertainty.\n\u003E \n\u003E Meanwhile, I guess the forecast is enoght clear to secure the house as prevention, dont you think? After all is the only house we have.\n\nI am all for sustainability. It will eventually be a requirement with or without global warming/climate change. Eventually, we wont have any more non-renewable resources left and we will have to recycle everything (or mine asteroids). \n\nIdeally, if the amount of money we had to spend to stop climate change and the effort on the part of every citizen was minimal, i would say, yes, we should put in the money and the effort. But clearly, the amount of change required is huge (all the green efforts most countries have taken have been pitiful and dont actually reduce anything). To make a difference, the industrialized world would have to reduce emissions by 10x, which is just not going to happen. Coupled with that, china and india are in the process of industrializing. If everyone in China and India used as much energy as we do in the US, the whole globe is F\u0027d.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E You\u0027re back!

I try to take one day a week off my computer.\n\nMy biggest problem with global warming is the dogma; there is always room for a rational, respectful debate (that is what science is), but what happens with global warming debates is closer to condescending dismissals, insults, bullying, and name calling which is reminiscent of politics. \n\nKeep in mind, 10 years ago, 97% of scientists thought global warming was a pseudoscience.

It\u0027s a very specific number.\n\nEver since surveys have been carried out, the vast majority of scientists (over 65%, even in the lowest results) have agreed that anthropogenic warming is occurring. The results in no way back up your very emphatic statement that 10 years ago, an overwhelming majority of scientists thought AGW was pseudoscience.\n\n\u003E Is that the only thing you wish to respond to?\n\nSorry, your post was a victim of \u0022last on the page syndrome\u0022, and I didn\u0027t see it until I went looking.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The thermocouples i am using have been selected to be accurate to within 0.1\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C. The error is from the DAQ itself, not from the thermocouple i am using. I have verified the offset with more than one thermocouple. All report 0.6\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C instead of 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C.\n\nWell if there\u0027s a systematic error in the data acquisition, or indeed with *anything*, it shouldn\u0027t make a difference when we\u0027re looking at trends. Unless it is not only present, but *growing in magnitude*. And also relatively consistent across several different ways of measuring temperature, mercury thermometer, thermocouple, satellite measurements, etc.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The data I have seen does not cherry pick anything, but uses the raw data to show that global average temperatures have decreases since 1998. Here is a figure from the NOAA:\n\nLook at the blue line. The average temperature has still increased since 1998. 1998 was just anomalously warm, dragging the moving average up for several years afterwards, 2006 was anomalously cold, dragging it down. Your graph shows the 5-year mean, which means the latest data in it is from 5 years ago. [More recent data from NASA](http://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/) shows that 2014 was the warmest year on record, and the 5-year mean is likely to increase again.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E If such a hiatus doesnt exist, then why have i seen article after article trying to explain why it actually doesnt exist (despite the obvious change in slope of the data)?\n\nBecause it doesn\u0027t exist? The change in the slope of the graph of a noisy signal over a period of a few data points doesn\u0027t imply that global warming is \u0022on hold\u0022 or not happening.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Also, why are the uncertainty bars so large if thousands of thermocouples are being used?\n\u003E \n\u003E If we are accurately measuring average temperature, the trend should also be less noisy, no?\n\nNot really. There are various correction factors in place, to compensate for things like urban heat islands, ocean mixing, and the geographic distribution of sensors, which is not uniform over the surface of the globe. These all have a small amount of uncertainty associated with them, making the signal slightly noisy."},{"CreatedByName":"78stonewobble","CreatedById":97559,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T11:52:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E you know we can not derail the topic, never mind.. eat it ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_greenhouse-gas_emissions_of_energy_sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_greenhouse-gas_emissions_of_energy_sources)\n\u003E \n\u003E Dont worry, nuclear will be still usefull for the next 5 to 10 years.. after that there is not point to keep making them.\n\nBased on relatively small scale projects and ignoring the needed ressources to build, deploy and maintain enough solarcells, windturbines and energy storage to replace to a high degree or all of global conventional powerproduction (taking in mind that solar power has to be dimensioned with eg. 14 percent efficient loss over 7 years).
