Using small bursts would mean you get the worst of both worlds, first you transcend terminal velocity where the drag slows you down, then you need to wait for your speed to slow which means more gravity drag; all the while you could be burning the excess fuel and obtain a gradually lighter vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T16:16:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMainsail is useful for its enormous thrust, it has best TWR of all engines.
