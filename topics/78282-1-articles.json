As time passed and safety improved the reduction in fatalities resulted in ever longer queues of Kerbals waiting for their chance to fly off into space. These Kerbals became prone to fits of boredom and we all know how dangerous a bored Kerbal can be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn an effort to to alleviate the growing boredom it was decided to give the waiting Kerbals something to do. Counting was suggested as a suitable activity and to make things more interesting a number was assigned to each and every rocket part. Imaging combinations of rocket parts that yielded the smallest or largest total number became a popular activity and, much to everyone\u0027s relief, the boredom problem was solved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll numbers need a symbol of some kind to differentiate them from other similar looking, sometimes identical numbers that in fact have a totally different meaning. What to call the new numbers soon became a topic of heated discussion. Remembering a science fiction story of a race of pink creatures who invented something called currency and went on to invent numerous mechanisms which ensured the value of this currency would continually decrease over time - a story with a very sad ending by the way, they decided on \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1 the symbol they used for square root. Not only would this be amusing in the context of the story, it would also act as a very practical reminder of what can happen if you allow people to simply invent numbers according to whim and fancy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-21T00:45:28Z\u0022 title=\u002207/21/2014 12:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ecat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T01:53:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tfvCm5L.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tfvCm5L.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dI8JbBD.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dI8JbBD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"inigma","CreatedById":69310,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T02:46:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Proton T Shuttlecraft... perfect 3 Kerbal SSTO for rescuing stranded Kerbals in any Kerbin orbit.
