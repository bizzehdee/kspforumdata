It is set to end time warp every time it checks to see if the kerbals die. A better warning system is in the list of things to do. The orbit change might be a side effect of cancelling time warp suddenly. I\u0027ve only tested it on the pad so I\u0027ll have to look into its effects in orbit. If it is causing side effects in orbit, I\u0027ll just remove it until I have a better system to take its place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022StainX\u0022 data-cite=\u0022StainX\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI love this plugin, adds so much more realism! \u003Cp\u003EBut its easy to forget to activate the scrubber.... at least for me (poor Kerbals) \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny chance to set them to ON by default!?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s already done for the next version.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theSpeare","CreatedById":62144,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-25T08:05:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, although keep in mind I would simply just hyperedit a single command pod into orbit (preferably into a very high one, so time warp can be high enough to deplete resources).
