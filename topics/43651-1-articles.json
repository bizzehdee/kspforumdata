Land on the Mun, say something cool, plant a flag, do some science, go home. Jebediah Kerman took the job, stating that the Mun is his favorite celestial body, because it\u0027s \u0027so classic\u0027. He said he would live there if he could.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems the universe has a sense of humor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fuel margin was tight, you see. The lander was extremely small, and was direct ascent based. It looked like something a \u0027noob\u0027 would build, in Jebs own words. Bob was perfectly fine with that, but preferred to stay home, and watch TV. Bill said that he was already slated for the Aldrin 4 mission headed for Minmus. Jeb, as mentioned, was enthusiastic. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Three... two... one... liftoff!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/f9cUpvr.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022f9cUpvr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob and Bill looked up into the sky. As the ship flew upwards, they watched, half awed, half bored. Bob turned to Bill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You think he\u0027ll be okay?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Bob, that\u0027s pretty much guaranteed. Jeb is a good man, he can figure his way out of anything.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, that thing looks like it doesn\u0027t have much fuel.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022He\u0027ll figure it out. I\u0027m gonna talk with Wherner about Aldrin 4, what are you gonna do?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Play some poker with Tomlo. Tell me when we send a mission to a nice, safe place. Like Laythe.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah, whatever, Bob.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Bob ran off, Bill took one more look at the rocket--by now well into it\u0027s gravity turn and nothing but a blue speck in the sky--and then headed to the VAB...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESoon...\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kv3lyih.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kv3lyih.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene looked at the screen. He didn\u0027t like what he saw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Uh, Jeb, you\u0027re still doing the circularization burn. You\u0027re gonna need to be more careful with the fuel, especially now.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hey, don\u0027t worry! I\u0027m almost done with the burn.

The Armstrong 12 has landed!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Uh Jeb, it seems you\u0027re on a slope, what\u0027s your...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Working on it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022...Fuel situation...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb maneuvered the ship off the slope and onto the plateau near the crater. Expert, just as always.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Jeb, please tell us your fuel situation.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Uh let me check... oh, no.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002232.5 units. Not nearly enough to get home from Minmus, let alone off the Mun.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene sighed. This is what he feared.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Jeb, we\u0027ll get a rescue ship to you as soon as possible.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022All right.
