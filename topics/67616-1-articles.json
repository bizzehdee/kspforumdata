I goofed up a little and didn\u0027t catch the asteroid until a little after its periapsis, but I got it into a huge orbit and then shifted its plane to equatorial (it had about 60 degrees of inclination to start). The asteroid was a Class 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mRapSvB.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mRapSvB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I got it in the equatorial plane, I used about a dozen aerobraking passes to drop it into a 130 km x 100 km orbit over Kerbin.

The two nukes could slow it down into a nice vertical descent, but they didn\u0027t have the oomph to soft land the beastie, so it crashed at about 100 m/s.

I decided to see what I could do using the four parachutes on the nuke nacelles for landing the asteroid. Those parachutes are only meant to safely land the nuke nacelles that can be separated in case of an emergency (such as a launch failure), so I didn\u0027t really expect them to return the whole ship and rock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/x7l71pE.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022x7l71pE.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used the engines to slow the ship/rock down (there\u0027s still more fuel left in the Tug than the engines can use up, even if firing all the way down from orbit), and at 5000 meters I cut the engines and deployed the chutes.

The main deployment was somewhat violent, but everything held together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, the ship and rock descended into the ocean at about 16 meters per second. Strangely, the green illuminators I have on the Tug (one high intensity, one low intensity) appeared to be able to shine right through the asteroid to light up the water below. When the rock hit the water, it slowed the Tug enough that by the time the Tug dipped into the water, none of its parts broke. The rock did indeed sink\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6but the strangely buoyant metal of the ship acted as a floatation device to keep the rock from falling to the bottom of the sea. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zKPNsXh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022zKPNsXh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECool!

Below, I set it down a little west of KSC on four good chutes. Again, the lights were able to shine through the rock and illuminate the ground.
