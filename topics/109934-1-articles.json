For example, I\u0027m planning a test craft, just to send to minimus and back to see how much fuel it uses, it would use 4 ion engines and 4 fuel cell arrays, one per engine. I thought of putting the large 1.25 meter xenon tank in conjunction with a fl t200 tank, I wonders if that would be enough LFO for the 5000\u002B xenon?

I blame being at work and sober instead of at home and buzzed. From checking various cfg files, everything in mthe game seems to burn 1 LF to 1.2... O.

When you\u0027re capturing at an airless world or making some other big burn, it\u0027s all or nothing in 1 go. So if you\u0027re planning on doing any of that, you need enough batteries to last perhaps an hour or burning. And this gets into heavy batteries.\n\nAnd FWIW, a Gigantor in Laythe orbit with 100% sun exposure makes 0.92 EC/s. Lesser solar panels need not apply."},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T23:21:41Z","Content":"Why not just get some official sources?\n\nFor every 18 units of charge, the resource intake reads:\n\nLiquid fuel ratio = 0.02025\n\nOxidizer ratio = 0.02475\n\nThis means that Electric charge ratio = 18\n\nFor every one unit of Xenon, 18 units of Electric charge are used.\n\nFor the 5250 Xenon tank, this means that you will need approximately:\n\n107 units of Liquid fuel\n\n130 units of Oxidizer"},{"CreatedByName":"DancesWithSquirrels","CreatedById":138267,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T02:21:21Z","Content":"*\u0022...* *only outward-bound and homeward-bound transfer burns are really amenable to the multi-orbit thing...\u0022*\n\nActually, you can manage pretty well without massive burns.

And maybe a lander for Bop or Pol. If you\u0027re working from Duna inwards, solar panels suffice. Otherwise, if you\u0027re at Dres and beyond, use LV-Ns to move and RTGs to run the electronics, which will cover the ore scanner and SCANsat stuff. The main use I see for fuel cells in stock is to run the ore drills and ISRU in the outer planets. Fuel cells seem to run through LFO way too fast to handle life support needs (if you\u0027re into that)."},{"CreatedByName":"DancesWithSquirrels","CreatedById":138267,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T04:18:14Z","Content":"*\u0022* *But that\u0027s only possible in certain situations...\u0022*\n\nSay you\u0027re going to Eeloo. Find the transfer orbit that will take you to an intercept with an apoptosis equal to Eeloos orbit, but **leading** it slightly. When you get close, burn until your periapsis is only slightly below Eeloos *(while Eeloo catches up with you)*, with an intercept somewhat further along the orbit - you will approach the SOi at near zero relative velocity. That orbital change can be very slow, driven only by your RTG\u0027s, as long as you mostly negate your relative velocity prior to entering the SOI.\n\nFrom there, once you\u0027ve entered the SOI, burn with repeated periapsis kicks to first stay within the SOI and then lower your orbit eccentricity. Pretty straightforward with ion engines, a battery bank, and some RTGs to recharge it - it doesn\u0027t take a lot to change a barely approach/exit pass into an eccentric orbit. \n\nIf travelling to Moho, do the same but have your intercept **lag** Moho. You will have a higher velocity than Moho at periapsis, and as you slow at periapsis you will catch up at a reducing relative velocity, with a target of near-zero relative when entering the Moho SOI. The difference there is you\u0027ll be using solar panels rather than RTGs."},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T06:35:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Actually, you can manage pretty well without massive burns.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E But that\u0027s only possible in certain situations, such as there\u0027s no game time (as opposed to real time) constraint.
