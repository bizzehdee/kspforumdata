The Duna colony is currently under siege and in threat of being bombarded, however, thanks to the heroism of the local garrison commander, the enemy fleet had to spend all of their space-to-surface missiles on destroying the Duna defenses. Duna is in the middle of finishing a surface-to-space cannon, but this will take at least 1\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BD year. In the meantime, the stalemate at Kerbin is going nowhere, the Federation has sent a freighter to resupply their Duna blockade fleet, and enable it to bombard the Duna colony before the surface defenses are ready. Of course, the colony will capitulate, but this will mean a humiliating and costly defeat for us, as well as the loss of Duna, should this happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, before the freighter was able to leave Kerbin, we struck a blow with an EMP missile and threw it into an unstable orbit. On the other side, if we sent in a vessel to finish it off, their fleet, orbiting on the other side of the planet in comparison to ours, will react and intercept immediately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs such, we\u0027ve entrusted you, yes, \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E, with designing and launching a vessel that can utilize makeshift engineering and low-tech to permanently paralyze the enemy freighter and render it useless. If you succeed, the Duna defenses will be completed without the enemy fleet resupplying, forcing them to retreat to Kerbin, and thus decisively turning the war for Duna in our favor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ve done satelite imagery of the freighter before sending you off, they can\u0027t tell you much, but it\u0027s better than nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i461.photobucket.com/albums/qq333/Ascensiam/carrier1_zps28197cbd.png\u0022 alt=\u0022carrier1_zps28197cbd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt hasn\u0027t done anything except define the freighter\u0027s orbit and detect it\u0027s own detection systems.
