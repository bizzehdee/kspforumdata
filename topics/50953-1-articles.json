I\u0027d kill the RCS thrusters completely since the rover doesn\u0027t need them and instead mount batteries on the backend as your weight balancer, with the Center of Gravity marker on to know when you\u0027ve got enough. That would free up the sides and you could attach a radial parachute on each side lined up with the CoM for a balanced descent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood setup overall for a small rover.
