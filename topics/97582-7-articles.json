This thread is an example of highly charged emotions, and perhaps you can see why threads such as this usually get shut down pretty quickly. The fact that some people didn\u0027t even realize where the name Valentina comes from shows that KSP is still teaching people new things, which is the sort of \u0022realism and teaching\u0022 that so many people clamber about. You could say that Kerbals were amorphous, but that\u0027s no longer the case.

The nice thing is that there is a variety of features to choose from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the crux of this matter is that TheCanadianVendingMachine computer is being overloaded by KSP, then I suppose you can consider that you now have one less mod that you have to run. So in that regard, it\u0027s a wash. The people who work on artwork are generally not the same people who work on the code, not to mention that they are hired as artists...to do art. Max said that ~95% of the work on this particular feature was in creating the artwork. So diverting an artists skills to coding is something that the Squad team has to consider if the cost is worth the benefit, or is it better to leave them doing their primary job...working on art.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am sorry that your computer has a hard time running the game for more than 15 minutes.
