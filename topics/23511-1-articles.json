Personally, I recommend the Common Berthing Modules addon to help with that.

First, assign them to an action group so you can turn them on and off. I\u0027ve found that with bulky modules they will activate before the docking node magnetism settles, so the nodes and struts will fight each other and tear things apart. Having them off before you dock, then turning them on after everything stops moving seems to help. Second, in the VAB rebuild the part of your station you will be docking with so you can correctly aim the struts. Don\u0027t assume that you have them aimed right, there\u0027s nothing quite like the frustration you get when you finally dock only to find that the struts are trying to lock to the cold vacuum of space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EETA: Try to not face the struts down on the ship you are launching. They occasionally seem to attech themselves to the launch pad, and surprisingly enough have enough strength to hold your rocket on the ground. I\u0027ve had a 2.8 TWR rocket hover 50\u0027 over the pad at full throttle due to quantum struts. Also, if you do want to toggle them make sure you have them on an action group. You can right click them, but not fast enough that the first one you activate won\u0027t pull your module sideways before you can get the rest.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-23T03:29:18Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2013 03:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Noticeably FAT\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
