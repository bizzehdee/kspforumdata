Thank you!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s somewhat contradictory, given that you want a budget laptop for gaming and video editing. Sure, a budget machine can play the game. But the questions are, how well and what will it look like? The Intel integrated GPUs cannot perform as well as a graphics card. You should also consider that you may want to play other games besides KSP. Please bear with me here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhatever you decide on, below is the closest thing to a gaming laptop that \u003Cem\u003EApple\u003C/em\u003E offers. If you got KSP via Steam, there would be no need to repurchase the game. The machine is over 5 times your budget, so its given only for reference, so that you will feel better about the Windows laptop that you decide on (in terms of cost):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOSX Mavericks (inc. iPhoto, iMovie, GarageBand, Pages, Numbers, Keynote, Safari), 15.4 inch MacBook Pro, LED backlit Retina display (2880 x 1800 pixels), 2.6 GHz Quad core Intel i7 CPU (boosts to 3.8), 512 GB PCIe flash (SSD) storage, 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3L SDRAM, full size backlit keyboard, Intel Iris Pro graphics \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E Nvidia Ge Force GT 750M with 2 GB GDDR5 memory, integrated lithium-polymer 95 watt hr battery (up to 8 hours wireless web), 85 watt power adapter, 2 USB 3 ports, HDMI port, SDXC card slot, Bluetooth 4.0, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, HD camera, 2 Thunderbolt 2 ports (can use adapters for other connectivity), 0.71 inches thick, 4.46 pounds. Note that Mavericks uses memory compression, so 16 GB RAM would behave more like 24 GB RAM. It would set you back about $3,000 after taxes; $3,500 if you want a 1 TB SSD instead of the 512 GB SSD. I suppose that if you are unsure of your mentioned laptop choices above, remember that a $600 risk is obviously less costly than choosing Apple\u0027s pricey laptop or other gaming laptop (edit:) with the exception of sal_vager\u0027s recommendation being nearer your budget).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-15T19:26:24Z\u0022 title=\u002212/15/2013 07:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Dispatcher\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stranded","CreatedById":90919,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T16:28:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the replies guys. At this point for me my current laptop is so slow I think I switch from FPS (frames per second) to SPF (seconds per frame) around the 400 part mark on a craft. I built one yesterday that has around 600 parts, and it was miserable. I have a faster desktop, but some scripts are running on it currently so it will be a couple more days before I can move the save files over and test this on a faster machine. While having a super custom built desktop is the ideal situation, I like the ability to pick up my laptop and drag it to the couch if I want to play around, or even have others watch some gameplay. We all get the convenience of a laptop..
