During this process time-energy composite was such that the quantum state hesitated at a state that allowed the predecessors or ordinary matter transition from the high energy form. This created the complexity that eventually leads to our material universe. Sounds interestimg, thats all i have to say in support. Remind everyone that other than some neutrinos we cannot see what happened before CMBR.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
