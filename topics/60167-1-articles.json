If you look at the impact toloerance of the leg in the VAB/SPH, that is the impact speed that if you exceed, the leg will break.

(As it is a drop pod I assume a little internal cushioning for the kerbal) I have 3 of the smallest legs as \u0060shock absorbers\u0060 and usually only two break. I\u0060ve found this to be pretty much it for these legs and this pod if you want to know you will land ok.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/16HQcef.gif\u0022 alt=\u002216HQcef.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt should depend on just how much mass is hitting the ground at the speeds mentioned.
