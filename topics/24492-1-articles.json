It has a tendency to tip over when I hit the gravity turn; still haven\u0027t figured out how to correct that little flaw.

A multi-stage spacecraft can be 100% reusable and a SSTO can be expendable. To be reusable, an SSTO would need a deorbit engine and some way of landing safely (parachute, wings, retrorockets...) which would eat into the payload mass, and quite probably take away the SSTO capability. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn effect, an SSTO launcher will always have a smaller payload capability than a multi-stage launcher. In most calculations, with current materials, the payload mass fraction is so low that it really doesn\u0027t make sense to build one. For example, the Titan II first stage, with no payload, could be SSTO.
