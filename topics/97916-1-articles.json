But in general, It\u0027s jut a better idea to use an LF\u002BO SSTO. If you still want to use xenon, use a jet engine to reach high velocities, which you can then use the ion engines when you\u0027re suborbital.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KandoKris","CreatedById":103873,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-28T04:54:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have just the thing to help you with the Ion Glider your making...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85728-Ion-glider-collier-trophy!\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85728-Ion-glider-collier-trophy!\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter reading a bunch of ion focused threads Slash In my opinion is they highest authority on them.
