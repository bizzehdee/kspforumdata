I first use the symmetry option and place, for example, 4 of a certain object about a common axis on the surface. I then want to place a different object on the same surface and using the symmetry option. However, this time I only want 2 of the new object instead of 4. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, there is this automatic setting thing where the system forces me to continue placing 4 of this new object. In other words, whenever I try to switch back to 2, or even some other number like 3 or 5, once I select the desired surface, the game will try to set the number of items back to 4. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a really frustrating problem. I wonder if there is an option to turn this annoying thing off, or is this actually a bug?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Apollo13","CreatedById":74572,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T04:35:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEditor Extension mod:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Euploads_2013_07_EditorExtensions_v0.5.zip\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scorpi15","CreatedById":34189,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T07:04:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhich is \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/38768-0-21-Editor-Extensions-v0-6-5-Aug-%28EdTools-Editor-Tools-replacement%29?highlight=editor\u002Bextensions\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E, by the way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T11:40:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s just a part of the design.
