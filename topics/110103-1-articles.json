Prefer to use the rockets, but after some success with a small passenger shuttle and passenger SSTO for cycling kerbals and leveling them up, I tried to make a cargo carrying SSTO. It worked on the second try with an 8 Jet engines instead of 6. It can lift 18 tons (2 locked X200-16 tanks) to 80 km, with plenty of fuel to spare. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo Orbit: Take off at 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 to 10 km, then 15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 until velocity no longer increases, start rocket engine, go back to 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, turn off jet engines once they give out (custom 2), turn off air intakes (custom 1), continue until apogee of 81 km is reached, coast at 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 until above 70 km, circularize. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo Land: Retroburn at ~90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 past spaceport. I used Mechjeb to see predicted landing spot, have it at 550~575 km before spaceport, put all fuel in furthest forward tank, balance oxidizer or dump almost all of it via fuel transfer mod (keep some for fuel cells). Maintain 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 angle during re-entry until 600 m/s, dive as low as -45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 angle to 5 km, turn on engines to 1/3 thrust, level off at 3 km, cut engines before landing to glide in at 50~100 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAny improvements recommended?\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/4szgm0co5wv97kq/Large_Cargo_SSTO_1.craft.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/4szgm0co5wv97kq/Large_Cargo_SSTO_1.craft.zip\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8etsDgk.png\u0022 alt=\u00228etsDgk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SHiftER2O","CreatedById":141087,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T14:24:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat are the statistics of this aircraft?
