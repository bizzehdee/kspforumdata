Although, I suppose you could also try and build a crawler with rover wheels (or tank treads from a mod) and roll your rocket over from the Runway to the Launchpad, a throw-away separator is probably the easiest way...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/5PMsb\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

By (lots and lots of) trial-and-error I determined this to be the maximum safe power-level for this particular rocket and Mass Driver stack. The maximum safe power-level for any rocket and Mass Driver combo will vary based on the size and mass of the rocket, the length of the Mass Driver stack, the level of structural reinforcement (struts, launch clamps, KAS ground-pylons, etc.), and the aerodynamic design of your rocket (see below).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It is important that your rocket is not only streamlined, but aerodynamically-stable. This means you need most of your mass up top, and most of your drag towards the bottom of your rocket (PRO TIP: landing legs and/or stabilizer fins at the base of your rocket help IMMENSELY for this). As drag is tied to mass in the stock aerodynamics model, making an aerodynamically-stable rocket is quite difficult in stock (no, there\u0027s nothing *I* can do about this: it\u0027s one of the shortcomings of the horrible current placeholder aero model... The same difficulty in maintaining aerodynamic stability can be observed with long/tall stock rockets with very high liftoff Thrust-Weight-Ratio...) however in FAR you can design aerodynamic-stability into your rocket simply by keeping the Center of Mass high (placing denser fuels such as hypergolics in the upper stages makes this MUCH easier if you are playing with RealFuels) and the Center of Drag low (even adding lander-legs so you can recover the launch stage will add drag to the bottom of the rocket in FAR, which is *precisely* where you want it...) If your rocket is NOT aerodynamically-stable, it will tend to flip over after exiting the Mass Driver, and will make some pretty fireworks when it crashes into the ground (or tears apart due to aerodynamic forces in FAR), but won\u0027t get you into space...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Make sure your Mass Driver has enough electricity to operate- the acceleration isn\u0027t free! (Mass Drivers respect conservation of energy and all that...) Attaching lots of batteries to the Launch Clamps (or ground-pylons, etc.) holding the Mass Driver in place helps with this, as does simply attaching more Launch Clamps (each launch clamp produces electricity at a set rate) or solar panels, etc...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Make sure your Mass Driver is well-supported. They *DO* experience recoil, although currently the recoil appears to be in the wrong direction (in the same direction the payload is firing- which is why some players have noticed the Mass Driver rings, batteries and all following their rocket into the air...) I am hoping to fix the recoil-direction bug in the future, but either way you will have to deal with recoil in one direction or another- so make sure you have plenty of launch clamps, pylons, or struts!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs always, I hope you guys enjoy playing with the Mass Driver mod, and let me know if you have any problems with it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EP.S.\u003C/strong\u003E As always, my example screenshots are from a Career Mode install with Real Solar System 64K (which adds difficulty by up-scaling the planets and thus increasing Delta-V requirements to orbit, and is one of the reasons Mass Drivers are particularly pragmatic for my space program in the first place...), MechJeb2 (for the informational displays), FAR, Deadly-Re-Entry, Realfuels, Procedural Parts (which helps *immensely* with producing a nice streamlined shape for my rocket that is stable at high speeds), Procedural Fairings (also helps with streamlining), and NovaPunch2 (adds some useful engines- such as the one I used in the SSTO featured above...)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-04T06:45:28Z\u0022 title=\u002202/04/2015 06:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelhester07","CreatedById":96470,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-04T19:42:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice to see one of my parts taking a spinoff of it\u0027s own.

This effect should be detectable at smaller fractions of c. If there is no difference in the energy required for each object to get to .6c then there is no frame of reference and faster than light travel is actually possible with standard propulsion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s my thought experiment on that matter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-12T00:19:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMichaelhester07,\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you have any insight into the recoil-problem?

I can\u0027t abandon real-life physics (or KSP physics, for that matter) of how a body acts under acceleration in order to get a consistent duration of acceleration- and tying the power level to the mass of the craft would prevent players from having any control over the final exit-velocity of the craft or rate of acceleration (unmanned craft can put up with a lot more g\u0027s than manned craft with Deadly ReEntry installed- which will kill crew if g-forces become excessive, for instance...) by tweaking the power-level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-22T21:07:23Z\u0022 title=\u002203/22/2015 09:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaribouGone","CreatedById":138623,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T22:23:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethat g rule of thumb is useful. i found acceleration through F=ma, but never thought to put it in terms of g.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eout of curiosity, a kerbin g is also 9.81 m/s^2. right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut the problem still remains: if i accelerate at 50m/s^2, for one second, my final velocity should be about 50m/s faster, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut if i accelerate at 50m/s^2 for some unknown fraction of a second, my final velocity is a number i can\u0027t calculate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif i\u0027m remembering physics class correctly (i\u0027m sure i\u0027m not), this whole issue is due to the fact that acceleration found through F=ma is instantaneous, which is mostly useless info unless it can be treated as constant and exist for period of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei was never suggesting power be tied to the ship\u0027s mass. the available acceleration should definitely depend the ratio of driver power to craft mass. it would be neat if the driver could magically know the target\u0027s mass, and tell us power in terms of g\u0027s, relative to the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso, while it wouldn\u0027t allow for nearly as precise control, tying the power of all units together, so that only one menu would need to be tweaked would save a lot of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhile i definitely respect trying to maintain realism and abide by the laws of physics, there\u0027s a fine balance between realism, and gameplay. i know what i\u0027m suggesting is not at all how a coil-gun would work. but its well within the means of the ksp engine to apply force over time. that is basically what a rocket does, after all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe idea behind my suggestion was that 1: a set unit of time would make estimating change in velocity from F=ma much easier. (in it were 1 sec, (F/m)=change in V)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand 2: if ksp wants things to behave like rockets, why not play along? while i know very little about computing, i got the feeling that the massive lag and kraken attacks were the result of instantaneous forces freaking the physics engine out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eto me, sacrificing a bit of realism to make the game behave properly is worth it. besides, the end result is the same: a big machine that accelerates things absurdly fast. i don\u0027t think many people are going to care if they were secretly under thrust a moment longer than they should have been.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enow, don\u0027t get me wrong, this mod is really cool as is. the parts look good; its fun to use; and almost free dV is always welcome. but calculating final-velocity needs to be easier before this joins my always-install list.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T01:48:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECaribou, the forces aren\u0027t instantaneous.
