This is of course an eclipse of the Mun in front of the sun, though I imagine you could get solar eclipses more frequently on Jool, and have potential for them on Duna.

Obviously, Gilly and Ike are small enough that you may only get a partial eclipse, even at the equator, due to the inclination of the moon and the tilt of the axis of the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found the easiest eclipse to see is a solar eclipse caused by Kerbin as seen from the Mun. However, interestingly on Linux it seems that such eclipses don\u0027t cast shadows over the landscape like they should. Because of this there aren\u0027t any Munar eclipses visible from Kerbin. I don\u0027t know if this affects the Windows version, though.
