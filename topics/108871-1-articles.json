I\u0027m playing on hard career mode right now and wnt to go to Duna, I have the whole one side of the tech tree unlocked but it won\u0027t let me unlock the MK-2 pod yet, I need something with more seats! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone know what mod I am talking about and can give me a link? It wasn\u0027t part of the FASA plugin or whatever that one is called, I\u0027m 90% sure it was a single mod separate from that. Any similar mod that is a two seater that will work in 1.0 I would like, a capsule. I\u0027ve also used the Apollo command pod in the past I\u0027m not sure if that is 1.0 compatible. I really wanted this Mercury one if possible, sounds like a \u0022fair\u0022 mod for me to use that isn\u0027t bypassing the contracts/science too much. I don\u0027t want to have too many mods installed, I\u0027m trying to keep as vanilla as possible but at this point I really need a ship with more than one seat.

It\u0027s pretty trivial to just stack 2 one-man pods in the early game. I typically use a capsule up top then add non-aerodynamic airplane cockpits stacked underneath it to add more Kerbalnauts. It works pretty well overall but you do have to watch it when you start stacking 3 or more pods together because they like to flip over on re-entry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lazarus1024","CreatedById":65276,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T16:11:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you look at it, just the command pod for Gemni was a fair amount larger, let alone the support module for Gemini.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T02:25:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESee also: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121062\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECorvus: Size 1 two seat command pod\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"passinglurker","CreatedById":103157,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T02:46:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESee also: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81537-1-0-2-Tantares-Stockalike-Soyuz-and-MIR-25-3-9-05-2015-Ariane-5-Release\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETantares\u003C/a\u003E the original 2 seat 1.25m pod mod\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Orionkermin","CreatedById":91013,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T02:58:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m seeing so many of these threads lately, really makes me feel like the stock game could use its own early game 2 kerbal capsule.

At least there\u0027s plenty of mods to choose your favorite now, just look through all the examples in this thread.
