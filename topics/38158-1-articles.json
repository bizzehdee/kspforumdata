Now, what makes a plane aerodynamically stable? Well, picture the most aerodynamically stable stable thing I can think of, an arrow: how does it make it to keep pointing in the direction of travel no matter what happens? Well, the answer is simple: the center of lift is way, way behind the center of mass. Unlike in the rocket pendulum fallacy, you aerodynamic thingy \u0022hangs\u0022 from the center of lift, and is pulled down from the center of mass. That means the center of mass will always try to get before the center of lift in the direction of travel. Which is why opening a chute behind it will always work (a parachute gets greats amount of \u0022lift\u0022, or better said, aerodynamic forces).\u003Cp\u003ENow you can go a bit too far, and make your plane \u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E aerodynamically stable. Then what will happen is you don\u0027t have enough control authority to make it point anywhere but prograde, and \u0022prograde\u0022 will start being more and more \u0022downwards\u0022... very gentle way of crashing, and with a beautifully curved trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, what I can say is: there is a reason planes are long, and have rear stabilizing surfaces at the end of a tail, well behind the center of mass. And why flying wings are very, very tricky to pull off in the real world without fly-by-wire systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
