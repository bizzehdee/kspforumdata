You do have them strutted, but it looks like each one is only strutted to other SRBs which are no more firmly attached. I would suggest to you strutting across the stages to distribute the stress on the SRB/adaptor joint, using an arrangement similar to this example. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/y1mVuM8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022y1mVuM8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can use helper parts like that little cubic strut to avoid the nuisance of hitting the part directly above the SRB.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Justin Kerbice","CreatedById":101695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-06T08:12:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWithout jointreinforcement (even with it sometime), when SRB get low on solidfuel, they push so hard that a big weight above them literally crush what\u0027s between.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think SRB are not designed to be use like this, and IRL, they are dropped while they still have some \u0022juice\u0022 (perhaps for the same reason \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can try by attaching this 4 SRB group to a radial decoupler, it will be a diamond pattern ( -=- ) which might need two decouplers to stay connected maybe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SSSPutnik","CreatedById":91745,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-06T08:52:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E4 SRBs that size produce thrust equivalent to just under one mainsail.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-06T09:36:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe emptying SRB is exerting too much force on the adapted above it.

It looks like you\u0027re trying to stick the outer Jumbo tank on a number of radial decouplers at once. That does not work, the tank only sticks to one of them and the rest is just sitting there doing nothing at all (the tank can clip through them). Remove all excess decouplers and install (EAS-4) struts between your tanks instead for increased mechanical strength.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-06T14:01:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have got too much thrust, remember you can set the thrust limiter on solid boosters in the VAB, to get a less forceful and longer burn.

That is why they are breaking in differing ways, at differing times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you \u003Cem\u003Emust\u003C/em\u003E have fins, put them on the srb, right at the top, or on the oranges, as close to the quad as possible. this will slightly reduce the horror factor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso: Multiple radial decouplers on the oranges? NoNoNO! Only *one* of them is linking, the rest are decoration. If your different tanks are linking on different radials, you have an asymmetrical ship!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso: Your SRBs are not symmetrical! Yes, you have four neatly around each Quad, but the quads are not radially symmetric in their layout. Try this. Built only *one* of your 6 legs for this vehicle. Only once it is complete, then use 6-way reflect to clone the other legs in. This will ensure their rotation is correct, and everything balances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso: Your SRBs are not symmetrical! (no this is not deja Vu, they are broken in another way). Your strut stitching is not quite balanced. Normally this is of little concern, but in a close-to-failure setup like yours, having the strut attach to srb#2 at 60 degrees, and on srb#3 at 45 degrees, will cause the srb\u0027s in question to torque relative to each other. Just a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion: Rather than putting 28 SRB in pancake staging under your orange cluster, wrap them around as tight=packed onion ring. I think you will only fit 24 that way, but as each has its own radial link, the result will be more steady. 2 struts between each srb and its left-right neighbor, and a few fins for steering. Not one per srb! You will save in mass, partcount and stability, at the loss of a bit of elegance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
