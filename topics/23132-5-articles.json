There is a danger we have all got used to beta standards which could carry on into the finished product and I think it should be finished to a high quality, the highest quality possible, and that should continue into the foreseeable future for no extra charge as long as the game is in development, including DLC development and KSP2. Further bug fixes or refinements should not be in DLCs, should always be free to owners of the game and available seperately from purchaseable DLCs which add content and function. But the bug fixes may in part be financed by DLC as continuing to polish the base game apart from satisfying honest pride can be justified as making a good foundation which grows the player base and improves community confidence on which basis DLC content will be more popular. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the attention to support is good then there is plenty of scope for DLCs which wont get peoples backs up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe nuance I got from the furore was that some people got the wrong end of the stick about Harvesters statements. That is because there is a degree of paranoia among gamers about the attitudes of some of the cynical publisher mentalities which might belong to people who might schmooze developer expos and this happened just after one such. In some cases I honestly believe the paranoia is justifed. IMHO expo hype can do funny things to the developer / fan relationship and not all of it good. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe accusations against KSP were totally unjustified by either Harvesters statements or intent but I think there is a lot of discontent out there and KSP caught a gust of the wind that is blowing, through no fault of its own. But the answer to that is not to isolate and insulate against the user base (which ultimately alienates), which you are not doing thankfully, it is to communicate and achieve mutual understanding and set an example for good developer conduct and community relations and the answer is always to proceed ethically, because that is what ethics is.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-22T20:55:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2013 08:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by boolybooly\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scrogdog","CreatedById":66879,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-22T20:59:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Brabbit1987\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Brabbit1987\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDespite what the company does, I do like KSP enough to still have purchased it.

Many developers prefer to make the game, and then parcel it up, and 2. Many developers seem to like massively overcharging for their DLC. Sure $1 isn\u0027t much, but when you\u0027re paying for a skin that should likely be $0.10 tops, its a mess. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis very much leads to lower quality games if you\u0027re not willing to pay for overpriced content which the game was designed to have, but then removed later to make more money. Further it KILLS modding because smart people won\u0027t pay $1 for what they could have done themselves in a few seconds with mod tools. How do you solve this? Don\u0027t add mod tools.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for Kerbal, my feeling is that they should do an actual release at some point, and if they want to do an expansion afterwords, that\u0027s fine. I\u0027d be willing to pay for more content, especially if it\u0027s actual content. Honestly i\u0027d prefer they just do a full out expansion pack rather than this piecemeal bs. They\u0027ve clearly done tons of work to bring this game to where it is. That said, if i suddenly see rocket booster downloads at a $1 each and the removal of mod tools, i\u0027ll throw it in the trash pile with all the other games that want to treat me like i\u0027m an idiot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"comham","CreatedById":43245,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T18:24:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Exal\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Exal\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat is the problem right there, squad has never stated what is going to be in the actual game all they have for that is a list on wiki of planned features and what is in the game right now.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe wiki list is not officially maintained by squad, it\u0027s just a fan list and only half of it is referenced.

DLC, and expansions are pretty much the same thing. An expansion is a DLC. Though a DLC may not be an expansion. In other words DLC is just a broader term. While expansion is a specific type of DLC. Not sure how much sense that will make to anyone but a good example would be like skyrim hearthfire is a DLC, but I wouldn\u0027t call it an expansion. It\u0027s more of an add-on / new feature. While Dragonborn is also a DLC but I would consider it an expansion as it expands the game by a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words DLC simply means anything that is downloadable for the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack on topic, I jsut simply wish Squad would make it more clear, on what is actually suppose to be in the final game, and what will not be.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T18:37:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAt this point that\u0027s impossible to do.
