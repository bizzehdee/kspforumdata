I am curently on the advanced construction mission of the tutorial. I get as far as completeing my rocket when i am then asked to select the pod and move or rotate the rocket 90 degrees this is while the rocket is still in the construction bay. No matter what buttons or direction pad i press nothing seems to move the rocket from its north facing point. I have tried several times only to have the ship totaly disapear i think after pressing the B button. Because of that i saved the ship before getting to this point but when its reloaded the kerbal goes back to the begining of the lesson where you select the pod first. So that means i have to restart the scenereo. Can someone please tell me how you change the rocket angle while its still in the construction building.

However, I\u0027ll take a stab at it. Please let me know if I\u0027m right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you build a rocket, it always has a \u0022root part\u0022. This is almost always the first part that you place (but you can change the \u0022root\u0022 while you are building). Anyway, if you click the root part, the entire rocket gets selected. It\u0027s best not to move the rocket after it\u0027s been selected, except to move it straight up. -- But don\u0027t move it this time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou didn\u0027t say which way you wanted to rotate the rocket. In general, once the root part has been clicked, and the whole rocket is selected -- you use the \u0022steering\u0022 keys. Whatever you use to steer. Each click should flip the rocket 90 degrees in the indicated direction, while it is selected. So I\u0027m going to\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eguess\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0that it\u0027s either your left thumb stick, or the left hat switch. (On the PC, which you don\u0027t have, it\u0027s the WSAD keys.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bruce635","CreatedById":166963,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-24T06:49:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222679484\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022143981\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221468734516\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022166696\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022stubedoo54\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 17/07/2016 at 6:48 AM, stubedoo54 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi fellow travelers.
