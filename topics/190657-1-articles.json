Set the piston\u0027s extension to max so it tries to stay out, like a spring, but the low damping setting makes it compress easily.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SnailsAttack","CreatedById":184399,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-10T04:10:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ndunno if it\u2019s possible but this would be cool. i tried using pistons for it once but they usually got destroyed in the process of contacting the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
