Sort of like Titan, with lakes of Methane? Maybe it had an atmopshere at one point?"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T00:59:46Z","Content":"My guess is it\\\u0027s a distant body from the outer solar system, which fell inward after a collision, the collision and the sun helped to melt it slightly, leaving the smooth portions of the surface we see today. After a bit of orbiting, it was captured by kerbin, with the Mun gradually perturbing it into a circular orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"Rascal Nag","CreatedById":9451,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T01:51:37Z","Content":"I feel that Minmus was formerly a part of another planet in the outer reaches of the star system. This planet had its own trojan asteroids, one of which was large enough to be classified as a dwarf planet. This dwarf planet worked its way out of its lagrangian point and collided with the larger planet, ejecting debris which escaped the planet\\\u0027s influence. Now in a new orbit of Kerbol, the pieces coalesced to form what we know as Minmus. Then, while crossing the path of Kerbin, it was captured.\n\nAlternatively, Minmus was a moon of a gas giant in the outer system. A wandering planet came a bit too close to the gas giant and the one moon, and flung Minmus towards the gas giant. The velocity gained by this interaction flung the moon out of the gas giant\\\u0027s reach. Eventually, it found its way to Kerbin."},{"CreatedByName":"Rocketscience101","CreatedById":12864,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T02:08:22Z","Content":"I personally agree that it may have been a former comet. Comets contain a hole tone of ice, and dwarf planets, are either farther out possibly in the asteroid belt or on the outer reaches of a solar system, that this could not be one. It may have run out of the gases that gave it that amazing tail, and kerbin, had intercepted its orbit, just at the right point, that put it in a good position to orbit kerbin. Possibly the last of the gasses was used to put it in it\\\u0027s final orbit, because it may have been in an escape orbit. These things may happen all the time with larger planets, like Jupiter, and smaller ones like Mars. I personally believe that is how Mars received its two moons in the first place. Although, I am surprised on how the Minmus is so round, many comets resemble potatoes, like Phobos and Demos, Mars\\\u0027s moons. This may be caused by impacts, shortly after the Minmus had began orbiting the Kerbin. Which had made it much smaller than what it was originally. The seas that we may see on the Minmus are most likely very large impacts. After the impacts, the dust around the Minmus, soon formed the outer layer we may see, because of gravity, larger dust particles picked up smaller ones, making them larger, and turning into the Minmus. Perhaps, the Minmus was formed, by gravity forming the ice particles from a destroyed comet, which made a smaller version of the Mun. Things like things though, are believed to take millions of years. So most recently do we see the finished product of the gravity forming planets, and moons."},{"CreatedByName":"Anachronda","CreatedById":23187,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T02:31:41Z","Content":"I think Minmus is hollow, a spaceship from another system.
