An exemple of it\u0027s usefulness is an ion probe with low thrust escaping a gravity well (trajectory seen bellow). With the current system you need to constantly stop the time warp to reajust the heading or stop the engine and restart it during the next orbit over and over again.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022rfn78dyxn7741.png?width=960\u0026amp;crop=smart\u0026amp;a\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002277.71\u0022 height=\u0022746\u0022 width=\u0022960\u0022 src=\u0022https://preview.redd.it/rfn78dyxn7741.png?width=960\u0026amp;crop=smart\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;v=enabled\u0026amp;s=558293f903e725b360b256aea4576fe1fa9c2233\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"whatsEJstandfor","CreatedById":220814,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-06T18:49:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve heard rumors that rotation during time-warp is planned, but I\u0027ve yet to see anything official.
