Just with that any \u0022unorthodox\u0022 thing I design (Ex. making an hidden ejection pod) I would be able to make it look more natural instead of patching it with metal plates. \n\nThat\u0027s the only suggestion I have at the moment, look forward to playing more 1.0 when I have more time, very excited. Might mess around with challenges on the forums here. Love someone made an SLS one, Mad a stock SLS along with an Orion capsule when information began to be released about it."},{"CreatedByName":"Mudkip909","CreatedById":180021,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-02T14:08:41Z","Content":"Amazing"},{"CreatedByName":"Deddly","CreatedById":62955,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-02T16:01:15Z","Content":"This thread is from 2015 - three years ago.
