Although I\u0027ve found kOS will still run as far as you don\u0027t need to control anything. The problem comes in if you close the kos window while out of signal range you can\u0027t open it back up until in range, but for setting up nodes it works fine. It does help a little that i have a failed komm sat launcher in a much higher orbit (almost into Munar SOI) so I can on occasion get signal when I\u0027m out of range of KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was going to post how I\u0027m working on getting my sats into orbit but thought I\u0027d post it over in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/47399-kOS-Scriptable-Autopilot-System-0-9?p=765384\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post765384\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EkOS thread\u003C/a\u003E instead.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sma","CreatedById":67377,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-08T14:39:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vardicd\u0022 data-cite=\u0022vardicd\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnybody noticed Scott Manley has picked up Remote tech? \u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E**YouTube Video**\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENice, I haven\u0027t seen ep2 yet, dont remember if i noticed on ep1 or not, though that might have been before RT2 was out again.
