Took me a month of playing to circumnavigate the Mun and I could do that in mostly a straight line, dropping stations in my path every 100km to relieve the monotony. Minmus was a much shorter drive, but the terrain is very unforgiving.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Kerbin circumnavigation would be three times as long as Munar circumnavigation, but because of the oceans, it would wind up even longer. Crossing an ocean, on, or under the water can be done, but would be madenningly tedious. You would almost certainly save significant amounts of time by driving around the oceans.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joshmo","CreatedById":10280,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-19T19:04:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the lifting the car with a plane idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phoenix Aerospace","CreatedById":26120,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-19T22:01:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EU mad?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SunJumper","CreatedById":27062,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-20T14:02:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you stay still, you\\\u0027ll travel around Kerbin in six hours...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScientists call this phenomenon a \u0027day\u0027... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Khrissetti","CreatedById":29557,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-20T14:25:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI got bored just driving from a poor landing site a few klicks off from KSC2 to the space centre itself, that only took about 20 minutes.
