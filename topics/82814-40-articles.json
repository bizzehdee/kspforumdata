The reason carriers aren\u0027t allowed to carry extra ammunition is to stop BD armoury weapons from having too much of an advantage over stock weapons, but the way things are going they probably won\u0027t need extra ammo - BD turrets in the series will be limited to a short yet undecided amount of time for which they can fire in each turn. For example: if I had 5 seconds worth of firing time in a turn I might spend 3 seconds of it on one ship and 2 seconds on another. This means even a small amount of ammunition will last a long time.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, that perfectly explains the reasoning, and I understand it now.

We are are currently in the process of designing as well as touching up a number of combat spacecraft.

Though we do believe you will be quite impressed when you see what we have managed to build thus far. For now we can\u0027t quite let you know where we are based due to security concerns though we will tell you that we do have orbital shipyards and processing systems, allowing us to manufacture in space.

The team there was researching an artifact on the moon and from our last transmissions it appeared that they had made some sort of great discovery regarding point to point FTL travel. According to what few recordings we have left they seemed to have believed that they could build such a device quite easily. However they did seem to believe that their main problem was going lie within navigating to the right point in space, meaning that for the time being such a device would be limited to interplanetary distances. After hearing of this discovery we immediately ordered them to encrypt and upload all of their research data to the nearest com satellite orbiting the planet and to pack up and wait to be extracted. When the drop-ship arrived to pick up the base we found a few GMI ships leaving the moons SOI and a rather large crater where our outpost had been... When we questioned them they claimed that a asteroid had just nailed the planet and gave us very fuzzy footage of the event. The impacted area was not only clearly not caused by any rough space rock but it was also unusually radioactive... Most of the communication satalites were also missing, though we did manage to salvage some data from one that was in a very unstable degrading orbit. After GMI showed off their FTL capabilities we are certain that they were more involved then they had initially claimed to be.

These ships may not the most heavily armored but they do have a decent range as well as the ability to haul 2 of our fighters along with a pile of munitions. The vessel is estimated to be best used like a light carrier and a cruiser if things get sketchy. This means that for the most part the fighters should do the fighting though if it comes to it the vessel can be equipped with heavy anti-capital ship weapons as well as operate some of the guided missiles (Stock probe core ones) into enemy ships. These ships have almost 2 of everything so they can take a good deal of damage and still fight.
