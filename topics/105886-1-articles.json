Now, one-button launches are far more practical than they were before, so I think a revival of the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cone-button\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 challenge is in order.*\n\n*Inspired by* [*Yakky\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Hand\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s free challenge*](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/94490-The-Hands-Free-Mission-Challenge) *which in turn was inspired by* [*Thunderous Echo\u0027s \u0022One-Button Bill\u0022 Challenge*](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/94346-1-Button-Bill)*.*\n\n**Briefing:**\n\nEver since Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s dramatic atmosphere transformation, Jeb has not been able to fly our rockets straight. We\u0027ve built several hundred rockets already and he has crashed every single one of them (it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s quite amazing, really). As a result, we are now almost bankrupt; one more failed launch will put the final nail in the coffin for our space program. That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s why we need your help. We need you to build a rocket that requires so little thought to fly that Jeb cannot possibly crash it. We need a rocket that only takes one button to fly.\n\nInterested? Great!\n\nHere are some basic guidelines that you should follow while you build your space craft:\n\n**Rules:**\n\n- Only use one action to fly your space craft: The stage function (the Space bar). There is no limit to how many times you can stage.\n\n- Once launched, you cannot change the throttle.\n\n- No debug menu \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Ccheats\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 (no infinite fuel, unbreakable joints, etc.)\n\n- Stock only, no mods other than information/visual\n\n- Provide pictures of all the key events in the mission WITH resource tab open.\n\n- (Optional) Provide a craft file with staging time stamps. If your mission is complicated, I may ask you do this just to verify.\n\nThere are two categories you can apply for:\n\n **--- Explorer ---**\n\n**Goal:** Exploring the Kerbin system will never be easier (at least for the pilot)! Your mission is to send a one-man capsule to a stable orbit somewhere in the Kerbin system. (You can take extra, but we only care about the pod)\n\n**Scoring:**\n\n**For Kerbin Orbit:** ----- (semi major axis(in Km) \\* (1 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 eccentricity of orbit))\n\n**For Mun Orbit:** -------- 30\\*((Mun SOI radius(2230) - semi major axis(in Km)) \\* (1 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 eccentricity of orbit))\n\n**For Minmus:** ---------- 60\\*((Minmus SOI radius(2187) - semi major axis(in Km)) \\* (1 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 eccentricity of orbit))\n\n*(Basically, you get rewarded more points if your orbit is large and circular)*\n\n1.5x multiplier for return trip.\n\n0.9x multiplier for every stage past stage two. (For instance, if you stage four times, your multiplier is 0.9\\*0.9 = 0.81)\n\nNo points for leaving Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s SOI.\n\n**Multipliers are accumulative** \n\n**Explorer Leader board:**\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n- Stratzenblitz75 (**916.6**, Only used SRBs)\n\n**--- Heavy Lifter ---**\n\n**Goal:** How awesome would it be to have a rocket that can deliver payloads to LKO without having to think about piloting it? Your mission is to efficiently deliver a payload to Low Kerbin Orbit using only the space bar. (Fairings are recommended)\n\n**Scoring:**\n\nlog\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E(Mass of payload)\\*(Mass of payload / (cost of rocket(not including payload)-cost of recovery))\n\n**Heavy Lifter Leader board:**\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n- None yet\n\n**--- Mile Stones ---**\n\n**Goal:** Prove the improbable! Be the first to:\n\nLand on the Mun:\n\nLand on Minmus:\n\nLand on another planet:\n\nRendezvous with an asteroid:\n\nThanks for viewing and good luck!\n\n*(Also, feedback on the challenge, especially on the scoring system, is greatly appreciated)*\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nAs custom for starting a challenge, here is my entry:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
