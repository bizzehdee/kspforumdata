Though the current Mk II and III can already do this on the smaller moons via RCS. The Mk V looks cooler. I got rid of the tail fins to make it look totally flat. This also give the added bonus of having no obstructions at all on the top and bottom docking hardpoints. Id like to think that the Mk V is the final adaptation of my Phoenix class of orbital fighter but one can always improve. So far it fulfills all my mission parameters perfectly so im happy with it. Its cheap enough on fuel and needs no RCS at all unless its docking, a concept I\u0027ve tried to adopt even in my capitol ships. So far only the largest ships would need RCS for maneuvering and only in combat for quick reaction time or for docking.
