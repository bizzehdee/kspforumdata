If it is indeed a different experiment from the materials lab, and I need to do a surface materials exposure, which part would I need for that?\n\nThis is an awesome mod btw, love it. \n\nThanks\n\nP.S.   Did you remove the rescue missions from the vanilla game where we rescue various Kerbals stranded in orbit? I found those rather enjoyable along with picking up some free Kerbalnauts.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-06-25T00:47:26Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2019 12:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by r3\\_141592654**\n  \nAdditional Question"},{"CreatedByName":"Frostiken","CreatedById":1837,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-11T07:13:15Z","Content":"How do I blacklist certain science categories?\n\nThe SIGINT from DMagic was already mentioned, but there\u0027s also problem with the WildBlue MOLE experiments (it keeps popping \u0022Empty slot for an experiment\u0022 which isn\u0027t possible to complete).\n\nI found this:\n\n    @CC_EXPERIMENT_DEFINITIONS[StationScience]\n    {\n        @EXPERIMENT,*\n        {\n            ignored = true\n        }\n    }\n\nBut...
