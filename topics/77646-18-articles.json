Mind you, the propulsion method that would most likely be used, tiny xenon thrusters, are still heavily under development and aren\u0027t planned to fly for years. It would be impossible to communicate with the probe during the trip or, perhaps, even after arriving at Mars; it would be very nearly impossible to carry any traditional science instruments on the CubeSat. A rocket would have to be launched in almost precisely the correct orbital inclination to make this plan feasible. No CubeSat has survived for long enough to get to Mars. The technological hurdles that would have to be overcome are enormous, and would likely require a research and development budget far, far higher than the satellite itself would cost. This would make a crowd-funding campaign likely to not succeed, and private backers almost certainly wouldn\u0027t be willing to fund the multimillion-dollar cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENASA would likely be lukewarm with its support at best.
