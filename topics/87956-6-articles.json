I\u0027ve taken a few classes on rocketry and aerodynamics, so let me rephrase.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENERVAs and nuclear ramjets both function by passing gas over an extremely hot substrate. NERVAs simply carry their own supply, nuclear ramjets use whatever gas they happen to pick up. I don\u0027t know of any examples, but in principle an engine could conceivably be designed to do both. Nuclear ramjets do lose thrust with altitude as there is less atmosphere passing through the engine to be heated and expanded, no different than a normal jet really. I don\u0027t know what the thrust profile of a NERVA is in the atmosphere, certainly the plume would be under-expanded in anything more than a vacuum, but I don\u0027t think anybody would be crazy enough to try that in reality anyway haha.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I\u0027ve never heard of a nuclear air augmented rocket.

Methane and ammonia are also good candidate propellants which in spite of their low Isp provide good delta-V and thrust. Water is also a possibility for a propellant. The only problem is that the fuel rods need special coatings to withstand the effects of each propellant, and what works for one will not work for another, especially when it comes to oxidation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob Braeunig has posted quite a bit on the subject of alternate propellants on various forums and the only ones he had issue with were methane and pentaborane as I recall.
