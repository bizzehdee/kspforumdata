It would make it much easier to adjust parts on the spaceship to have the center of mass at the correct position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith ortographic view, and with fixed camera rotation button, you could make a visible ruler too (with numbers), or have the item parts\u0027s axis lines visible. I think this would be a relatively easy improvement (especially if you dont implement every idea), but it would make it much easier to make stable rockets/airplanes, especially sstos/vtols.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know its not a 3d modeller program, but i think these things would help a lot in spaceship design.
