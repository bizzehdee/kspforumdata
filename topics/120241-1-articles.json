Is there anything to stop it happening? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany Thanks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/zgShP39\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/siqUZfh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022siqUZfh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-06T00:23:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou lack horizontal velocity, in other words you\u0027re not going fast enough relative to the ground.

Possibly horizontal speed is the issue, but in that case you would still need to fly it as though it was a helicopter, by tilting forward to gain speed, sideways to turn etc, before shutting off the aerospike. If I had to guess tho, I\u0027d say the aerospike is serving the purpose of the main rotor on a chopper and turning it off is bound to have the associated consequences.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spacetraindriver","CreatedById":149403,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-06T19:02:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had the same problem with my Thunder Bird. There are two types of VTOLs. 1. Planes that take off vertically And 2: Craft meant to fly without lift. Basically what the last guy said. That \u0022Turn off vertical engine\u0022 is really for the Plane VTOLs. Unless that thing has enough thrust to push it like a SRB (Those engines are quite small) it would be best to keep that bottom engine on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
