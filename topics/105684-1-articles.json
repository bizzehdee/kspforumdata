It seems that his method of interstellar transport could be adapted to KSP. Basically, they travel at sub-light speeds (usually solar sails for economy but sometimes chemical engines aka \u0022kickers\u0022 for speed) to the edge of the system. When they reach the edge of the gravity well, they activate a \u0022Burleson Drive\u0022 which folds space and they appear at the edge of the destination system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe distance between systems is in BUs (Burleson Units). How far you can jump and how close to the origin and destination systems depends of a formula of local gravity, ship\u0027s mass, size of Burleson drive, and how much power you can shove into the drive at a burst (capacitor/battery dump).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI figure the generation of a new system using random numbers and a texture pallet shouldn\u0027t be too hard. I wouldn\u0027t include multiple biomes in the first couple of versions. In the game you would have to have non-orbiting stationary beacons locked onto the system primary at both systems for navigational alignment. Discovering a new system would be a matter of placing a beacon, sending out probes along that direction. I suggest having a beacon on the probe, so it can return and the probes unmanned in case they just disappear on jump.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinding the new planets, if any, in the new system would be awesome, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s possible with the program the way it is. New types of stars would also be good. I think this mod would be perfect for use with MKS/OKS, Remote-Tech, and TAC Life Support. Let me know suggestions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T19:08:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELook at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97865\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal Warp Drive\u003C/a\u003E, and/or any of the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113665\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Efaster-than-light drives\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gorignak","CreatedById":142033,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T00:59:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThose mods only work within the original system. This would add new systems as well. Parameciumkid\u0027s Para-Sci Jump Drive and ESLD Jump Beacons are the closest.
