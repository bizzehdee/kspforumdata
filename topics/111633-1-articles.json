With the success (and great feedback) of my Phoenix Industries CRS mod, I\u0027ve been brainstorming on what to do next.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast night, I watched a low-budget(ish) thriller flick called \u0022The Last Days on Mars\u0022 and thought the rover designs were really cool. So I\u0027m going to try to make a 2-person manned rover cockpit with KIS storage space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe design I like most is in \u003Ca href=\u0022http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2014/344/f/7/f71937d24c6b30c1722c4d5adc8975d2-d89cyxs.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis picture\u003C/a\u003E (I think someone painted it based on Andy Weir\u0027s \u0022The Martian.\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, this is what I have so far. I\u0027m not much of an experienced modeler, but I think it\u0027s a fair start. I also have no idea how to do the IVA for it, but I guess I\u0027ll cross that bridge when I get to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v68/MoviesColin/wip1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022wip1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CobaltWolf","CreatedById":105588,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T16:43:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBased on your image, the side windows should be bigger I think.
