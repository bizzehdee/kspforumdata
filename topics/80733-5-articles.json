The general idea is that modders or \u0022maintainers\u0022 create a meta-file that has the directory structure of the mod, licences, author, download location, etc. It is ok in theory but not practical in my opinion\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, you have KVC, a full fledged working mod that is currently being used by a list of mods already. Each mod that supports KVC has a small *.version file somewhere in the mod directory. This file is created by going to an online site that generates the file and updates a database.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, what if we combine these two? Add some select meta-data to the version file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBUT, how would that help the mod author? For the example of PreciseNode, what would you gain? Well, the imitate answer is you get less people spamming your thread saying your mod doesn\u0027t work cause they have an outdated version. However, I think we could do much much better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe authors would need a way to generate this file(s). So why not an application, maybe written in java, that would create the files and update the online database? Why make it stop there? Have it update the changelog and then upload the file for you! I know you said you did not not like uploading to multiple locations. What if this tool did it for you?
