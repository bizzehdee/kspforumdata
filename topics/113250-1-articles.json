My FPS is almost always locked out at 60 but no matter what I do, whether I turn the game graphics settings up or down I still get this strange stuttering. I find it quite distracting and it\u0027s ruining the experience for me quite a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy system is: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewindows 7 64bit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8 Gig ddr3 RAM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAMD FX-4100 quad core @ 3.6Ghz (stock) processor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGTX 960 EVGA scc 4GB GPU\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERunning 32bit version of KSP\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny idea what\u0027s causing this and is this a common problem?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ANWRocketMan","CreatedById":65251,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T11:23:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA lot of people have this problem. Including me. It just started randomly two days ago for me. It doesn\u0027t matter how many parts you have or what the scene is it will stutter. And in-atmosphere it gets even worse and my framerate drops by about half(even more than that). Once I\u0027m out it stops. I\u0027ve been unable to find a mod that causes this(the framerate drop *MIGHT* be FAR) but the stuttering happens in stock KSP and with different mod configurations(RSS \u002B RO, a vanilla install, just visual mods and so on). I\u0027ve tried a bunch of GPU settings and nothing helps. Restarting the game or my PC doesn\u0027t help at all. The weirdest is that it just randomly started in the middle of playing(about a week or more after I updated to 1.0.2) so it wasn\u0027t there at the start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can post your log and modlist it might help anyone who has some idea of what might be going on. The only concensus thus far is that it\u0027s a KSP and Unity garbage collection that causes the stutter. There is another thread already on this topic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
