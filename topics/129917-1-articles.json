When the editor finally decides that your fairing is in a good spot the top line of text (shown brown in your second pic) will turn blue and will close on the nose cone. Taking a closer look at your second screenshot, I think what it\u0027s trying to do is close the fairing in a point (the way that they are usually used), but it\u0027s trying to do it\u00A0\u003Cu\u003Einside\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0of the nose cone, so it won\u0027t let you. No idea why it won\u0027t instead make an interstage connection to the outside of the nose cone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBest advice I can give is to play with the camera angle and zoom, and hope for the best.
