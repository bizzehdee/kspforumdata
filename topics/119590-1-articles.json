As far as I recall I\u0027ve found 2 cases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) In some closed trajectories.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) In some non-closed trajectories\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn case 1) it is enough to quick-reload the game or just go to the Kerbin Space Center and come back to he ship. I\u0027ve also found that in case 1) you cannot pin point the perigee or the apogee to show data. You click on it but the altitude disappears once you move the mouse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECase 2) happens to me sometimes in theoretically-closed orbits that actually aren\u0027t because in your path there is a planet you are going to rendezvous with. Ex: orbiting around Kerbol and making a rendezvous with a planet. Imagine a blue trajectory that goes from your ship to the target planet. In those cases, if between the ship and the target planet there is only the periapsis or the apoapsis, you cannot create a maneuver node in the arc between the ship and the point where the peri/apoapsis exists. But you can create a maneuver node between the peri/apoapsis point and the rendezvous planet. And it is no use to trying to solve it as in case 1). Even when going to the Space center and coming back to the ship, the issue remains.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone know if cases 1) and 2) are bugs?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-29T15:42:06Z\u0022 title=\u002208/29/2015 03:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LordCorwin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-28T17:54:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t know if it\u0027s a bug, but I\u0027ve had both cases happen from time to time.

Sometimes I\u0027ll also go out to the far end (as you\u0027ve described in Case 2), create the node, and then drag it back to where I need it. Sometimes I find I can create the node even when it seems it won\u0027t allow it, as if the line is so thin/fine that I\u0027ve got to hover there and move around a bit before it shows up - and sometimes that\u0027s only briefly, and then I have to try again and again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordCorwin","CreatedById":114256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-28T18:07:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, thx, in fact I\u0027m a bit relieved to see I\u0027m not the only one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-28T18:16:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can also confirm seeing the same behavior.
