Well, those games are huge, far more deep than KSP will ever be, but... now they\u0027re not enough.

The most memorable space titles of these times are Millennium 2.2, Deuteros and Xcom. Somehow, KSP reminds me of millennium 2.2 (except for the war that was going on there). The best \u0022modern\u0022 space game that I\u0027ve played for a considerable amount of time is Galactic Civilizations II: Twilight of the Arnor. The biggest letdown I\u0027ve ever experienced was Spore; I was so stoked about the ideas Will Wright presented... it had to be good. Turned out to be a kiddy showcase which I haven\u0027t played any longer than a couple of hours.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
