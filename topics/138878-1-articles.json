You might notice the numbers have different colours. What this is doing is that it is separating your stack of three engines so that each has it\u0027s own fuel gauge. The numbers are just listing engine 1, engine 2, etc. The last engine of the group has a green number indicating it\u0027s the end of this stack. Else you\u0027d only have one fuel gauge for all three engines, which makes no sense (think of liquid fuel engines having different amount of available fuel each)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
