Presuming not much actual experimental was done on the 3rd, and 15th was mostly spent packaging, uploading, and preparing news, that leaves 7 work days. It was mentioned that this time around experimental testing would take longer than usual, so let\u0027s double that. Adding the announce and packaging days back gives us 16 work days. Looking at the calendar and factoring in the holidays, I believe this leaves us at May 1st.
