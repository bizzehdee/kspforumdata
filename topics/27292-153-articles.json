This isn\u0027t rocket science, people... well, it is, but you know what I mean. If you\u0027re dumping bits, for any reason, you\u0027re no longer \u0022SSTO\u0022; you\u0027re just a regular spaceplane, which is fine for many purposes. This isn\u0027t just a semantics issue; one of the points of a single-stage design is that since the entire craft is along for the trip, you can in theory refuel it and use it again. If you can\u0027t take off without those bits you dumped, then by definition your vessel is not reusable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if the part you\u0027re dumping seems minor, then you can probably spend a little time and effort to fix the issue and make a true SSTO. If you\u0027re often bashing your LV-Ns against the runway, then your aft landing gear are likely too far forward and/or too short; too far aft and you\u0027ll find it tough to take off, but too far forward and even a slight climb angle will start hitting the bits hanging off the back end. With canards and/or a raised nose, you can take off even with the gear placed far aft, but it\u0027s something you\u0027ll need to fine-tune to account for your design\u0027s flight characteristics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to what I did today? Sent a Kethane refinery to Gilly, which then moved to a 200km orbit over Eve. Brought back Jeb and his spaceplane from Minmus and botched the landing. (I was trying out the B9 landing gear, and they\u0027re just way too spongy. The thing bounced four or five times on landing before clipping a wing on a hill. Thankfully, all the important bits survived.) Built a small 20-ton Kethane refining rover for general duty on Mun; it\u0027s just a simple rover, really, but I wanted something that could pull double duty as an emergency fueler. And finally, I tweaked my 5000-ton heavy lifter design a bit for better control.
