Originally it was supposed to be one way, but I think I switched\u00A0it to make something easier without considering the consequences - Namely that Star-Ethan and Star-Evelina do not know about why intelligent life is so infrequent. Not everything may make sense given this inconsistency, hopefully that will be fixed in a rewrite, should one ever exist. Hopefully, this story is nearly done, and will be done in a few more chapters. To speed up the process, I have decided to not do nearly as many pictures - Chapter 34 may not have any at all. Project Intrepid was killed by an intense need for pictures in one chapter which I never overcame, I would hate to let that get in the way of finishing this.

The ships aimed their weapons, which began glowing a bright green. We all began screaming as the pilot desperately tried to get his stricken ship to do something, anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, before they could fire, there was another series of bright flashes as about a dozen ships of various makes and models warped in and began firing upon The Species\u2019 ships. Then there was a dark purple light as our ship was caught in some sort of tractor beam, and pulled into the cargo bay of one of the larger ships. Instantly, that ship engaged its FTL once more, having only been on the scene for ten seconds maximum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat happened!\u201D I shouted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWait\u2026 People are still fighting back against The Species?\u201D the copilot said, astounded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt would appear so, maybe its not as hopeless as it seems,\u201D Jeb responded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWait. Which ship did we get pulled into? Good guys or bad guys?\u201D asked Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood guys!\u201D Kareen said, right as the same time as Tsian said \u201CBad guys!\u201D We continued arguing in fear for the next thirty seconds or so before we heard a knock on the hatch and froze.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEveryone find something heavy,\u201D Evelina said, as she popped open the longest blade on her Swiss army knife. \u201CWe\u2019re not going down without a fight.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe knock happened again. I grabbed a chair for protection as the engineer pushed the button for the door controls. The door slowly opened to reveal a single Illasticonian.

Our worst fears have come true.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CExcuse me,\u201D I said. \u201CWhat the hell is going on?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRight. Sorry. Welcome to the Resistance. Please follow us. The Admiral will want to speak with you. By the way, that\u2019s a nice knife you\u2019ve got there, Evelina.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUh\u2026 Thanks.\u201D We began following him through the corridors of the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo\u2026 You know we lost, right?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYeah.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRight\u2026 So after the chamber fell into the black hole, the rest of the Galaxy, save for Kerbin, fell in a month, except for isolated pockets of life here and there. A few individuals have managed to seal themselves away so deeply that it would require more energy to recover them than would be worth it, and some of us have formed a military organization, trying to hold off against The Species for as long as possible, mostly out of spite.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd you have made it several months.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSomehow. Either The Species isn\u2019t as powerful as it claims to be, or it wants us alive for some nefarious reason\u2026 But now, as you have showed up, I fear it to be the latter, but I\u2019m getting ahead of myself\u2026 Two months ago we realized that somehow the station was actually, against all known laws of physics, slowly emerging from the black hole! That must have been some feat of piloting! We tell stories - legends, even, of what heroism that endeavor must have been. Ethan and Evelina, the Man and Woman who flew a ship through a black hole and lived to tell the tale!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CActually it was just random. We have no idea why that happened. I was a bit busy getting sucked out of a window.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C...Oh. Uh, anyway, err\u2026 The original escape plan was for many planets to produce super fast ships in bulk, and then to, all at once, fire them in all directions in the hopes that some would escape\u2026 Due to the loss of centralized Galactic authority, this never happened\u2026 Many of these were built on Duna. We can\u2019t really tell what Kerbin has been doing precisely, due to the shield around the whole Kerbol system, but if they have been wise, they will have completed the project, just in case. And our goal became to survive long enough for the station to re-emerge, long enough for The Species to drop the shield around Kerbin, long enough for us to make one last mad dash to Kerbin in hopes of boarding one of these vessels.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s a stupid plan,\u201D said Jebediah. \u201CAfter months of waiting, why would we keep those ships around?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI will admit, it is wishful thinking, but it is all we have to go on. And besides, there weren\u2019t any procedures for that in place, were there?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C...No, there weren\u2019t,\u201D said Jebediah.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COne last mad dash for Kerbin,\u201D Kareen said. \u201CAnd that is probably happening soon.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut the thing is\u2026 Ethan, Evelina, and Jeb have been involved in a suspicious amount of stuff, and are almost certainly being used as puppets by The Species to manipulate us into making things easier for them. As such, we should likely not go to Kerbin, as we might mess things up for them.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut wait,\u201D I said. \u201CSo, uh\u2026 We discovered something\u2026 With crystals and whatnot\u2026 Uh\u2026 Basically, in a bit under five hours, we will have the opportunity to recover an unknown object that might turn the tables tremendously.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEthan, for all we know, there is nothing but empty space at those coordinates!\u201D Jeb protested. \u201CActually, for all we know, that\u2019s just a rock!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDo you doubt my conclusions?\u201D asked Tsian.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLook, the only reason we have this information is because I followed the monolith\u2019s instructions. Were The Species really influencing the monolith\u2019s visions that early on? And Ladstini! If he is a demigod-wizard like Galactus claims, he showed up for a reason. So at the very least, the monolith and Ladstini are on the same side\u2026 Do you trust the monolith?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C...That would have been early for them to influence a monolith, but I\u2019m not ruling it out.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe should at least wait the five hours to see what\u2019s up.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COkay, look!\u201D said the Illasticonian. \u201CWrite down your account of the events, everything we need to know. I\u2019ll send it to the Admiral. He\u2019ll have read it by the time you arrive. He will make the decisions.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRight.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnyone who isn\u2019t injured, pick one of these rooms, they are all empty, begin writing.

I\u2019m on the edge about this, but the current plan is to continue as normal.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd what is normal, again?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis Tauquantum gate,\u201D Cheng said, as he gestured to the massive structure behind him, \u201CRepresents about two thirds of the remaining energy possessed by The Resistance. However, due to how it is stored, it is useless unless used for a launch, which means there is no reason for The Species to capture it for its energy alone. We\u2019ve even made sure to use the most inconvenient FTL drives available to make it less likely that The Species shows up. We\u2019ve tried to not interfere with them to give them another reason to kill us, and we\u2019re doing things as randomly as possible to prevent them from predicting our next moves with great accuracy\u2026 But that\u2019s not the point. In short, the idea is that the instant the shield drops, we will pack our remaining numbers inside the Tauquantum gate and fire it up, using its last charge, zapping us all to Kerbin, where we can board the ships they have stationed there, and hopefully, maybe get far enough away to survive.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COkay, so, we use the gate, and hope Kerbin has done its homework,\u201D Evelina said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes. But it isn\u2019t as simple as that. As you know, Tauquantum Gates extend their range by effectively bouncing off of neutron stars, and we need accurate measurements of the stars in order to do that. The Species apparently has use for neutron stars, so over the past several weeks we have been watching them blink out of existence one by one. For the remaining ones, our old data can only do so much for us, and as a result, the most practical route is now 37 neutron stars long. That makes it the second longest neutron star route ever successfully traversed, and that\u2019s only because some guy wanted to do 100 just for the hell of it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd he made it?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, he died at 72.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe have like a 70% chance of making it through, though. I think we\u2019ll be able to fit everything in.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo how does that work. Is everyone here just trained to jump into their ship as soon as possible once the shield drops?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo. So all of the neutron stars oscillate in some dimension, the science guys gave me a lot of mumbo jumbo about all that\u2026 But the more neutron stars, the more time it takes to line up, and we can\u2019t predict it very far out. The average convergence interval is maybe five hours. The seventy percent chance of making through is because our predictions are not exact. The trip is expected to take just under a minute, which means we have to predict the motion of the last few neutron stars that far into the future. That goes wrong, statistically, 30 percent of the time.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo, you\u2019ll only put everyone on high alert once the shield drops, due to how infrequent the convergences are?\u201D asked Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPrecisely.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo, uh, what have you decided about the whole Galactus thing?\u201D I asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHe makes pretty good nachos.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, like, I mean\u2026 The anticonian crystal or whatever it is called.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAh. The conundrum of the century\u2026 Well, I suppose the conundrum of the last 14 billion years or so. It is all but confirmed that we are being manipulated by The Species for their own gain. We need to balance our own odds of saving people with the need to follow their script. If we stray too far from what they have planned for us, we will be crushed like ants. The defiant thing to do would be proceeding exactly as planned, completely ignoring what many think to be nothing but Species bait\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis plan has the endorsement of both the Great Wizard Ladstini and the Monolith,\u201D interjected Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd we have no way of knowing for sure if they are immune to influence, or if they aren\u2019t straight up mind controlling either of you. As I was saying\u2026 Some people don\u2019t even want to attempt the object recovery. Others want to embrace it wholeheartedly. I have decided, however, that assuming that Tsian can solve the Anticonian Transposition Equation, and that the necessary apparatus can be constructed in the next two hours or so, that a recovery attempt will be made, and we will decide whether or not to alter the plan after examining its contents. If the shield drops before then, we will proceed as planned.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe door opened with a loud slam as it severely impacted the opposite wall. \u201CI have solved the Anticonian Transposition Equation!\u201D boldly proclaimed Tsian.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n==========\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah, Cheng, Kareen, Tsian, a few technicians of various races, Evelina, and I were gathered in front of a window overlooking a patch of space. This space was devoid of all matter except for a tiny device a few hundred meters away, containing the anticonian crystal and a mechanism to detonate it exactly the right way at the exact right time. Calculations had derived the rough volume of the object to be recovered, putting an upper bound on its approximate size, hence the distance to the crystal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGalactus, in radio contact with us, was outside in a hastily acquired space pod modified to run off of a local stock of explosive devices, with \u201CTNT INFINITY\u201D hastily scrawled on the side. Such a ship should not physically work according to every engineer and scientist in the Resistance, but like everything else Galactus laid his hands (hooves?) on, it somehow worked perfectly as long as nobody looked into it too closely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPlace your bets,\u201D I chuckled nervously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPrecisely nothing will happen!\u201D declared Tsian.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYeah, I\u2019m with Tsian on this one,\u201D said Kareen. \u201CThere\u2019s not going to be anything but empty space on the other end.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, Kareen, I mean, the mechanical part of it won\u2019t work. This thing has to precisely trigger a crystal in the exact spot, at the exact time, in order to work at all. No engineering device has the capacity to work so flawlessly.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHey!\u201D called out a technician. \u201CI built that. It will work. Yet still nothing will happen, as you cannot have possibly solved that equation in three hours.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI am the foremost scientist alive in my field!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou are the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0scientist alive in your field!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI don\u2019t know why,\u201D said Xanth, who had just popped in, \u201CBut yeah. Nothing will happen.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI can hear you guys,\u201D reported Galactus. \u201CThere\u2019s any number of useful artifacts Ladstini could be sending me. Notes on the location of the Magic Boulder, the Golden Mushroom of Gal-Godoshinoai, his wizard hat\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGalactus, I\u2019m going to be blunt here\u2026 Nobody believes you. The entire Galactic Union\u2019s scientists and engineers have come together time and time again, and every time they have come to the conclusion that your stories, though fantastic entertaining, cannot possibly coexist with our current understanding of physics.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd yet he can fly to a black hole on a rocket powered by TNT,\u201D said Evelina quietly, staring at the device so far away. \u201CYour science can\u2019t explain that, not yet at least.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAny sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,\u201D I began, \u201CAnd if you eliminate the impossible, the truth must remain.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAre you suggesting Galactus is magical?\u201D asked another technician incredulously. \u201CI mean, I knew you humans had some catching up to do, but aren\u2019t you both a little old for \u00A0magic?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAdmittedly, yeah,\u201D I said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvelina leaned over and turned off the link to Galactus\u2019 radio. \u201CWe read a paper on the way to the black hole. It said that Galactus might be a Quantum Linked Being?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s a fringe theory, I wouldn\u2019t trust it,\u201D said Tsian.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut if you thought it was a completely stupid theory you would have stronger words than that,\u201D said Jebediah.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd when you measure his technology, it doesn\u2019t do anything out of the ordinary?\u201D I asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut it keeps on working when we aren\u2019t looking,\u201D said Jebediah.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCould Galactus\u2019 subconscious be influencing quantum waveform collapse?\u201D Evelina theorized.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIf it were that simple,\u201D replied Tsian, \u201CIt would be an open and shut case\u2026 But something more complicated along those lines is a theory. But when we discuss it with other suspected QLBs, they suddenly stopped being able to reproduce results.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHence why I turned off the radio,\u201D Evelina said. \u201CIt might work because Galactus believes it can\u2026 Or maybe his subconscious believes it can. The others have a logical explanation, and therefore, the magic is gone - It is limited to what he believes to be possible.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s the stupidest theory I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201D said Tsian as he turned the radio back on. \u201CBut then again, I have already eaten my words once today.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COne minute,\u201D said Kareen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJebediah! Old friend!\u201D said Galactus in a strained voice. \u201CYou believe me, at least?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah paused. After a few seconds he responded. \u201CYes, Galactus. I believe you.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAll of it?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes. Every single bit,\u201D he lied.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThirty seconds.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWilling to put money on that?\u201D asked Tsian.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI have none, and neither do any of us.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh then.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou can bet in stars,\u201D suggested Xanth. \u201CWhat?\u201D I thought.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou know what, sure. Ten stars.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDeal.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI believe you too, Galactus,\u201D said Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you. Here goes nothing.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFive. Four. Three. Two. One.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a bright black flash. Galactus gasped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI think you owe me ten stars,\u201D Jebediah said, grinning ferociously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CConceded,\u201D Tsian breathed lightly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOut of the window, a bit far away, floated a gray rock, 15-20 meters in diameter, punctuated by streaks and flecks of some glowing green material.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBy Ladstini\u2019s Grace\u2026 We have been delivered the Magic Boulder.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGALACTUS!\u201D shouted a new voice. \u201CIs that\u2026 Is that truly you?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPhil? Phil The Pig? Tell me something only Phil would know!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe applesauce incident.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPHIL! IT IS YOU! How have you been, man?\u201D A small spaceship appeared from behind the Magic Boulder, housing Phil The Pig in a space suit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI searched for centuries, Galactus. After we parted ways, I resumed the search. I found Ladstini\u2019s notes. I found the final Golden Mushroom and then two more after that. I searched planet after planet after star after star, till I had gone so far, I wasn\u2019t sure if I could find my way back any more. But I found it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou found the MAGIC BOULDER, Phil!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut no matter how hard I looked, I could not find you.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COn the soul of the great Mushroom, Phil, I swear, I\u2019m so sorry. I never gave up the search. Never. But I could never find my way back to you. We said we would meet at Infinity City if we ever got lost. But Infinity City never showed itself again - and all roads lead to Infinity City!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh Galactus, how I\u2019ve missed you! But\u2026 The last thing I remember is getting blown up. Can you explain what I am doing here?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COf course!\u201D shouted Tsian. \u201CThe distribution was over a wide range of space.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWho is he?\u201D asked Phil The Pig.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUh, it\u2019s\u2026 complicated.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDo we have to save a planet again or something?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe have to save the universe.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNice. This will be what, the third time?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHalf an observable universe away,\u201D muttered Tsian in awe. \u201CAnd judging by the field size, Phil would have been blown up decades or centuries ago! So the crystal picked up him and all the pieces of the boulder, retrieving them here! And that explains why we haven\u2019t contacted them! We haven\u2019t even bothered checking that far out yet, not that our communication devices could hope to pick a signal up from that far away!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo you\u2019re saying, mr serious science man, that I died years ago?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPrecisely!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COk, Phil,\u201D said Galactus. \u201CHere\u2019s the short version. I found these guys. Uber peaceful. Like I had to lie about my laser guns being for asteroid defense to get them past them.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat?\u201D shouted Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTrusting, kind, caring, even, no, especially to a fault. They banded up all 80-odd species in the galaxy trying to find life and keep the peace, but they found an absence of civilization. Then eventually - \u201C\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFaster version, please.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBig evil aliens attacked and this station is the only place left.

He had been in the shadows, detached from the rest of the group, but now he walked out into the light. \u201CWhat exactly can this boulder do?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, we don\u2019t know!\u201D said Phil. \u201CWe do know it can, in theory, restore planets. We don\u2019t know how that works, though.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBy Moho\u2026 \u201C gasped Jebediah. \u201CIt\u2019s all real\u2026 We\u2026 We can save Meros!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe can save Jslan!\u201D shouted Kareen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIf it works, we can save the galaxy,\u201D Xanth said in awe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe just need to translate the text on this slab of rock, here. We split up the device for safekeeping.

There\u2019s huge militaries there!\u201D said Phil. \u0022Might only be able to remember a few hundred that were specifically destroyed...

Galactus, did you see planet Pock at all after the detonation?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, I did not. When I looked back it was gone.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo debris?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou know, that is kinda suspicious now that you mention it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd,\u201D I turned off the radio, \u201CGalactus is possibly a quantum linked being.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd individuals, at least in theory, become quantum linked after large numbers of Illasticonian crystal jumps,\u201D whispered Tsian. \u201CBut a large one would do the trick just the same.\u201D He pulled out a paper and began scribbling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBy Moho,\u201D Jeb said, as he turned the radio back on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd the asteroid or whatever that hit planet Pock. Could that have triggered\u2026 it?\u201D I asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTsian put down his pen. \u201CGiven the field strength and best guess distance, it would have to be over four thousand kilometers in radius.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGalactus, how big was planet Pock?\u201D asked Jebediah.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAbout 4700 kilometers in radius.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat must have been one big asteroid,\u201D remarked Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m not following this,\u201D Cheng said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNeither am I!\u201D said Galactus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYeah, what is it, Ethan?\u201D asked Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat if\u2026 What if the core of Planet Pock\u2026 Was one giant Illasticonian crystal?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n========== Star-Ethan\u2019s Journal\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA theory. Just a theory. Not much else to go off of. I\u2019m completely ashamed of how excited I got. Looking back on it, its foolish. It couldn\u2019t possibly be correct! What do I know about this stuff? I was quasi-randomly selected to go into space one day and I\u2019ve been stumbling into nothing but trouble ever since\u2026 Is it possible that I am a quantum linked being? No, knowing about it stops it\u2026 Unless I just stopped it\u2026 And that takes a gazillion Illasticonian crystals. Would anticonian crystal use reverse quantum linking? Could you be negatively quantum linked? Cursed with bad luck instead of good luck? Would Phil The Pig have meaningful bad luck after just one use of an anticonian crystal?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, everyone completely ran with the \u201COh, Planet Pock was an Illasticonian Crystal\u201D thing even after I tried to calm them down. Tsian swore on his life that it was closest thing to an answer we had. Jeb and Galactus endorsed it wholeheartedly, and Cheng is now crafting our strategy around it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFortunately, the original strategy will still work even if the boulder or the crystal turns out to be a dud, but I\u2019ll be responsible for perhaps the biggest letdown in the history of the universe - the death of the last hope this corner of the universe may ever experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight, implications\u2026 So, if you haven\u2019t put it together yet, if we trigger this planet-sized Illasticonian crystal without shattering it - assuming it is one crystal and not a non-homogenous mix of rock and crystal\u2026 The entire crust of the planet, and everyone on it can be teleported an incomprehensible distance away - hopefully far, far, far away from the reach of The Species. Granted, the crust may just collapse into itself given the hollow planet that results, but we will cross that bridge when we come to it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a debate among us. Some of us wanted to spawn in Planet Pock right here. Detonate it, get far away, and then respawn every dead planet with the final charge of the boulder. The rest of us wanted to wait for the shield to drop, take the boulder to Kerbin, spawn the boulder there, get everyone off of Kerbin and onto Pock, then detonate the crystal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs much as it pains me to say this\u2026 Permanently abandoning all of humanity save for 3 of us, and nearly all of Kerbalkind\u2026 Well, it appears to be the best option. We could respawn like 90% of the galaxy on the other side. The boulder allows the resurrection of destroyed planets\u2026 Kerbin has not been destroyed yet, and the other 10% are worlds that have been enslaved. Going to Kerbin would be extremely risky. I want to scream and cry, but this is logically the best thing to do. We have the key to the universe, we should not run headlong into no-man\u2019s-land with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rest of us came to that conclusion as well. After a fight, one of the technicians tried to use the boulder. It didn\u2019t work, the boulder turned an angry red for a few seconds and burned their hand (singular their, species is genderless).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTouch thine boulder with purest intent\u201D doesn\u2019t appear to be poetic license\u2026 The boulder will not work if your intentions are selfish\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPeople lined up to try. Hospital is full of burnt hands. It seems like this boulder doesn\u2019t like logic\u2026 Or maybe it wants the probability of saving the most amount of beings\u2026 I don\u2019t know how it would read that, but it literally has \u201CMagic\u201D in its name. Or maybe everyone did it out of fear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter some discussion, it was determined that the only one here who can reasonably be trusted to activate the boulder is Galactus The Cow himself. If searching tirelessly for the boulder for centuries if not millennia just to save his planet isn\u2019t \u201CPurest Intent,\u201D I don\u2019t know what can be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough come to think of it, \u201CPure\u201D intent just means undiluted. 100%. It is possible to have pure Evil intent\u2026 But whatever. Maybe it just fit into the poem well enough. Or maybe... No, it has to mean good! Otherwise The Species would have found it and used it by now! Unless they haven\u0027t found it, and are waiting to steal it from us... Maybe this was a ploy to make us recover it for them... But then why have they not stolen it back yet? Their plan must not be complete yet...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only problem is that Galactus refuses to activate the boulder. He wants to save Kerbin. Even Phil could not convince him otherwise\u2026 So our hand is forced. We will take the boulder to the Kerbin system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAccording to Cheng, here is the current plan:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe are already on high alert. As soon as the shield drops, The plan will be telepathically communicated to Jebediah on Kerbin to ensure their co-operation. We can predict neutron star alignments about a minute or two out with reasonable accuracy. Once an alignment happens, every five hours on average, an alarm will sound, and everyone will board their ships in the Tauquantum Gate. The Gate will power on even if some people haven\u2019t made it. I even slept in a ship last night just to make sure. Most of us are. The rest are sleeping in their spacesuits next to the airlocks, making forever sure their alarm clocks are functional.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe gate will fire us, and three cargo ships, one of which is carrying the Magic Boulder (there are 3 in the vague hope that it will confuse The Species) through the long chain of neutron stars, and we should pop out somewhere in the sphere of influence of Kerbin. Our side to side distance is very well constrained, but without a gate to receive us on the other end, our forward-back distance is not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGalactus, at this point, will activate the Magic Boulder, summoning Planet Pock. According to Tsian\u2019s Magic Boulder User Manual, this should only take a few seconds. If it works, Planet Pock will be placed into an orbit around Kerbin just above its Roche limit. All of the spaceships built for the escape from the Species will instead be used to get as many people as possible onto the surface of Planet Pock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe three cargo ships, which have been modified for maximum acceleration, will accelerate halfway to Planet Pock and decelerate the other half of the way. Depending on how accurate we are, this could take up to twelve minutes depending on how accurate our jump is. Most of our ships have been modified with weapons. Some of our ships were even looted from Earth itself (Earth\u2019s fate remains unclear - either capture or destruction). These madlads pulled a nuclear submarine out of the seas and across the stars, bolting fusion engines to it. Our job is to protect the freighters. During this time, the evacuation of Kerbin will be in progress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce the boulder is safely on the surface of Planet Pock, if the threat is minimal, we will wait for as long as we can to evacuate as many people as possible before detonating the Crystal (we still are arguing about what the best way to detonate the crystal is - Someone suggested using that giant solar beam that is powering Kerbin. It will take some time to burn through the crust but it will not crack the crystal). If we are under active attack and are losing badly, the crystal will be detonated as soon as possible using whatever means necessary, including warp speed ramming.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe will be left behind in this case. But still, what a way to go out\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe planet will crumble like it did for Galactus, scattering fragments throughout the unobservable universe. But one of those fragments will contain the Magic Boulder. We don\u2019t know how much data the boulder needs to restore a planet, but we have engraved instructions into the black slab of rock on the boulder (eerily similar to a monolith) in almost every language spoken by the Union, as well as a list of destroyed planets. Curiously, instead of the 80-90 that are known, we have attached thousands of names\u2026 I asked Jebediah about that and he would not answer\u2026 Galactus and Phil also were able to recall a few hundred planets from their travels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hope is that the survivors of the detonation will be able to either recover and use the boulder, or that the boulder will drift through space until someone finds it and is able to use it. It is possible that a bad enough detonation will cause Planet Pock to fragment into so many pieces that the boulder will be destroyed, but even then, the boulder was destroyed before\u2026 Perhaps the Great Wizard Ladstini will help the other people out there recover it from its destruction. The important part is getting it far away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCome to think of it, a great deal of the survivors may become Quantum Linked, unless we tell them about it\u2026 Wait hold on, could there be more of Galactus\u2019 kind out there? Throughout the unobservable universe, eternities away, all quantum linked, searching for a way to bring their home back? If we respawn Planet Pock, will it clone them? Or will the planet just be empty? So there will be a bunch of superhero cows flying throughout the universe, and a bunch of non superhero cows who then become superhero cows after the second detonation of Planet Pock? Could one meet the other, and it would be like that meme of the spidermen pointing at each other? Are there other things like the Magic Boulder out there in the cosmos? Could you make infinite supercows by detonating Planet Pock repeatedly? Could they band together to defeat McDonald\u2019s?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have somehow found this journal, via the Kpad itself, or via the autosave to this Tauquantum Gate\u0027s network, I apologize profusely for this nonsensical ramblings and speculations. I would say that these are questions for another time, but for all I know, I could die in the next few hours - there may not be another time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvery moment with Evelina could be my last.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019ll never get to be truly good at piano. I\u0027ll never be able to make and release that album.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019ll never be able to finish my stories.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll these things, doomed to only be remembered by The Species if they deem these memories worthy of the storage space they take up\u2026 I mean, with so much history, they have to be keeping some records, right? But with their hyper-efficiency, surely they must not be keeping everything. And what is another teenage romance in the grand scheme of the unobservable cosmoverse? What is my life? What is this planet? What is this galaxy? All these stories and memories and songs and lives, doomed to be forgotten forever mere hours from now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mean\u2026 It was inevitable. Everyone is forgotten eventually. Even great generals and leaders eventually fade to dust. The Union has only been around, what, six thousand years? Wait\u2026 Why is that so recent? Oh, probably doesn\u2019t matter\u2026 Our own history is slightly less than that as a species\u2026 We have forgotten much. I don\u2019t know how much they have forgotten\u2026 But surely it is all dust in the end.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I do not want this sudden vaporization. I want people to know. I know not if the time a memory is remembered matters more or less than the number of people that memory reaches, or the extent of that reach, but I know that memories cannot crystallize within the fabric of Humanity - well, what\u2019s the word for not just humans\u2026 Memories cannot crystallize within the fabric of Us without time. Take my life now (well, preferably not) if only in exchange for the time to become a fond memory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow, at the end of time, we would all fight to just remember one more time\u2026 As our memories turn to dust, I suppose, we would, defy all rationality to remember just one more time, hoarding the dust as ferociously as a lost man in the desert devours water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u2019t want to go\u2026 I want to hoard this dust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis ship is stifling. I want to get out but if I do I may never get back in. What else is there to do here but endlessly spiral into crises of existence, besides watch the stars, of course.

So it was true. The Universe, having been birthed no more than 1.2 billion years ago, was to die.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYo, chill out, man,\u201D said Raul\u2019s friend and colleague, Samul.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe Universe is dying, Samul.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI think it is a bit premature, Raul, to come to that conclusion, and we\u2019ve known about entropy for millennia, why freak out now?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI don\u2019t mean heat death, Samul, we all know that the space and matter that makes up the universe is almost certainly non renewable. Duh. I mean how the universe experiences itself\u2026 Life. Living. Being alive. Energy is, of course, finite, but it is less finite than life itself. Energy kills. The Peaceful wield Energy to traverse the stars, the Energy kills them. The Warlike wield Energy to kill others, but they kill more than just others. And if, by some miracle, life learns to control the Energy of the universe, they will simply burn through all of its Energy in a wasteful fit, as life must always be more finite than Energy.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRaul, do me a favor.

I see the remains of all who have fallen to the Energy, the worlds of those who are doomed to fall to the Energy, and a deceptively small expanse for those who learn to control it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe Coal is finite, so we found the Oil. The Oil is finite, so we found the Uranium. The Uranium is finite, so we found the Fate. Even Fate is finite, so we found the Stars. And, Raul, if we become prosperous enough to burn through every last star, surely there will be more to find. It is what we always do.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd what happens at the end?

When the universe dies, whoever is last will look back on us and say \u201CIf only they had not wasted the Stars! The Fate! The Uranium! The Oil! The Coal! They\u2019d give so, so much for the energy contained in a speck of dust, just to live a little longer, to see and to feel for just one more moment. Do you really want that on your conscience?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, no, but\u2026 Raul, what is there to do? Hoard the dust?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes.

Hypothetically\u2026 With all this dust you would have hoarded\u2026 What would you do with it?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, priority one would be to learn enough to hoard the dust better\u2026 Priority two, hoard all of the dust. Priority three would be to use all of the dust to learn all there is to know, and see if the reversal of entropy is possible\u2026 Priority four, once entropy is reversed, I mean, well, burn all the stars you want, I don\u2019t care, we can all do whatever we want. Use the supernovas as fireworks for all I care.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd if the knowledge needed to reverse entropy is less finite than the dust needed to attain it?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, I mean, like, if we\u2019ve used most of the dust it\u2019s not looking promising that we can make more, I\u2019d say we should, I don\u2019t know, use the rest of it for...

The crash had killed him, no doubt, was this heaven? Was this hell? It was a dark room, he was surrounded by stuff. The room accelerated, Ethan was in tremendous pain. All of a sudden, there was a flash of white.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd he saw them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd they were beautiful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMemories upon memories far greater than his tiny mind could comprehend, much less hold, flooded his mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis mind could not think, but a shadow of a thought formed between the screams: \u201CThis must be The Species\u2019 record of all of the worlds they have destroyed!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd from the vision he knew their strategy - minimal energy storage. Why store when there is so much universe? They had scouted far further than they had devoured, and were an expanding sphere of emptiness, all energy put towards moving forward faster and faster, for the worlds were dying ever so quick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome of the worlds did not make sense. His shadows began to think, but in that moment it all ended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe machinery was torn from him and he was left floating in space. Shocked, he tried to recall anything he had just thought, any specifics, but it was all gone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEverything was all silent. There were no screams, no shouts, nothing at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpinning around he saw the Magic Boulder mere dozens of meters away and began jetpacking through the pain towards it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe looked back at the species ship, apparently frozen. Had their plan worked? Do something unexpected and they would not know what to do? Did he disable it in the crash? The few seconds before the crash had vanished from his memory\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother shadow of a thought formed. Himself and the boulder were on a suborbital trajectory He had no heat shield, but the boulder was all but indestructible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut he pressed on and reached out and hoped it would be enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEthan Edwards crashed into the boulder at fifty meters per second.

He responded with the shadows, and the boulder obliged.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Magic Boulder glowed brightly, intensifying over a few seconds, before winking out of existence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEthan looked up again at the Species ship. It now appeared to have recovered somewhat, and a number of weapons appeared to point at him, but the only thing he could do was laugh.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuddenly, the giant beam that had supplied Kerbin with electricity stuttered, and abruptly moved, coming alarmingly close to the surface of Kerbin, before impacting the mothership head on, obliterating it in seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of the Species ships paused and warped away as if in fear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSquare cube law, take that, you demons!\u201D shouted Ethan in triumph.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA moment ago he would have been content to just lay back and burn up, but he was suddenly once again fueled with an inexplicable drive to survive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the distance he spotted a piece of debris. Was that the Emerson? It survived the collision?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe pain came roaring back, but he knew he had to get to it if he wanted to survive.

A few decades after the early Duna missions, during the first Jool 5 mission, Kerbin suffered a global thermonuclear war. Hundreds of millions perished. We held on ever so tightly, but we were slipping. Those K drive ships, those unreliable little fellas, those sorry excuses for exploration vessels, were not to find life. They were to find a habitable world we could escape to and find civilization on.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd instead, you found Meros.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CA habitable world, perfect atmosphere, perfect gravity - \u201C\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou were going to kill them to save your own species! You are monsters!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo! Well\u2026 There were many higher ups who, upon hearing the initial news, wanted to let Meros boil until nobody was left, then terraform it back to the pre-apocalypse state\u2026 But, well, it proved impossible and there was significant pushback. What actually happened was far more interesting. After the war, the divisions still remained, several separate groups of Kerbals were exploring space, there were extreme tensions\u2026 If the Fate had been discovered before then, Kerbalkind would have surely perished\u2026 The protocol for discovering a habitable world, by all major factions, was to keep it secret and defend it from the others. But then, after we discovered Meros, we all expected to fight over it, but the life\u2026 The life was priceless. Instead of fighting for Meros, we fought for the Merosians. We all came together, we pooled our ships, we tried to create any plan we could think of.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd it failed?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI failed.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJebediah, stop destroying yourself.

We don\u2019t! We don\u2019t fight at all! All the nukes we would have fought each other with? We blew all of them up on Meros and we didn\u2019t make any more. We couldn\u0027t save Meros, but for those few weeks where we had hope, we were damn well prepared to. The food we were going to grow to feed Meros through the famine? In those weeks we figured out how to modify them to leach contaminants out of the soil. The spaceships we collaborated to build? We could move everyone to the Mun while we fixed up Kerbin. The terraforming technology we had created? Turns out we could also use it on Kerbin! All of the anti radiation stuff? We couldn\u2019t produce enough to protect the Merosians from the fallout, so we were going to give them ours. We were prepared to kill our planet out of pettiness, but we were, all as one, collectively willing to die a slow cancerous death to give them a chance in a million of surviving. Healing doesn\u2019t happen through brute force. Healing happens while you are distracted.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo\u2026 The Mission.

Well, not just a distraction\u2026 The Jool 5 was symbolically chosen for the Kerbals, this has been very hard on them\u2026 All the secret keeping, being relocated\u2026 But there were very few who objected.

The drama of possibly not having enough seats on the return vehicle? The drama of a stowaway? I\u2019ll tell you what I saw.

Suddenly there\u2019s no distance barrier to your perceived enemies. No language barrier. No financial barrier. No time barrier. No class barrier. Not even any external barriers to accomplishing their dreams, you want to build a flying submarine, just ask us and we\u2019ll foot the bill! And too distracted by the strange mysterious aliens who will kill everyone if a dysfunctional space mission fails, that they didn\u2019t once notice that their supposed enemies had become their closest friends.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah looked straight at me and took a deep breath.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou know what I see? I see Turks debating the intricacies of Whack-A-Kerbal strategy over dinner with Greeks. I see Catholics and Sunnis working on how to optimize the angle of solar panels on the cities we built. I see Americans and the Chinese programming video games together. I see Indians and Pakistanis collaborating on aerobatic drones. North and South Koreans building giant art sculptures. Teams of Russians and Ukrainians playing Frisbee against people from all over Myanmar. Israelis and Palestinians writing a musical about that guy who infiltrated one of the secret underground cities we have. Conservatives and Liberals together writing Constitutions to rival that of the Kerbals. Capitalists and Communists composing symphonies. The rich and the poor designing roller coasters. And I see a naive American, an arrogant North Korean, a neglected Russian, a broken Liberian, and an abrasively enthusiastic Irishman, who, with the support of seven billion others, managed to, against all odds, complete on the first try a mission to Jool and its moons, and, well, most of the way back. Ethan, I see\u2026 I see in you a small fraction of what I saw in us. I see the scars fading. I see the sun rising.

I have almost no memory of the event itself, the cool part was obviously a setup by some higher power, and during the uncool part I managed to mistake a random scrap of metal for the Emerson, which definitely did not survive a head on collision with a moon sized starship at three kilometers per second.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstead, credit Evelina. She, who had ventured so far forth in the Tauquantum gate that she popped out closer to Duna than Kerbin, and knowing she had zero chance of survival, made her way to the nearby relay mirror controlling one of the giant laser beams that powers Kerbin, hacked into it, disabled every single safeguard, and managed to aim it with several seconds of light speed delay directly into the heart of the Species mothership, completely destroying it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, she will tell you \u201CIt is just idiot proof, not malice proof\u201D and \u201CIt had to be a setup, of course they could have dodged it if they wanted to!\u201D but don\u2019t let her do herself dirty like that, what she did was at the bare minimum at least as cool as what I did.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe will go back to Earth tomorrow. And that\u2019s tomorrow in Kerbin days, so we have what, five hours left? Maybe closer to four by the time I post this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs such this will likely be the last entry on this blog. I\u2019ve been successfully de-cloned into just one me now, so no nonsense with Star or Space or Ground or Jonathan or Kevin any more. Just me. After I post this I don\u2019t intend to read any comments, or count the likes. I\u2019m going to transfer all these blog posts and journals to a memory storage device, keep it on me, power off my KPad, leave it here, play some piano with Obbury quickly, and watch the sunset and sunrise with Evelina. Although I\u2019ll need help reverse engineering the file format and hardware into something readable by Earth computers\u2026 Speaking of which, wow, we\u2019re going to have to deal with Earth computers again. Compared to how good the Kerbal ones are, it is going to feel so slow!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn case you haven\u2019t heard, PSA, the Kerbals have done their best to remove people from dangerous situations. If you were skydiving or tightrope walking you should find yourself on the ground. All planes will be landed at the nearest airport. Etcetera. You will return in whatever health you are in now, if your cancer got cured while you were here, you won\u2019t re-get the cancer when you go home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is also possible that the boulder may have duplicated some of us. I\u2019m unsure exactly what the logic of the boulder is, but it tries to restore the planet to just before a major catastrophe with all people\u2019s memories of the catastrophe intact? But sometimes this results in duplicate people, and in at least two cases so far, duplicate planets!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u2019t be concerned though. Even if this type of cloning doesn\u2019t have telepathy, it is pretty awesome having a twin. I kinda wish I got the opportunity to play piano with myself. I never really was alone with myself long enough to think of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSoon we will have no more translation, no more immortality (except the first five minutes just in case the Kerbals missed anyone about to die - do NOT test it though just in case), but, well, no more freedom. Make sure to end your conversations a bit early as they will turn off translation a few seconds before the teleportation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe will have jobs again, we will have bills again, we will have all that good old pre-post-scarcity society stuff to deal with. But we will have a few things we did not have before. Memories, for one. Knowledge that we are not the only ones. Not only do we have the shock of \u201CHey there\u2019s like 80 other species in this galaxy!\u201D We also have the shock of \u201CWe literally can\u2019t count the number of species now!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut what I hope we take away from this the most, and forgive me if I\u2019m sounding too preachy, is a view of what things could be like if we mend our scars and prepare for the stars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe can become Kerbin. Well, not literally. But we can. Will it be easy? No, it will be the hardest thing we have ever done. But that\u2019s not a reason not to try. If anything it is a reason to try harder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mountain seems so tall, but keep on climbing, for should we reach the top and never slip and never fall, we will be rewarded with a view grander than any thus seen before. And when there is no further to climb, we shall learn to fly, and then, a new, far grander adventure shall commence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Kerbals will have their hands full for the next few decades trying to make sense of this brand new universe. The stars are whole again, and the entire focus of Kerbalkind must be utilized to help keep them that way. They say we\u2019ll be okay on our own, but the silence will be deafening\u2026 We need to make them proud, and there will come a day where we are able to help them as they have saved us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMay the Infinities smile upon you, and may we all smile back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI love you all,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Ethan Edwards\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n==========\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEthan and Evelina sat staring at the Mun, Minmus, and Planet Pock, holding hands, as the sun began to rise over the horizon of Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI wanted to be normal\u2026 But now I don\u2019t want this to end,\u201D Ethan said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI don\u2019t either.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CKnowing our finest moments are behind us\u2026 We aren\u2019t even adults yet.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI sure feel like one, though\u2026 Facing the fate of the universe really matures you pretty fast, doesn\u2019t it?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI feel both four and four hundred, and I find it impossible that I\u2019m biologically fifteen.\u201D There was a few seconds of silence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019re even, right?\u201D Evelina asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI think I\u2019ve lost count\u2026 But yes.

It was a centralized single galaxy organization with an emphasis on solving internal conflicts before branching out, strict conformity to the highest ideals, exceedingly high requirements to join, and a high emphasis on peace.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this new universe, where the Infinities had awakened, half violent, half not, where The Species may still be lurking, where central authority could only project so far, and where so much help was needed in all directions, The Union simply would not do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first order of business was to begin missions into the unknown to disseminate the knowledge of the dangers of Fate drives and Fate weaponry, and the knowledge of second generation faster than light technologies.

While inter-species diseases in the past had been rare enough that it was dealt with on a case by case basis, it was no longer feasible in this new world. The great hospitals of Illasticonia were set to work on the creation of a system to mitigate the spread of disease.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe third order of business was the construction of a new council chamber. While there would no longer be a Council except in times of intense turmoil, a new physical location was needed, no longer as a place to vote, but as a place to facilitate diplomacy.

The spiral was divided into stripes and each stripe was filled with a different common atmosphere or hydrosphere. The spiral was gigantic, planning for species of enormous size. All manner of materials compatibility requirements were taken into account, and form fitting force fields would be available for those who could not survive in any of the regions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was all perfect, until a species of antimatter beings showed up.

One time falling into a black hole was too much, and while it was now difficult to reach, it was now, more or less, equally difficult for everyone to reach, much easier to maintain, and offered an unparalleled view of the Infinities beyond.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe old council chamber, having been reset by the Bouldering, still rests above the black hole (though a smidge higher, just in case) as a museum.

A seat was left open for The Species should they return and desire to join.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Harmony Of The Heavens was not a confederation of species.

Should the votes be divided one per being? Per world? Per intelligence point? Per contribution? Did artificial intelligences count? Where was the line between intelligent and non intelligent?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the end it was decided that nothing could be done to ensure a fair distribution of the votes. In the rare case where central authority was needed for a monumental decision, a council would be randomly selected from those on board the chamber, and a simple vote taken. Not an ideal solution, but it was hoped that such authority would not be needed on a regular basis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid it go smoothly? Not in the slightest, but did it work?

The amount of energy produced by the slaves just barely did not recoup the energy required to enslave them (plus opportunity cost) rather than harvest their planet. Further simulation time was allocated to further optimize this.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ESeveral notable beings were picked out and a story was formed around them. Building them up as heroes. Presenting them as heroes. Crushing them - crushing the species into slavery. Simulations showed that the enslavement time could be extended to approximately 123 years 11 months 2 days this way.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThe story played out without issue initially. The simulations showed, though, that the line between the human response being crushing defeat and triumphant rebellion was as thin as it was nonsensical. An incredibly inefficient and illogical species.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ESpecial attention was paid to the final shot. Everyone remaining on Kerbin and Pock would be watching this live. The shot, its brightness, length, velocity, color, and even what cancers it would cause were optimized almost without end. It would hit the Voyager square on, perfectly framed in the camera shot, and the Voyager would explode in a carefully choreographed fashion into precisely calculated pieces which would bounce harmlessly across a (fake) deflector shield. The exact composition of this shot mattered to the utmost degree, as the slightest improvement could yield billions of man-hours of slave labor.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EJackie the Runner was a human attempting to run all around Kerbin. She happened to be nearby when the battle was to take place, so she was subtly nudged in the right direction to collide with Ethan and Evelina, delaying them a critical amount of time, so they would enter Mission Control at just the right moment.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThe Species ceased to care about Jackie after that instant, as it was highly unlikely she would matter.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EWhen the Vehicle Assembly Building collapsed under the impact of an orbital ring tower, the exotic gases inside the Genocide Button were dispersed far and wide rapidly. One of these particles made its way over to Jackie, who was for some reason, still running towards the escape craft. It entered her nose and had an interaction with her biology, a chain reaction that ultimately led her to reconsider the situation and head for the nearest intact shelter, which happened to be Mission Control.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EShe entered the door, which opened with a bang, as it had been set to offer as little resistance as possible earlier that week to allow for an easier entry by Ethan and Evelina.

When all of the energy has been accumulated, accumulate knowledge at all costs and efficiencies. Where the latter may help the former, balance these accumulations. When knowledge suggests that half of all remaining energy has been used, and there are no promising paths to obtain greater energy, or when knowledge is obtained of how to accumulate an infinite amount of energy, observe the second directive. Do not observe the second directive until then - knowledge of the second directive is detrimental to the accomplishment of the first directive.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThe second directive was encased in many layers, expanded upon over the eternities by The Species.

Healing doesn\u2019t happen through brute force. Healing happens while you are distracted.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo\u2026 The Mission. The Voyager\u2026 It was all a distraction?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes. Well, not just a distraction\u2026 The Jool 5 was symbolically chosen for the Kerbals, this has been very hard on them\u2026 All the secret keeping, being relocated\u2026 But there were very few who objected. We were prepared to do far worse for you. The Council did not just assign us the Humans to save them\u2026 But so we could have a chance to redeem ourselves.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh, so it doesn\u2019t matter that we broke half of the rules and didn\u2019t even complete the mission?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh, not in the slightest,\u201D chuckled Jebediah as he began to tear up. \u201CWhat do you see?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI see a dysfunctional crew barely lucking through every landing, bringing shame to our race every time we do something stupid?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFar more distracting than a perfect mission. Although I wouldn\u2019t have launched that YouTuber if I had a chance to do it over again.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat was planned?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMaximum chaos! The drama of possibly not having enough seats on the return vehicle? The drama of a stowaway? I\u2019ll tell you what I saw. Humans so outraged by the mission and how it was going that they didn\u2019t notice that it was all going exactly as planned.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow so?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, there\u2019s the distraction, and the lack of barriers. Suddenly there\u2019s no distance barrier to your perceived enemies. No language barrier. No financial barrier. No time barrier. No class barrier. Not even any external barriers to accomplishing their dreams, you want to build a flying submarine, just ask us and we\u2019ll foot the bill! And too distracted by the strange mysterious aliens who will kill everyone if a dysfunctional space mission fails, that they didn\u2019t once notice that their supposed enemies had become their closest friends.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah looked straight at me and took a deep breath.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou know what I see? I see Turks debating the intricacies of Whack-A-Kerbal strategy over dinner with Greeks. I see Catholics and Sunnis working on how to optimize the angle of solar panels on the cities we built. I see Americans and the Chinese programming video games together. I see Indians and Pakistanis collaborating on aerobatic drones. North and South Koreans building giant art sculptures. Teams of Russians and Ukrainians playing Frisbee against people from all over Myanmar. Israelis and Palestinians writing a musical about that guy who infiltrated one of the secret underground cities we have. Conservatives and Liberals together writing Constitutions to rival that of the Kerbals. Capitalists and Communists composing symphonies. The rich and the poor designing roller coasters. And I see a naive American, an arrogant North Korean, a neglected Russian, a broken Liberian, and an abrasively enthusiastic Irishman, who, with the support of seven billion others, managed to, against all odds, complete on the first try a mission to Jool and its moons, and, well, most of the way back. Ethan, I see\u2026 I see in you a small fraction of what I saw in us. I see the scars fading. I see the sun rising. I see the tears vanishing, I see the smiles so brightly glowing, I see a land beyond all sorrows, I see a happy ending, and I see a new beginning.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah began crying as he hugged me. I began to cry as well and we stood there for what felt like a long time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHey, I don\u2019t mean to interrupt you, but the last thing I remember was an asteroid and then a giant explosion. Who are you, why is there a weird planet in the sky, and why are you in my kitchen?\u201D We both turned to face the Pockian cow who had entered the kitchen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUh\u2026 It\u2019s a long story,\u201D said Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJebediah!\u201D shouted a Kerbal who entered the room. \u201CI found you!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRegfan, it has been far too long!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe planets - they are back!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhich ones?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAll of them!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CVya?

The Great Receiver blew out from the sheer number of transmissions we are receiving!

HERE ARE THE PRINCIPLES OF A SAFER FASTER THAN LIGHT DRIVE.\u201D Attach the principles. Start at maximum power and turn the power up by 1 percent every minute until the antenna is destroyed. Do I make myself clear?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut sir, the Great Antenna took generations to build!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe are the only advanced civilization for galaxies in every direction. Every minute we delay they are going to be stupid and blow themselves up with Fate bombs and Fate drives. Did I stutter?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRight, sir\u2026 Sir, we cannot detect an ending. The signatures continue to the edge of the range of our sensors. Even in the furthest measurable instantaneous quantum spectrum, there is no change in density!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis is going to be a major headache. Come with me, we need a ship,\u201D said Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWait!\u201D I asked, grabbing his shoulder. \u201CWhat happens now?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, the Union has its hands full for the next however long, that\u2019s assuming The Species doesn\u2019t show up again\u2026 Likely we will send you back to Earth. We may or may not keep in touch. But Ethan, I must go!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJeb, I - Thank you.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMe?

Pretty much everything we planned went worse than expected!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CStop blaming yourself for Meros, Jebediah. It has turned you into someone nobody would rather you be.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou can say that all you want, but that scar will never heal. Nothing you can say will bring them back.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes, but something you do can.\u201D Jebediah froze and opened his mouth in shock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2026 We can save them,\u201D he whispered. \u201CRegfan!\u201D he shouted. \u201CI want half of our ships talking to nearby worlds in order of closeness. The other half, get a sunshield to Meros as fast as Kerbally possible. Put Bill in charge of the antenna and tell Xanth to head for Sector 12, he\u2019s good at that. Ethan!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes, sir!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI will never be able to repay you. You have my utmost gratitude. May the Infinities smile upon you - I could never know, but I sincerely hope they all would.\u201D And at last, I understood that expression.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou can ask them yourself now.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019re right, I can.\u201D Jebediah smiled and ran out of the door. It would be the last time I ever saw him in person. He left me and an extremely confused Pockian cow in the kitchen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo, uh, do you want the long story, or the longer story?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n==========\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEthan\u2019s Public Blog, One Week Post Bouldering\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, first of all, y\u2019all are giving me waaaaaaay too much credit. I have almost no memory of the event itself, the cool part was obviously a setup by some higher power, and during the uncool part I managed to mistake a random scrap of metal for the Emerson, which definitely did not survive a head on collision with a moon sized starship at three kilometers per second.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstead, credit Evelina. She, who had ventured so far forth in the Tauquantum gate that she popped out closer to Duna than Kerbin, and knowing she had zero chance of survival, made her way to the nearby relay mirror controlling one of the giant laser beams that powers Kerbin, hacked into it, disabled every single safeguard, and managed to aim it with several seconds of light speed delay directly into the heart of the Species mothership, completely destroying it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, she will tell you \u201CIt is just idiot proof, not malice proof\u201D and \u201CIt had to be a setup, of course they could have dodged it if they wanted to!\u201D but don\u2019t let her do herself dirty like that, what she did was at the bare minimum at least as cool as what I did.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe will go back to Earth tomorrow. And that\u2019s tomorrow in Kerbin days, so we have what, five hours left? Maybe closer to four by the time I post this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs such this will likely be the last entry on this blog. I\u2019ve been successfully de-cloned into just one me now, so no nonsense with Star or Space or Ground or Jonathan or Kevin any more. Just me. After I post this I don\u2019t intend to read any comments, or count the likes. I\u2019m going to transfer all these blog posts and journals to a memory storage device, keep it on me, power off my KPad, leave it here, play some piano with Obbury quickly, and watch the sunset and sunrise with Evelina. Although I\u2019ll need help reverse engineering the file format and hardware into something readable by Earth computers\u2026 Speaking of which, wow, we\u2019re going to have to deal with Earth computers again. Compared to how good the Kerbal ones are, it is going to feel so slow!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn case you haven\u2019t heard, PSA, the Kerbals have done their best to remove people from dangerous situations. If you were skydiving or tightrope walking you should find yourself on the ground. All planes will be landed at the nearest airport. Etcetera. You will return in whatever health you are in now, if your cancer got cured while you were here, you won\u2019t re-get the cancer when you go home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is also possible that the boulder may have duplicated some of us. I\u2019m unsure exactly what the logic of the boulder is, but it tries to restore the planet to just before a major catastrophe with all people\u2019s memories of the catastrophe intact? But sometimes this results in duplicate people, and in at least two cases so far, duplicate planets!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u2019t be concerned though. Even if this type of cloning doesn\u2019t have telepathy, it is pretty awesome having a twin. I kinda wish I got the opportunity to play piano with myself. I never really was alone with myself long enough to think of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSoon we will have no more translation, no more immortality (except the first five minutes just in case the Kerbals missed anyone about to die - do NOT test it though just in case), but, well, no more freedom. Make sure to end your conversations a bit early as they will turn off translation a few seconds before the teleportation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe will have jobs again, we will have bills again, we will have all that good old pre-post-scarcity society stuff to deal with. But we will have a few things we did not have before. Memories, for one. Knowledge that we are not the only ones. Not only do we have the shock of \u201CHey there\u2019s like 80 other species in this galaxy!\u201D We also have the shock of \u201CWe literally can\u2019t count the number of species now!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut what I hope we take away from this the most, and forgive me if I\u2019m sounding too preachy, is a view of what things could be like if we mend our scars and prepare for the stars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe can become Kerbin. Well, not literally. But we can. Will it be easy? No, it will be the hardest thing we have ever done. But that\u2019s not a reason not to try. If anything it is a reason to try harder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mountain seems so tall, but keep on climbing, for should we reach the top and never slip and never fall, we will be rewarded with a view grander than any thus seen before. And when there is no further to climb, we shall learn to fly, and then, a new, far grander adventure shall commence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Kerbals will have their hands full for the next few decades trying to make sense of this brand new universe. The stars are whole again, and the entire focus of Kerbalkind must be utilized to help keep them that way. They say we\u2019ll be okay on our own, but the silence will be deafening\u2026 We need to make them proud, and there will come a day where we are able to help them as they have saved us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMay the Infinities smile upon you, and may we all smile back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI love you all,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Ethan Edwards\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n==========\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEthan and Evelina sat staring at the Mun, Minmus, and Planet Pock, holding hands, as the sun began to rise over the horizon of Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI wanted to be normal\u2026 But now I don\u2019t want this to end,\u201D Ethan said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI don\u2019t either.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CKnowing our finest moments are behind us\u2026 We aren\u2019t even adults yet.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI sure feel like one, though\u2026 Facing the fate of the universe really matures you pretty fast, doesn\u2019t it?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI feel both four and four hundred, and I find it impossible that I\u2019m biologically fifteen.\u201D There was a few seconds of silence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019re even, right?\u201D Evelina asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI think I\u2019ve lost count\u2026 But yes.

It was a centralized single galaxy organization with an emphasis on solving internal conflicts before branching out, strict conformity to the highest ideals, exceedingly high requirements to join, and a high emphasis on peace.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this new universe, where the Infinities had awakened, half violent, half not, where The Species may still be lurking, where central authority could only project so far, and where so much help was needed in all directions, The Union simply would not do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first order of business was to begin missions into the unknown to disseminate the knowledge of the dangers of Fate drives and Fate weaponry, and the knowledge of second generation faster than light technologies. There was no shortage of volunteers. They very nearly turned away some volunteers as there was concern that a shortage of starships could endanger the galactic economy!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFortunately, a certain binary planet system had suddenly acquired millions of intergalactic transport ships that were no longer needed for their original purpose!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second order of business was vaccinations. While inter-species diseases in the past had been rare enough that it was dealt with on a case by case basis, it was no longer feasible in this new world. The great hospitals of Illasticonia were set to work on the creation of a system to mitigate the spread of disease.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe third order of business was the construction of a new council chamber. While there would no longer be a Council except in times of intense turmoil, a new physical location was needed, no longer as a place to vote, but as a place to facilitate diplomacy. While main communication would now be virtual, for these reasons and also for sentiment, a new chamber was designed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGone were the 100 seats in four tiers, and in was a huge spiral world, the artificial gravity stronger and stronger the further away from the center you went. The spiral was divided into stripes and each stripe was filled with a different common atmosphere or hydrosphere. The spiral was gigantic, planning for species of enormous size. All manner of materials compatibility requirements were taken into account, and form fitting force fields would be available for those who could not survive in any of the regions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was all perfect, until a species of antimatter beings showed up. The accommodations necessary for them were very tough to implement, but in the end, surmountable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the center of the spiral was a massive spherical observation chamber, and at its core a stage with all manner of instruments, free for anyone to play.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe station was placed high above the north pole of the galaxy. One time falling into a black hole was too much, and while it was now difficult to reach, it was now, more or less, equally difficult for everyone to reach, much easier to maintain, and offered an unparalleled view of the Infinities beyond.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe old council chamber, having been reset by the Bouldering, still rests above the black hole (though a smidge higher, just in case) as a museum. The four tiered room itself had been restored to its pre boulder condition and was open for tours. A seat was left open for The Species should they return and desire to join.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Harmony Of The Heavens was not a confederation of species. It was a confederation of anything. One being, a nation, a moon, a planet, a star cluster, or anyone, really, could join, so long as they agreed to the following:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNo members of the Harmony Of The Heavens shall engage in interplanetary combat except when required to in response to an existential threat\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNo members of the Harmony Of The Heavens shall utilize Fate based technology except on designated testing worlds\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAll members of the Harmony Of The Heavens shall share their scientific discoveries\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAll members of the Harmony Of The Heavens shall submit to biological screenings to protect against interstellar pathogens, and must agree to non invasive mitigations prior to any interstellar journeys\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAll members of the Harmony Of The Heavens shall assist and protect all other members and non antagonistic non members in times of need to the best of their ability\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was endless debate about what these requirements should be, and more were added over the years, but in the end, given how little was known about The Infinities, it was decided to be as inclusive as possible - Do not fight one another, protect one another, and teach one another.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was debate about how voting should go. Should the votes be divided one per being? Per world? Per intelligence point? Per contribution? Did artificial intelligences count? Where was the line between intelligent and non intelligent?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the end it was decided that nothing could be done to ensure a fair distribution of the votes. In the rare case where central authority was needed for a monumental decision, a council would be randomly selected from those on board the chamber, and a simple vote taken. Not an ideal solution, but it was hoped that such authority would not be needed on a regular basis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid it go smoothly? Not in the slightest, but did it work?

Its first mission in 2056 was to retrieve the crew of the Zarya, who had become stranded. Its second mission in 2057 was to venture to the edge of the solar system and make sure it was safe.

I totally understand if you don\u0027t wanna go through all that work though... you\u0027ve already given us a lot in one of the most important things someone can give, a story. So thank you for finishing that, over these six years, it\u0027s a wonderful thing you\u0027ve done for us!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iamn00b","CreatedById":207378,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-20T13:02:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nngl my guy I think you could try writing something for r/HFY, good job with this story!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IntellectualTortoise","CreatedById":222175,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-21T21:50:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/161505-ultimate-steve/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022161505\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/161505-ultimate-steve/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Ultimate Steve\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Many thanks for this incredible ending to one of the most amazing stories I\u0027ve ever read on the forum.
