But I didn\u0027t realize that the INCLINATION window restricted me and I had to do something else. Ike still sounded good and I didn\u0027t need to re-start the mission. In fact, I drained most of the fuel in the S-IVB stage (The S-II too) so I had 300m/s left after the course was set for a DIRECT IKE ENCOUNTER. But then... The stack separator was attached in a wrong way (basically I guess the engine was attached to the S-IVB and the stack separator too...) and it just couldn\u0027t separate. Oh, and when I EVA the engine randomly explodes And the Command module separates. So should I try to dock the LM to the CSM and then Hazard-ish the S-IVB in Ike, then orbit it? What I mean is I\u0027m gonna destroy it in the surface and decouple it, like he did here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/D6ck-47LB7k?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr should I maybe just enter a low Ike orbit and wait for a rescue ship..?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb, Bill and Valentina need your help!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-22T12:17:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving to Mission Reports.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MythicalHeFF","CreatedById":176690,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-23T13:17:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you tried overheating the decoupler by turning on the CSM\u2019s engine to separate it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Autochrome","CreatedById":212032,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-23T21:21:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224105818\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022207276\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221648041452\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022176690\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jack Joseph Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, Jack Joseph Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you tried overheating the decoupler by turning on the CSM\u2019s engine to separate it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u2019s what I was thinking\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-23T21:30:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should be able to right click on the stack separator and toggle it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
