With an engineer on board, it can mine and refine ore efficiently enough to keep itself running constantly off of part of its fuel production via the fuel cells, while still churning out fuel at a pretty fast rate. It is wheeled for mobility, and has four \u0022Thud\u0022 radial thrusters to allow it to land safely from orbit. It\u0027s designed to dock with a special fuel carrier which is essentially a flying orange tank; that orange tank then uses part of the produced fuel to reach orbit and dock with a waiting space station, where it offloads almost all of its fuel, leaving just enough to deorbit. It then lands as close as possible to a miner, which drives up to it and docks, then begins to fill the tank up all over again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main advantage with surface refining is that you can use the fuel production capabilities of the lander alongside fuel cells to keep the miner running constantly; day/night is no longer even an issue.

The tanker rover brings the crude back to the refining base where it is stored. When the base\u0027s LFO reserves are cut into, it refines some of the held crude into fuel to replenish the reserves. The orbital station serves as the fuel point for munar crafts, as well as tanker tugs hauling fuel down to my very-LKO fueling stations (designed for SSTOs). When that has empty fuel cans delivered or when its on-board fuel reserves take a sizable hit, the shuttles deliver more fuel from the base to the station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEfficiency:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key to efficiency here is that, while this is a many-step process from extraction to usability, fuel is only expended in one leg of the process, shipping to orbit. For lower gravity worlds like Minmus, non-fuel-consuming wheeled vehicles are not a viable option, but the low gravity makes sub-orbital hopping far more viable. On the Mun, the gravity is high enough to make rovers usable, which I leveraged to minimize the amount of fuel utilized in what is my largest, highest yield ISRU operation yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mousethethird","CreatedById":143081,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T23:52:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhooph.

You do not need huge ground storage tanks for either ore or product. The big product tanks are part of the consumer vehicle, which you connect (dock, claw, KAS) to the base before starting production. So, you connect consumer and base, and start the drills. As soon as a small amount of ore gets in the tank, start the ISRU. As soon as a small amount of product appears in its tank, start pumping it into the consumer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe system will be limited by whichever process is slowest (drilling, refining, or pumping). Usually, it\u0027s drilling, so what you\u0027ll see eventually is nothing at all in any of the base\u0027s tanks but the tanks in the consumer gradually filling up as ore is converted and pumped out as product as fast as it\u0027s coming out of the ground. NOTE: This only works in places where you have good ore on a good landing field. But in this case, because the base is small, it can easily be a rover. This allows you to land the consumer anywhere in the vicinity and drive the base up to it, which simplifies both flying and connecting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E2.

Second, big ships are slow, hard to maneuver, and laggy. Besides, why go to all the trouble of setting up a refueling system, only to pack it up and take it somewhere else? So what I prefer to do is send out flotillas of small ships each with a specific role. Each individual ship is thus easier to deal with and cheaper. Plus, most of them won\u0027t be coming home anyway. They\u0027ll be permanent fuel systems at the various planets, which can be used later by other expeditions. But of course, OTOH, huge motherships are cool \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mousethethird","CreatedById":143081,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T14:49:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith motherships, you get everything a mission needs all in one big, laggy pack. All benefits of a station, all slapped together for transport, landing, and in this case, refuelling. I guess it\u0027s more the thought of realism than anything else for me; you wouldn\u0027t stuff a few humans into an Orion without a habitat for em on a 9 month journey to Mars. But, for probes, there\u0027s not a problem sending them to other places individually, other than me having to oversee them individually.

If I refuel around Duna, I can send a fully fueled ship to Dres more efficiently than direct from Kerbin. And then, more efficiently from Dres to Jool. Kerbin-Jool direct ~ 9000 dV with Kerb launch included. From Dres, only about ~4700 dV. With refuelling at every stop, I could effectively do a grand tour if I wanted. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T14:58:09Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 02:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mousethethird\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Goomblah","CreatedById":143441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T16:22:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mousethethird\u0022 data-cite=\u0022mousethethird\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf any tips on making either ground refineries or balanced motherships could be thrown out there, I would appreciate it.
