But I had a thought.... What if you could configure in the settings what resources you want to use? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was apparently ditched because, when tested, it seemed too complicated to implement. But we\u0027ve seen mine-able resources being added with mods - Kethane, Karbonite, two popular ones (the only two I know lol). So I thought \u0022How could they add resources while keeping it simple for players?\u0022 for a while. While playing another game (Can\u0027t remember which), I thought about activating certain resources through the settings. More advanced players could add more resources as they develop in kerbal space program. It makes it easier to handle adding a resource at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could be a possible fix to the complexity of multiple resources. If you have all the resources activated, you also use something similar to the ship type selector so that it shows certain resources at a time. Support, anyone? This could be built on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-14T22:08:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea of resources has been placed on the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWhat Not to Suggest List \u003C/a\u003Ebecause it has been discussed endlessly without productive results (and also because it tends to devolve into arguments).
