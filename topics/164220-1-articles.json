Make a quicksave in orbit, and load it. Eventually, frame rate will start getting worse after each load as CPU use goes up and up. Load 20 times in a row (this is what I did to verify the mechanism), and the game runs DRAMATICALLY slower. I\u0027m not certain whether it\u0027s only quickloads, or if repeated normal loads cause this as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Back out to the main menu, load the same game, load the same quicksave, and the leak is reset. Make a new quicksave and load it, load the main save, or return to space center, and it\u0027s still in full force. So, it can really build up over a long play session, as long as you don\u0027t go back to the main menu.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI first noticed this quite some time ago, but I didn\u0027t report it because I assumed that such a thing would already be known. But I see now that I should have reported it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nedit: I should add, that this is not really a support request, rather a bug report. The guide called this \u0022The Stock Support \u0026amp; Bugs forum\u0022, but I guess it was renamed. There\u0027s nothing else to suggest that this is a bug report forum, but the quote makes this the closest thing I could find.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nedit: Can anyone else verify this?

I lose several FPS every time I load or quick load, and I have to periodically go back to the main menu. It\u0027s certainly playable, but annoying when it creeps up on me and I\u0027m playing at 8 FPS (or worse) before I realize why. It seems to subtract a flat amount of FPS each time, such that the first several have no effect except to increase CPU load, then it takes a few to drop noticeably, then a few more drops it extremely low.
