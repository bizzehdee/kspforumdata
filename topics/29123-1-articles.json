Go to your parts folder, find the one you want to resize and copy then paste it\u0027s folder. Then change the name of the copied folder so you\u0027ll know what\u0027s in it. (eg. stacktricoupler copy becomes stacktricoupler 2.5m)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Open the part.cfg file in a text editor and look for the line: Name = This is what the unity engine calls it. Give it a new name.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen later: Title = This is what you see in the game. Give it a new name as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI usually just add the new size to the end of their names.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Look for the line: RescaleFactor =\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s there, then the number in it becomes the basis for your resize. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, the stock stacktricoupler is a 1.25m part. It contains the line RescaleFactor = 1. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I change that to RescaleFactor = 2 it becomes a 2.5m part and RescaleFactor = 3 makes it a 3.75m part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd of course RescaleFactor = .5 makes it a .625m part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the fun part:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the line RescaleFactor = is NOT in the part.cfg file then the game uses the stock 1.25 rescale factor. In fact if you add the line RescaleFactor = 1.25 to a part that didn\u0027t have any rescale listed it wouldn\u0027t change size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you want to double the size of a part you would add RescaleFactor = 2.5 and to triple the size of it you\u0027d use RescaleFactor = 3.75. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd of course to make it half the size you\u0027d use rescaleFactor .625\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecently I needed some landing gear and the horizontal legs in the HOME mod kit looked like they\u0027d work. They were 3.75m and I wanted 2.5m. There was no rescalefactor listed in the part config so it was using the default value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.5m is 2/3 of 3.75m so 1.25 (default value) * .66 (how much I want to resize it) = .825.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI copy and rename the directory, edit the part.cfg to give it a new name, title, and add RescaleFactor = .825 and my 3.75 meter parts have a 2.5 meter copy that works just as well as the original.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResizing parts this way keeps the connect nodes where they should be and I haven\u0027t found any connection issues that didn\u0027t exist in the orignal parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re trying to play a fair and balanced game you probably want to increase the mass of parts that you make bigger and decrease it on parts your make smaller. And this is where it becomes a bit of a guessing game. A cylinder that you double in size gets 4 times the surface area and 8 times the volume. So do Spheres and probably cones. (didn\u0027t work out cones)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor fuel tanks dry mass is surface area so you\u0027d quadruple the mass and increase the propellant capacity by 8 times. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor something that\u0027s a mix of empty space and machinery like a station module you pretty much just have to make an educated guess. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave fun with your new variety of part sizes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Tempest","CreatedById":66963,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-26T19:41:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat about the breakingForce parameter? Does that scale with it or do you have to manually adjust it as well.

You can make a fuel tank (breakingForce~200) and attach that to a command pod root (no breakingForce) then put a command pod on the bottom of the tank. Drop that at all kinds of angles and the bottom pod will always fall off while the root pod will stay. I could add a breakingForce to the pod, but there are tons of parts that don\u0027t have a breakingForce and finding them would be a huge pain.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Atanar","CreatedById":59913,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-26T23:00:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is the wrong forum section.
