FSairBrake is indeed broken in the way I found above, but also ferram hasn\u0027t implemented his own airbrake simulation yet, so for now he detects parts that are using the stock airbrake system and lets them do their thing. So the stock airbrakes will work in FAR, but not the firespitter ones unless the collision mesh thing is fixed as kcs123 mentioned. OR, as I am going to do, one could go into the firespitter airbrake part config file and replace the MODULE section with that of the stock airbrake system for now. I like the size and shape of the firespitter ones asthetically/practically, and incremental deployability isn\u0027t that huge a loss for now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T16:55:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyeah we\u0027ll need snjo to fix up the models and such as I do not have access to those\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zgrudij","CreatedById":142641,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T19:18:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehello ! is there any way to lock the gimbal of the swamp engines ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cobaltsky95","CreatedById":147154,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T21:39:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having some slight Waterlaunching problems, when i use the waterlaunching system on, well, anything, it explodes my craft into pieces upon launch\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"V8jester","CreatedById":136093,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T16:23:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI built several multi rotor and tilt rotor aircraft with mirrored helicopter rotors.

Basically you want the most recent plugin available. Usually mode with dependencies will have an older version of secondary mods. For instance B9 is a large scale mod with multiple mods put together.
