The green progress bar at the bottom of the dialogue box freezes at about 80% complete and the dialogue box then becomes unresponsive to any controller input except quit. The old ships can all be loaded on the launch pad and new ships can be created and added to the save list in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E (but not opened again once saved).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReverting to a previous save does not fix the problem.

Will give it a try, although he\u0027s got a long ship list so may take a while.
