HE did it! I thought for a moment that it would land on the ISRU stuff, but HE DID IT!\n\nYes! I really did cut one forward \u0027chute to level out, and it worked. The careful reader will note that only 3/4 chutes initially deployed; I guess I missed one in the AG settings and so I had to open it manually. Thus initially the Billmobile was descending with the tail raised, and opening all four chutes made it shift to a nose-up attitude...anyway am very glad the cut worked to avoid impacting the drill, loss of that component would have been catastrophic.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Reading it with the soundtrack playing makes all the difference!\n\nI played it while I read the pages aloud to Kuzz Jr. That made even my hairs stand up!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I hope it\u0027s as excellent as I think, because I have a hunch it\u0027s got a fair ways to drive.\n\u003E Happy landings!\n\nIt was indeed a *very* happy landing--and yeah, Bill missed by about 25km. Part of the error was due to not being able to hold course for a normal/antinormal burn; you don\u0027t realize how important SAS is until you can\u0027t use it!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Wow, loved the build up to the reveal of the contents of that container.\n\nAlways happy to surprise the readers ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) I think i did show it with the bay doors open at one point, maybe in the \u0022Bill Space Program\u0022 window back on the Duna thread...but if so, that was a lot of pages ago.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Anyways, great update! I can\u0027t wait to see Bob\u0027s reaction to first sight of the Billmobile!\n\u003E ETA: Woo! Page 100!\n\nWoo indeed!

I wasn\u0027t confident of any attached parts surviving unshielded descent, and didn\u0027t trust a simple heatshield to occlude all the parts, hence the cargo bay--and I knew I would not be able to drive a rover out of the bay, hence the deployment ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I read the comic too fast for the soundtrack to catch up.\n\nYou can save the rest of the track for when the M7 enters, coming soon..."},{"CreatedByName":"FlyingPete","CreatedById":127384,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-08T14:32:07Z","Content":"I was also a bit puzzled as to how the Billmobile is driven, but looking closely it seems there\u0027s some small ore containers fuel tanks and a couple of rocket engines hiding at the stern.
