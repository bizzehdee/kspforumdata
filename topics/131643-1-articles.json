There are so many, of so many different sizes and places, it\u0027d be impossible to give you a good list.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRather, learn to recognize them as you pass over them. Naturally, avoid the sides of mountains, though this one is tougher because you don\u0027t have a good reference to compare it to. (I generally \u00A0aim for the base of mountains when in doubt - it\u0027s a little easier to get a bead on what\u0027s \u0022level\u0022, and if I\u0027m not quite at a level spot, there will usually be a level spot nearby.) But there\u0027s one other trick here: crater walls are usually level, so you can use those as a baseline for finding level ground. For this reason I actually tend to aim for an empty spot in the middle of a group of craters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore importantly, the design of your craft is itself important. You have to be able to stand with a few degrees of slant - you\u0027ll never find a perfectly flat site (except Minmus). Landers do best if they\u0027re horizontally spread out - I like to radially attach fuel tanks to the side (via radial separators)\u00A0of the bottom of the lander and put my lander legs on that. If they pump fuel to the center, you can then stage them shortly after liftoff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sir_Robert","CreatedById":158111,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-08T22:35:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can make your own list with SCANsat.

\u00A0Just a big enough\u00A0for a small lander, or a large area for a major base? \u00A0Also, if you\u0027re just going with a small (and squatty) lander, you can land on most low-gravity places even on steep slopes, and SAS will keep you from tipping over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother factor to consider is the terrain detail level in your game settings. \u00A0The higher this is, the more complex (so less flat)\u00A0the terrain, while the lower it is, the smoother. \u00A0This makes a HUGE difference, so if somebody tells you a given place is flat but he uses low terrain detail while you use high, when you get there it won\u0027t be as flat as he said it was.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo basically, if you\u0027re just doing small landers, you can come down just about anywhere that\u0027s not an obvious mountain\u00A0and be OK. \u00A0If you need enough room for a base, then you have to go looking for suitable real estate at ground level because you can\u0027t see the small-scale details of the terrain from orbit. \u00A0This means you must first send a rover, airplane, or hopper (depending on local gravity and atmosphere), land it, then move it around scouting the terrain. \u00A0Once you find a spot you like, park your scout there so you can use it as a target when you land your main base parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, here are some general guidelines in my experience (and I use high terrain detail):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoho: \u00A0Except for the mountains, it\u0027s reasonably flat all over, although there are some very hilly regions. \u00A0The dark plains inside the larger craters are quite flat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEve: \u00A0The oceans and lakes are perfectly flat if you don\u0027t mind getting wet. \u00A0Most of the rest of the terrain (except the mountains) is smoothly rolling dune fields so you don\u0027t have to be picky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGilly: \u00A0The gravity is so weak you can land anywhere. \u00A0Also, you can flit along at low altitude and find the best spot without having to send a scout first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMun: \u00A0The Midlands are generally quite flat except near major craters. \u00A0However, small-scale craters are everywhere so just don\u0027t come down on or near their rims. \u00A0The bottoms of big craters are usually not very flat at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMinmus: \u00A0All the various flats, of course. \u00A0Also the high plateaux and the poles are pretty flat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuna: \u00A0The bottoms of the canyons and big craters are the flattest places on the planet although YMMV depending on your terrain detail setting. \u00A0About 80% of the planet is rolling dune fields which contain main base-sized\u00A0plateaux. \u00A0But you have to go looking for them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIke: \u00A0Pretty much anywhere that\u0027s not an obvious mountain. \u00A0The lighter colored areas are usually flatter than the darker areas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDres: \u00A0Other than the big N-S canyon, there\u0027s not a whole lot of terrain on Dres. \u00A0Most of the ground is quite smooth although often not quite level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaythe: \u00A0The oceans are everywhere. \u00A0What little land there is is often quite uneven except right at the water\u0027s edge, which unfortunately is usually counted as the ocean biome so has no ore. \u00A0My favorite place to land (conveniently located on the equator) is the SE coast of the big, squarish island at about 110^ East. \u00A0Otherwise, the islands are the poles are very flat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVall: \u00A0All the dark Lowland basins are reasonably flat. \u00A0Not much else is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTylo: \u00A0Pretty much flat all over except at the obvious mountains and extreme poles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBop: \u00A0Pretty much like Gilly\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPol: \u00A0Not much flat ground here at all, and there are bugs with the surface collider so you often crash while still 1500m above the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEeloo: \u00A0Pretty flat all over except at the borders between the white and brown areas, which are steep slopes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
