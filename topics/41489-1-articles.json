You have to put them on both sides of your spacecraft, to keep it balanced and efficient.

This doubles the propellant use but makes for faster turns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich method you use will depend upon your preference for fast-but-heavy or light-but-slow, and may change depending on what the craft is supposed to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(You definitely need more than one RCS block; I never use fewer than 4, using the VAB\u0027s 4x symmetry option to make sure they\u0027re balanced with each other. On designs where I go with the \u0022fast burning\u0022 school, I\u0027ll use 4 on each end.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -- Steve\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"petrichorAM","CreatedById":76235,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T21:30:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBest tip I was given is once you\u0027ve built your rocket in the VAB disconnect the orbiter/lander section and turn the CoM marker on. You then want to place the RCS thrusters in a 4x placement (symmetry button) and make sure the centre of the thruster block is aligned with the CoM marker and it should then be perfectly balanced.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dave4002000","CreatedById":41394,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T21:55:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t necessarily have to choose between the two methods. I incorporated both systems onto my kethane dropship. 4 RCS blocks placed out on each end of the tanks along with 4 blocks placed right in the middle behind the docking port. For normal maneuvering i only use the ones on the ends. Then, when i want to dock, i shut off the ones on the ends and activate the center ring for precise translation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img62/6598/w5in.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022w5in.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
