Hello everyone. I\u0027ve got a large rover in orbit around Minmus, equipped with a MechJeb 1.9 and a ISA mapsat dish, otherwise stock. I\u0027ve landed it there several times, and each time I touch down fine, everything seems normal. When I go back to the tracking station though, it lists the rover as on sub-orbital trajectory, not landed. Trying to activate the flight again causes the KSB to lock for a minute while it thinks, then declares the flight a catastrophic failure, everything has crashed. I\u0027m only using those two addons, and I\u0027ve not had any trouble landing identical rovers on Kerbal and the Mun. Any ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T20:10:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know, but maybe the mapsat has to be off?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cesium133","CreatedById":62032,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T20:14:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve noticed a bug where when I land my rover on Minmus, the game won\u0027t recognize it as landed (and as a result won\u0027t let me go back to the Space Center) while it\u0027s on rover wheels.
