For the European, it is \u003Ca href=\u0022http://style.org/unladenswallow/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eestimated to be around 11 m/s\u003C/a\u003E and it is yet unknown the air speed of the African. However, the Kerban swallow is pretty badass, with an average cruise speed of 1,691 m/s at 26 km, it has nothing to fear of the puny swallows of the Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/hNvSD\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Be aware tough that this is a very nervous plane around it\u0027s cruise speed and altitude, so pay attention!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor slowdown, I recomend about a 25% to 50% of Kerbin to go from cruise speed to a speed at which you can do some decent turns (Mach 1-2). So be aware of your speed when trying to land at KSC not to overshoot it. I have plans to add some air-brakes as soon as I find a mod other than B9 that offers them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mods used are the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - SpacePlane \u002B (1.3)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - FerramAeroSpace\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can get it \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/20khrys1xzqbo2p/Unladen%20Swallow.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-10T20:39:23Z\u0022 title=\u002208/10/2014 08:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by sam445\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-09T01:42:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E*puny\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Punny\u0022 isn\u0027t exactly a word but is used sometimes to describe something that is rich in puns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, constructive feedback: I like how it both looks fast and IS fast.
