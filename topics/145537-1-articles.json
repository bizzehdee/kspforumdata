Since I first started playing KSP some years ago, I only managed to land on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E itself less than a handful of times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried to standardise the final orbit before reentry, I tried to standardise the geocoodinates for the final burn, same for the initial periapsis after the burn. So far I have not been able to get consistent results on where I land. One problem is that from an orbit at say 71,000 m, 1 meter \u002B or - and 0.1m/s variance can mean several tens of km off target for touchdown/splashdown if not more than a hundred\u00A0km.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor those of you who do precision landings, any hints and tips on how to get more consistent results? I would think each design would require its own details on how to de-orbit but I would like to hear from you how you go about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-07T12:59:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEach design does have its own details, but the key is aerodynamics.

If I\u0027m clearly short, I go prograde early. I want to be at 1000 m/s over the mountains. Planting a set of flags along the path that indicate what your speed should be when that flag comes into the 100km radius can be helpful.

I use a 85km by 30km orbit for re-entry with a pod (and a heat shield with about 20% ablator). It seems to be better to get down through the upper atmosphere quickly, but not to set the periapsis so low that you smash into the lower atmosphere at too high a speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you get the same critical heat built-up if you get rid of one of the service bays? The heat shield occludes something akin to a cone behind it, rather than a cylinder, so if your craft is too tall you may still have hot air hitting your pod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is something a lot of people miss. \u00A0In the upper atmosphere you generate a lot of heat, but due to the thin air you cannot radiate that heat off the vehicle very well. \u00A0That\u0027s why getting to the lower atmosphere helps remove heat while also providing more air resistance to slow you down faster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222709209\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022145537\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221470648530\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022140595\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LN400\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 hours ago, LN400 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found it to be different. Shedding off a small fuel tank and a 909 (little more than 0.5 t in mass then), to go heat shield first sees the g-meter\u00A0make a jump,\u00A0not just the kick from the separator, it stays higher indicating a greater braking force indicating greater drag. Shedding that to go pod only sees an even greater jump on the g-meter. Same as before, it stays higher so it\u0027s not only the kick from the staging. I still have had chutes, solar panels, anything that wasn\u0027t shielded by the pod, or engine, or heat shield or whatever, blow up long before I reached the low atmosphere.

In the stratosphere (above, say, 53km) you get a decent amount of drag, and your craft can radiate fairly effectively. So this is a safe zone for slowing down. The players who advocate for steep reentries don\u0027t seem to recognize this. You can stay above 60km for a very long time and bleed off a couple hundred m/s with perfect safety.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the upper atmosphere (perhaps 36 to 52km) is a bad zone. Your drag has only increased a little, but your craft is storing up heat quickly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt 35km or below is the make-or-break point. You have a lot of drag, and a lot of skin heating.

I always plan so that I have enough fuel left to make it to the runway if I undershoot. Basically what I do is achieve a low orbit (71-75km) sometimes including aerobreaking and set a maneuver node over the desert continent (ca. 130-140\u00B0 W) and aim for my trajectory to end on a level between the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and the Island Airfield.

Might seem like cheating for some but since fuel harvesting is in the game I take full advantage of it for maximum efficiency. Hey, being German must be good for something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
