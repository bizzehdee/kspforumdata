Jonbald had sent him and Gene into orbit to protect them from the usual cycle-based turmoil, and had hoped they would be able to work remotely until all operations had transferred to Copper Station. Unfortunately he needed their attention here, on the surface, their hands guiding the workers as they assembled their rockets and spacecraft. He had overestimated the ability of a mostly untrained populace in building and operating complex machinery. Jonbald himself was proof enough they could safely return and be protected from disappearing into whatever void it is that claims kerbals when the cycles hit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course he didn\u0027t really need to bring them back to have Wernher and Gene on-planet. He could always imprint another pair of kerbals at the crashed UFO, using the skills and memories of the long-disappeared versions of the Wernher and Gene who first discovered it. Do that and he\u0027d have another Gene and another Wernher. Except that doing so would cross a line even Jonbald was wary of. It was one thing to give these new Wernhers their old memories, to give a fresh Gene his old leadership skills, but another thing entirely to destroy the mind of an otherwise innocent kerbal. He was already suspicious of the machine itself, an alien device of unknown origin which he himself barely understood after nearly a decade of use and research. Using it to imprint other kerbals was wrong, perhaps a crime, and was not something Jonbald cared to do.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnless another Wernher or another Gene showed up, that is. Jonbald had never fully understood the disappearances and other peculiarities, but throughout all of it there had only been one set of these two familiar kerbals at one time. He was aware of multiple Jebediahs and Bills and Bobs sometimes meeting their copies, but those three were so clueless that nothing much could bother them. How would an intelligent kerbal adapt to meeting its double? (He had wondered once what became of the army of Jebs Albro had at his command, but concluded they must have met a fate similar to the many kerbals Albro had stranded. Albro\u0027s many shadow projects, from OTS to OSD to Continuum itself, had always used kerbals as disposable. It was something Jonbald worked to change when he took over, but there was little to no accounting of what had gone before.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo here they were. At present there was only the one Gene and the one Wernher, and they were in the wrong place. Additionally, there were fresh kerbals on Kerbin who needed experience and flight time. Crews Jonbald had started training as soon as the space program restarted. These crews needed to go up, and the crews up there needed to come down. They could either keep throwing away capsules, or they could return to an older, proven design. A design which had produced three flight-proven craft: Titanium.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf the three previous Titanium craft, two were stuck in orbit at the Transfer One, while the third had somehow survived down on the surface. (It wasn\u0027t unheard of for such aircraft to survive the cycles. Jonbald\u0027s own personal jet a prime example.) They suspected the two Titaniums in orbit had been there too long, and didn\u0027t trust them to land safely. (Their chosen landing gear were no longer considered in-spec for a craft as heavy as the Titanium orbiter.) And the third one on Kerbin was little more than an airframe test unit. Still, he felt it could prove useful, and asked the ground crews to move it into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E and keep it protected and under cover.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe overall design was good, but needed some tweaks. Obviously the landing gear had to be improved to the point that it could withstand touchdown of such a heavy vehicle. Older variants had limited flight capability, the two Juno jet engines were only capable of extending the glide post-reentry. Four Junos would be enough to make the Titanium an actual aircraft, capable of a runway takeoff and free flight when not full of rocket fuel. And finally the hack-job of a probe core was replaced with a larger, inline core, capable of flying the craft to and from orbit on its own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce the initial changes were complete, Jonbald had ordered construction and integration of a new orbiter. They didn\u0027t have much in the way of production capacity - all of their tooling was designed for the more traditional rockets - but producing a one-off should be easy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe process resulted in the Titanium Y-series orbiter.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first (and so far only) vehicle in the series, Ti-Y-1, was being prepared for flight when Gene and Wernher started out for Copper Station. Both of them had spent all of their time in orbit at Manganese Station; Wernher running orbital science operations while Gene managed the day to day tasks of the agency (and occasionally remote launch and flight director duties). They both hopped into an Iron shuttle and used it to transfer to Copper Station, awaiting the arrival of the first of the new Titaniums.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180324_ksp0496_fe-xfer.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022604\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180324_ksp0496_fe-xfer.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180324_ksp0507_fe-xfer.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022602\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180324_ksp0507_fe-xfer.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey needn\u0027t wait long, as the Titanium Y-5 was rolled out to the launch pad shortly after they arrived at Copper. As is usual for the design, the Ti-Y-1 orbiter was mated to a disposable nose tank. Only the tank would be discarded, the remainder of the vehicle (the entire Ti-Y-1) would return to the space center. Simple, reusable, effective.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crew was transferred to the obiter once it was safely on the launch pad. This first flight would feature a full crew of one pilot and five new scientists. The new pilot, Kadun, had been hand-selected by Jonbald from a large pool of candidates. She had completed a small amount of qualification flying to prove she could handle an aircraft, then thrown to the wolves aboard this flight. The scientists meanwhile were recruited from the top universities across Kerbin. They included Julwise, Lemming, Neloly, Wildan, and Haycas; all five of them respected researchers in various technologies that would prove useful to the continued development of Project Copper.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180324_ksp0511_ti-y5.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022602\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180324_ksp0511_ti-y5.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe launch itself was a bit shaky at first. The orbiter ever so slightly bumped the launch clamps while jumping up from the pad, but Kadun and the flight computer were both able to keep it on course. They were well beyond hypersonic when the nose tank was emptied, the main engines cut, and the tank was discarded. Once clear of the tank, Kadun maneuvered the craft for its orbital insertion burn, and set up a rendezvous with Copper Station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180324_ksp0520_ti-y5.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022600\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180324_ksp0520_ti-y5.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180324_ksp0523_ti-y5.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022602\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180324_ksp0523_ti-y5.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat rendezvous took place a short time later, after less than a whole orbit. The other Iron shuttle had been moved to one of the radial docking ports, allowing the Titanium to dock at the docking port along the main spine of the station. (It would not have easily fit anywhere else, as either the wings, the nose, or the vertical stabilizers would collide with something.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180324_ksp0530_ti-y5.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022604\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180324_ksp0530_ti-y5.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180324_ksp0534_ti-y5.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022601\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180324_ksp0534_ti-y5.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe five scientists moved into the new long-term home while Gene and Wernher gathered their things and made their way into the Titanium. Elkin was happy to welcome the new blood into the ranks of the science corps, though the five new kerbals were a bit confused as to whey there were already other kerbals in orbit. This was all very new to them, and as far as they had known a couple munths ago kerbals had not ventured into space. Now here they were, witnessing first-hand that kerbals had not only been to space, but were living there quite successfully.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the crew swap complete, Kadun undocked the Ti-Y-1 from Copper Station, pushed away until they were at a safe distance, then brought them down to a reentry orbit. Once they were at a safe periapsis and aligned such that their reentry would bring them down near the space center, she completed their deorbit burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180324_ksp0535_ti-y5.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022600\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180324_ksp0535_ti-y5.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180324_ksp0540_ti-y5.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022600\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180324_ksp0540_ti-y5.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately someone had slipped up on the reentry math. They were still very much hypersonic and well over 30km when they passed overhead of the space center.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Don\u0027t worry,\u0022 Kadun called out to her two passengers in the crew compartment, \u0022this new shuttle is equipped with enough jet power to fly us to dry land somewhere. Just stay strapped in and we\u0027ll see what we get.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180324_ksp0546_ti-y5.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022603\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180324_ksp0546_ti-y5.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat they got wasn\u0027t very good. If she allowed the glide path to continue, they would come down in the ocean halfway between the space center and the next continent. As soon as the craft was able, she banked hard north, biting into the thicker air. There was an island, roughly two thirds of the way back to the space center. From the charts it appeared she could land there, perhaps roughly so as it lacked any signs of civilization, and they might have to if the fuel didn\u0027t hold out. It was a bit North of a flight path that would take them back to the runway, but if their fuel ran out too soon they\u0027d have to ditch into the ocean.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKadun opted for the rough island landing over the salt life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180324_ksp0550_ti-y5.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022600\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180324_ksp0550_ti-y5.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180324_ksp0561_ti-y5.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022600\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180324_ksp0561_ti-y5.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTurns out they had more than enough fuel to spare.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKadun opened up the intercom again, more to make a mental note than to share her thoughts with Gene. \u0022If you\u0027ll look off to our starboard side, you\u0027ll see an interesting island featuring a large flat area to the north side of it. Based on our distance downrange from the space center, this island would make a good landing site in the event of a failed launch.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few moments later Gene was in the cockpit with her. \u0022Wouldn\u0027t a return to launch site be safer?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sure, if you can make it back. If we fail on ascent the odds are good the main engine just cut out or died a painful death. At that point the shuttle itself will be completely full of rocket fuel and oxidizer, making it too heavy to carry with just these four jet engines. We could try to dump the ox, but to tooling for that all goes through the main engine. If the fuel lines are the reason the engine cut out, we\u0027d have to take the nearest target we can glide to. RTLS might not be possible, and this is the only rock between us and infinity.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Do you think you could land a craft this large on that island?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Absolutely, sir.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene hmmmed. \u0022Ok, I\u0027ll think about it. And I\u0027ll have a team look into preparing an abort to island scenario, work it into the training regimen. Maybe send a couple lumberjacks and ground crews out to clear a landing strip on the island itself.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thank you, sir.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180324_ksp0577_ti-y5.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022602\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180324_ksp0577_ti-y5.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe remainder of the flight back was uneventful. The orbiter ran out of fuel just short of the space center, but well within their glide path.

This impulse has suppressed his traditional sense of morality, and he has fallen so far as to conscript the local populace into the factories and forges needed to fuel the program. With the aide of Gene and Wernher, their own memories and experiences restored by an alien device, the space program is building the key to Jonbald\u0027s exodus.

In no time at all Gene had found and corrected several issues with the way things were being run at the space center, and had ironed out most of the problems that were causing grief with their industrial support structure. Meanwhile Wernher had pointed out several failures of process in the integration and operation of the rockets themselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the end most of the problems were minor - a missed wrenching here, an un-hammered nail there. Gene could find no deliberate instances of sabotage, though he agreed with Jonbald there could always be the potential for such. And there was a lack of through training for the kerbals at the factories and the space center which led to confusion. So many of these minor problems and confused kerbals that it all added up, resulting in the death of several rockets by a million paper cuts.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe pause they took to train the kerbals at their command took more time than fixing most of the issues, but in the end they had their production queue running at full speed.

There was initial apprehension at launching in the middle of an eclipse, but Gene and Jonbald both refused to be bound by superstition and order it to go.

We both know kerbals can not stay here forever. Albro realized it when he started Continuum. Half the work of Continuum and its Orbital Sciences Division was to find gaps in physics. Holes. Cheats. Ways out. A means for us to leave, to run from this cyclical unavoidable destruction. We may not have seen eye to eye on the methods, Albro and myself, but we did agree our place is out there amongst the stars. If we stay here we die.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And if you leave we all die.\u0022 Archibald responded with a sad smile. \u0022The warnings of The Elders were not idly given.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That superstitious nonsense again.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How could you of all kerbals not believe? The Elders have been absolutely correct about everything. They witnessed the same cycles we do, they struggled as we must. Leave Kerbol, they said, and our Universe will collapse in upon itself. What is here must always be here.\u0022 He paused, Jonbald could feel the weight of Archibald\u0027s gaze. \u0022Understand, brother, that what we do, we do in the best interests of Kerbin. All of Kerbin, even those who are trapped here by fate.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And I the same.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nArchibald walked backwards toward the office door. \u0022Then I wish you luck old friend. Please heed our warnings. Please stop this project, or redirect its efforts elsewhere. Do not pry at wrecks that are best left sealed. Do not disturb the dead. You are welcome to join us again at North Mountain any time, the invitation always stands and our doors are always open. Farewell.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd with that he was gone. Slipped out of the door unnoticed, all while Jonbald was watching. What strange creatures these kerbals were.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo The Wreck was still there. And if the order was so concerned about Jonbald finding it, then it must be fully intact. Which would mean they had a second egg at their disposal. The contents of the one here on Kerbin were corrupted, mostly lost to time. Perhaps they could learn more from the one on The M\u00FCn.

It would need every Newton its LV-50 Orchestra launch vehicle had available to loft itself into orbit and to the rest of Copper Station.

There was still an experimental cryogenic section they planned to launch, but work on the experimental nuclear reactor had stalled completely.

The most difficult part of adapting to the \u0022down\u0022 turned out to be forgetting it was occurring.
