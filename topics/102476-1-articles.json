If you don\u0027t have that installed, go ahead and get that. Add the following to a .cfg file in your GameData/ folder:\n\n    @PART[*]:HAS[@MODULE[ModuleReactionWheel]]{  @MODULE[ModuleReactionWheel]  {    @PitchTorque *= 0.1    @YawTorque *= 0.1    @RollTorque *= 0.1  }}\n\nJust change the numbers to whatever scale you want. I don\u0027t know how much less powerful the reaction wheels are in RO, so the above is simply a guess."},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T07:54:37Z","Content":"[(Semi-)Saturatable Reaction Wheels](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111049)"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaugeforever","CreatedById":110684,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T16:00:54Z","Content":"Thanks guys!"}]}
