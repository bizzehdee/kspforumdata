Once their mission is complete, the satellite (or probe in the case of voyager) is then left sitting up there in space, and the scientists back here on earth come up with new ways to use them and they go get more funding to pay for their research and equipment/personel to use the abandoned satellite/probe. So the repeatable contracts for science are valid, have the first one pay a lot, just make the following ones pay less to represent the fact that you don\u0027t need to send another ship there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow as far as the flag missions go, I think that it should be that each kerbal on the mission can only set 1 unique flag per orbital body, per mission (for the contract purpose only, just general purpose flags they can set as many times as possible provided they go back to the ship/pod for more flags) So, if you send up a 3 man lander, that means you should be able to do the flag mission 3 times, before you have to send new kerbals (each kerbal would represent a different company/nation figuratively) I\u0027m actually thinking that when I complete most of the unique contracts that I can do without having to spam repeatables to install the life support/better than manned mods, start over and then set up permanent bases as that I see as being a more realistic way to do the repeatables.

It\u0027s not the most efficient, but it gets me a close encounter in under two orbits. Came across an odd thing: the RCS and SAS sometimes turn off automatically as you come close to a Rescue Mission target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/QW7irj.png\u0022 alt=\u0022QW7irj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut up a pair of satellite probes with 80 monopropellant and some RCS thrusters when testing the Hydraulic Detachment Manifold for a contract - they have a thermometer, battery, antenna and some solar panels, so \u0022Science from orbit around Kerbin\u0022 is trivial. A good source of cash, too, so I\u0027m not being too careful with money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/vErUHL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vErUHL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/37owcr.png\u0022 alt=\u002237owcr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, a Mun landing that I screwed up. Didn\u0027t really have enough fuel to get off, as I hadn\u0027t put much in, and I had taken up the probes at the same time. They served as drop-tanks to try and offset their mass, but it clearly wasn\u0027t enough. There was fuel left, until I destroyed the tank trying to stop my slide down the mountain on which Jeb had landed. He has the science for two different contracts on him, and was also going to test the LV-1 on a Mun escape trajectory... so that\u0027s a more conventional \u0022rescue mission\u0022 (the sort set up by accident and bad flying). In the mean time, he\u0027s providing lots of cash planting flags and picking them back up whenever a \u0022Plant a flag on Mun\u0022 contract comes around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/JoO8V2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022JoO8V2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/p8iblU.png\u0022 alt=\u0022p8iblU.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-19T19:29:51Z\u0022 title=\u002207/19/2014 07:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Concentric\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Razor235","CreatedById":16436,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-19T20:02:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECame across an odd thing: the RCS and SAS sometimes turn off automatically as you come close to a Rescue Mission target.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems to happen everywhere when getting in within 50-100 meters of an object.
