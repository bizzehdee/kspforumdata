I wonder if over the long term that Oort cloud comets could be more favorable for delivering water to Mars even though there would be a much longer delivery period for each comet then asteroids from the main belt. Of course getting out there would be difficult for our current space faring technologies, but one would assume that the delta-v requirements for changing a comet\u0027s orbit to impact Mars would be less dramatic then moving a asteroid from the main belt.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theend3r","CreatedById":97560,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-12T10:07:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Horn Brain\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Horn Brain\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWho knows what would happen? Anyone with about two seconds to spare thinking about this problem. Mars would explode from centrifugal force looooooooong before you ever even noticed the added gravitational effect of the extra energy. Mars doesn\u0027t need more gravity, just a magnetic field. And that\u0027s only for the long-term (hundreds of thousand or millions of years). If we warmed up Mars right now and added some extra atmosphere to get it up to safe levels, you could have oceans and atmosphere for longer than our civilization has existed so far.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was just explaining a previous post plus I wrote it was impossible...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
