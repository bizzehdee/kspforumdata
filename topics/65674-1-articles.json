In real-life getting enough power to do everything you want, is quite a challenge. None of this challenge can be found in KSP however. You can keep a massive space station powered throughout its entire orbit with nothing but a small battery and a small solar panel. You don\u0027t have to launch a large truss with massive solar panels like they did with ISS. There are barely any parts that require power to run and even fewer that require a constant power source.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d love it if this game would have us think about how many solar panels or batteries we\u0027d have to take with us on our spacecraft, probes and space stations. But what how could this be accomplished? I\u0027d like to discuss this here. Maybe it can inspire Squad or modmakers. So if you have any ideas, feel free to reply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a few ideas of my own. If they\u0027re good or not, is open for discussion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELimiting Solar Power\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn real-life, available solar power rapidly diminishes as we get farther from the Sun. Past Mars, solar panels become less cost-effective than RTGs. In KSP, solar panels always produce almost produce about the power they do in Kerbin orbit, wherever they are in the Kerbol system. They only become useless far beyond the orbit of Eeloo. In a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/67090-Solar-panels-are-usable-too-far-out-and-RTGs-never-become-economical\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eprevious suggestion thread\u003C/a\u003E I went into further detail on this. If KSP followed a more realistic power progression, then different destinations would require different power strategies. A space station in Kerbin orbit would require less (or smaller) solar panels than one in Duna or Dres orbit. A probe to Duna could run on two solar panels, but one to Jool or Eeloo might be better served with an RTG. This change is useless without an economy (so things can become cost-effective or not) or more things the consume electrical power, but with those things introduced this would be a thing to keep in mind as it would introduce more choices to the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScience Costs Electricity\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment there are very few energy consuming parts. There\u0027s the Science Lab and the antenna parts that gulp up ElectricalCharge, but the other science parts are noticeably lacking. It doesn\u0027t require any power to collect science from a Mystery Goo container or a Thermometer, even though these parts are recording data. Introducing power consumption to these parts might add some interesting choices in the early career mode, when battery power is limited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EConstant Power Consumption\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe holy grail in making electrical management more interesting is parts that require a constant power consumption. At the moment this is only Probes and Sensors/Lights when they\u0027re turned on. This is such a small number of parts and they have such a low amount of power consumption, that it makes almost no difference. What parts could we introduce or change so that they meaningfully use electrical power and stop functioning when there isn\u0027t enough power? I have some ideas:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EManned Pods\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the lights, equipment, etc. in a command pod require electricity to function. Yet they don\u0027t. A command pod that doesn\u0027t receive power wouldn\u0027t be able to control the craft it is part of, similar to a probe body. This is probably the simplest change to implement, as it would work the same way as with probes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ELife Support\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA simple life support system I think is still in the vein of KSP. To produce \u0027life support\u0027 you need electricity. If you run out, the amount of life support starts to decrease. If you don\u0027t start producing extra power or shut some things down, your Kerbals will die once the life support runs out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAntennas\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn real-life spacecraft are almost always relaying some kind of information back to Earth (except hibernating deep space probes). Want to be able to send back science data to Kerbin? Add an antenna, and thus a power drain to your spacecraft or station. Probes could perhaps be made so that they require an antenna to be controllable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, these were my ideas.

It\u0027s possible that KSP solar panels generate colossally more power than any comparable human technology. The PB-ion info notes that it is \u003Cstrong\u003Enot powered by witchcraft\u003C/strong\u003E, however assuming it is %100 percent efficient it produces 20.6 MW of thrust power (P=T*Ve)! It draws 14.6 E/s which means the conversion factor is 1.4 [MW] per [E/s]. This means that a single humble OX-Stat panel produces 1.1 MW of power at Kerbin\u0027s orbital distance. This is over one hundred time the combined power of the ISS solar arrays! Any tiny power draws are a drop in the bucket compared to this.
