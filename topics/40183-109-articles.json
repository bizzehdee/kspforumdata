Fixed a possible issue with civilian contract orbital. The issue was if you switched vessels while in landing stage your green check marks for all the orbital Objectives would be unchecked (this is normal in most contracts). The problem was that once you went back to your vessel the orbital checks would not go back! I fixed this issue by adding some checks to what I did and did not want to work for changing vessels in contracts. Now this contract is pretty safe for most part and you should be able to change vessels at any time again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Fixed issue with landing goal still being applied while in PreLaunch. I fixed this issue by only allowing the landing goal to become active after it detects the vessel launch.

You know how normally the camera swings 90 degrees to a new position when you achieve enough velocity to go from a suborbital path to an orbital path, or visa versa? Well now whenever that happens, in addition to the camera rotating it also zooms WAAAAAAAY out, until the ship is but a tiny pixel in the distance and I have to spin the mouse wheel a lot to zoom it back into view.
