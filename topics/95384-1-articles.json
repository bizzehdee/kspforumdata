Merging Interstellar and Near Future is a seemingly impossible tasks because they operate on vastly different power scales. Interstellar functions on the Gigawatt range while Near Future doesn\u0027t get much higher than a few Megawatt. Also the scaling is vastly different where Near Future is stable, Interstellar power scaling over time varies between hardly useful to incredible powerful. Another problem is that they use resources that seem similar but are incompatible and mixing cooling technology doesn\u0027t work either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFeatures\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lot has changed to make them work together and in the process I added additional features. But in short here are the main features:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Reactor power has been reduced drastically and the power difference between the weakest and strongest is much smaller. For example the end game anti matter reactor (\u002B generator) is only 40 times as powerful as the initial nuclear reactor. Compare that with Interstellar 1000 times and you get the idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Merged Interstellar and Near Future Technology tree into a separate Tech Manager tree. I made early (Near Future) nuclear technologies accessible earlier and lowered the science requirement of near future electrical engines to make them a good intermediate technology between the nuclear engines and fusion engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Near Future reactors now represent the first generation of nuclear reactor with slightly more power output than their Near Future reactor equivalent. They use a modified version of Interstellar reactor modules, yet do not require any external power generator to produce electricity, therefore similar to the original self contained reliable near future reactors. These reactor will be ideal for powering space ship over a long periods or remain at standby to start and maintain fusion reactors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Thermal engines (thermal rocket nozzle), which come available after nuclear propulsion tech, are now useful from the start including the smaller versions. A first generation nuclear reactor connected to a thermal nozzle provide equivalent trust to a stock nuclear engine (which is 60 kN). The added advantage of a separate nuclear reactor is that beside propulsion, the same reactor can also be used for long lasting power\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Interstellar nuclear reactor become available later (as NF Reactors) and function as high performance, high maintenance reactor which become powerful enough for upper stages of rocket or SSTO with added benefit of much higher specific impulse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Resource integration; For example, Interstellar engines now uses Near Future Liquid Hydrogen resource (instead of Liquid Fuel) and Near Future hydrogen tanks (which have less density than Liquid Fuel) now require some electrical power (like Interstellar Liquid Deuterium tanks) to keep the Liquid Hydrogen from boiling off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Interstellar Electric Engines are now integrated with Near Future Tech nodes. Interstellar Electrical engines, although still very power hungry, now require much less power, able to compete with Near Future electrical engines. Further, their power usage is now limited by your generated power and ISP and the thrust is effected by atmosphere density.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Improved Science Lab research gatherering. The amount of research now also depends on the Kerbals Profession (Scientist, Engeneer) and skill level. This means leveling up your scientist in the field before they enter the lab will be rewarding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Added ability of Atmospheric Scoop to function as Propulsive fluid accumulator which can be achieved by placing a vessel in a circular orbit at the edge of space with access to (KSPI) plasma engines and enough power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Added Nitrogen as a resource which can be used as a propellant in Thermal/Magnetic Noozles and Electric Engines. Nitrogen is stored as a pressurized gas, which can be converted to Liquid Nitrogen. Liquid Nitrogen allows for more compact storage and can be used for Cooling Wasteheat, allow electric generators to temporary to perform more efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Balanced the Alcubierre warpdrive; In order to balance the warpdrive with modified reactors, I had to significantly changed it performance and behavior. Instead of a low requirements infinite travel wormhole generator, it now becomes high requirements limited distance warp field engine. By infinite travel wormhole generator, I mean that the original warp-engine could be charged with any reactor and travel for any distance and even allow charging for the next warp jump during warp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWarpdrive\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new Alcubierre warpdrive requires your reactors to overcome a power threshold and the distance you can travel is determined by the initial strength of the warpfield (determined by warp speed) and your ability to maintain it (with electric power). This effectively makes it impossible to power the warpengine using only nuclear power, you going to need at least a fusion power to get into warp. Charging the warpengine works as it previously did but instead of losing all warp power at launch, you lose half (and any overcharge). The first half is used start warp travel, the second half represent the warp field which you need to maintain to remain at warp speed. The more power you can use to maintain the warp field, the longer distance you can travel. Once you warp field (represented by Exotic matter) runs out, it collapses and you return to normal space. If you stop you electrical generators or stop feeding the warp engines, the warp field will start to collapse on it\u0027s own, but it can take considerable time depending on the warp field strength (which depend on the warp speed). If you you wish to drop out of warp sooner, you can press the \u0022Deactivate Warp Drive\u0022 to reverse to polity of your warpfield generator and help the warp field to collapse much fast. This means you can no longer instantly drop out of warp at will (as you did in Interstellar) and that your warp engines start uncharged after dropping out of warp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mod, which was created out of my own frustration with the lack of incompatibility between Interstellar and Near future, is my first (public) Mod for KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy currently version already includes all above mentioned features, but not everything is balanced and tested yet.
