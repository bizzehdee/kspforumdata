Yes, people who are contacted for those polls still have the option of declining to answer, but most people, if directly asked, will respond to a polling question. Political polling works because the sample is determined (mostly) randomly from a very large sample population, and can therefore be effectively extrapolated to the general population with a small margin of error.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, responding to \u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E poll requires that a KSP player (1) Have a forum account, (2) Actually be active with that account, (3) Be interested enough in the thread\u0027s content to read it, and (4) Care enough about the poll question to respond to it. Consequently, the sample population is very much \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E randomly selected, and thus can\u0027t be effectively applied to the entire playerbase.
