Even in that situation I would argue that the user, while not causing the hope and subsequent disappointment directly, would be learning\u00A0valuable life lessons: things don\u0027t always go as planned and life isn\u0027t always fair.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, my argument with the swing set analogy is that Squad is reacting to the potential behavior of some community members\u00A0regarding the reason for lack of public roadmap. Your argument seems to be that Squad is to blame for inciting negative behaviors. They are related, to be sure, but are not the same arguement. However I think we can both agree that Squad\u0027s prevention of negative behaviors from some members of the community by keeping any hint of a direction or fragment of public roadmap comes at the cost of some of the community\u0027s understanding, interest, and goodwill.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-21T17:58:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2017 05:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Mako\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mako","CreatedById":69375,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-21T17:56:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223063365\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022160846\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221495385835\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022103157\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022passinglurker\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, passinglurker said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nPeople taking a line out of a recent weekly address to mean making history will have planet scaling is a prime example of the reading between the lines that happens when squad doesn\u0027t use a roadmap that people can refer to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do agree that without a roadmap for context these types of reveals with little to no details are unhelpful to just about everyone until clarified. Until clarified these types of unexpected reveals without context make it feel\u00A0like Squad is lacking direction and vision for KSP. I know that it has been said by Squad staff that there is an internal roadmap, but I don\u0027t believe that is the best way to to work on an community-involved, open-development model game. If Squad wants to\u00A0produce KSP in a closed-development style that\u0027s their choice, but everything they do says that\u0027s not the case...\u00A0except for the lack of public roadmap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve always wanted to see Squad commit\u00A0fully to an open-development style, or at the very least talk about the intent for KSP.

The game needs to run well enough to be enjoyable in every version available to the public.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Inform your customers of development. Periodic, content-rich updates are important to the customers, so they will not be surprised by a delay. A vague roadmap (gasp) is also somewhat useful. Wube has one of these, and I have not noticed any problems arising from misinterpretation thereof.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Explain yourselves when there are delays. The delay will cause angst, but the explanation makes people much more inclined to understand. Explanations should be concurrent with the announcement of the delay.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Have a strong developer presence in your community. Customers tend to like it better when they can talk to the ones who supplied the software.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Run development in such a way that you can make estimates as to release dates.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-If you aren\u0027t going to meet a date, know this and plan accordingly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTogether, these policies serve Wube well. In the old days (before 0.25), SQUAD operated similarly, but they\u0027ve gotten more quiet as time has gone on. Communication slipped, hard deadlines appeared, and the general quality of Forum interaction appears to have diminished. The sudden jump from alpha to beta to released was jarring to me (and presumably others). The decision to port to consoles was met with much concern, and most (if not all) would agree that this concern was warranted. The extraordinary dearth of information with regards to said ports might be legal-related, but it is still bad for customer satisfaction and should be addressed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"genbrien","CreatedById":131978,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-22T15:41:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223063254\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022160846\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221495378690\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002272277\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tidus Klein\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 21/05/2017 at 10:58 AM, Tidus Klein said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think KSP will ever get a sequel, it\u0027s not that type of game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost games that get sequels get them to tie together lore or expand upon the universe of the game and its story.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf they do a sequel it\u0027ll be most likely I think to start on fresh base of code and/or new engine\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKinda easier to start anew than to fix broken code from 5 years ago\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mako","CreatedById":69375,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-22T16:24:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223063876\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022160846\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221495429497\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002227914\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 hours ago, Vanamonde said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are not reading the same internet I\u0027m reading.
