The problem is in how I set up the rigging for the solar cells. There are 44 individual panels for each row of cells. 88 total. I rigged both rows of cells at the same time, by hand. That\u0027s too much work to get done before 1.05, not even sure I can squeeze it in to 1.1, however I was able to get the model with the new truss working properly before bed last night and this version is definitely as good as the last if not better.\n\nAnother issue is determining the amount of ec per second. If we say that 1ec per second = 1kw ( [@NathanKell](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/75006-nathankell/) ), then 100 ec per second is 10kw more than all of the iss solar panels output combined. It should be more like 22.5kw or 22.5 ec, and that\u0027s without dinging it for being 60 percent of the size. Which is counter intuitive, seeing as I\u0027d be doubling the size and cutting the output down by more than 1/4. The Gigantor XL panels have a rate of 24 ec per second, and that\u0027s not changing any time soon. So if we ignore 1ec per second = 1kw and instead base if off of the surface area as a multiplier on ec (my math sucks) I\u0027d guess it would be over 200 ec per second easily.
