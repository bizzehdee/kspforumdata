Also, no sneaky switching to the other player\u0027s ships to check out their makeup, fuel load etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to check out the opposition you do it the old fashioned way, close rendezvous and Mark 1 Eyeball. I\u0027d say moving in to rendezvous should constitute the end of a unit\u0027s move, giving the other player a chance to respond to the visit/provocation in some way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to get more hardcore about it, someone could gin up a game management server with check in/check out of the quicksave files with player settable time limits and a history of all the save files for game replays. Miss your check in time and you lose your turn, reverting back to the previous save file. All your stuff is on its own while the other player gets another go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would still rely on the honor system to not peek at or fiddle with the other player\u0027s ships since everyone would have to share the same game space and (without a multi launch pad mod) the same launch site at KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny system of play should have a way for players to agree on breaks during which nobody opens the shared game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dortmunder","CreatedById":66018,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T06:51:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tried asking for this a couple times, and no one was interested.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d be interested for sure if there\u0027s some sort of competition involved.

Winner is the first to safely land all six. Kill a Kerbal, run out of fuel, anything else that causes the mission to fail is a loss.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggested turns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPregame is building your ships. Once they\u0027re built, players contact each other to confirm they\u0027re ready to begin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst turn is launching first ship to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond turn is launching the second ship OR initiating a maneuver of the first ship to start transit to the planet, player\u0027s choice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird turn is launching the second ship - if not launched in the second turn OR initiating a maneuver of the second ship (launched in the second turn) to start transit to the planet OR do something else with the first ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf both ships were launched in the first two turns, then in turn three a player may make one move with each ship OR if a support ship is required by your mission plan, take a full turn for the launch. Any launch from Kerbin = a full turn since you can\u0027t do anything else anyway until the ship reaches orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd go on from there. Not hard and fast rules but in general any major action with a relatively quickly achieved beginning and end like launching a ship to orbit = one turn or move. Beginning an action with a somewhat indefinite end or that will take a long time to end, like a Hohmann transfer to a distant planet = one turn or move. A move or turn can also include finishing any actions that are required to leave your ships in a state where they will be safe when left unattended while the other player is running the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s similar to a turn based strategy game. In those the typical setup is units may either move OR do some action with some units having the ability to move AND immediately do an action if the player chooses. With \u0027fog of war\u0027 a unit that moves and discovers an enemy unit may be automatically attacked or may be allowed to attack in that move if not normally allowed to (element of surprise).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP doesn\u0027t have \u0027fog of war\u0027 and sharing the quicksave file back and forth won\u0027t allow players to immediately respond to challenges or attacks so to start with I figure it\u0027s best to keep it a friendly match and not try to sabotage or otherwise interfere with the other player. Save that for when mods and improvised weaponry are added to the mix. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve always preferred real time strategy games over turn based because I can immediately respond to things as they happen. With turn based it\u0027s moving units one at a time or initiating actions then ending the turn and sitting there helplessly as the other player or computer pounds my forces, or watching with glee if my actions turn out better for me - yet still being unable to pull back if my units are getting stomped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut since KSP has no built in multiplayer, the only way to compete or cooperate is by sharing the quicksave and/or persistence files.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
