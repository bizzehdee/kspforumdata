Could you make it to where the kerbal is stranded on the mun inside of a lander ship with very little electricity on only one small solar panel or a kerbal is trapped on Duna inside a science lab and you have to rescue him after he takes a surface sample? Really my question is, Can you make a pre-made craft be part of a contract?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
