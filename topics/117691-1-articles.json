It just can\u0027t go straight over the runway, turning sharply the moment it crosses 50m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThankfully, if I spin up the VTOL engines early enough, it needs some 60-70m/s for take-off, which means some desperate maneuvering, struggling not to tear wings off, driving off the runway etc. Actually, the last one is the rescue: once the wheels are off the ground it stops misbehaving immediately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt climbs to cruise altitude somewhat sluggishly - it got quite a bit of extra weight after all. Three rapiers, four LV-Ns, all fuel tanks full (both LF and OX), six shock cones (heavier but less draggy; need all six for the rapiers), and a big battery and a reaction wheel in the cargo bay. Add a full set of RCS, shielded port instead of the nose cone, and two solar panels from Asteroid Day mod, the only non-stock parts. Can be replaced with standard panels freely. Plus some fuel lines, some struts, heavier wheels... that all adds up. Anyway, 50m/s of vertical speed isn\u0027t too bad. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt cruising altitude it gains the 1000m/s in quite reasonable time, then it needs to be \u003Cem\u003Ecarefully\u003C/em\u003E pitched up, to 300m/s of climb. If you do this too fast, it will lose wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce air starts running out I switch Rapiers to closed cycle (giving Whips a couple seconds more before they sputter out). That\u0027s when I fire the nukes too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe oxidizer for Rapiers last until some 35km, with apoapsis of about 55km. The rest of the climb is done on Nukes, but by then, with 1800m/s and a long time until apoapsis circularizing is just a formality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately in the orbit it had some 150m/s of dV left. Barely enough to reach an LKO fuel station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso: as I burned for the selfies, I brought apoapsis low enough for reentry. I put phys-warp at 4x and one of the cubic octagonal struts by which Nukes are attached exploded to overheating (bug). The crippled plane with some pieces of wing missing failed to perform the reentry, lost all wings on some 32km, and the hull plummeted to death.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So, it\u0027s just a proof-of-concept, a prototype, not a functional STOVLSSTO plane. Also, the cargo bay was mostly empty. If there was any cargo, it would need to include extra fuel. (although, due to Pilot Assistant glitching somewhere around 33km up, sending me spinning and wasting some dV, I guess I\u0027d reach the orbit with a bit more fuel.)
