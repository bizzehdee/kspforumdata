The new wheels are a result of Unity 5\u0027s new wheel system AFAIK, and SQAUD has to work within the boundries of the engine they originally chose. As far as maneuver nodes go, you are experiencing either a unique bug or you are in career and haven\u0027t upgraded the Tracking Station. 1.1.0 was shipped early, and that \u00A0was extremely frustrating for a release. in 1.1.2, the game is more profoundly fixed, and has stabalized quite a bit more than previous releases.
