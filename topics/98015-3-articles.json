HoundDog Ib for example gives me 3 tonnes in LKO... so I try to see what I can achieve with only 3 tonnes.

The Verity VI-Mi probe was built specifically to order for a contract, someone with entirely too much time on their hands wanted a record of RPWS and magnetometer readings around Minmus .... for 340days, but they were willing to pay handsomely for it and that was all that mattered really, what with the next research building upgrade requiring over 5 million Funds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVerity VI was launched atop a dependable HoundDog Ib, due to its small size no larger launcher was required. However a new technique would be trialled for this launch and will be applied for all future Minmus launches if it works well. Rather than launching equatorially and then performing an expensive plane change burn in low orbit (often over 500Dv for the 6 degree chance) it was decided to time the launch to coincide with Minmus\u0027 inclination and launch at 6 degrees.

When you consider that these heatshields wont just be used for in-Kerbin trajectories I think that having all that ablator and excess capacity is going to be quite useful when you want to perform aerocapture at say Jool, and then re-enter on Laythe, or Sarnus/Tekto.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven in my 0.90 version I usually tweak down the ablator volume to save craft mass, so as far as these (fairly simple) tests are concerned I would say the ablator volume burned is similar although slightly reduced than 0.90, not enough for me to want to change its effects though as unprotected parts of the craft were incinerated pretty quickly (Mun-\u0026gt;Kerbin boost stage, jettisonned before re-entry but remained within physics range)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shania_L","CreatedById":58975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-06T22:18:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDay 215, KSC\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce the engineers had been able to tidy away all the reports especially written for yesterdays audit they were able to get back to doing some actual work, rockets and stuff you know?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the crack of dawn a HoundDog II blasts off the pad, weighed down with the modified, but as-of-yet not renamed, Medea automated transfer stage.

The upper stage has also had to be enlarged, a Rockomax service engine running on the incredibly efficient cryogenic HydroLox fuel mix allows heavier payloads to be accelerated up to orbital velocities, however due to the nature of the fuel this stage will not be able to hold position in orbit and perform secondary duties as a transfer stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/PhNGKQL\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022PhNGKQL.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PhNGKQL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHoundDog III is the latest design from the VAB, straight out of testing.

In itself the Engine test would be within the capacity of a HoundDog I, however it was decided that use of this as a combined engine and launch vehicle test would be more than covered by the payout, Mortimer gave the green light.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReplacing the original 8 tonnes of lead plating with 6.5tonnes of lead plating and a rapier engine the HoundDog III was rolled out to the pad in short order. 4x KW rocketry Globe VI solid motors (rated at 297KN each) and 3x KW Rocketry Maverick-1D KeroLox engines (rated at 366KN each, but strangled by atmospheric density) ignite on the pad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022P1Hxi63.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/P1Hxi63.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe III follows a much more aggressive launch profile than either the I or II, having a target TtW ratio of 1.5 at liftoff, compared with 1.2 in previous models. This is partially due to difficulties experienced in low speed stability with previous models, but mainly because the KW solid boosters can only be tweaked in thrust output and not burn time, if HoundDog does not reach sufficient speed and altitude before they burn out then the core stage simply cannot lift the vessel. The core stage also must be run at 100% throttle from liftoff right to burnout simply to burn off enough fuel to reduce mass to achieve a TtW of 1:1 at solid motor jettison.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll goes well with the first 1.5 stages, and as the KeroLox core stage is run dry it is jettisoned allowing the HydroLox fuelled Rockomax Service engine (169KN) upper stage to take over the acceleration to orbit.
