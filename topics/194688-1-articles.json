I would like to find a program that would allow me to distort the geometry of an equirectangular scan (2:1 resolution similar to what stock ksp uses) into a cubemap. I have found software that can do the later, but not at the resolutions present.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022DdmbbPA.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002241.86\u0022 height=\u0022428\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/DdmbbPA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003ECurrently my plan is to export textures as separate\u00A0color channels as seen above. This means that instead of 5-6GB exports I can get away with 1-2GB ones. From here I would like to convert their geometry, then recombine them and export them as DDS cube-faces. If anyone knows of any software capable of handling this task, please let me know. I believe my pc can handle it, but my knowledge is simply too limited with these sorts of things. But that is why I am reaching out to you people, as I expect there is a lot I do not know yet.\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAny help is greatly appreciated,\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Luci\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
