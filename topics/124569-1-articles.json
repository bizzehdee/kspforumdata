Faction B wants to destroy it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMethod 1: To prevent detection, I will launch a debris bomb into retrograde orbit. The kinetic energy of the debris (I\u0027ll be using tens of oscar tanks or even just decouplers) will be enough to effectively destroy the station; however I can also use small bombs from BD armory. I will deploy the debris 10 to 20 kilometers prior to the nearest approach so that they will move enough to collide with anything in a radius of several hundred meters.If a vital module or a docking node is damaged, the station is pretty much broken.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPros:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - large, variable action radius\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - high probability of hit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - hard to detect; late detection; only seconds of time for counter-measures\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - no good counter-measures except for modifying the position or the orbit of the station which may not be possible in the small time period\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Orbit may be blocked for several hours until the debris will be far enough from eachother.
