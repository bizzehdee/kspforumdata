I used various colors but there was one that wasn\u0027t working (at least properly), this was the metallic and Specular options, when I set both to 255 (max) the craft would be shiny and perfect in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E but when it loaded in the pad the colour was black. In that time it wasn\u0027t a big deal for me because I could use another colours, but now I made an Atlas and I want it to be \u0022shiny\u0022 but it\u0027s just black\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor the installation of RP-1 (and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E) I used Carnasa\u0027s guide\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere are some screen shots of how it looks in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and in the pad\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E:\u00A0https://ibb.co/RYSYnf1\u003Cbr\u003E\nPad: https://ibb.co/YcMp4W6\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-03T09:09:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShiny metal textures usually turn out black in flight in my experience, could be something to do with reflections being turned off in flight as having them switched on kills the frame rates.
