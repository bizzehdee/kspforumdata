The problem is, the reality is that NASA\u0027s budget is being gutted slowly, and has been for a long time. The commercial initiatives are being starved into oblivion, and the majority of the budget keeps on going to pork in rocket states. And nobody is showing real support for NASA in any significant or meaningful way (other than the public, but no one listens to them \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E).

We have no idea what a seat costs the Russians, period. And subsidized seats aren\u0027t exactly unheard of. (We provided them on the Shuttle.) Russian era accounting is no clearer than that of the Soviet era and they show no interest in clarifying the situation. As to the second, the current mark of Soyuz is not only largely new (and thus cannot be said to be \u0022best understood\u0022 at the systems level), it also hasn\u0027t flown sufficient times to make any accurate statement as to it\u0027s safety. (Though I will note in passing, it\u0027s landed off-target due to failure of it\u0027s main computer on something like roughly one third of it\u0027s flights to date.)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust one quick note, or two, because this shuttle-soyuz comparison is quite off-topic. Neither of us can provide hard numbers, but I\u0027d say at a time when NASA was practically subsidizing Roscosmos so the russian ICBM engineers wouldn\u0027t loose their jobs (ISS modules and such, the 90\u0027s), which is around the time Tito bought the first seat to ISS for about $50 million, I don\u0027t think the russians really had the money to subsidize anyone. In fact I suspect that money paid for considerably more than the single seat and allowed them to keep flying the Soyuz at a sustainable rate. And the monetary situation hasn\u0027t really improved since then, only the demand for Soyuz has risen. So file that under \u0022supposition\u0022, but I think I have a point when I say that the prestige USSR cooperation flights may have been subsidized, but NASA and the tourists pay more than what the seat costs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to safety, well... we\u0027ll agree to disagree, ok? At least we can agree the comparison is difficult.

If we go into hypotheticals, you are the first to point out the marginal cost of a shuttle flight (which, incidentally, would have made it a cost-effective vehicle... if you could launch 50-100 in a year). Since anything worth doing in space other than business as usual requires more upmass/year, I posit it\u0027s more economical to spread that upmass into a number of launches that creates adequate economies of scale while maintaining low overheads and keeping space assembly to a reasonable level. Individual failures may become more common, but there is less riding on each flight and more frequent flight opportunities, so backups can cover those easier, and in most flights no human life is at risk, and in those that there is human life at risk, there are additional safety measures.

From everyone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoliticians tend to squander money by their very nature. I agree with your sentiment that a long term sustainable architecture for manned space exploration requires a strong public interest. This is one reason why things like KSP make me so excited, they are great at informing people and popularizing science. Perhaps people influence by games like this will go on to someday become a politically influential nucleus of support for an expanded space program. On the other hand, I would tend to disagree that the Apollo Program \u0027galvanized the nation\u0027. I think it is a bit of a fallacy to suppose that NASA had strong popular support during the 1960\u0027s but somehow \u0027lost its way\u0027 with the public since then. People are certainly sentimental about that era, but the unfortunate truth is that even in 1969, on the eve of the moon landing, most Americans wanted to spend less money on space exploration, not more. Close to half of the surveyed American public thought the expense was wasteful and the resources would be better directed towards more earthly concerns. Only 15% percent of American though that funding for space exploration should be increased. It turns out that support for manned space exploration beyond LEO peaked in 1994, but even then there was never a majority of Americans in support for say a manned mission to Mars. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this is why NASA\u0027s modus operandi has been to try to fly under the radar while progressively building up a platform for expanded exploration. The problem is that even though NASA\u0027s budget is small compared to many things in government, it retains a high political profile because, well... its space! How can it keep a low profile? This is what I think the Space Shuttle and the ISS were meant to be by NASA, gradual rungs up a ladder to Mars (or the moon), but it turns out that operating these systems was so expensive that they never had the resources to devote to taking the next big steps. I think this also explains the current predilection for talking up \u0027game-changing\u0027 technology; they hope this will make big missions more affordable. But I wonder though, if they make it more affordable, will not their budget just be further cut to the current equilibrium? I wonder if NASA\u0027s manned program is for political purposes (and thus practically speaking, for funding purposes) a vestigial organ of the cold-war slowly shrinking until it is done away with entirely? I certainly hope not, but being nigh-inhumanly cynical is generally part of the politician\u0027s job description.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWow... that ended up being a little dark.

Its primary missions did not materialize fast enough (or at all). The space shuttle was originally designed to ship up propellant for cis-lunar space tugs, and to service a large LEO space station, something on which construction didn\u0027t start until over 17 years of the space shuttle flights. After Challenger, NASA didn\u0027t dare to fly propellant modules as cargo on the space shuttle. The initial development actually came in basically on budget and on time. Payload to orbit was theoretically 65,000 lbs, but in practice it never managed this because of onerous payload bay dimensions, essentially designed for military payloads. The main reason the Space Shuttle was so much more expensive that planned was that they planned to amortize costs through, \u0027airline-like\u0027 flight rates. NASA initially planned an ambitious flight rate-60 flights per year, but the reality was more like 6 flights per year. They thought that they would have less-than 30 day turn-arounds, between each orbiter flight with a cost on the order of a few tens of millions of dollars. We should make fair comparisons though. If the Saturn-V had flow 135 times it is likely that they would have had fatal accidents. Also the Apollo program had cost-overrun similar in rate to the Shuttle program; if Apollo had been continued it would have become more expensive as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said they had some cool ideas for upgrades, such as these reusable liquid fly-back boosters. It was thought that such boosters would save up to $400 million per year on operations (assuming 7-8 flights per year). They would be more environmentally friendly, they would roughly double the maximum payload mass to the ISS\u0027s orbit, and allow polar orbit missions from KSC (since in addition to the increased delta-v you don\u0027t have to worry about spent stages impacting New York). Also Challenger type accidents would no longer be possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/yshl4b98.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022yshl4b98.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://mix.msfc.nasa.gov/IMAGES/MEDIUM/0001720.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220001720.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://mix.msfc.nasa.gov/IMAGES/MEDIUM/0001721.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220001721.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chrischambers","CreatedById":69113,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T19:29:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would go down the path of the The X-38 Crew Return Vehicle (CRV)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"luinux","CreatedById":81325,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-12T21:24:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat about this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylon_(spacecraft)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylon_(spacecraft)\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rpayne88","CreatedById":58336,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-12T22:27:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DerekL1963\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DerekL1963\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is just an oversized Dyna-Soar, which had significant problems with it\u0027s launcher.
