In the SPH, click the Center-of-mass button, also the Center-of-Lift button. What you are describing is called a \u0022land-dart\u0022...it does what arrows do. That happens when the yellow-ball is too far in front of the blue-ball.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u0026gt; So move wings around until the blue-ball is only slightly behind the yellow-ball(the balls should \u00A0touch).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u0026gt; Right-click a fuel tank and empty it. This shows how the yellow-ball is moving around in flight as you deplete fuel...keep that in mind, because if \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0the yellow-ball is BEHIND the blue-ball at any time in flight...you will be having a bad time (\u0022flip-happy\u0022).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you want to make cargo spaceplane, i suggest trying to build something similar to SKYLON.

I built\u00A0one with the B9 mod part pack, and it is the most stable plane i have ever seen...re-entry at 60\u0027 pitch without my keyboard input, without any tendency to fall over/flip around.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt weights 59t at launch, and can put about 7t in LKO.
