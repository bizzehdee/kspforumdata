Making standard parts is fairly simple as you just make the 3d model, add a collision mesh, copy and paste a config file from another part and tweak it to your needs, but how do you make something that you intend to function completely different from stock parts. For example, the interstellar mod has a warp plugin, nuclear reactors, new fuels and resources etc etc etc, which to the stock game should mean absolutely nothing. I would like to make a whole new fuel system that extends the realism of engine ignition, a bit like the engine igniter plugin, but with a bit more depth to it. The only problem with this is I can\u0027t start typing things like UDMH and RP-1 into part configs because the game is not programmed to compute resources like that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, all I am really asking is how to you access the game code and program into it to start variables like UDMH and RP-1 to act as resources for the game and can be used as propellants etc. I know the game runs on c#.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help would be great\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinks to info pages about these things would be appreciated a lot\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoePatrick1","CreatedById":104094,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T15:14:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI only started writing plugins a few days ago but have been making parts for almost a year now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not entirely sure what you want to do but if you just want to add a new fuel type to use in the config you can do that without a plugin.
