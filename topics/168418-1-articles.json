I thought the tech-tree was pretty well thought-out. Heavy rocket parts are on the top. So if you like manned rockets (like me), this will be your go-to zone. Unmanned, science-type stuff is on the bottom. So if you like sending probes, you\u0027ll concentrate here. These will be small anyway, so you won\u0027t need the big rockets. Branching off of these are the pods, landing gear, wheels, docking ports, and all the other things you\u0027ll eventually want and need. These are supposed to be tough decisions. When you\u0027re ready to open a node and you\u0027ve got 90 points to spend, that\u0027s a bit like having your last 10 bucks in your hand. You\u0027re not gonna spend it on just anything. You really need to think about it. I think the game does this well. There is stuff you want, and stuff you need, and some things that just look cool.

I usually save these for last since I\u0027m a rocket guy. When I saw your question about the Dart yesterday it made me smile because, although I\u0027ve got about 2,500 hours in, most of that was on a single career. I unlocked the tech-tree so long ago I forgot where things were. I just started a new career a few weeks ago and, after unlocking most of the rocket parts, I suddenly realized I didn\u0027t have the Dart. It took some searching to find it hidden with the spaceplane parts; high up in the tree. This was perplexing at first but, when I thought about it for a moment, it made sense. As a rocket guy, I think of it as a \u0022rocket part\u0022 because it\u0027s my preferred engine for Duna and Laythe landers. However, if you\u0027re a spaceplane guy, with its low profile and decent thrust, it probably makes a good \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E engine.
