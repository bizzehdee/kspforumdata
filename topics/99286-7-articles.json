The other is mostly filled with gripes, complaints about how KSP isn\u0027t ready for 1.0, individuals saying they haven\u0027t used the tutorials in a long time, and to be fair - a few possibly useful bits of feedback. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYup, and as I said myself about understanding why Squad may be seeking mediums of communication with less traffic, the signal to noise ratio may be a big part of that, so we agree on that point as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think a big part of the increasing negative attitude you may be (quite correctly) perceiving on these forums may be directly related to this issue actually: the sensation that the community is being slowly cut out of the loop and becoming less relevant in how the game is developing. I think that\u0027s potentially amplified by the impending \u0022release version\u0022 of KSP, as we\u0027re beginning to feel like there\u0027s now a clicking clock on how long we have to provide feedback and be heard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, not certain if that sensation is accurate, but I do think it\u0027s present in a rather large volume as illustrated by this thread, and is at least implied in some of the more nasty comments I\u0027ve seen directed at Squad. In fact, I think I\u0027ve watched individuals essentially become more and more nasty as they seem to get more and more frustrated due to feeling they\u0027re not being heard, when they used to be rather reasonable individuals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommunity management, especially on this scale, certainly isn\u0027t easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alizerin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alizerin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main change should start with us, the community\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I might even agree with you on principle on that point, I think trying to convince a mass of people to shift direction and behave in a different manner might be an overly idealistic approach to things \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-12T02:04:12Z\u0022 title=\u002202/12/2015 02:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FlowerChild\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceHips","CreatedById":176006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-12T02:00:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FlowerChild\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FlowerChild\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYup, other than living dangerously in even daring to speak poorly of 4Chan...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027re having fun watching you talk about us, just so you know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re interested in why we get information before other sources first, you might like to know that it\u0027s because many of us are friends with the team and speak to them directly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAsking the right questions often gets you a good answer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and just out of curiosity, how are things going back at the minecraft modding scene?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you still doing that, or is there too much drama these days?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-12T02:07:09Z\u0022 title=\u002202/12/2015 02:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kerboa\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r_rolo1","CreatedById":26192,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-12T02:04:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAlizerin\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are comparing apples to oranges.
