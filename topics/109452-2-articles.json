I hope it\u0027s not too long.\n\nThe first is an engine chart with only two engines, the LV-909 (\u0022Terrier\u0022) and the LV-N (\u0022Nerv\u0022).\n\n[![Lg61OhWl.png](http://i.imgur.com/Lg61OhWl.png)](http://i.imgur.com/Lg61OhW.png)\n\nThe jaggedness is clearly visible here. Let\u0027s focus on the horizontal black line, which corresponds to a payload of around 3.4 t. I\u0027ve marked as **1**, **2** and **3** the points where one engine overtakes the other. As you can see:\n\n- To the left of point **1** , the LV-909 is better.\n- Passing point **1** , the LV-N becomes better.\n- But at point **2** , the LV-909 gets back the lead. We\u0027ll see in a minute why.\n- Finally, at point **3** the LV-N overtakes again, and will remain better for any higher \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv.\n\nNow take a look at the next image.\n\n[![eRaYABKl.png](http://i.imgur.com/eRaYABKl.png)](http://i.imgur.com/eRaYABK.png)\n\nThis plot is a more detailed representation of the black line we saw in the previous image. Since it\u0027s computed for a fixed payload of 3.4 t, instead of showing just which engine is better it shows what the total mass of the ship would be, versus the \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv.\n\nI\u0027ve also marked three points **1**, **2** and **3**. These correspond to the same moments marked in the previous image. This is what\u0027s going on:\n\n- Before point **1** , the LV-909 (red curve) yields lower total mass, which means it\u0027s better.\n- As we move to higher \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv, notice how the LV-N (black curve) is increasing at a slower pace (this is because it has better Isp).\n- At point **1** the curves cross over: the LV-N now yields a lower total mass.\n- At around 2650 m/s (not marked) notice how the red curve jumps. Why? Because slightly above 10 t total mass, a single LV-909 with its 60 kN of thrust is no longer enough to provide a TWR of 0.6. So we need to add a second LV-909, which adds the mass of the engine (0.5 t) and about 2.5 t of fuel to compensate for the extra weight.\n- As we continue to the right, we reach point **2**, where what just happened to the LV-909 now happens to the LV-N: once it passes 10 t we need a second LV-N to make sure the TWR remains above 0.6. But see that this jump is much larger! This is because the LV-N is much heavier: not only do we add the 3 tonnes of the engine itself, but we also need to add about 7 tonnes of extra fuel (and tanks) to compensate. That\u0027s a big penalty!\n- The result is that at point **2** the LV-N becomes worse again.\n- Finally, as we move further right the better Isp of the LV-N lets it catch up, and it does so at point **3**. By this point the curve for the LV-909 is starting to get more and more vertical (this is the exponential nature of the matter).\n\nSo as you see, the jaggedness is caused by these sudden changes in engine number that result in regions where one engine suddenly becomes worse than the others.\n\nWhy do they look like a sawtooth in the original chart? If we plotted the curves of the second image for a higher payload mass, you\u0027d see the crossover points move to the left (and in different amounts for each engine). Hence the regions where one engine overtakes the other would start and end at smaller \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv.\n\nHope this helps understand the behavior."},{"CreatedByName":"ToddEth","CreatedById":141196,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T22:36:18Z","Content":"Thanks for these, I will find these of much use when I get back off holiday."},{"CreatedByName":"nholzric","CreatedById":7793,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T23:31:57Z","Content":"\u003E Hope this helps understand the behavior.\n\nBrilliant, thanks Slashy and Meithan for the explanation.

I know KSP stores this information using atmosphereCurve, but I don\u0027t know how to evaluate these manually.\n\nTaverius made [a very detailed post](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93332) on this but he uses an external Unity plugin to actually compute the curve. If anyone could give me Isp values at 5 atm I could make these charts quickly.

Landing on Kerbin is close to free when coming from an interplanetary trajectory, so skip the capture and low orbit circularization dv.\n\nStill, if you want the single-stage ship to launch from Kerbin\u0027s surface, it\u0027s a lot of delta-v. So let\u0027s assume you can get to orbit with 3500 m/s (I haven\u0027t been able to hit these values in 1.0 yet, but I\u0027m far down the tech tree), then an aerobraking-assisted 1200 m/s Duna transfer. I have no idea how effective parachutes are in Duna in 1.0, but you won\u0027t need anywhere near 1300 m/s to land. Let\u0027s say you spend 500 m/s in a little propulsive assist. You *will*, however, need around 1300 m/s to takeoff. Ater that, you can do the transfer back to Kerbin\u0027s SOI probably on 800 m/s if you catch good windows, and then just aerocapture at Kerbin and land with almost zero fuel expenditure.\n\nThe total cost (ballpark) would be around 3500 (LKO) \u002B 1200 (Duna transfer) \u002B 500 (landing) \u002B 1300 (takeoff) \u002B 800 (Kerbin transfer) = 7300 m/s.

Duna liftoff requires Kerbin-relative TWR of 0.3, but let\u0027s multiply that by 2 so the Duna-relative TWR is at least 2.

Ater that, you can do the transfer back to Kerbin\u0027s SOI probably on 800 m/s if you catch good windows, and then just aerocapture at Kerbin and land with almost zero fuel expenditure.\n\u003E \n\u003E The total cost (ballpark) would be around 3500 (LKO) \u002B 1200 (Duna transfer) \u002B 500 (landing) \u002B 1300 (takeoff) \u002B 800 (Kerbin transfer) = 7300 m/s. That\u0027s also impossible, since you require TWR \u003E 1 for Kerbin takeoff. So yes, no single-stage ship can pull this off (and there\u0027s a \u0022good\u0022 challenge for anyone willing to try -- but they\u0027ll all fail).\n\u003E \n\u003E If you relax the single-stage from Kerbin surface requirement, and instead assume you start in low Kerbin orbit (so you\u0027re allowed to use an expendable launcher that won\u0027t travel to Duna), then the total cost is about 3800 m/s. Duna liftoff requires Kerbin-relative TWR of 0.3, but let\u0027s multiply that by 2 so the Duna-relative TWR is at least 2. The 0.6 TWR chart says this is totally doable, and that the optimal engine is the LV-N.\n\u003E \n\u003E **Not sure what you mean by this.**\n\nThe display on your charts \u0022steps\u0022 where the graph tells you that another engine has been added. With all of the engines, their colors, the overlapping, etc. it is hard for me to see when another engine is being asked for. i.e. I cannot discern the steps with all of the disparate engine info being displayed. Is their a chart for just one engine? I may have missed it.\n\nAlso, I misspoke in my request for what I want my rocket to do. I expect it to be staged. A rocket of this nature would be doable, yes? Is it practical? (Heck does practicality even matter in sandbox game?) \n\nThanks so much for the reply and mucho kudos on your charts.

I may have missed it.\n\nIf you plotted the engine charts with a single engine, it would all be one color (or one color and white), which wouldn\u0027t be interesting. Perhaps you want to look at the total mass plots, where instead of just telling you which engine is better for any (payload,dv) pair, more detail is given about just how good or bad each engine is in providing dv for a given payload.\n\nIn those plots you can follow the line for a specifc engine and see how heavy the spacecraft would be to yield a specific dv, and then compare that to the other engines.\n\nDon\u0027t know if this clarifies things a bit.\n\nAlso, I agree that there\u0027s probably too much information in these charts to be represented clearly. I\u0027m working on a webapp (see below) that computes these charts on the fly with user-customizable parameters, and I\u0027m thinking of several ways to interactively extract information from the analysis.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Also, I misspoke in my request for what I want my rocket to do.

In fact, a single-stage ship that departs from low Kerbin orbit, lands on Duna, and returns to Kerbin is probably doable. The LV-N is probably the optimal engine for such a ship.\n\n~~~~~\n\nAlright guys, I wanted to give you a very quick sneak peek of the webapp I\u0027m working on. A word of warning though: this is a very much work in progress at this point. The engine selection is not yet implemented (it\u0027s fixed to the LV-N, LV-909 and Mainsail, and there\u0027s no color key so you\u0027ll have to guess ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)), and many things can go wrong.
