Since it\u0027s computed for a fixed payload of 3.4 t, instead of showing just which engine is better it shows what the total mass of the ship would be, versus the \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also marked three points \u003Cstrong\u003E1\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003E2\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003E3\u003C/strong\u003E. These correspond to the same moments marked in the previous image. This is what\u0027s going on:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EBefore point \u003Cstrong\u003E1\u003C/strong\u003E , the LV-909 (red curve) yields lower total mass, which means it\u0027s better.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAs we move to higher \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv, notice how the LV-N (black curve) is increasing at a slower pace (this is because it has better Isp).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAt point \u003Cstrong\u003E1\u003C/strong\u003E the curves cross over: the LV-N now yields a lower total mass.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAt around 2650 m/s (not marked) notice how the red curve jumps. Why? Because slightly above 10 t total mass, a single LV-909 with its 60 kN of thrust is no longer enough to provide a TWR of 0.6. So we need to add a second LV-909, which adds the mass of the engine (0.5 t) and about 2.5 t of fuel to compensate for the extra weight.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAs we continue to the right, we reach point \u003Cstrong\u003E2\u003C/strong\u003E, where what just happened to the LV-909 now happens to the LV-N: once it passes 10 t we need a second LV-N to make sure the TWR remains above 0.6. But see that this jump is much larger! This is because the LV-N is much heavier: not only do we add the 3 tonnes of the engine itself, but we also need to add about 7 tonnes of extra fuel (and tanks) to compensate. That\u0027s a big penalty!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe result is that at point \u003Cstrong\u003E2\u003C/strong\u003E the LV-N becomes worse again.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFinally, as we move further right the better Isp of the LV-N lets it catch up, and it does so at point \u003Cstrong\u003E3\u003C/strong\u003E. By this point the curve for the LV-909 is starting to get more and more vertical (this is the exponential nature of the matter).\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo as you see, the jaggedness is caused by these sudden changes in engine number that result in regions where one engine suddenly becomes worse than the others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy do they look like a sawtooth in the original chart? If we plotted the curves of the second image for a higher payload mass, you\u0027d see the crossover points move to the left (and in different amounts for each engine). Hence the regions where one engine overtakes the other would start and end at smaller \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps understand the behavior.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ToddEth","CreatedById":141196,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T22:36:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for these, I will find these of much use when I get back off holiday.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nholzric","CreatedById":7793,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T23:31:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps understand the behavior.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBrilliant, thanks Slashy and Meithan for the explanation.

I may have missed it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you plotted the engine charts with a single engine, it would all be one color (or one color and white), which wouldn\u0027t be interesting. Perhaps you want to look at the total mass plots, where instead of just telling you which engine is better for any (payload,dv) pair, more detail is given about just how good or bad each engine is in providing dv for a given payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn those plots you can follow the line for a specifc engine and see how heavy the spacecraft would be to yield a specific dv, and then compare that to the other engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t know if this clarifies things a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I agree that there\u0027s probably too much information in these charts to be represented clearly. I\u0027m working on a webapp (see below) that computes these charts on the fly with user-customizable parameters, and I\u0027m thinking of several ways to interactively extract information from the analysis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sobriquet\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sobriquet\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso, I misspoke in my request for what I want my rocket to do. I expect it to be staged. A rocket of this nature would be doable, yes? Is it practical? (Heck does practicality even matter in sandbox game?)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, then yes, it\u0027s totally doable. In fact, a single-stage ship that departs from low Kerbin orbit, lands on Duna, and returns to Kerbin is probably doable. The LV-N is probably the optimal engine for such a ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~~~~~\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright guys, I wanted to give you a very quick sneak peek of the webapp I\u0027m working on. A word of warning though: this is a \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Every much work in progress\u003C/span\u003E at this point. The engine selection is not yet implemented (it\u0027s fixed to the LV-N, LV-909 and Mainsail, and there\u0027s no color key so you\u0027ll have to guess \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E), and many things can go wrong.
