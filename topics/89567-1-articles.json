It\u0027s still a long way to space, and the (now useless) weight from all the plane parts will eat most of the gains you had so far.

And if it really flies as well as you say it does, you may have great sucess if you just replace the basic jets with turbojets. Take-off and early climb will be slower, but it should last to something like 1000m/s@20km -- much better, but not yet good (most people here think that if a plane can\u0027t make 2000ms@30km, it is a failure).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can tickle even speed/altitude out of it if you use more intakes.

Spaceplanes\u0027s don\u0027t need a whole lot of wing and adding more wing just adds more mass. Inability to ascend is the result of a lack of power in most cases. The higher you go, the more airspeed you need. For more temperamental planes you can \u0022Stair step\u0022 them up. That is ascend as high as you can, level off, allow speed to build, then try to ascend some more. However it is best to try and design those faults out so you can get a steady ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour rocket engines are heavy and in-efficient. The LVT-45 is not a great spaceplane engine unless your trying to build in a low tech tree. For a plane this size, the toroidal aerospike is wonderful and in space it\u0027s the most efficient outside of the LV-N (which is incredibly heavy and very low power and is not great for a plane). The downside... it has no thrust vectoring so it must be perfectly placed to avoid rotation. That shouldn\u0027t be a problem for you plane as it has it\u0027s center of mass right across the center. The RAPIERS are also good choices. For smaller planes the 24-77 and 48-7S are good choices. For a low tech tree, the LV-909 is also a good choice. You don\u0027t need a lot of rocket power, jet power is more important. By the time you use the rockets your up high in the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou also have a lot of fuel in that plane. For your first plane you shouldn\u0027t try to go to the moon or anything, just get to a 150km orbit, or even just a 75km orbit. You shouldn\u0027t need that much fuel to do that, even in stock. That will just weigh your plane down. Don\u0027t worry about putting jet fuel on a Spaceplane. The little fuel your jet engines use does not outweigh the cost of adding the mass of a jet fuel tank. Just run fuel lines from your LFO tank and use that for both jets and rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFYI, I do use FAR.

DocMoriarty\u0027s guide focuses on use of the RAPIER engine. It\u0027s slightly out of date (by slightly I mean it was designed for 0.24.2 and he hasn\u0027t yet updated it for the changes in 0.25), but so far the only thing I\u0027ve seen that\u0027s major is that the new Wing Connectors are functionally equivalent to Delta Wings. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn answer to your specific questions...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) You want to get up above 10,000 as quickly as possible. Assuming you\u0027ve got what it takes to do that (in my experience, most spaceplanes fail either because they veer off course and crash during take-off - which keptin explains - or they haven\u0027t got sufficient lift/thrust and wind up going in the drink), start off by getting your prograde marker to at least 45 degrees above the horizon as quickly as you can after takeoff. Depending on your AoA, this may mean getting the nose up to 55-60 degrees or more; so be it. You can start leveling off after 10,000; at that point you don\u0027t want to be ascending greater than 100 m/s. Shoot for this velocity profile: 350 m/s at 11k, 450 at 14k, 650 at 16k, 850 at 19k and 1300 at 23 km. If your speed is increasing rapidly, you are going up too fast; if it\u0027s barely budging, you\u0027re going up too slowly. You want to try to get most of your orbital velocity before your engines start running out of air (or, if you use RAPIERS like DocMoriarty, before they kick over) - but, you want to keep the turbojets running for as long as you can. If they start flaming out, throttle back. Eventually, you\u0027ll stop accelerating on turbojets alone - that\u0027s when you kick on the rockets. If you\u0027re above 30k when that happens, you\u0027re probably okay to shut off your jets, close your intakes and angle up to 45 degrees - at that point your plane is a rocket and you want to get it out of the atmosphere as quickly as you can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) There are so many things to look for when you\u0027re building a spaceplane it\u0027s not funny. Refer to the guides I linked for specifics. As a rule - you want your CoL slightly behind and slightly above the CoM for maximum control, and preferably you want to design your plane so the CoM doesn\u0027t shift around too much - you definitely don\u0027t want it to where it shifts behind the CoL (if it does, you\u0027re more likely to lithobrake than land). You want your CoT aligned with the CoM, again for control. You want sufficient lift and sufficient thrust - sufficient thrust being 1 Basic Jet engine per ten tonnes of craft, 1 RAPIER engine per thirteen tonnes of craft, or 1 Turbojet engine per 15 tonnes of craft; sufficient lift is generally 1 lift unit per tonne (or roughly 2.3 tonnes per Delta Wing, like DocMoriarty says). You want good steering authority on all three axes, and if necessary you want sufficient SAS to hold your craft\u0027s attitude. And you want to be able to takeoff and land safely. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) As others have suggested, I\u0027d use Turbojets or RAPIERs for a proper spaceplane - Basic Jets excel for low-level aircraft (like you would want for parts testing) and for VTOL capabilities. You\u0027re short on thrust and short on intakes - thrust can be remedied by swapping out the engines for your design. You want no less than three Ram Air Intakes or the equivalent per turbojet - that\u0027s your craft\u0027s big weakness at the moment if you want to make space (you have the equivalent of three at the moment; you want at least twice that amount). You\u0027re awesome on the lift department. That CoM might shift a bit too far aft...I\u0027d have to run your craft through the RCS Build Aid mod to know for sure, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: These would be the OP\u0027s original questions, not the second set.

There are several approaches, but remember you have these miraculous things called wings, you can glide. Descend shallow, lower the Pe while on the other side of the planet so it takes nearly a half orbit of landing.

If your still too fast, don\u0027t be afraid to pass it by and come around and land at 270. Don\u0027t be afraid to fire up the jets, unpowered deorbital landing is going to be one of the last things you learn about planes, when you master that it will prepare you for shuttles, which once deorbited don\u0027t fire an engine ever again (because they don\u0027t have jets).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022phemark\u0022 data-cite=\u0022phemark\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E5) I dont really like the look of many intakes on a plane, but I guess it will always be like that for plane SSTO?
