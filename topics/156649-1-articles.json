Which means they dock with my fuel shuttle. I think the current one\u0027s been in orbit for 15 years or so. It\u0027s never broken a contract.

Yes, it still applies for refueling. But it depends on which version of the program you are running? Or it might even work if this savegame has been upgraded from a previous version.
