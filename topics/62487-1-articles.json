When you are high enough and go fast enough, you have to point your plane a little below the horizon, so your periapsis goes closer to you. With some planes i can make it so the apoapsis is 100 km\u002B, and the periapsis is where i currently am, at 50 km. This way i can reach apoapsis using only liquidfuel and intake air. Then i just burn a little on apo to raise the periapsis. Doesnt feel very realistic, but it is still fun \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-08T16:48:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tank Buddy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tank Buddy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt is, and not even that difficult.

Except I aim to be around 32km when I\u0027m reaching for these speeds. It makes it easier and less gas hungry (at least for my particular designs). I\u0027m usually only going about 1000m/s at 23-24km, but it\u0027s all in how you prefer to fly. I can achieve what Kasuha demonstrates above with a single TurboJet and two radial scoop intakes (no ram intakes).
