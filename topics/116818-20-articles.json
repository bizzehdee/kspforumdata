Or maybe it was but I was looking in the wrong places...\n\nIt also only happened to me after switching to a mostly stock installation so maybe something else I had installed was preventing it.\n\nEdit: Ok, scratch the part about it happening immediately after switching scenes.... I think that bit was only happening because I had already triggered the bug, gone back to the vessel and then changed the LAN (with the stock cheat orbit setter) - and then switched away before the scene could be saved.  OD then updated the orbit with its own saved values which were never replaced with the new ones. \n\nSo I can see THAT happening in any circumstance where the orbit parameters change and then the scene is exited BEFORE OD commits the parameters to its own saved node.\n\nBut that\u0027s probably a different problem than the one being investigated. Or maybe not... 0 is the default value and if OD tries to update an orbit\u0027s parameters and tries to look up those parameters before it has a saved node to look them up on then 0 is what you get.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-04-20T22:47:26Z\u0022 title=\u002204/20/2018 10:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EApril 20, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Starwaster**"},{"CreatedByName":"golkaidakhaana","CreatedById":206662,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-21T00:10:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 23 hours ago, Maeyanie said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Short version: It has been recompiled, but there are some bugs.
