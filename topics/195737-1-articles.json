However, I\u0027m either not be remembering correctly or they setup that via the EVA follower mod. The end result I\u0027m looking for would be controlling a Kerbal that you can see though\u00A0the cockpit window that is actively controlled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMods I\u0027ve checked already:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0- I\u0027m aware of the \u0022EVA Follower\u0022 mod, but that would be programming movement and the switching to EVA to watch.

(QuickIVA mod switches to IVA on launch, but doesn\u0027t keep it there for EVA.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-07-20T07:39:24Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2020 07:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by cyberKerb\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clamp-o-Tron","CreatedById":201818,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-20T20:46:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022129964\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed2076007643\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/166786-19x-through-the-eyes-of-a-kerbal/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:211px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theJesuit","CreatedById":122369,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-21T08:33:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could keep a spare kerbal on the inside to look out the window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother option would be to use hullcamVDS cameras clipped inside a pod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso jsi advanced transparent mods to make some mods show the iva while you are outside.\u00A0 Doesn\u0027t work for everything though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPeace.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cyberKerb","CreatedById":28891,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-24T13:35:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the suggestions. The transparent pods option is probably the closest, but the camera would be fixed on the\u00A0 IVA prod and only good for static shots. As soon as\u00A0 you moved the EVA Kerbal, the moving camera would cause you to lose the fixed perspective of looking from the IVA position.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theJesuit","CreatedById":122369,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-24T20:00:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129964-linuxgurugamer/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022129964\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129964-linuxgurugamer/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@linuxgurugamer\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0adopted? a\u00A0mod that had a tracking light, a spotlight that followed a targeted craft.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/192536-18x-19x-tracking-lights/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/192536-18x-19x-tracking-lights/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI asked if there could be something similar added to hullcamVDS but it was out of scope for both mods I think.\u00A0 I reckon it would be marvellous as it could follow your EVA kerbal around and may be the solution you are looking for?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn saying that, yes the IVA set camera will always be static.\u00A0 I guess what you could do as well is \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patch the camera position as that it sits outside and away from the part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPeace.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
