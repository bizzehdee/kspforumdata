The addition is nice and seamless; and informative. Actually, since reading your tutorial, I\u0027ve been making some aircraft without pitching the wings.

You can\u0027t actually have a pure aileron in default KSP because an aileron is a control surface only hooked up to the roll axis and doesn\u0027t respond to pitch control - in KSP they are either hooked to both pitch and roll (if symmetrically linked) or just pitch. (you can have vertical surfaces linked with roll control too, but that is just weird \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, another KSP issue related to that - elevators behind the Center of lift (or mass?) seem especially ineffective in KSP, especially when attached to wings that are attached mid-fuselage. This mostly because of the lawn dart syndrome you described, because without canards, the CoL shifts back away from the CoM and marginalized the elevators on the wings. So a Delta-wing style plane (or something like the space shuttle, which only has elevons on the main wings) is very difficult to make in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-15T06:07:08Z\u0022 title=\u002210/15/2013 06:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tiberion\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"keptin","CreatedById":8884,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T14:05:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m hoping that in a future update players are given the ability to assign control surfaces, like you can in FAR. It\u0027d add another step, but would be a ton better than the stupid auto-control. Maybe they can do both, have an auto default or something. Anyhoo, I left out that stuff because explaining it might confuse new players when they could more easily learn it for themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think KSP favors canards over conventional tail assemblies since it doesn\u0027t take into account many of the disadvantages they have; in-flight CoM issues with further back wings (fuel in wings), can enter irrecoverable deep stalls, turbulent air over main wing, difficult to design for, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother advantage of canards in KSP is that they don\u0027t tend to snap craft in half. Unlike conventional elevators that put downforce on the tail to lift the front of the craft, stressing the parts in between, canards simply lift the weight of the front of the craft and let the tail get pulled down by gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis all being said, you can make high performing conventional craft. The big advantage that canard designs bring to the table in their difficulty to stall is also one of their biggest performance drawbacks.
