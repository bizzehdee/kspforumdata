Just thought i\u0027d introduce myself before checking some of the other forum posts. I\u0027ve had KSP since 11/2012 and play it off and on (mainly in spurts). I\u0027m still getting the hang of a lot of the finer points of being a rocket scientist, I don\u0027t understand a lot of the more complicated concepts, and I can guarantee it won\u0027t be the most efficient designs, but I\u0027m figuring it out and having a ton of fun (and some frustration and sadness, RIP Jebediah) along the way. Love the game and I expect connecting with people who are also tin can rocketeers will be a blast.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"austin4050","CreatedById":66368,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T01:06:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are a lot of \u0022tin can rocketeers\u0022 here!

I\u0027ve tried to collect some of the best tutorials and resources I can find into a single library of links that I call the Drawing Board (link in my sig). Feel free to check that out, and also to ask questions in the How To section if there\u0027s anything you can\u0027t quite wrap your mind around but want to know more about. Take a look at the rest of the forums, too, and don\u0027t be afraid to jump into any conversation that interests you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"internetlad","CreatedById":67165,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T08:00:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the kind words and the resources! I\u0027ll be sure to check them out. I think the biggest thing for me that needs work is just general optimization in the building and operation of my craft, or maybe finding out things i\u0027m doing wrong. I don\u0027t really get the manouver mode either, so I just sort of wing it, which often ends up with me orbiting Kerbin about a dozen times before getting caught in the sphere of influence for whatever i\u0027m trying to get too (aka the mun) and acquiring orbit from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe article on using real life math in respect to KSP is something i\u0027ll surely check out later. I\u0027d like to do some let\u0027s plays with some of my funkier/more difficult designs but it seems like everybody and their dog has an LP out of some game or other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAmong my achievements (for anybody who cares) I\u0027ve done a round trip from the moon (I have about a 1/10 success rate of making the round trip, more often than not I end up flipping my lander on it\u0027s side and then sending out a rescue team which flips over on it\u0027s side.) set up a space station with docking ports to refuel for a long haul space trip (yet to be attempted). my .19 version went up after I watched \u0022Battle of Vulture\u0027s Drift\u0022 and got all starry eyed about the prospect of playing star wars, but it ended up with me spending several hours trying to dock an ion powered fighter with the SS. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to my lack of understanding for using the manouevers, I haven\u0027t made an interplanetary trip yet. More often than not my ship ends up in a \u0022sort of\u0022 close orbit to wherever i\u0027m heading and never makes a proper intercept, I get bored and go build a plane that \u0022sort of\u0022 flies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been wanting to set up a SSTO reusable plane with a smallish rocket on it\u0027s back to launch up to the space station and \u0022save\u0022 fuel, (My current design method of sending up a standard rocket burns up several rockomax fuel tanks and by the time it gets up to the space station there\u0027s only about 1000 fuel left) but haven\u0027t been able to get the design right. I have a basic understanding of the core game concepts, but all the math behind it is lightyears ahead of where I am.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
