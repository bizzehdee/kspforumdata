A bare pod can safely re-enter from Low Kerbin Orbit without needing an extra heatshield. So you just need to give it a push. You can EVA out and use the Kerbal jetpack to push the pod, launch another ship with a claw to grab the pod and deorbit it, or launch another ship that just physically pushes the pod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr do a straight rescue mission sending up a new re-entry vehicle to bring your Kerbal down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn all but the EVA-push case you will need to learn orbital rendezvous. It\u0027s one of the key skills in spaceflight and gives most people trouble the first time they try, NASA included! But it\u0027s just another technique to learn and practice really.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aethon","CreatedById":110755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-26T00:48:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMake sure to push the pod retrograde with the jetpack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AeroGav","CreatedById":152027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-26T22:22:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t recommend this, but you can still jump directly from a low orbit on Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMake a small retrograde burn with RCS to bring your lowest point into the atmosphere, \u00A0 \u00A0then save the rest of the RCS fuel to burn UPWARDS and RETROGRADE at the altitude where the atmosphere starts to bite hard. \u00A0 I did it at 55km and ran out of RCS by 50km, so that was a bit early, but he survived the re-entry without burning up. \u00A0 \u00A0For some reason the impact with the surface itself is not a problem, so long as you\u0027re not under time acceleration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
