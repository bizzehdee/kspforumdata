I think I quite understand time dilatation as an effect of gravity but not so much with velocity as velocity is always relative. If a ship was moving relative to earth at 1/2 c, that would also mean that earth is moving relative to that ship at the same speed, no? Then how come that the clocks on those two bodies would show different time after their reunion, not taking gravity into account? Would it also work in an isolated system with only earth and that ship since there wouldn\u0027t be any difference between them except their mass?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-15T01:02:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the ship passes the Earth, from Earth\u0027s perspective the ship\u0027s time is dilated. From ship\u0027s perspective, it\u0027s the Earth\u0027s time that\u0027s dilated, because, as you pointed out, velocity is relative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if the ship slows down to land on Earth, after comparing the two clocks, it will be the ship\u0027s clock that\u0027s behind. The reason for that is acceleration. Unlike velocity, acceleration is absolute. And acceleration also causes time dilation effects. If you have to describe time dilation from perspective of an accelerated object, you have to use General Relativity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince Earth does not accelerate, however, from its perspective, Special Relativity still works.
