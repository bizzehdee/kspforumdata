For KSP, it could be something that once enabled allows you to load this saved state directly to something like your current most played save, or just to the main menu. So in theory, I am suggesting whether or not it is possible to save exactly what the RAM has currently loaded and then when running that file, it puts everything that was on the RAM back in the same order on the RAM. SO instead of loading KSP and letting it go through your game data and putting everything where it needs to be for the game to load, you would have a saved state after all of that would happen, which would in turn increase the loading time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
