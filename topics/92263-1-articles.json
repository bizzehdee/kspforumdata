The Atlas rocket used didn\u0027t stage, but it had 3 engines, 2 of which were dropped off during flight - this is probably the closest thing to an SSTO that\u0027s ever flown to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrying to build this in KSP, I couldn\u0027t get fuel to flow through a decoupler, so I had to attach a tiny Oscar-B fuel tank to each of the side engines and use a fuel line to feed fuel from the main tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilarly, I couldn\u0027t use a tricoupler, since that would make its thrust off-center with only one engine.
