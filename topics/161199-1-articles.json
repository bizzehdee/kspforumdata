I did a little experimenting and I think I\u0027ve found the main trouble with the launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nToo much control, believe it or not. But more specifically, all of the control surfaces on your shuttle are trying to do everything all at once and they are fighting each other for control. You have pitch, yaw and roll enabled for your vertical and horizontal stabilizers on the shuttle -- but when they engage all that force is being applied off center because there are fins on only on one half of the craft. Simple solution, your vertical tail fin should just have yaw activated. The inner set of horizontal control surfaces should be set only to pitch. And the outer set of horizontal control surfaces should be set only to control roll.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, you have so much thrust from the shuttle\u0027s vector engines that they can be turned down to about 60% each, just on the shuttle.\u00A0 I also turned down the gimbal control on those 3 shuttle vector engines to 70%. That dampens down the over-correction a lot (Edit to add, although maybe not since this causes problems higher up when you begin to run out of fuel in the main tank. Some more experimentation is in order on this point.) After making these changes the whole launch still requires a gentle touch. Try not to over-correct. Ease over during your gravity turn, don\u0027t make any sudden movements. When rolling, allow \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to settle down a bit before rolling back the other way. Remember, since you only have control surfaces on one side of your assembly all of your control surfaces will be dragging on one side of the craft a lot more than the other. Wobbling will be unavoidable, but manageable I think with these minor alterations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would also add some physical struts between your shuttle and main fuel tank. Autostrut is fine when your tank is full, but by the time the tank empties it is no longer the heaviest part and you lose the autostrut connection once you stage off the solid rocket boosters. Collisions ensue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne last thing. If you assign an action group to toggle off your shuttle\u0027s vector engines it will make it much easier to switch over to your orbital engines. With the vector engines running your shuttle will just spin head-over-heels without the weight of the main fuel tank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-29T02:07:28Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2017 02:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by HvP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HvP","CreatedById":146104,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-29T02:41:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, one more idea. I don\u0027t think you need to turn down the thrust on the shuttle\u0027s vector engines after all. That thrust will be needed once the main tank runs low since the off-center weight will start to cause a spin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstead, try assigning an action group to the two inner vector engines of the large fuel tank assembly that will toggle them off when you need to, leaving the outboard engine running. Once the outboard fuel tank gets low on fuel there is less weight for those 3 vectors to push and it becomes uncontrollable. Toggling off two of the three engines will reduce thrust on that side of the launch vehicle to 33% and becomes necessary sometime around the time you stage away your solid fuel boosters.
