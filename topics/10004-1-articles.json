Follow the flight instructions and these systems will work any time.\n\n**Orbiter System:**\n\nThis system is used to make maneuvers at about 300,000 m. It is capable of higher altitudes than 300,000 m, however I have had the most success at 300,000 m. In order to get the best results roll to 60^o^ above the horizon on a 90^o^ heading. Burn the outer boosters until the fuel runs dry. Continue along the vector until the Apoapsis 35,000 meters, at that point roll the ship to 45^o^ along the same 90^o^ heading. Burn the tank until dry, at which point only the actual Orbiter will remain. From there, any number of maneuvers are possible.\n\n**MELS IV (Munar Elliptical Landing System):**\n\nThis system is capable of landing on the Mun. In some cases, when first loading the game, one of the engines breaks off, however, this is only on the first flight of either MELS/MEOS system. Launch is straightforward, burn through the solid boosters, climb until the bottom stage burns out. Light the 3^rd^ stage until the Apoapsis is 70,000 m, roll to a 10^o^ above the horizon on a 90^o^ heading. After achieving a stable orbit of roughly a 100,000 m circular orbit, jettison the 3^rd^ stage. When the Mun rises, burn on a heading of 0^o^ above the horizon at a 90^o^ heading until the Apoapsis is 11.4 million m (this is the same altitude as the Mun above Kerban). From there, use the remaining fuel in the 4^th^ stage to slow down to 100 m/s during the altitude range 20km to 10km range. Drop the 4^th^ stage and land on the Mun leaving the remaining fuel tank at least 3/4 full. The remaining fuel should be enough to return to Kerban.\n\n**MEOS I (Munar Elliptical Orbiter System):**\n\nThe MEOS I flies the exact same way as the MELS IV, however, the 2^nd^ stage needs to be throttled down in order to not max out the Adv. SAS. The only other flight difference is when the MEOS I comes into the gravity-well of the Mun, you will be able to achieve a stable orbit.\n\nThese are videos of the systems in action, the Mun Shot is one version of the MELS off, but the flight mechanics are the same. The MELS III (the one in the video) had some balancing issues that were ironed out with MELS IV. The MEOS is the same thing as the MELS IV, but with an Orbiter style CM on the top instead of the lander\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/lP5RskdwAQE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/2aXNR_qm700?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**T-6 trainer jet:** Basic T1G design, the first one to not blow up on take off, for use in atmosphere only\n\n**Gourami III:**\n\nA capable shuttle for use in LKO, easy to fly and fun to use\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/_S5P9nCBqAY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"kevinlacht","CreatedById":14955,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-01T15:30:47Z","Content":"pictures?"},{"CreatedByName":"H2oskiKerbal","CreatedById":9538,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-04T02:43:55Z","Content":"Yes Please Pics would be Appreciated now you might want to hurry before the \u0027OMGAZ NO PICS NO CLICKZ\\\u0027 people get here if there are any but anyways on topic now.Sounds like a really nice craft"},{"CreatedByName":"Elven_sword","CreatedById":16427,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-04T23:00:21Z","Content":"OMGAZ NO PICS NO CLICKZ"},{"CreatedByName":"H2oskiKerbal","CreatedById":9538,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-05T04:02:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E OMGAZ NO PICS NO CLICKZ\n\n\\*faceHoof\\*"},{"CreatedByName":"Elven_sword","CreatedById":16427,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-05T05:15:34Z","Content":"Bronies?
