I\u0027ve passed time and gotten reputation up. I have also seen videos with the ones like 5dim where some contracts are available from the get-go. Is their anything I am missing on how to install them? Oh and yes i do have Contract Configurator installed as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
