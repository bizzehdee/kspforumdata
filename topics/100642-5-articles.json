Because career-mode KSP already forces players to work within limits of parts count, mass, and size - an argument can be made that designing payloads to fit inside one of the *(theoretically proposed)* fixed-size fairings - is a good extension to already existing craft-construction gameplay.

I still don\u0027t get that argument by the way) is.. part count. That and it appears the mod in question (procedural fairings) is actually not well understood by quite a few. Leading to some assumptive reasoning.\n\nWe have many parts, even in career quite a few do not get used. Or they are used (due to forced progression) and then almost never used again. The part count is getting out of control and is dramatically impacting the amount of memory KSP requires. Remember, absolutely every texture and part is loaded on start. This is not an inexhaustible resource. So adding 20 fairing shapes to cover the \u0022fixed\u0022 school of thought, for example, isn\u0027t really sustainable.\n\nFinally - as it happens the current procedural fairing mod actually *constrains the maximum size* when used in career. You must unlock various tiers of parts, to unlock larger fairing capabilities. This emulates \u0027fixed\u0027 fairing sizes by limiting the maximum payload that will fit, without the horrendous part tax.\n\nThis mechanic (dynamic parts with defined, progression-based constraints in career) could easily be extended to any number of parts; fuel tanks, rcs tanks, batteries and a number of other components. Simplifying part count, yet maintaining the mechano or lego like nature many relish the challenge of.\n\nIt allows for the proverbial cake, and the eating of said. Note that I refer to career or science modes. Arguing for balance in sandbox (which thankfully doesn\u0027t seem to be happening) is a pointless exercise. Sandbox should be as as free of restrictions as possible. That, mostly, is the point.\n\nLastly, I can\u0027t imagine parachutes will remain unchanged given the change to the aerodynamics model; having said that, there\u0027s no clear indication they will be adversely impacted under the new model. Stock chutes work with NEAR or FAR, so I would be surprised if this hasn\u0027t already had some work done. Regardless, I\u0027d rather see some smarter mechanics around \u0027chutes, rather than pure complexity for the sake of it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-26T00:58:25Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2015 12:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by kofeyh**"}]}
