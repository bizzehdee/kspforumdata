I still don\u0027t get that argument by the way) is.. part count. That and it appears the mod in question (procedural fairings) is actually not well understood by quite a few. Leading to some assumptive reasoning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have many parts, even in career quite a few do not get used. Or they are used (due to forced progression) and then almost never used again. The part count is getting out of control and is dramatically impacting the amount of memory KSP requires. Remember, absolutely every texture and part is loaded on start. This is not an inexhaustible resource. So adding 20 fairing shapes to cover the \u0022fixed\u0022 school of thought, for example, isn\u0027t really sustainable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally - as it happens the current procedural fairing mod actually \u003Cem\u003Econstrains the maximum size\u003C/em\u003E when used in career.

This emulates \u0027fixed\u0027 fairing sizes by limiting the maximum payload that will fit, without the horrendous part tax.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mechanic (dynamic parts with defined, progression-based constraints in career) could easily be extended to any number of parts; fuel tanks, rcs tanks, batteries and a number of other components.
