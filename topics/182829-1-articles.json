By agreeing to the EULA, it will be\u00A0stated that you are forced to agree to this arbitration clause by the terms set in the EULA.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy would Take Two want to enforce this?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy enforcing all players and forum goers to this agreement a\u00A0dispute that a consumer may have is\u00A0deprived\u00A0of the\u00A0right to access the public court system. This\u00A0denial of that access - without you being able to make a meaningful voluntary choice to surrender that right - could potentially be a\u00A0significant loss on a personal level depending on the situation, for example, if your Add-On license was being violated by Take Two or if you had a monetary dispute outstanding. Ensuring that all consumers waive the right to push these disputes to the public court system and instead settle disputes with a third party arbitrator has historically favoured the party with the most money to throw at the issue... i.e. its generally easier for the bigger, wealthier party to make a dispute dissapear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E*Shaking my pitchfork* \u0022So it seems Take Two are the Devil and are taking away my rights!\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, kinda, yes, but so are a plethora of other businesses such as Amazon, eBay, Netflix, EA, Snapchat... etc. etc. the list goes on (just look at a short list of these companies: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.citizen.org/our-work/access-justice/forced-arbitration-rogues-gallery\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELink\u003C/a\u003E).

Someone used to getting paid more per hour than a trial attorney, and who\u0027s often got decades of bench experience. Cheap is not a term I\u0027d associate with the process, and unless damages are provable and substantial - the costs are typically shared.\u00A0Both parties wind up with significant skin in the game. Versus a trial situation where it\u0027s possible in some circumstances to obtain council on contingency (meaning they only get paid if you win, but there\u0027s still often smaller costs in the meantime).

Requiring forced arbitration is a good way to kill an arms length deal between two parties, but it\u0027s really hard for \u0027the masses\u0027 to negotiate it away when it\u0027s part of the entrance fee for employment or use of a good or service (including entertainment).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the same time, there\u0027s always potential for damages. Who knows what the long term plans for the game and software includes? It\u0027s always possible for companies to get hacked, for credit card or payment information to be leaked, for personal details to be leaked, for bugs to allow unauthorized use or access to computers, etc. It\u0027s not hard to imagine a situation where one might have their credit card info used fraudulently due to a data security breach - and then comes the argument for who\u0027s responsible. Such a breach would undoubtedly affect large numbers of users - forcing them to arbitrate individually can take significantly longer and result in much lower damage recovery than a class-action suit.

Safeway,\u00A0Inc. actually set the precident that without them notifying you personally you dont have to abide by their terms. and just clicking on an\u0022agree or you aint playing our game\u0022 isint enough to show you agree with the terms.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nnow on a reperate case in the US\u00A0\u00A0Douglas v. Talk America the court actually said that parties must consent to the new terms. so between these two cases you have presedent that says you must be personally notified and that just clicking a box saying agree isint enough to prove you have agreed to all the terms and conditions. this means that the new take 2 EULA isint legally binding, unless they can prove you have read the new one!\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nnow if you live in europe there is actually a law prohibiting unfair contract terms, that basically means they cant change the terms on something you have bought. Kerbal isint a servace its a product sold on hard copy, their for regardless of future updates to this game, the new EULA means nothing. so forinstance, if they put in a data harvesting thing in an update to gain information about your system. providing you bought the game before the TAKE 2 eula was active then they cant do that to you because you bought the game prior to this happening. Its akin to taking your car in for a servace and it coming out only being able to runn on a special fuel, you ddint ask for that change, so they cant change something you bought without your EXPRESS permission. again, clicking a box they is known no one reads is not binding. but on top of that there is a burden of proof in the EU that essentually overturns EULA\u0027s because they cant prove you have read it. essentualy it is that a contract must have a signature, and clicking a box is not classed as an electronic signature. hope this helps you, and remember dont read the EULA :p its not worth the paper its printed on!!! see what i did there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
