Yeah, it definitely got my heart racing there, I didn\u0027t want my first successful Mun landing to end like that lmao. I definitely like the concept of having an ascent stage though, it didn\u0027t really matter that that I broke stuff in the landing XD I just need more fuel next time!

I also really wanted to post again with my second flight, since it shows some of the advantages of this style of Munar landings. I can definitely understand why NASA chose the Lunar Orbit Rendezvous concept for the Moon landings. It leaves a lot of fuel all around for doing different tasks (ex. landing on the Mun, returning to Kerbin, etc.), so I encourage everybody to try it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/ZHufJ#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/ZHufJ#0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ekku Zakku","CreatedById":34696,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-26T01:12:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPosted the save file, as it was requested, and also, this being (AFAIK) the first true Apollo-style ship in KSP, I want to post it in memory of Neil Armstrong.

We should see him as an inspiration, to keep building crazy rockets, and bringing little Kerbals to the Mun following in his footsteps. Rest in Peace.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
