The mission, regardless if you accept it or not, is an endurance run. Our engineers want to know how long a 10 second burn can carry our best space-planes, so you pilots have been chosen as \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Eguinea pigs\u003C/span\u003E testers. What you testers must do is fire up the engines for a total of 10 seconds, then attempt to achieve the highest ground distance possible. Now, our engineers didn\\\u0027t want faulty results because a current lack of proper stall physics, so \u0027glitches\u0027 such as Infinite Thrust have been banned. The stuck-up engineers also want photo proof, so 3 photos are a requirement, 1 just after the initial burn, another during the gliding period after, and the last showing the total ground distance covered. I have personally made a test run in the Arkbird II, and I started off slow for competition\\\u0027s sake. Good luck pilots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EThe Leaderboard\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
