It was shaking and could not go to warp or return to space center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe shaking started after debris from the fairing got jammed in between the parts of the rocket, so I detached the payload, got it into orbit and switched back to the lift section and the debris had vanished but now the lift section will not let me switch away again because it is \u0022moving over terrain\u0022 and yet shows orbital speed 0.0 and surface speed of 207.9m/s.

Was so far away though it was only worth 38k but better than nothing!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T15:13:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a bug where a craft with a stuck fairing panel will be treated as landed, Claw has been working on a fix.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T13:18:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks sal_vager, that explains it, useful to knoe, I will do acrobatics to remove panels in future.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
