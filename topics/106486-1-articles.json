In real life, something like this would generally be considered an extended mission, which would be a separate contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there anything preventing you from, once you realize you can perform an extended mission on Minmus, going back to KSC and accepting the \u0022explore Minmus\u0022 contract?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Patrick Kerbivan","CreatedById":114804,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T05:56:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not absolutely certain, but I had discarded a few contracts when the flyby contract appeared without the explore, and if memory serves the explore contracts would usually show up right away if they were available at all. I don\u0027t know what all the tweaks made to contracts in 1.0 are, but it seems like the exploration contract just wasn\u0027t available yet. Perhaps the flyby is now a sort of prerequisite, but if that\u0027s the case it seems like it\u0027s punishing the efficient to not allow you to take them both on in one flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T15:49:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a flaw I\u0027ve seen in many computer games- where the player takes the initative, and does something themselves, the game does not recognise it, and later instructs the player to do the exact same thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad walked straight into this one, with the way they\u0027ve used the contract system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TothAval","CreatedById":142030,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T16:44:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ecould be handled by being able to manually request the specific contract on a certain celestial body via the infoscreen in map view or via an additional option in mission control. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei also added this suggestion in the QoL list i am currently making\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr. Scruffy","CreatedById":38540,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T17:20:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree with the OP - these contracts should be auto-active.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
