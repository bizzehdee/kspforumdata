The guys at Squad \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbaldevteam.tumblr.com/post/47730955705/expansions-dlc-and-the-future-of-ksp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Equickly cleared up\u003C/a\u003E the confusion, and all was forgiven. Not much else has even been said about post-release content since it is so far down the road. Everyone moved on with their lives and eagerly began looking forward to the next release, version .20.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, version .20 was still planned to be the update that would lay the groundwork for the implementation of resources collection and utilization. Screenshots were released of UI\u0027s showing how much of a given resource was on a body. We even had the resource chart visualizing what all resources would be in the game, how they would interact, etc. I won\u0027t re-post it here since the devs have said that so much about resources has changed since that chart was released as to make it nearly irrelevant. Suffice it to say, the community was pretty pumped about finally getting one of the most requested features for KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally, around the same time that the clarification was made on DLC, the decision was made public that resources would not be in version .20. The devs had decided to shift their focus to implementing career mode in order to avoid a situation like Minecraft where, for a long time, the dev team for that game endlessly added features to the sandbox without ever getting closer to a finished product or even having an idea of what a finished product would look like. I believe that releasing KSP on Steam also put some pressure on Squad to have a clear end in sight and work aggressively towards finishing the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a working hypothesis that these two events (the discussion about DLC and the decision to postpone resources indefinitely) are directly related. I can\u0027t find specific posts to cite, but I distinctly remember one of the reasons given for cutting resources from the next few updates was to focus on the essential aspects of what they thought the game should be about, or something along those lines. I\u0027m paraphrasing because, again, [citation needed]. I have a feeling that somewhere along the way, it was decided that mining planets for resources should not and would not be one of these core features, and that the entire concept would be put on hold until after the game was released.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am fine with this decision, if indeed it has been made. I am curious, however, to know what you all think about it. Am I wrong completely, and seeing connections where there are none? What possibly could have prompted the discussion of DLC if indeed some had not been seriously talked about among the devs? Was the decision to focus on career mode over resources a mistake, in your opinion? Would you be disappointed if resources were not part of the initial release? Are resources an integral part of the game that need to be implemented before version 1.0? Any other comments you have on the subject are appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nachtwind","CreatedById":41015,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T09:40:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell... Correlation is not causality. Check the following statistics: Since the pirates vanished from the caribean earth got warmer. So if we introduce new pirates to the caribean islands will earth become colder? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe decision to not include resources into the game for a while still has, as far as i understand it, more to do with the fact that the game has to be prepared for the introduction of such features.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn .18 multiple resources were introduced like Liquid fuel and oxidizer. First step done. Furthermore parts were changed to allow any kind of \u0022resource\u0022 to take. Electricity is another example for that. Later rovers were introduced along with sensors etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the _very_ \u0022basics\u0022 are done. You have sensors to find stuff (possibly still, but nevertheless its easily programmable now). You have rovers as mobile platforms and you have the means to transport resources. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that a system like Kethane could be implemented with those prerequisits. But why doing it? Kethane is a great mod. Any feature added to the game to mimic it would just do that: mimic it. There would be no further extension NOW to what Kethane already does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe major trend on development is currently the career mode as career should be heavily depending on resources. So - jsut imagine for a second - you would have to get a certain element for R\u0026amp;D, you need uranium for RTGs or silicates for improving SAS. Oxygen, Methane, etc for creating fueles... endless opportuneties. But you need to have a start. And that would be implementing R\u0026amp;D... and maybe career as you could sell material to get funds.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, and imho only then, a built in resource system could be superior to what Kethane adds to the game. And therefore worth to code. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong story short:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would just be patient. The game is at version .21 right now. Thats a long way from the big 1.0 AND possible DLCs. Also decisions on the staff seem to change often and swift, so its hard to always follow the way the devs think.. but normally, if you try to, you end up seeing that the path they walk down makes sense. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA shameless self ad: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/45945-The-evolution-of-KSP\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/45945-The-evolution-of-KSP\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI try to put new features into bigger context.

Apparently they thought \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lGlWdyn.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E was a little too complex for people. It honestly isn\u0027t. I\u0027ve said it before, all they\u0027d need to do is introduce just a couple elements at a time so we can wrap our heads around them THEN lay the mining and processing down on us in a similar fashion. Or something like that. It\u0027d be easy with their tech tree madness that they\u0027ve got planned. They could even add \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E complexity to the system and as long as they took us through it at a gradual rate via career mode...it would be perfectly fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I feel that they might actually hold off on releasing those systems for an expansion after KSP1.0 is released. Of course, that\u0027s all based on what they \u003Cem\u003Esaid\u003C/em\u003E. Those features will be huge and game changing, almost like an entirely new game in itself, so that would really fit the definition that they laid out for expansions or DLC. What they feel those things should be. They might even add deep colonization to that expansion to make it even more substantial.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm...at the same time, I think that they might not do expansions after all. I mean, it made a LOT of people angry. On the flip side to that, they \u003Cem\u003Edid\u003C/em\u003E guarantee that anyone who purchased the game before the end of april were guaranteed all future updates and expansions for free. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI honestly don\u0027t know what they\u0027re planning. What they\u0027re going to do. But I got the game right in the middle...or near the end of April, I think. On Steam, so I\u0027d honestly be okay either way XD\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also feel that they kind of deserve the right to put out an expansion like that. Or rather, to hold resource prospecting, collecting, mining and deep colonization for an expansion. Maybe they\u0027ll hold off FTL and that whole other star systems thing for an expansion, too! I really wouldn\u0027t mind that, though if I hadn\u0027t gotten the game before the end of April I wouldn\u0027t really be able to afford those expansions, unless they offered a compilation at a steep discount or something. I don\u0027t know, but I do know that they put a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E of thought into each and every update and every major feature so I feel that they deserve a little extra reward for doing so. If I had the money for it, I\u0027d buy KSP for all of my friends, even the ones that wouldn\u0027t necessarily play it just so that SQUAD could have a little extra cash for their efforts. They\u0027re certainly treating us better than most publishers and developers who put out sixty dollar games. So they deserve a little somethin\u0027 on top of their already really positive reputation and their undoubtedly substantial payout from sales thusfar.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nachtwind","CreatedById":41015,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T15:04:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Beeman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Beeman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat said, I feel that they might actually hold off on releasing those systems for an expansion after KSP1.0 is released.

Just remember - KSP is roughly 1/5th of the way to a final version! And some changes just need preparation. Take, for example, the evolution of rovers. SQUAD started with this Plane-like wheel, added in a later update brakes to it and then probe bodies and later still the rover chassis/bodies. Where would have been the benefit to have a rover chassis without wheels? Or reaction wheels without SAS functionality? Spaceplanes without a drag model? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake it as evolution: You dont have \u0022No Eye\u0022 and then a fully evolved \u0022Hawk eye\u0022 - more importantly you dont have \u0022Half an eye\u0022 in between. Every step inbetween, as small and as insignificant it seems, serves a purpose to the final result. Same is for features - there would be no use for just some halfhearted attempt on resources as long as better solutions are available through the modding community. Therefore the preparations have to be done to create something bigger and better that will then just be \u0022done\u0022 at some point. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike i said, finding fuel and using it to fly arround is simple as you can install kethane. But if you need uranium to develop (SQUAD needs to program R\u0026amp;D first) RTGs (QUAD had to develop \u0022electricity\u0022 as fuel first), Element Zero for Heat Shields (SQUAD has to develop reentry effects first) or metal to build fairing (Fairings had to be programmed first, the VAB has to work, you need Money or funds (has to be programmed...) and THEN you can have a resource system superior to what mods provide.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leax256","CreatedById":57364,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T16:25:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nachtwind\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nachtwind\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou might argue the same way about Career mode, (space)Planes, Modding ability or pretty much every feature that is planned up until 1.0. ...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etis why I take what I get and don\u0027t complain...well said.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beeman","CreatedById":28178,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T18:52:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nachtwind\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nachtwind\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou might argue the same way about Career mode, ...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou actually \u003Cem\u003Ecouldn\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E say that about career mode because...as I understand it, career mode has been the goal of KSP from the get-go. But sandbox was required to get the core gameplay mechanics(building, launching rockets and doing things in space) up and running and well tested.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat we can almost certainly expect KSP1.0 to contain is at least everything that modern space programs are capable of. Missions that have already flown and been successful. That includes probes, minimalistic manned missions, rovers, spaceplanes/shuttles(only because they\u0027re already in the game), station building, telescopes and other such things with all the great career mode goodies layered on top of all that. I mean, we already have just about all the parts we \u003Cem\u003Eneed\u003C/em\u003E to make KSP a playable game with an engaging career mode...and you can expect career mode to feel grand and compelling like a tycoon game, which has been said to be the ultimate goal of KSP\u0027s career mode. How they\u0027ll change that as they actually develop it is beyond me, but I\u0027m excited either way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll we really need from this point on is career mode stuff. Granted, we know that they\u0027ve got at least one year left of development time given their own estimates plus a few months \u0027cause you can never predict how long it\u0027s going to take to iron out some things. But they only really need a few more major patches and they could release KSP as a full-on game. They\u0027ve almost got R\u0026amp;D in the bag, we just need currency, missions, the full-on knowledgebase, lots more sciency bits, hopefully life support and other such career-only mechanics. Everything else is icing on top and could very well be left off for expansions...and all I was saying was that I\u0027d personally be okay with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I would obviously \u003Cem\u003Eprefer\u003C/em\u003E much more complex systems in the vanilla game, I even mentioned that I\u0027d like to see \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E resources than what they showed in that flow chart. Things like different metals for part construction or rare elements/metals that you could deliver back to KSC for straight income and little else, if anything. I\u0027d love to see all kinds of fun mechanics creep their way into the vanilla game but there\u0027s no telling what they\u0027re going to do because talking about expansions made a lot of people angry...but they honestly felt like that would be the best option for them to ensure that KSP finally gets finished.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe all love KSP very much so and only want to see the vanilla experience expand and expand, but there\u0027s got to be a limit for KSP1.0 and I feel like that\u0027s all they were feeling when they talked about expansions and/or DLC stuff. But what they\u0027re almost guaranteed to implement is all the stuff that KSP was intended to do in the first place...which is to provide a space \u003Cem\u003Eprogram\u003C/em\u003E simulation/tycoon experience that all sorts of people can enjoy and might actually make people learn a thing or two about space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nachtwind","CreatedById":41015,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T20:21:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs this discussion seems to be about you convincing me that SQUAD will add resources in a DLC and me about convincing you that SQUAD will release resources in the vanilla game i can only quote HAL9000:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Beeman, this conversation can serve no purpose anymore.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beeman","CreatedById":28178,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T21:26:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot at all, my opinion is that it doesn\u0027t matter what they do.
