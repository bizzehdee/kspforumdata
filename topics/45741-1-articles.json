Control-clicking (or whatever) a part would toggle a lock on it and all other parts between it and the command pod.

The OP is suggesting that in the future, you could create locked subassemblies within active craft in the editors. Rather than just working with the assembly without the rest of the craft, you can import a subassembly, lock it, and then do the same for a few more, After that, you can work with massive modular craft and lifters with relative ease as they behave as a single part in the editor until it is unlocked, which could be done by grabbing it, using the lock key again (alt \u002B G would be good) and then reattach it. Now, its however many parts it really is.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T09:12:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHaving some ships as \u0022historical\u0022 or \u0022built\u0022 could work as well. Recovered ships would be limited to their current design only, with additions. Just as the ships in orbit can be docked, but cannot be modified. This way you could have a reusable ship similar to the space shuttle that can have minour additions, but for a full change would require the dollars of cost for a total rebuild?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KrazyKrl","CreatedById":65849,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T19:32:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHaving locked assemblies would be neat. You could recover an assembly from somewhere, and use it as an entire assembly. They could automagically appear in the sub-assembly library.
