If they are to be toggle-able, why not just leave them mods?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI completely agree. I play with a lot of visual enhancement mods and plugins, while adding very few new parts, but someone else could love new parts and add tonnes of those to the game. That\u0027s one of the great things about KSP, that you can customize the game to such a degree, and everyone\u0027s experience is different in some small way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
