But what if I wanted each fin to attach twice symmetrically on a single booster, meaning the symmetry is around the booster itself?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if I\u0027m bringing my point across clearly, but basically I want to know if/how this can be done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacePi","CreatedById":143554,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T20:58:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUse only 1 booster, customize that.
