I asked this question on some github forums but I\u0027m not getting answers and I\u0027m still lost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe situation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the first issue: I am not the project owner but am trying to contribute small changes to the project. I made my own github fork of the project, then fetched that to a local copy on my own computer, made my changes there, committed them, and pushe them back to my own github fork, and made the pull request for it. This worked fine. The author said it may be a few days before that pull request gets merged in with the main project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I also tried to fix a second issue. I made the code changes in my local copy to perform those changes and tested them locally and it all looks good. But now when I try to commit and push those changes back to my github fork, they keep getting assigned to my previous pull request. How do I stop my future commits from being applied to that previous pull request (that\u0027s still pending) and instead apply them to a second pull request meant to be applied after my previous pull request?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-06T08:04:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s going to merge them into a single pull request no matter what.
