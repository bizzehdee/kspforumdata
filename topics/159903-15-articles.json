Sorry for not making that clear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNozzle area ratio is a function of pressure drop ratio.

An engine with a much higher chamber pressure has less of a pressure drop between SL and vacuum, and so the nozzles will be closer in size.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll that to say: if the BE-3 was a low-chamber-pressure engine, then we would expect to see a very large vacuum nozzle in comparison to the SL nozzle.
