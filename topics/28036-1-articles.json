Usually the heaviest section of a plane that is low on fuel (and this is the case when returning/landing) is the engines, esp. if you use many engines. The solution is to redistribute the lift surfaces to cope with the weight of a \u0022dry\u0022 plane. It\u0027s better to have a plane that can land easily but struggles to achieve orbit, than to have a plane that orbits easily but is hopeless when flying \u0022dry\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA possibility is using tanks arranged side by side rather than in-line. That way the CoM shift is less pronounced because most of the mass stays in the same place. Here are the only two succesfull designs (out of 40\u002B) that i can consistently orbit and land. They both have most of the weight towards the rear and the smaller one has wings behind the engines. That made the biggest difference for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s15.postimg.org/kg6w0630r/screenshot319.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot319.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s23.postimg.org/q928gyji3/screenshot334.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot334.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s23.postimg.org/me3fs4pq3/screenshot394.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot394.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general there should be just enough lift to take off even if you have to fly off the runway to do it, otherwise the plane will kick like a mule once it\u0027s empty. Again, i\u0027m happier once i can actually land the plane easily and only need to figure out how (much to airhog) to achieve orbit. Spaceplanes are very frustrating, and very hit-and-miss.
