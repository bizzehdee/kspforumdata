Despite this, the ports aren\u0027t connecting. It\u0027s as if there\u0027s an invisible layer between them holding them apart at 0.4 m. The ships are now held together magnetically and in stable orbit over the mun, but I can\u0027t transfer my crew to get home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I\u0027ve docked in the past successfully.

The perspective on your screenshot doesn\u0027t show very well the clearance from the side of your engine bells to the side of the cargo bay, but it looks like your service bay has to slide in between them a little bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe physical boundaries of parts in KSP don\u0027t always coincide with the art as seen in the game. Some parts have collision surfaces well outside of the part of the model that you can see. As I understand it, the newest version of the Unity platform that KSP runs on doesn\u0027t allow any concave surfaces without the addition of extra shapes to the model. So, for the sake of simplicity and better performance some corners get cut, literally. Those areas at the top of the engine bell probably aren\u0027t really pinched in if you could see the invisible parts of the mesh model. It would be more like a truncated cone with the top chopped off -- the wide end at the top (base) of the engine butt and the smaller end at the exhaust nozzle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis wasn\u0027t a problem when you launched because KSP doesn\u0027t calculate collisions for parts on the same vessel, and as long as it was docked together it was treated all as one. Now though they are two ships and will bump into each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe best solution at this point is as the others have said. EVA your Kerbals from the lander, don\u0027t forget to collect any science you have from it, and float them over to your return ship. On your next design iteration try to leave a little more room between parts that are going to be in close proximity when docking. And it\u0027s sometimes fun to take a page out of NASA\u0027s book and test the docking mechanism in near orbit before starting the long trip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-09T03:42:25Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2017 03:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by HvP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-09T03:45:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt might be worth saving, then using the lander to set the whole thing on a reentry course if you\u0027re able.\u00A0 That lets you just timewarp and let things drift apart.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
