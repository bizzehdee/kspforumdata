I have actually seen people do similar things to this before. Reach orbit by only pressing the space bar, reach the Mun by only pressing the space bar. They\u0027re interesting to see and tend to involve very clever engineering to pull off. Duna is much more difficult because of the interplanetary transfer but I very much doubt it\u0027s impossible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs someone who\u0027s reasonably experienced with running challenges, I would, however, suggest a couple of things:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nLook at other challenge threads\u00A0on the forums to get an idea of what works well and what doesn\u0027t. This is a simple challenge (in terms of the level of detail required to understand the goal) so take a look at how other challenges like that are run.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTry your own challenge (or at least something similar) before posting about it. With complicated challenges (such as my Doing It Constellation Style challenge) it can be enough to do a simpler mission a few times to have a good understanding of what\u0027s required to expand upon it for the complex challenge goals. For this challenge though, you probably should try the full task of going to Duna and back by only pressing the space bar. Since it allows no room for error and no fine maneuvering, it\u0027s going to be incredibly difficult, so you should try it yourself to get an idea of whether it\u0027s even reasonable to do (or, if it is doable, whether the satisfaction of doing it is worth the effort of fine-tuning your spacecraft as much as the challenge would need).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTry a couple of other, similar challenges to get an idea of how challenges in general work, and what works best.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"}]}
