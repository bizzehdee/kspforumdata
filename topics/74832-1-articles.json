OK fine it was funded about the same time the ouya was so got drowns out by that thing. Still it has funding and even though there were delays its a thing. Friend of mine owns one. I\u0027ve got one on order.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does console emulation ranging from 8 bit Atari up to the 16 bit era (it could do PlayStation and Dreamcast but not a lot of effort is going there so while proof of concept emulation is a thing it isn\u0027t very good.) I don\u0027t advocate software piracy but there are some interesting homebrew titles out there and hacks that turn what was commercial material into something so different it might as well be original. Emulation is a thing. Like it, don\u0027t... Its there even if all you want to do is stick to the open source/homebrew software.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk fine it emulates stuff so what? Completely open toolchain based on Linux, has SDL 2 (though 1.2 is more stable at this point) and some other standardized libraries like python.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are also a few doom ports (odamex and chocolate are the two that come to mind,) as well as eduke32, decent, quake, and an assortment of homebrew games like powder, dink Smallwood, blockrage, open born, streets of rage remake, and other stuff being developed. The key here is its an open console anyone can do stuff for. Want to be gonzo and port abiword to it and bang out a draft on your handheld plugged into a TV with a computer plunged into its OTG adapter? You can! What about dosbox? Already done! And yes it will run the original dungeon keeper. Poorly but it runs!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has WiFi, an fm radio, tilt sensor (nice for playing decent), HDMI and av out (sorta kinda not working all the way but eh. Give it time, its supposedly almost done.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://gcw-zero.com\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://gcw-zero.com\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMain page and also leads to store links if you want to buy one from thinkgeek or other non us based retailers.

I mean that would be kinda nice but I\u0027d rather roughly the same hardware configuration with a duel or possibly even a quad core design with maybe a few more buttons to make PlayStation/Dreamcast/n64 less of a chore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill. Even though the kickstarter was early last year it\u0027s only been getting traction this year. And I really don\u0027t want to have iteration after iteration after iteration going so fast the guys that got the first ones won\u0027t wonder if they should have held out for next year\u0027s model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the nice thing about consoles vs PC: platform uniformity. You program!/test for a spec and that\u0027s what it\u0027ll be like for everyone barring some kind of bad juju pissed off spirit or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m personally more interested in homebrew and engine ports than in the emulated stuff. Sure I\u0027m going to look through emulators because it\u0027s sort of amazing what romhavks exist, but come on, I like native titles. They\u0027re nifty.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
