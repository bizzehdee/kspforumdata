But I\u0027ll show my work.\n\nWell first off, jets won\u0027t work so you are stuck with rockets. Let\u0027s suppose you came up with a crazy spaceplane that uses LV-N engines (Isp=800). You need 12,000 m/s delta V to get to orbit from sea level. Let\u0027s say you launch from a high mountain, and only need 9000. The Tsiolkovski equation gives,\n\ndV=g\\*Isp\\*ln(mass\\_full/mass\\_empty)\n\n9000=9.81\\*800\\*ln(m\\_f/m\\_e)\n\n1.14=ln(m\\_f/m\\_e)\n\nexp(1.14) = mass\\_full/mass\\_empty\n\nmass\\_full/mass\\_empty = 3.13\n\nSo your ship would need to be 68% fuel at takeoff. \n\nNow, working around a single LV-N with 60kN of thrust and a mass of 2.25t. Let\u0027s assume your wings, control systems, and cockpit are all massless. Rocket fuel tanks have a full to empty ratio of 9:1. \n\nRecalling we need an overall full to empty ratio of 3.13: looks like you need thirteen FL-T100 to get that ratio (or the equivalent). That gives a total takeoff mass of 9.56t and an empty mass of 3.06t.\n\nBUT that 9.56t of mass weighs 159.7kN on Eve! (9.56t\\*16.7m/s2) And your LV-N only has 60kN of thrust. I don\u0027t think any wings made can lift you very high with a thrust to weight ratio that poor, before you run out of fuel. Especially the massless ones I just loaned you. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) And then you still have to get to orbit when your wings stop working--not trivial with a TWR much less than 1.\n\nSimilar problem if you use a higher thrust, lower specific impulse engine like the aerospike. That exercise I leave to the reader ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nFor calculations like the one I just made, crack open a physics text and/or refer to this excellent guide: [http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Cheat_sheet](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Cheat_sheet)"},{"CreatedByName":"Lohan2008","CreatedById":80945,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T03:37:17Z","Content":"Simple answer is NO."},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T11:24:50Z","Content":"A legit stock Eve SSTO is impossible in KSP .90, but that may change in 1.0.\n\n The only way to get close is by using ion engines on a glider.

The problem with that concept is that your heli \u0022stage\u0022 must be able to lift itself and the rocket stage into high enough atmo, and at the same time your rocket stage needs to be able to lift itself and the heli \u0022stage\u0022 from high atmo into orbit. Electric helicopters barely have enough power to lift themselves in 1 atm, much less a rocket stage big enough to achieve orbit around Eve from that altitude.\n\nIon planes are probably a better choice, though they do face the same problem. I\u0027m certainly interested to see people try whatever is on their mind.\n\nAnd remember, gentlemen, that dropping any parts disqualifies the vessel as an SSTO. Reaching orbit with a kerbal EVA makes the craft Single Stage to Suborbital at best (impressive as well, but not as prestigious). And using FAR certainly doesn\u0027t count as stock (at least until KSP 1.0).\n\nThe first person to achieve a truly stock and exploitless Eve SSTO (if anyone ever makes it) is bound to become a KSP legend.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-18T22:22:30Z\u0022 title=\u002203/18/2015 10:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Deutherius**"},{"CreatedByName":"jarmund","CreatedById":126888,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T22:45:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E *...snip...* it does stretch my imagination for the suit to protect the wearer for that long in such a tough environment.\n\nI\u0027m using TAC Life Support, so i let the mod worry about the realism.
