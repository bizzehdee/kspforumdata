The only thing that will change, is where the hardpoints is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW. If what you did was when added a cylinder and added 3 meter in the radius, you will get 6 meter in dia.

Blender is not easy to learn if you have experience with other 3d software. And the prize of 3d studio max is huge in my opinion, I have a topic here \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=10045.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=10045.0\u003C/a\u003E where you can ask of help on blender. I will try to help as much as I can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the reason why it is to big. Is that when you add that 3 meters, it will be 6 meter in diameter. That is why you have the model to big. Remember when you set scale in the size, you have to add it as half the size. Because it is radius. Not diameter. so for right scale for 3 meter in diameter. You should add 1.5 meter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-12T15:18:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERemember RADIUS is the distance from the center of a circle to any point on the circumference (outer edge)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDIAMETER Is the distance from opposite points on the circumference (the line crosses the center) and is basically the radius X 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBlender asks for the radius of the top face of a cylinder (and the \\\u0027wide face\\\u0027 of a cone) when making one, so you just divide the desired diameter by 2:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 meter cylinders: 0.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.75m cylinders: 0.875\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2m cylinders: (I\\\u0027m not even gonna bother telling you this one.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3m cylinders: 1.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand so on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"teacherboi","CreatedById":19774,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-12T17:41:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELOLOLOLOLOL\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETalk about a \u0027DOH\u0027 moment!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, thank you Tiberion and Anariaq for your help!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERadius... and I\\\u0027m going to be a teacher!
