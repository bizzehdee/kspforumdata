The import showed me that the model is 6 meter in diameter. If you could upload the .blend file I could check out what is going on.\n\nEDIT:\n\nshould add that the scale in the CFG, will not affect the scale of the model in KSP. The only thing that will change, is where the hardpoints is.\n\nBTW. If what you did was when added a cylinder and added 3 meter in the radius, you will get 6 meter in dia. So the model will be twice as large. Just for info. when you add a cube it is 2x2x2 meter, so you can check if the scale fits."},{"CreatedByName":"teacherboi","CreatedById":19774,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-12T14:52:51Z","Content":"Ok, here is the actual .blend file.\n\nWhat I did was I added a cylinder and in the dialog box on the left hand side where it shows the rotation, number of faces, etc. I set the size to 3 meters (default is one meter).\n\nI have to say, I\\\u0027m really trying to get my head around blender.

Blender is not easy to learn if you have experience with other 3d software. And the prize of 3d studio max is huge in my opinion, I have a topic here [http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=10045.0](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=10045.0) where you can ask of help on blender. I will try to help as much as I can.\n\nAnd the reason why it is to big. Is that when you add that 3 meters, it will be 6 meter in diameter. That is why you have the model to big. Remember when you set scale in the size, you have to add it as half the size. Because it is radius. Not diameter. so for right scale for 3 meter in diameter. You should add 1.5 meter."},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-12T15:18:47Z","Content":"Remember RADIUS is the distance from the center of a circle to any point on the circumference (outer edge)\n\nDIAMETER Is the distance from opposite points on the circumference (the line crosses the center) and is basically the radius X 2\n\nBlender asks for the radius of the top face of a cylinder (and the \\\u0027wide face\\\u0027 of a cone) when making one, so you just divide the desired diameter by 2:\n\n1 meter cylinders: 0.5\n\n1.75m cylinders: 0.875\n\n2m cylinders: (I\\\u0027m not even gonna bother telling you this one.)\n\n3m cylinders: 1.5\n\nand so on."},{"CreatedByName":"teacherboi","CreatedById":19774,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-12T17:41:12Z","Content":"LOLOLOLOLOL\n\nTalk about a \u0027DOH\u0027 moment!\n\nOk, thank you Tiberion and Anariaq for your help!\n\nRadius... and I\\\u0027m going to be a teacher!
