As soon as the colony is big anough and can produce most of its own stuff, the need some internal economy system (I know there is disagreement how big such a colony has to be or whether this is possible at all, but if it is not possible there will be no colony in the long run and I try to answer what a colony could sell. I also would discuss whether it is possible, but not in this thread). For the daily live, people on Mars would use some Mars currency for which they buy stuff produced on Mars. Nevertheless there would be some exchange between Mars and Earth currency, be it because some people find it cool to own 25 Mars bucks or some people want to trade something and need the other currency. If people on Mars can build rockets and deliver stuff to Earth, they can earn Earth money, even if they sell stuff that can be produced easily on Earth. Then Earth bound production would be a lot less complicated for the same goods an more profitable. But if the marslings strongly desire Earth money for some Earth goods, they would do it nevertheless. So something will be exported on the long run from Mars to Earth. But then of course it would be something where they get the most money per effort.
