I intend to add the RT2 support through one .cfg file not unlike how RT2 modifies stock. These won\u0027t have the :FINAL parameter. They\u0027ll add MODULE[ModuleRTAntenna] node to the dozen or so parts that need RT2 support. The second .cfg will be the one that adds the standard bits to all the pieces such as the MODULE[ModuleDataTransmitter] node and will have the :FINAL parameter. Now, in this file on some parts I want it to add the ModuleDataTransmitter node only if there is no MODULE[ModuleRTAntenna]. My question:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can see that you can use wildcards when modifying nodes, but the syntax doesn\u0027t seem to allow you to do that when creating them. I could create two entries in the file, one which only modifies the part if the ModuleRTAntenna node isn\u0027t present, and then the second that does all of the other bits, but I\u0027d prefer to have it all together. I think this is my best option - 3 modifications to the part. First adds RT2 support, non-final. Second checks for RT2 support, final, processes after the RT2 one. Third (in same file as second) applies to anything without tech tree and applies it, also final. The last two can go in either order, so having them both process in the 2nd pass is fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERT2 file: @PART[Dishcl1] {}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAIES file: @PART[Dishcl1]:HAS[!MODULE[ModuleRTAntenna]]:Final {}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAIES file: @PART[Dishcl1]:HAS[~TechRequired[]]:Final {}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Does 2 :FINAL node edits cause one to be blocked, or do they all process just fine. That is, does :FINAL simply signal what pass to do the modification in?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Is there a simpler way to process this? I want to keep the RT2 one clean like RT2 does, so I don\u0027t really want to invert the order. My expectation is that Carmics will get TechRequired added and that last element will simply disappear, but the RT2 one may always be needed. Not sure if that support will get built in either by Carmics or by Cilph.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) What does the # signify in the expression? Is that necessary to indicate that it\u0027s a property and not a node?
