I was running out of dV on my way back so I basically got into a large eliptical orbit, and then dipped the periapsis into the atmosphere to try and aerobrake it in. I takes 3 laps to get the speed down enough that I\u0027m definitely going to splash down. On the final lap, when I\u0027m at about 12000m and my speed has dropped to around 600m/s, my chutes suddenly deploy and disintegrate. There doesn\u0027t appear to be any reason for this, the atmospheric re-entry effects are dissipating and I\u0027m shedding heat. Why is it happening? It\u0027s very frustrating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XLdU648.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022XLdU648.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-12T05:00:33Z\u0022 title=\u002201/12/2016 05:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 12, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by KerBlam\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-12T04:56:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you using stock or mod chutes?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf stock, they should never deploy until you stage them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWere they cyan colour before you entered the atmosphere?
