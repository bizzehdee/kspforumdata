I\u0027ll go and get it real quickly.\n\n(Hopefully this should be more entertaining than the previous entries).\n\n![33569B686D86E5F4D51278319EE09AF5769F901B](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/621848412057775636/33569B686D86E5F4D51278319EE09AF5769F901B/)\n\nThis is a NAFA-18-E1 Caracal, a still unreleased update to my older NAFA-18-C model. It is a VTOL fighter which uses 2 turbojets to hover and another turbojet for forward flight. It can hover quite well, and even zip around the space center quite well just hovering (it is quite fun). The aircraft does feature an ejection seat, which works by detaching the sides of the cockpit and then launching the pilot and his seat out of the aircraft.\n\nOne day, I was test flying the aircraft over the space center in VTOL mode, at an altitude maybe 2/3rds of the way up the VAB, fairly close to the research center. I decide to switch to forward flight mode. After a sequence of events, this happens:\n\n![08497CE6A73CB2E1886BAE334610E2592B90332A](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/621848412055722322/08497CE6A73CB2E1886BAE334610E2592B90332A/)\n\nCan you figure out what happened?\n\nHint: the incident can be attributed to pilot error.\n\nHint 2: I highly recommend paying close attention to the picture rather than taking a quick glance at it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-22T18:02:35Z\u0022 title=\u002208/22/2015 06:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Noname117**"},{"CreatedByName":"FireFaced","CreatedById":141290,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-26T14:05:03Z","Content":"Looks like you crashed into one of the buildings due to your switch to forward flight mode, then tried going VTOL to save yourself but it was too late."},{"CreatedByName":"Noname117","CreatedById":53624,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-26T14:16:19Z","Content":"Not really what happened.
