It is a VTOL fighter which uses 2 turbojets to hover and another turbojet for forward flight. It can hover quite well, and even zip around the space center quite well just hovering (it is quite fun). The aircraft does feature an ejection seat, which works by detaching the sides of the cockpit and then launching the pilot and his seat out of the aircraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne day, I was test flying the aircraft over the space center in VTOL mode, at an altitude maybe 2/3rds of the way up the VAB, fairly close to the research center.
