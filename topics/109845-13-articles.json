I\u0027ve been using the wiki docs on its github page. I think those are pretty old and a bit rough. But as they\u0027re on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E github page, they\u0027re official, so I use them, even if they do seem a bit sparse to me. Is there any other source of info/docs, or is that it?\n\u003E \n\nI cobbled what I know together from the forum post / \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E release thread. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E syntax is byzantine and unusual at first, because it builds on top of KSP\u0027s equally NIH cfg syntax, but once you get going it\u0027s not that bad, particularly with \u0022modern\u0022 extensions like nested operators and variables."},{"CreatedByName":"VladP53","CreatedById":103604,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-31T22:12:00Z","Content":"That\u0027s quite nice mod.
