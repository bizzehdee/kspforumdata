I\u0027ve had the mod working just fine with the game since .21 came out, I have the most up to date version of the game and the mod. Mechjeb just stopped working all of a sudden. The tab on the right side of the screen no longer appears when I attach the mechjeb part to a craft. I tried reverting my game folder to it\u0027s original state, didn\u0027t work; I tried the patch version on this thread as well as the version found at the Spaceport. I have changed nothing, it just decided to stop working. Has anybody had a problem similar to this? This has never happened to me with mechjeb or any other mod.
