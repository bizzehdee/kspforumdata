Inspired by the Viking program I launch an unmanned mission to Mars. The vehicles are not reproductions, just similar solutions using real hardware available to me at the appropriate point in a career game. This is launched after I achieved Lunar orbit but before any Lunar landings, so pretty early tech, though a few bits of hardware are available that i\u0027ve chased down and might not have been in service at the time (I have nice SRBs). My vehicles are quite a bit heavier than Viking, im still getting used to designing for interplanetary RSS, this thing turns out a little over-fueled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVagabond I\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1,800 tonnes!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11,632 dV Atmos / 18,199 Vac\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E99,000 Kredits, all lost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E91 parts inc clamps and stagerecovery chutes (which are insufficient anyway)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll seemed set for \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112862-Project-Prometheus-RSS-RO-Lunar-Direct-Ascent\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EProject Prometheus\u003C/a\u003E, as the Kerbals had dubbed their nascent Lunar program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engineers began to design a small scientific probe lander that could make the first touchdown off Earth in preparation for a manned follow-up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would carry a shortranged aerial for communications with the Lunar ring alongside a series of experiments; the ubiquitous thermometer, a magnetometer and a new device developed especially for the mission, a Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons designed to detect traces of Hydrogen on the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA small backup battery provides power through the Lunar night and a cluster of flat surface panels allow for recharging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander was fueled with Aerozine50/NTO running through three 1kN orbital thrusters. The new throttling descent engine was not utilised as the engineers found it bulky and difficult to design around. Descent-plan therefore would be a series of arrested falls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA canister of MMH/NTO was included as an RCS system with significant performance gains over the older HTP systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally a quartet of landing legs allow touchdown without risking the delicate engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander comes out within the range of acceptable payloads for a Maul launcher, calculations indicate that a 2.5 ton transfer stage is needed to get the payload in low lunar orbit without touching its fuel and the vehicle is modified slightly to account for this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, as the Kerbals set about constructing the Lunar Lander they notice that Mars is coming into alignment...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mission is hastily redesignated to Vagabond I. New profile, unmanned Martian landing, this is deemed far more scientifically interesting as Mars is a much better candidate for the DAN.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Lunar lander is repurposed, very few changes are made beyond the addition of an array of parachutes, both drogue and main. The engines dont make TWR 1.0 on Mars, not until nearly empty, but should be able to cushion what the chutes dont deal with. Or thats the idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Lander module is now also accompanied by an Orbiter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis carries a fixed high-gain dish and an omni-directional antenna for its role as relay, in addition to a RADAR altimeter to map the Martian surface in preperation for landing. It also features independant RCS, battery and solar power in order to be sustainable after Lander seperation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Orbiter section, like the Lander, uses Aerozine50/NTO as fuel, burned in a AJ10-118K service module engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission profile calls for the two craft to arrive at the red planet together, where the Orbiter establishes a stable highly-inclined orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile both craft run science experiments from this situation the RADAR maps and landing sites are selected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft separate and the Landing module de-orbits, parachutes and soft lands. Surface Science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is hoped that the Orbiter will have enough fuel at this point to perform a flyby of one of the Martian moons before returning to its relay position. (ed: while the craft is all mine, built with what I have available, this is basically a copy/paste of NASA\u0027s Viking mission profile. The DAN experiment also went to Mars in reality, though not until Curiosity.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECombined weight of the Orbiter/Lander is a staggering 21 tonnes, the pad-weight of the old Javelin 4\u0027s. Maul has a fit even at the idea of launching Vagabond I, a new launch vehicle is needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERather than factor in a dedicated transfer stage for Martian Injection it is decided to use a combination of the launch vehicle topstage and the Orbiter dV to accomplish this burn. The Orbiter has been designed with 4k dV but probably only needs 1250 or so to capture around Mars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe old RL10 topstage of previous vehicles is discarded as underpowered, the new J2 engine, which performs in the same role is selected in its place, still burning cryogenic Hydrolox.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is stretched until it covers both final circularisation at Earth and 75% of the Martian Injection (Geosynch give-or-take) at which point the Orbiter itself will take over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELifting the J2 is the tried and tested LR-87-7 burning hypergolics assisted by two of the largest SRBs ever concieved, ATK L.S.G 5-segment LRSRMs. (ed: lengthened Shuttle SRB, as used in the SLS).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SRBs are somewhat overpowered, even with this load to push and the LR-87-7 is lit on the pad, shut down around 20km and then not relit until SRB burnout (shortly after reaching vacuum). This manages SRB burnout Gs and stretches the delta-V overall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/YNwYp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

(The SRBs survive re-entry but hit at 45ms and are lost, chutes too small) Having been idle for most of the ascent its a little underpowered (over-fueled) but the Kerbals compensate by lofting the payload a little higher to buy time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 87-7 finally exhausts its hypergolics and falls away to burn up, the J2 ignites to finish the orbit at 350x350.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/1G3Fb\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Lander detaches, opens link through the Orbiter and burns 540 of its 2,100ms dV for Phobos flyby. Orbiter continues to aerobrake. Lowering from initial capture has taken only a small amount of RCS propellant to maintain aerobrake altitude, but has taken a long time. A range of southern hemisphere upper atmospheric and low space readings are taken during successive 6 minute passes at 85km above the midlands, major craters, lowlands and olympus mons.

The Lander module performs a very high-speed flyby of the innermost satellite, the two passing each other in opposite directions. The magnetometer proves the the small moon is not in fact a hollow iron sphere launched by Martians. (ed: a serious theory once, discredited by the time of Viking which finally laid it to rest. Phobos is a clump of rubble.

TWR is still below 1, but it takes the edge off and nothing bursts into flames yet. Still looking good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E29km, disaster. RCS depleted.

The last two braking burns fire prograde and try to turn Lander into Impactor. Thankfully the wussy atmosphere of Mars prevents them making things too much worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E18km, yeah, this wont go well.

Craft starts to decelerate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0km Touchdown at 13.3ms, craft bounces a little and one leg is damaged but has been fortunate enough to come down on a pretty flat plain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(ed: lucky as anything, the fact that my burns ran anyway lightened the craft enough to get it down dead-stick with 4/5 chutes. Cant believe I forgot to arm the nosechute. RealChutes is awesome. Science gains from the entire mission amount to almost 3,000. By making so many atmospheric passes with the combined ship I was able to run full suites on the upper atmosphere of almost the entire southern tropical band. I got no atmospheric readings in flight during landing however as I forgot to program them into the descent routine, and would have missed anyway based on my timing. The landing itself yields around 600, Phobos flyby and various high/low Mars adds its chunk and I end up with a 55% RADAR map which yields a bit more. Busts open the mid-section of my tech-tree and gives me the docking ports I so longed for. My main regret is not taking screenshots of the landing chaos. Even though I wasnt flying and had plenty of time I just plain forgot, though it was also night.
