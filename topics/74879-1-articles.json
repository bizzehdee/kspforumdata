The legal stuff that would go down would be very bad for both Squad and the SE creators. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus, there is no way to link the games even if the legal stuff was greenlighted. You can\u0027t craft a KSP part in SE then have a plugin transfer it into KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if you want a Refinery in KSP that makes components and you use those components to make the parts like engines, command pod, and everything else, that would be kool. In fact, would add more realism to the game. Go out and mine metals to make components to make parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-13T06:33:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, so instead of Extraplanetary Launchpads where the whole ship is magically created once you have enough resources to build it, you use KAS to connect all the individual parts.
