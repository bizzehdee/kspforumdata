I\u0027ll also be using several mods including TAC life support, DRE, FAR, and RLA stock alike. (the extra RCS options seem like they could be a huge help) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure others have done this sort of thing, so my questions for you is how doable was it and was it fun? I know using early sub-orbital flights to pick up control (for the winglets) and fuel for RCS thrusters will be pretty much essential. I did one flight in sandbox recently disallowing myself the use of reaction wheels and that was pretty fun. Managing my monopropellant as I landed on the moon and making sure I had enough for my return was interesting. Does that sort of thing get old/overly difficult on larger scale missions though?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway just thought I\u0027d share and see what some of my peers think about the matter, thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deathsoul097","CreatedById":77396,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-27T03:53:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEarly flights will be completely unsteer-able, unless you plan on using about 4 different LF engines and manually throttling them using tweakables, and RCS and thrusters are really far down the tree.
