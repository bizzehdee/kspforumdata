They\u0027re boards with nice edges. The Big-S series of wings, however, has varying thicknesses and a much more dynamic profile. They taper to the wingtip, and have a thicker airfoil, several times thicker than the standard wings. I know this thickness is probably meant to model the fuel capacity and look nice with larger planes, but I\u0027m curious if there are any other aerodynamic effects of the dimensions that distinguish them from their early-tech-tree cousins.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nDo Big-S wings have higher drag (like they would, intuitively, judging by their size)? Do they produce more lift at low speeds than a standard wing constructed to the same planform shape? Do they produce more lift at the wing root than at the wing tip? Heck, does it stall at the wing root first? ...or is it just a different-looking standard wing that you can fill with fuel?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThose of you with more programming experience than me (i.e., x\u0026gt;0) would probably\u00A0be able to navigate the part file or aero model to see any differences, so besides\u00A0designing and flying\u00A0a carefully controlled flight test experiment, I can\u0027t answer these questions as well as you guys can.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AeroGav","CreatedById":152027,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-11T20:37:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, \u00A0all aerodynamic surfaces have the same lift to drag ratio at the same mach number and angle of attack. \u00A0 Every wing piece is identical, the only difference is in lift rating (wing area) . \u00A0A wing or control surface with a lift rating of 1 will produce twice as much lift and twice as much drag as one with a rating of 0.5\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn addition, all wings have the same mass to lift rating ratio, except for the basic swept wing, which is twice as bad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPure 100% control surfaces, , have half as much lift rating as a wing would of the same mass . \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is easy enough to prove if you go into the ALT f12 menu, physics, aero, and tick the \u0022display aero data in action menus\u0022 box.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBuild a plane with several different types of wing on it, pin the right click menus in place, then take screenshots in various flight conditions. \u00A0If you analyse these afterward, you will see that the lift:drag ratio is same for all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, you will notice that fuselage pieces and engine nozzles create way more drag than wings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aegolius13","CreatedById":165625,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-11T21:40:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing to add: the game does take wing shape into account in determining where the lift created by a wing is located. \u00A0For example, if you put a Big S wing on a plane and then reverse it, you will notice the Center of Lift shifts toward the wider part of the wing (i.e., the back, if you use it in a normal delta shape). \u00A0But beyond the location of the lift force, \u00A0wing shape does not matter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe end result of all of this is that the Big S wing (along with its little brother, the wing strake)\u00A0is basically way, way better than any other wing. \u00A0It gives you fuel storage without the cost and drag of an outside tank, and at the same lift/weight ratio of the other standard wings. \u00A0Note that the the FAT-455 wing also offers fuel storage, but it has a very low heat tolerance that makes it tricky to use in spaceplanes. \u00A0And the Big S wing\u0027s large size is helpful, vs. making potentially weak/floppy arrays of wing connectors (though autostrut has helped with this issue).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus, you see Big S wings on practically all efficiency-optimized planes. \u00A0I wish the game would offer some more comparable wings for better variety, but that\u0027s the current state of things. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-12T02:22:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n^ What AeroGav said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0A wing is a wing is a wing.
