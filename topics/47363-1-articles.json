Perhaps it will start at the Island Runway... or maybe another simple airfield complex near more interesting areas for science. You may actually start with parts for only building vehicles (rovers) and aeroplanes. Then only later do you unlock rocket technology.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is an overhaul of the Island Runway in the works as well it seems.
