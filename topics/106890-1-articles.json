Suppose we could take an atmosphere and cut it in half, with 1 atm and another pressure next to eachother (which isn\u0027t possible), but at what pressure would you be able to stand on the gases below you? I always thought that perhaps it was possible, if not let me know. I assume that different gases have different densities and things so they might take more of a gas than another, but I thought it would be cool to ask ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomassino","CreatedById":137899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T15:50:00Z","Content":"I don\u0027t think that this is possible with gases... maybe if their temperature are below freezing point and they become solid"},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T16:07:53Z","Content":"I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any gas dense enough at one atmosphere of pressure that a human could float on it unassisted.\n\nThat said, with a boat light enough and big enough, you could float on the interface between sulfur hexaflouride and air at one atmosphere..\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/XjCmwuGKR6g?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Ethanadams","CreatedById":136913,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T16:19:05Z","Content":"Maybe if you could survive Jupiter and you got near the center of it you could stand"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T16:20:28Z","Content":"Tungsten hexafluoride is the densest gas at 25 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C and 1.0 atm.

So lets say that this technology matures to the point that we can do this experiment.\n\nNow everything depends on the size of your feet. Pressure is force per unit of area, and we need to generate about 700 newtons of force to keep the average human standing. Lets say that the pressure difference is 1 atmosphere. So 1e5 newtons per square meter. Then your feet would need to have a surface area of 7e-3 m2 = 70 cm2. My feet are about 26cm long and 10 wide. I estimate that my feet have about 60% of the surface area of a 26x10cm rectangle. So my feet have a surface area of about 26\\*10\\*2\\*0.6 = 312 cm2. More than enough to avoid falling through the plasma window. In fact, the pressure difference could go all the way down to a quarter of an atmosphere and I\u0027d still be fine."}]}
