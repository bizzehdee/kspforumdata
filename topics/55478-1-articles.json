And only Bob, Bill and Jeb are immortal ( can be changed ). The others stay dead. But yes I would love to see features that made the player more attached to the individual kerbal. Hiring them, training them and then having them earn experience and medals. And even ranks would be cool. Different space suits for each one. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then customizing kerbals... After Jeb returns from the Mun for instance I\u0027d love to unlock some aviators for him to wear lol.
