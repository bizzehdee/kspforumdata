They would have different masses, and might slightly differ from one another in color or features. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically they would represent a pair of asteroids.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main issue with this idea is that I can\u0027t think of how the SOIs of two objects orbiting each other would work in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leax256","CreatedById":57364,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T04:00:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Esimply put they don\u0027t, least not well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jfull","CreatedById":61722,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T04:19:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I did have an idea that there would be a SOI around system as a whole, centered at the invisible barycenter of the two, and then they\u0027d each have their own, far enough apart that there\u0027d be no overlap. I\u0027m not sure if it would actually work out if you did the proper math though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deathsoul097","CreatedById":77396,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T04:47:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe way I see this working is an empty is between the two, and they orbit it as moons exactly parallel to each other, and on the exact same orbit. The only problem would be the bugs that would be caused by the empty. If you went directly into it, it would be like the sun back in 0.13, kraken attack, nearly destroying your computer, and firing the ship out of the solar system, right into the jaws of the deep space kraken, that would rip your craft apart.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T05:37:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think this is doable for the same reason we don\u0027t have L1 Lagrange points. To do it really properly would require calculating gravity as a 2-body problem rather than a 1-body problem with the sphere of influence technique.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblems with trying to do it with the current 1-body model:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 - It would have an odd fold in space at the boundary between the SOI\u0027s. It would behave really screwy in the space between the two planets. Instead of moving across a nice mild gradient gently transitioning from pulling toward Dee to pulling toward Dum, you\u0027d instead hit a line where it would just instantly JUMP from pulling strongly one way to pulling strongly the other. This will interfere with trying to pull off nice figure-8 paths.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - The current model doesn\u0027t support the idea of \u0022equal\u0022 planets with SOI radii that have equal \u0022rights\u0022 butting up against each other. Instead it has a parent/child tree relationship of SOI\u0027s. i.e: Mun\u0027s SOI is inside Kerbin\u0027s SOI is inside Sun\u0027s SOI. So to do this you\u0027d need to make one of the two twin planets be a \u0022moon\u0022 of the other one, which sort of gets into the next problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 - The SHAPE of the SOI boundary between the two bodies would be wrong. What you\u0027d need would be something akin to when two spherical soap bubbles intersect and form a common wall between them, and that common wall is not shaped like a sphere but gets much flatter between them. But the current model can\u0027t do that. It puts spheres inside spheres inside spheres and they all have symmetrical shapes. No egg-shaped SOIs or SOI\u0027s flattened on one side are currently supported by the model the game uses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t get me wrong. I\u0027d love this, especially for the screenshots alone of landing on one planet and having the HUGE other planet taking up most of the sky above. But it would require a change in the main game engine to support it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-09T05:40:06Z\u0022 title=\u002212/09/2013 05:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Steven Mading\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T05:42:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt could be done, but only from a visual standpoint.
