Both?\n\nBoth methods can be used. Basically you\u0027re using the momentum change of the reaction wheel to impart an equal momentum to the spacecraft. You can have a wheel that\u0027s nominally stationary, and just start/stop it to rotate the spacecraft, or you can have a wheel that\u0027s spinning and just change its speed. A static wheel driven by a stepper motor is good for a very precise aiming of e.g. a telescope, whereas a running wheel is simpler. In practice the speed of the wheel will gradually increase to compensate for things like gravity gradient torque, and this built-up rotation eventually has to be cancelled out using RCS or similar.\n\nIn KSP, I\u0027ll happily use them where they\u0027re sensible- spamming reaction wheels instead of building a more stable craft feels cheaty to me. But for basic control, or \u0027gyro stabilisation\u0027 on a rover they\u0027re fine."},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T19:22:07Z","Content":"I hate when I use the thing they added in the game intentionally!"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T19:28:54Z","Content":"Thanks for the explanation FlyingPete that was always confusing to me.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I hate when I use the thing they added in the game intentionally!\n\nSo if MechJeb was added in as a stock feature, would you use it then if you don\u0027t already?

Why should it take me eight hours to go from a to b when I can slap on hacked wheels and these op reaction wheels and do it in an hour?\n\nI\u0027m actually in the midst of a major rover mission traveling to the poles of Eeloo. I regularly cruise at 125m/s across the surface and I can cover half the planet in a single sit down. It\u0027s nice just because of that.\n\nThat being said.. traveling at those speeds with a rover brings about completely new challenges to build a rover stable enough to withstand those speeds. And it takes really, REALLY good driving. \n\nSo that\u0027s the one case where if the current reaction wheels were to be nerfed ( and they should )id cfg hack them back the way they were. \n\nRovers again are my only exception where op/cheaty methods are warranted to make them REALLY fun."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T20:11:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Every autopilot feature uses rcs haphazardly.
