Both?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth methods can be used. Basically you\u0027re using the momentum change of the reaction wheel to impart an equal momentum to the spacecraft. You can have a wheel that\u0027s nominally stationary, and just start/stop it to rotate the spacecraft, or you can have a wheel that\u0027s spinning and just change its speed. A static wheel driven by a stepper motor is good for a very precise aiming of e.g. a telescope, whereas a running wheel is simpler. In practice the speed of the wheel will gradually increase to compensate for things like gravity gradient torque, and this built-up rotation eventually has to be cancelled out using RCS or similar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn KSP, I\u0027ll happily use them where they\u0027re sensible- spamming reaction wheels instead of building a more stable craft feels cheaty to me.
