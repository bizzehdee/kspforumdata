Magazines.) about this game and i\u0027m interested. As much as I can tell about those pictures I saw, it\u0027s gonna be pretty awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut since I play KSP quite a bit, and I like this kind of stuff, I thought about it for a little while. As the title suggests, i\u0027m interested in if you go to a planet will it be realistic? I mean you go to Mars and it looks like Mars in real life or it at least what it could look like in the future? Or will out just be a sexy looking world which makes no sense? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t really tell. What do you think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
