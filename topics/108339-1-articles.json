However, do NOT follow the retrograde marker, stay pointed at the horizon until you are falling straight down, then you can maneuver around to get your retrograde marker on top of your anti-target marker.\n\n4. profit.\n\n![lG0GJGB.png](http://i.imgur.com/lG0GJGB.png)\n\n![88x31.png](https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-sa/4.0/88x31.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T03:29:57Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 03:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by peachoftree**"},{"CreatedByName":"tito13kfm","CreatedById":144785,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T04:37:08Z","Content":"Thank you for this.
