It is definitely an issue with 1.0.\n\nEDIT 2: I changed from windowed to fullscreen and removed the \u0022-popupwindow\u0022 launch parameter.

As stated in the original post, my problem is not with OpenGL in fullscreen, but in windowed mode. Forcing OpenGL works just fine when I launch KSP 0.90 in windowed mode with the -popupwindowoption, but KSP 1.0 shows that error window right after launch when I\u0027m launching in windowed mode (with or without \u0022-popupwindow\u0022)."}]}
