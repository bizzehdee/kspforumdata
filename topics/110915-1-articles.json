What I want to do, is launch it straight up to certain altitude (I don\u0027t want to do the gravity turn for the purpose of this launch). Regular SAS just keeps it straight the entire way, and I am confident that there\u0027s nothing wrong with the rocket, because I launched this design like 50 times already. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I tried to use MechJeb (2.5.1, game is 1.0.2). I added the external control box and enabled Smart A.S.S., then set it to SURF with default parameters (hdg 90 pitch 90 roll 0) and hit execute. It started rotating right away on launch, which I guess is fine, because it was getting to heading 90. Then it ascended to about 7000m and for some reason started deviating from zenith towards heading 90. I don\u0027t know why, but it was definitely intentional on its part. Anyway it tipped the rocket over after deviating for about 3-5 degrees (which is pretty normal for my rockets), did some kind of crazy loop, and eventually managed to return to the zenith course. I repeated the launch about 5 times, it does that every time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have any idea what\u0027s up with that?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T16:54:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry Surf - UP or Orbit - Prograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis might be because you placed the control pod / computer core not facing the prograde direction. MechJeb always thinks that the pilot cabin or computer probe is oriented into the prograde direction. You can easily check that at the launch pad - your nav ball should be all blue, no brown (as your ship pointing up). If this is not the case you need to enter different numbers depending on the orientation of your cabin / computer probe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"A_name","CreatedById":134040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T17:04:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think your problem might actually be the Mechjeb box causing asymmetrical drag on your rocket.

I had a setup with central booster and several identical radial boosters (asparagus). Turns out, it wasn\u0027t completely symmetrical. Some radial boosters had struts missing on one side, which made that side kinda wobbly. Apparently, SmartASS has a real issue with that. While stock SAS just keeps heading without so much as noticing this wobble, SmartASS tries to do something that unbalances it way more and eventually flips the rocket over. It\u0027s pretty easy to reproduce: create a rocket with 1\u002B6 large boosters (I use double T800 tanks), and put struts just on one side.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jansn","CreatedById":131392,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T13:18:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Esnipped\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-27T13:21:10Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2015 01:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jansn\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
