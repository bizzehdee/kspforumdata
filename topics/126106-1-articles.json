Their thrust is similar, though the Reliants have an edge at sea-level) at the cost of being more massive (3.75t plus adaptor versus 3t). For an expendable first stage this is an acceptable trade. Upper stages, you generally want to keep as light as possible. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nClustering is also helpful if, say, you want more thrust than one Reliant but less than a Skipper - why not take two Reliants?
