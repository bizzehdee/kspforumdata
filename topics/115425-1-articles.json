Is there any way to remove a maneuver node without clicking the red x in map view? Friends and I are trying to do a mission control style flight with one person staying in IVA the entire time and using KSP TOT to upload the manuevers to KSP from a separate computer. The issue we\u0027re running into is that we can\u0027t remove the node unless we exit IVA and enter map view to press the red x."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T20:18:40Z","Content":"The deltaV bar next to navball also has a red x to delete the upcoming node.
