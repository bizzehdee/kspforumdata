Since v.0.22 there are some assembly issues I\u0027ve never encountered in earlier versions. If I pick up an entire craft and rotate it to expose the bottom of it (in the SPH) and detach a section to replace a part; the detached section will sometimes reorient to its right side up position, and will not reattach in the proper alignment. I really don\u0027t want to remove wing assemblies just to separate some fuel tanks, for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, once I WAS detaching some wing assemblies and one of the sections went so far into the SPH floor that it barely protruded from it. I was not able to select it and move it, so it was simply sunk into the floor (until loading another file or a launch; at which point it would be gone just like any loose items from a previous use of the SPH).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m wondering if anyone else has had similar things happen while building any craft?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
