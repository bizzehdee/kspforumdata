The idea is that you utilise them by building science stations and docking vessels with upgradeable parts to that science station in order to upgrade them - essentially allowing research stations and research outposts. One option I\u0027m consindering for the future is to differentiate between an initial cost (researching an upgraded the first time) and an upgrade cost (researching an upgraded item the nth item), this has the advantage of functioning rather like a tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) This is due to a bug. The proper function of the thermal rocket is to determine thrust by an attached thermal reactor but a previous bug fix has interfered with this code and meant that attaching no reactor at all gives you the base thrust of the engine.

Which means our starship would have to fly a whole year to reach a star ten lightyears away. And another year back. Kinda long when we look at it from our earthly perspective - on a plane we can circle the Earth in mere days. But it is still much, much better than cruising for decades using any sub-luminal drive we can come up with. And humans kinda/sorta did it long time ago - first explorers to circumnavigate the world spent years onboard their creaky, small, stinking and leaking sailships.

Instead, the warp drive will be powered by an exotic matter resource, which the warp drive will automatically generate when it has electrical power available. As I said before, I\u0027m also making it an upgradeable part. This upgrade will be the cheapest available because it very much qualifies as \u0022nice to have\u0022 rather than a stellar must have. The upgrade will simply allow the warp drive to charge substantially more quickly and permit higher warp speeds with a more massive ship. Since you\u0027re adding a few mutlipliers together, this could easily make upgraded nuclear rockets practical warp ships as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xX9qAlN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xX9qAlN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
