Id rather have a game run a constant 30fps then dip into the single digits for example. That is where I feel the high capacity gpus help with. FPS are bad, but overall there is no stuttering or hitching of any kind. Oddly enough this makes low frame rates much more tolerable. I really do hope Private Division can deliver in terms of optimization because the average user should be able to enjoy 30fps at least. But then part count comes into factors which is a very unique variable KSP and few other builder games has to deal with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ondrafialka","CreatedById":133701,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-03T14:09:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224249449\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214140\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677727494\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022227138\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FlyPathic\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/2/2023 at 4:24 AM, FlyPathic said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t checked much on VRAM (As I only have 4GB of it) but I have a 3050 and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E runs the smoothest, smoother than any other part of the game.
