Let me tell you, it\u0027s hard. First of all, your 1st stage has to be flyable with or without a huge rocket sitting on top of it, and has to be flyable in a wide range of conditions ranging from sea level and subsonic to Kerbin\u0027s upper stratosphere at mach 3\u002B. This means that your Center of Mass, Center of Lift, Center of Thrust, and Center of Drag have to be aligned in all those conditions. In addition, your second stage appears to need to be flyable on its own. Your second stage is even worse off, as it will have to deal with asymmetric thrust with no air to make control surfaces work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, in stock or FAR KSP, your idea should probably work fine without the kick stage: if you can get up to 1000 m/s and 20 km on your first stage, a single rocket-powered stage should be plenty to get you into orbit. However, your payload fraction will probably be lower than that of a well-designed SSTO, and possibly even harder to build. If you can get your first stage up to hypersonic speeds (1700\u002B m/s), you might be able to push the payload into a high enough suborbital trajectory that your second stage can use a nuclear engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor reference, here\u0027s what I built:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2Mn6CqX.png\u0022 alt=\u00222Mn6CqX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does technically work, but it needs two B9 VTOL engines in the tail to keep the nose up at high altitude despite my best efforts to balance it. Its payload fraction is only 15%. There are SSTOs out there with payload fractions of 30%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, a good source of advice might be the people who build shuttles.

You can establish the rocket stage on a suborbital ascent path, then keep flying the first stage after separation is more than 2.5km.
