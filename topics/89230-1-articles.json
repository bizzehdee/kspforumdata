I would like to see wheels that size and aerial things that look like they fit the size of a manned rover / buggy. The lights we have currently are also very big. I believe B9 and / or Kosmos contain some nice examples of lights that I think would benefit the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-02T18:58:38Z\u0022 title=\u002211/02/2014 06:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MelonHeadSeb\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
