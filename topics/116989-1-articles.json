It was suggested that it be released as a mod, so I\u0027ve released it in the following mod:\n\n[http://spacedock.info/mod/51/KW%20Rocketry%20-%20Community%20Fixes](http://spacedock.info/mod/51/KW%20Rocketry%20-%20Community%20Fixes)\n\nLicense is GPLv3\n\nThese patches will not be getting a lot of attention anymore since 1.1 is now fully available.\n\nFor 1.1, please use the KWRocketryRedux version instead: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/137762-kw-rocketry-redux-305-released/](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/137762-kw-rocketry-redux-305-released/)\n\nYou need to install ModuleManager for this to work.  This version includes the full KWRocketry, so you won\u0027t need to install that anymore.\n\nIf installing by hand, you MUST read the instructions, otherwise the engines will not work\n\nThis mod includes version checking using [MiniAVC](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79745).

I feel like its something easy that im just not grasping lol\n\nThat\u0027s based off of work I did. KW has two different way of handling decouplers between stages. The first way is like stock -- if you add a decoupler to an engine a shroud appears around the engine. The optional cfg disables the automatic shrouds and instead lets you use separate shroud parts that have an always visible shroud as part of the model. When you decouple a stage the shroud stays attached with the previous stage, looking just a bit cooler than a stock decouple.\n\nMy patch changes the shrouds so they decouple on both ends, floating free of both the previous and current stage. Basically you can setup your staging to [look like this](https://youtu.be/iJIY4n5oXjc?t=308)."},{"CreatedByName":"Bobe","CreatedById":95803,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T12:42:51Z","Content":"I tried installing KW via CKAN (with these fixes as a required dependency but *without* the interstage patch) and it completely broke my game.
