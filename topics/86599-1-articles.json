I am not sure if it is a bug caused by a mod or if it is intended this way, but so far in my career save I haven\u0027t gotten any contracts yet to test any kind of part. The only contracts I got were the ones with launching a vessel, reaching X height, reaching space, sending data from around Kerbin space, rescuing a Kerbal and the Mun mission. I run a lot of addons, but all of them are up to date.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo when do you usually get contracts for testing various parts in certain situations? I play on the hardest difficulty and hitting a wall right now, I can\u0027t get enough funds to run expensive missions or to unlock all parts in the various science nodes because I simply don\u0027t get any missions except rescure kerbal X from around Kerbin or send science data from around Kerbin and the mentinoed Mun mission. I also fast forwarded the time. So should I have gotten contracts already for testing parts or any kind of other contract? If yes, then I guess I need to check which mod causes this issue. Otherwise I might have to send 20 more inexpensive probes into space to send date and get a bit of money.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-09T04:29:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPart contracts can occasionally be a bit buggy in how they spawn. Sometimes you run into the issue you have, where they just don\u0027t show up for whatever reason until you\u0027ve done a bunch of stuff. It\u0027s likely supposed to be tied to reputation, except that I\u0027ve seen saves with sub-25 reputation earned having part contracts become available, while a game with 100\u002B reputation earned doesn\u0027t get part contracts to show up for ages.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"morph113","CreatedById":102656,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-09T04:36:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell I got over 500 reputation. I also used the debug command to refresh the contracts but it will always only load the same 3 or 4 kind of contracts, only offered from different agencies. I guess I will keep sending cheap probes into space for now to gather as much science and get money as possible and see if more contracts will unlock. Otherwise I don\u0027t know. The logs doesn\u0027t show any unusual and mods also shouldn\u0027t effect the contracts, even \u0022Fineprint\u0022 shouldn\u0027t temper with the stock contracts. Well I\u0027ll see how it goes, at least I have finally a purpose to use cheap probes for missions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-09T04:42:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI got them pretty much right away after I completed the first \u0022achievement\u0022 type missions (5000m, orbital, etc).

It\u0027s just less obvious since it was \u003Cem\u003Efar\u003C/em\u003E more rare that you would get zero procedural contracts after you cleared out the first four non-procedural ones. You can watch it in action if you decline procedural contracts, in fact: unless you decline one of the \u0022seed\u0022 contracts (which ones are seems random), you won\u0027t see any new contracts pop up. But once you decline (or complete) a \u0022seed\u0022 contract, suddenly the list properly refreshes and new ones are generated. Even then it\u0027s still buggy; I did a mass-decline recently to test it, and ended up with fewer and fewer procedural contracts showing up, culminating in only 4 procedural and one non-procedural contract on the list where before there had been 9 procedural and one non-procedural.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
