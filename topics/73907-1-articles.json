The reality of spaceflight and its rules and limitations are unfortunately both counterintuitive and disappointing to the average guy who just wants to see cool fighters blow each other up on the movie screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELook at Star Citizen: big huge sci-fi game, lots and lots of detail in everything they, plenty of technobabble. Fighters and spaceships move by accurately modeled manuevering thruster power which twist and turn it and act as a piloting aid. You also have the option to toggle this \u0022fly by wire\u0022 system on and off at will, and get real Newtonian flight physics instead, so they even dodge the \u0022engines must be always on to move\u0022 pitfall that many space games fall prey to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow look at the spaceships themselves: the entire interior is available as space to walk in. There are no fuel tanks whatsoever. Every engine on every ship in the game is a jet engine, both from the physical model and the exhaust effects. They have the typical adjustable, thrust vectoring turbojet nozzles. The ships have wings and air intakes and stabilization fins. Bonus: they currently have a player-built ship model contest, with the winner making it into the game. One of the finalists is a design that does not feature jet engines; instead it has banks of glowing energy strips angled in a claw-shape (one of the judges called it \u0022Gundam style\u0022). Do you know what the single most voiced complaint about it is? \u0022That doesn\u0027t look like proper spaceship engines.\u0022 And with that, they mean jet engines - as if they were somehow more proper for the application than a complete fantasy construct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, Star Citizen is not an authentic, hard sci-fi experience by any stretch of the imagination. Much rather, it compares to some kind of uniform, infinite atmosphere field with no gravity sources in which atmospheric fighter jets can have three-degrees-of-freedom air battles (and let\u0027s not talk about the laser cannons that shoot laser \u0022bullets\u0022 that barely move faster than the speed of sound). However, Star Citizen is also something which a lot of people really, really, really want to play. This highlights an important point: sometimes its okay to kick realism to the curb in order to create something fun. Star Citizen\u0027s combat model would not work in a real physics simulation; realistic space combat would involve computer-executed surprise attacks against vessels thousands of kilometers away, with single hits spelling the end of the entire vessel and the only human interaction factor being the act of hoping that your shot reaches the target before they manage get a return shot off. That is not fun. Nobody wants to play that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, we want jet fighters in space. And thus we get spaceships with wings, no fuel tanks, and jet engines. Worked for Star Wars, and will work for Star Citizen too. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-02T13:44:18Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2014 01:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RenevB","CreatedById":110395,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-02T14:00:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs Nibb31 said, it\u0027s mostly about suspension of disbelief.
