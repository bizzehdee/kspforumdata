There is a better file that will help us tell what\u0027s going on, and it would be helpful if you could provide details as to what you\u0027re doing when it crashes. The other file that would be good to upload is called output\\_log.txt and is in the KSP\\_Data folder. You can find all these details in the [sticky in this forum](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92230-%21%21%21-PLEASE-READ-BEFORE-POSTING-%21%21%21-Stock-Support-Bug-Reporting-Guide).\n\nOne of my first questions would be how long are you playing before it crashes? And what exactly were you doing at the time? Also, are you using any add-ons?\n\nThere are a few memory leaks in KSP, so playing for extended periods of time can sometimes result in out of memory crashing.\n\nWelcome to the forums! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"}]}
