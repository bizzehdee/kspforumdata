Other modders have reported it with parts that contain 3\u002B resource types, and have been able to solve it by intermixing the various modules in the part CFG.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, there seems to be no workaround when the part contains 3\u002B decoupler modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happens is that the part\u0027s icon in the VAB/SPH menu will zoom outward and vanish to infinity, when the mouse hovers over that part icon. Video below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might wonder what the usefulness of this might be. After all, there is the omni-decoupler option, right? Well, you might have a part where you want \u003Cem\u003Eall but one\u003C/em\u003E nodes to detach, and it may have nodes in multiple places (not just a simple stackable part). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/fzwObXoorho?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"}]}
