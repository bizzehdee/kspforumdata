Sure, there is the argument about passing things along to my children, but there are plenty of \u0022outs\u0022 for this. First, parents get to decide a HUGE amount of things for their children. What medical procedures to get, where they go to school, where they live, (before a certain age) who they can be friends with. You can\u0027t quite claim a designer baby if I\u0027m leaving its genetics up to random chance like everybody else, just with a different setup (presumably I\u0027d be with someone of compatible germlines). Another one, what if something is done (extraction \u0026amp; preservation, sterility, wonky alterations so the changes cannot be passed on [if possible]) such that my children cannot inherit my features?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the risk of possibly starting a threadlocking argument, I feel the following is a valid question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy do I have to STAY human if I choose not to be?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T21:14:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMazon Del, your cards have already been dealt.
