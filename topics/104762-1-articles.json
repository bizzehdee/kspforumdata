However, there is no promises that it will do so. Even if the technology is completely safe and its uses are completely benevolent, you gotta think about the economics of it too. Like any complicate medical procedures, it is gonna cost banks. Who is going to be able to afford it? Well, the ones with money of course.\n\nPerhaps there might be government policies that provide such treatments for lower cost, or have insurances that now extend over genetic deficiencies, but both of that is going to be difficult to get either way for most people (think about the insurance policies currently when your family has known genetic problems...). So we are going to see rich people even more healthier from generation to generation, and poor people just gotta pray that life doesn\u0027t deal them some genetic diseases because they got not much else they can do.\n\nOf course things may happen otherwise, perhaps the technology will actually be so innovative and cost effective that everyone is going to be able to get it, and human race as a whole is going to benefit from it. Though I suspect it will still get its price jacked up for profit either way.\n\nAll that said, I think it is still a worthy endeavours to look into our genetic material and eliminate problems before they manifest, and it will surely be beneficial to the human race. We just have to look at the big picture, see what the implications are for our technology, and prepare for its consequences."},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T16:30:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6as long as it\u0027s only for fixing defects, and not to\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\n\nThis is where this stops being a good idea.
