I know you are supposed to have rocket parts?\n\u003E \n\nShip the rocket parts up in a separate container.  These modules are meant to be inflated after they have been delivered to their final destination.\n\nOnce your deflated module is in orbit, dock a craft to it containing rocket parts (the qty needed will be specified in the right-click menu of the deflated module).  Once the supplies have been docked to the station, right click on the deflated module, and press the \u0027Inflate\u0027 button.  RocketParts will be consumed, up to the needed quantity, and if the need was fully satisfied, the module should inflate.\n\nYou can also do partial deliveries -- if there is not enough rocket-parts when you press the \u0027inflate\u0027 button, it will consume all that it can and await the remainder to be delivered -- press the \u0027inflate\u0027 button again when the fresh supply is available.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 minute ago, warranty45 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The only SSTU tanks I see are invisible?\n\u003E \n\nYou have an error in your installation.

Your log is so full of errors, from lots of different mods, that I cannot offer any assistance given the information provided.  Clean up the rest of those issues and I will be glad to help (though I have a feeling that once you fix the rest of the problems, your issues with SSTU will go away as well)."},{"CreatedByName":"Angustino","CreatedById":186728,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-25T22:40:37Z","Content":"Dear Go...

Just doing a clean install? Except for a couple part mods, I made sure that everything was made for that specific version.\n\u003E \n\nGenerally it starts with a clean install, and the minimal mods you are trying to debug.  If the mod works on its own, you progressively start adding mods back in, either one at a time or in small chunks.  When errors start occurring, you know that one of the most recently added mods is at least involved, and most likely the culprit. \n\nThis gets vastly more complicated when you have cross-mod patch sets such as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E/RP-0.  But you can still apply the same principals there to some extent.  First get \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E working without errors.  Then add in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E and get it working, and finally RP-0.\n\nWith so many mods interacting, it is not a simple process, extremely time consuming, and it really helps to have intimate knowledge of the mods, their plugins, and all the patches in use.  Try and narrow down to the specific cross-mod interaction that is being problematic as best you can, and test chunks of stuff at a time if possible (e.g. frameworks, stand-alone mods, patch sets)."},{"CreatedByName":"horace","CreatedById":166359,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-29T11:09:54Z","Content":"i am getting purple parts..."}]}
