BARTDON.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\nYou have to hand it to that blasted alien robot. For a piece of half-busted junk buried under a metre of moondust, it sure as hell has managed to manipulate the entire Kerbal species well enough. I\u0027d even go as far as saying that it gave us a masterclass-level demonstration of Machiavellianism.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\nThere it was, the utterly helpless remains of a broken machine, bragging about some failed plan to colonise our solar system and telling us just how dangerous its crewmates might be, if they are still out there. And then what did it go and do? It gave us a tantalising but almost entirely symbolic glimpse of its advanced technology, and now the resource companies are trampling each other to be first in line to fund our search for the aforementioned dangerous crewmates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\nTrans Pacific now expects us to put all other projects aside and go digging our way across the outer system to find the crew of the \u003Cem\u003ETransmare\u003C/em\u003E or whatever their damned ship is called, even if they are buried in places as dim-lit, as inaccessible and as green as Uranus. And once again we have the Second Engineer to thank for narrowing down the search zone: this only leaves us with a few trillion cubic kilometres to plough through!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\nWhat a change from the agenda this time last year, when the most adventurous project was the launch of a comsat into a polar orbit. Oh, the damned, bitter irony of it all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\nThe hardest thing to accept is the fact that I saw this coming from the moment Froemone started pleading with the robot for it to deliver the goods. I realise that the poor boy was only doing what he thought was right, but he may just have dragged us unwittingly into something much, much bigger than we can handle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\nThe moment our conversation with the Second Engineer ended, I had the doors to Mission Control locked and made every single investigator and engineer present in the room swear that all that had taken place would remain under wraps until the official report was handed to the Board. Of course, I intended this report to make no mention whatsoever of the blueprints for an advanced fission reactor. The recorded audio footage could be edited, if necessary. Froemone would retro-engineer his reactor if it pleased him, but he would have to damn well retro-engineer it in secret until I gave him permission to reveal anything more advanced than an extra-terrestrial wingnut.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\nAlas, despite my best efforts, news of this alien endorsement reached the Board of Trans Pacific Resources the very next day. And even they couldn\u0027t keep such a game-changing matter to themselves for long. By the end of the week, the news had gone global.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\nThis also tells me that someone on our team is a rat for the Board. This doesn\u0027t surprise me in the least; in fact I wouldn\u0027t expect anything less of Trans Pacific. But I swear to hell and back that my expectations won\u0027t save whoever that damned ratting Kerbal is from a new career that will consist entirely in scrubbing the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E floor until it shines. \u003Cem\u003EAnd with a blasted toothbrush!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\nThis whole thing still gives me the jitters, even though it happened six months ago. Dammit, I must calm down. Froemone and Karanda will be here in a few minutes with their progress report.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\nWe are committed, now. Committed to going to Mars and searching for this First Officer or whichever of his subordinates we can lay our hands on, despite the risk of awakening something that we really should leave well alone, buried out there until Sol goes red giant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\nIf I don\u0027t get this done, then the Board will redistribute me and find someone else who will. If it must be so, then we are damned well going to do this my way, which is what I told Froemone three months ago when we started to define the project to land Kerbals on Mars using the upcoming transfer window later this year.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\n\u201CHow would you make sure that this mission does not end up being cancelled, boy? Shoot away!\u201D was the question I had put to him. \u201CI need to see this through to the bitter end. I need to lead this mission myself. You are going to put footprints made by these very two feet on the surface of the blasted planet Mars.\u201D I put my feet up on my desk to make the point, betraying the fact that my spiked golf shoes were likely responsible for the many deep gouges scratched into the desktop\u0027s varnish. \u201CAnd we are going to do this in such a manner that it will be impossible for any member of the Board to veto the project once it is underway.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\n\u201CWell, uhm,\u201D thought Froemone. \u201CWe could send minimal crew, using existing technology. Small tugs pushing modular elements to aerocapture into low Martian orbit. We could use ...uhm... in situ resources to refuel on the surface and bring the weight and cost down...\u201D His voice trailed off as saw that I was rocking back and forth with my head in hands, silently cursing the fact that such a brilliant engineer could be so inept and unfamiliar with how the funding of a space programme worked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\n\u201C\u003Cem\u003ENo\u003C/em\u003E, dammit, boy!\u201D I barked with sufficient suddenness to make even our stoic Senior Engineer jump back a foot or two. \u201CBringing the weight and cost down is precisely what we \u003Cem\u003Edon\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E want to do. If we don\u0027t want this to be cancelled then we must think \u003Cem\u003Ebig\u003C/em\u003E. I want you to find the most complex and spectacular way of landing a full crew of Kerbals on the surface, and then I want you to make it bigger and more expensive still. Tell me, how much cash do we have right now?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\n\u201CUhm... about eleven million funds...\u201D said Froemone, blinking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\n\u201CThen we will spend more than half of that on this mission. D\u0027you hear me, boy? I will personally see that you\u0027re reassigned to airship maintenance if you manage to spend less than six million funds in getting us to the Red Planet.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\nFroemone winced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\n\u201CI want a large crew transfer vessel with a crew of six, and four of us on the ground when we get there. This will be easy enough to justify after the debacle onboard \u003Cem\u003ECernin\u003C/em\u003E: no crew member is to go solo at any point during the mission, so we\u0027ll need at least two teams down there. You have a payload budget of... thirty tonnes just for the crew.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\nFroemone\u0027s eyes lit up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\n\u201CI don\u0027t care how you get us to the surface, but we will need to stay there for at least three months. We must also have a decent crewed rover with several hundred klicks of cross-range and provisions for journeys of more than two weeks. I actually have a pretty decent idea of where we will be going, but the Board doesn\u0027t need to know that yet. Oh, and no faffing around on the surface with inflatable habs, I can\u0027t stand living in those things for more than a few days...\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\nFroemone\u0027s eyes shone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\n\u201CWe will also have a planetary communications system with areostationary relays and a couple of polar scanners. Surface operations must be in contact with the crew transfer ship at all times. And while we\u0027re at it, we might as well go and see if we can find ice on those two blasted potato moons. That should keep the resource companies happy, damn them. And it may come in useful for later missions farther out.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\nFroemone\u0027s eyes watered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\n\u201CAnd one more thing... See to it that there is a set of clubs on the rover. It will be the only chance I\u0027ll get to swing for nearly three years. Here, take a handkerchief, boy.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\nAnd so today Froemone and Karanda were here to present their preliminary designs. But we began with the report on the progress of our first mission that deployed the Second Engineer\u0027s reactor technology, \u003Cem\u003EFontanes One.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\nThe \u003Cem\u003EFontanes\u003C/em\u003E project had been born just a matter of days after Trans Pacific had discovered that alien robots that were giving away decades worth of technological progress for free were potentially scattered across the solar system, and had basically ordered us to, \u201C\u003Cem\u003EGo get \u0027em. Now.\u003C/em\u003E\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\nI had spent a long day brooding in my office, trying not to think about the consequences of unscrupulous, profit-minded corporations getting their greedy little mittens on advanced forms of space propulsion and hastily retro-engineering types of nuclear power generators that we had never even dreamed of. And that was if the crew of Colonisation Mission Seven didn\u0027t find some way of turning this technology against us. What a waste if all our efforts to explore our universe boiled down to this. I really wanted no part in it, but I was damned if I did, and damned if I didn\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\nIf I didn\u0027t, some other, less scrupulous Principal Investigator would take my place, and I could not let that happen. I would have to brace myself, but I was confident in my ability to stand up to the Board for the foreseeable future. After all, I have already kept us afloat through several major crises.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\nBut there\u0027s another problem. I\u0027m getting old.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\nI am, by far, the most senior investigator on the team, and when they come for me, this will be their weapon. They will honour me for my lifelong commitment to science, pin a medal or two on my suit for services to all kerbalkind, and order me to stand aside for some young, enthusiastic fool who doesn\u0027t know what he\u0027s getting into.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\nWith this in mind, I had kicked open the door to my office at ten to four and made my way down to the engineering department. Froemone and Mitzon were just wrapping things up for the day when I gave them my requirements for the first of many missions that would conform to our new policy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\n\u201CDo you think you can get that reactor running?\u201D I blurted out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\n\u201CWell, uhm... yes, but,\u201D began Froemone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\n\u201CGood! I want you to demonstrate it works by putting a probe in the Saturn system within three years of it being launched. It must then be able to orbit multiple satellites and scan them for any magnetic or terrain anomalies. And...\u201D I said, turning to glare at Mitzon, \u201C...it must not look like a piece of junk you knocked up in your back yard.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\nWith hindsight, I must admit that these were pretty ambitious specs, and had I checked a transfer plot, I would have realised that Jupiter and Saturn were really not in the best of places for a gravity assist, but that was the engineering department\u0027s problem, not mine. I couldn\u0027t afford to grow old waiting for the gas giants to be where we wanted them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\nTo my surprise, they nailed it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\nThus, the \u003Cem\u003EFontanes\u003C/em\u003E class of deep space exploration probes was born. Fitted with something called dual-stage 4 grid ion thrusters fueled by xenon and two small prototype vapour core fission reactors, using magnetohydrodynamic conversion rather than our traditional brayton cycle turbines, it packed nearly fifty kilometres per second of delta-vee.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003E\nGetting the damn thing up there had required two launches of our spaceplane; not because it was heavy (although at nearly nine tonnes, it was the atomic monster truck of un-crewed probes), but because it was so damned wide.

The pilot would be flying blind until shortly before we reached the surface, at which point the bay doors would open and provide him with a measure of downwards vision in order to select a landing site.

Camwi ...uhm... Karanda is certain that this is the best way to get large volumes of shielded cargo to the surface. The four engines are mounted on pivots that can rotate through 360 degrees. The fairings you see will protect the engine bells until speed drops sufficiently for them to rotate forwards and slow the vessel, then vertically to land. Aerodynamic surfaces will provide additional control during the unpowered phase of descent. This will allow you to hit your landing site accurately, and bring down her uncrewed sister\u00A0ship \u003Cem\u003EEspedaillac\u003C/em\u003E carrying \u003Cem\u003EArcambal\u003C/em\u003E within walking distance.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWe dismounted from the rover and climbed down the ladder into the baking desert heat.

I didn\u0027t envy the poor boy, wearing a heavy suit in the scorching desert sun and lifting some damned heavy equipment.

In the days before our return to orbit, this water would be electrolysed and cryo-cooled into hydrolox fuel to power our flight back to orbit.

A Planetary Investigator named Desfal would be my second scientist. He was an earnest young chap, and had previously worked as a researcher in hydrogeology for Trans Atlantic resources. His line of work had brought him to be interested in off-world resources.

Due to the expected difficulties of landing multiple payloads with pinpoint accuracy on an atmospheric body (in order to allow the assembly of a Martian outpost immediately after the crew touching down), it quickly became apparent that the equipment and crew should descend to the surface in as few modules as possible, ideally two: one for the crew, life support and supporting hardware, a second for the rover which can be remotely driven to the crew\u0027s landing site, should it land down-range.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nDue to the high degree of precision required for the landing zone (and the fact that the location is still classified and/or may be subject to modification) as well as the unknowns still surrounding atmospheric and surface conditions, a shuttle concept was devised.

This time our next stop will be another blasted planet, and I\u0027m beginning to understand what Camwise had meant when he\u0027d said to me \u003Cem\u003EI just don\u0027t think you get what it was like out there.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nLooking out through the lab\u0027s window and watching the already distant Earth slip away into the field of stars, I think back to the moment of truth that had taken place a month ago now: the final manoeuvre that had kicked us out of Earth\u0027s orbit, up to escape velocity, and on to Mars. We had already pushed our apogee most of the way up to geostationary with a first burn, and got rid of that damned drop tank stuck to the nose of the ship that spoiled our forward view.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022HFfwzFj.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HFfwzFj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAs a consequence, we had spent several hours in the radiation shelter at the back of the bridge as \u003Cem\u003ELaroque\u003C/em\u003E had poked her nose out of the radiation belts for the first time before dipping back below them for a final farewell to her home planet. It was the first of many times we would be brought together to huddle - all six of us - in that tiny corridor that connected the bridge to the microgravity laboratory, surrounded by the two tonnes of water that provided us with a measure of protection against the spiteful elements of the void.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI\u0027d sat (if one can be considered to be seated in the absence of such a concept as down) with my back to the cold bulkhead of one of the water tanks, hugging my legs and facing my crew. As we waited for the radiation levels to drop so that we could return to the bridge, I peered through the ghostly amber light of the shelter at the five other Kerbals there with me, and attempted to gauge their abilities and anticipate the problems I might face over the three years of close proximity ahead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nDirectly opposite me was Karanda, the Chief Engineer of our mission. An outspoken, sometimes hot-headed character, she was the complete opposite of her cousin in terms of personality, but she could be just as good at engineering original solutions to the challenges of space travel, and had an eye for beauty to boot. Whereas Camwise had cracked the problem of designing an engine capable of propelling a spaceplane to orbit, Karanda\u0027s team had produced the airframe itself. She could also be loud and vulgar at times, and I felt thankful that I didn\u0027t know enough of her patois to guess the meanings of some of her saltier expressions. I guess they might raise our spirits when the going gets tough, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nSlumped next to her was Mitzon, or Mr. Casual as I liked to call him. A buoyant Kerb from the northern latitudes of the American continent who didn\u0027t look his age, he had romped through the engineering triumphs and pitfalls of our space programme as if he hadn\u0027t a single care in the world. His cheerful presence would almost certainly be beneficial to the morale of the crew, but I still wasn\u0027t quite sure he was the right person to be in charge of a nuclear reactor that was supposed to be propelling us out there and back, as well as the water extraction operations on Mars which, if unsuccessful, would leave us stranded on the planet\u0027s surface with no hope of rescue. Time will tell, I suppose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nNext to me sat Desfal, the least experienced member of the team and my Assistant Investigator. I\u0027d chosen him partly because he was reputed to be a damned good hydrogeologist (which would undoubtedly come in handy in a situation where our very survival would depend on finding water or ice below the surface), and partly because he had worked for Trans Atlantic Resources for the past ten years. He was therefore unlikely to be the Investigator reporting our every move back to the Board of Trans Pacific, their competitor (not that he would be reporting anything from Mars that didn\u0027t have my seal of approval. After the subterfuge that took place onboard \u003Cem\u003ECernin\u003C/em\u003E, I will be keeping communications under close scrutiny, of course). Indeed, and oddly enough, Trans Atlantic seemed to be the only resource company in business on Earth that didn\u0027t seem to be begging for us to dig up the alien Monuments. Something to look into, I suppose. Anyway, Desfal was eager to make a good impression, and would probably cause me no trouble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAt the far end of the module, almost hidden in the shadows, was the rigid form of Munvey. A Kerbal from Asia of unguessable age, you could almost see the self-discipline oozing from the fellow as he sat to attention, waiting for the radiation storm to die down and return to his cockpit. Apart from myself, he was the most space-hardened old boy on the roster, and my Second-in-Command for this little jaunt. He was uncompromising and humourless, but he had been the first Kerbal to put down a crewed vessel onto another world and I had high hopes that he could repeat this feat further afield.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAnd finally, in the opposite corner, the youngest member of \u003Cem\u003ELaroque\u0027\u003C/em\u003Es crew, Second Pilot Lisabeth. She had looked apprehensive as we had abandoned the bridge for the relative safety of the shelter, but so far had proved herself capable of stepping up to the merciless appraisal of our Chief Pilot. If Munvey judged that she was up to the task, she would fly us to Phobos and Deimos in \u003Cem\u003ECadrieu\u003C/em\u003E. For the moment, she was discreet and kept her thoughts to herself. I would have to talk to her about Camwise at some point, I decided. If they had been close, she deserved an explanation, and I couldn\u0027t have any loose ends clouding her judgement with the work that lay ahead of us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe amber light flickered to green and we gratefully unfolded our cramped limbs and made our way back to the bridge. Perigee, and our final manoeuvre, were approaching rapidly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nA few minutes later, the six of us had buckled in back-to-back in the circle configuration of the cockpit as Mitzon and Karanda checked that \u003Cem\u003ELaroque\u003C/em\u003E had pulled through her baptism of radiation unscathed. Our Chief Engineer brought the reactor online, peered at the gauges on her console and announced that we were good to burn. In just a few seconds, we would hit our node and commit ourselves to three years in space. Munvey placed his hand on the throttle of \u003Cem\u003ELaroque\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s main engine but then, unexpectedly, he spoke.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CShe\u0027s yours, SP. Do the honours.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nLisabeth looked over at him in surprise, but she recovered, muttered a quick \u003Cem\u003Eyessir\u003C/em\u003E and grasped her own throttle, flicking on the ullage motors. Her eyes then wandered straight forward into the void awaiting us. In the final moment before we hit our node, there was a moment of weighty silence, and I swear I heard her whisper something to herself as she stared off into infinity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CI\u0027m sorry.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022YdyTtXp.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YdyTtXp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThen, bang on cue, she pushed the throttle firmly forwards to its stops. A few metres behind us, frigid liquid methane gushed through the reactor core and was instantly vaporised, expanding into a wide plume that, had anyone been around to observe it from a safe distance, would have undoubtedly been a beautiful sight. We were pushed back into our seats once more, but \u003Cem\u003ELaroque\u003C/em\u003E was still heavy with fuel and the acceleration was perfectly comfortable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nEight minutes later, it was over. We had pushed over the edge, escaped from our planet\u0027s clutch, and we were heading out into the unknown. Fortunately, another spell in the radiation shelter kept us from the temptation to look back at our planet receding minute by minute into the distance. Now that we had exceeded escape velocity, the belts were behind us very quickly, and we could finally spin up the centrifuge arms and settle into the rotating part of our vessel to enjoy the luxury of artificial gravity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nNow, one month into our three hundred day journey, we drift through deep space. Munvey and Lisabeth make sure that our ship keeps her tail pointing towards the sun, her huge fuel tanks bearing the brunt of the radiation flux and her solar arrays exposed to the life-giving energy. \u003Cem\u003ELaroque\u003C/em\u003E covers twenty-five kilometres each second in relation to our star, but we might just as well be immobile, frozen in time and space, as the Earth falls away from us, spiralling inwards towards the sun, and Mars reaches out to catch us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022AQFUNm6.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AQFUNm6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAll the craft that will serve us on this voyage are fanned out across a great swathe of space, flying in loose formation like some great invasion fleet sailing across the great black desert. The first to eject from Earth had been the communications and science probes. Scouting ahead of us, they had already made their first and only deep space correction manoeuvres in order to hit both polar and equatorial Martian orbits. Behind us were the landers and shuttles pushed by their massive tugs. And in the centre of this chaos, on board my capital ship, I felt like some admiral bent on assaulting another world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022bDWAeMI.png?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bDWAeMI.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Xti92ET.png?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Xti92ET.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022jq7Z67z.png?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jq7Z67z.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022LgXF6LP.png?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LgXF6LP.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022SSsRGAP.png?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SSsRGAP.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAnd because our home planet, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E Omelek, and the Board are now well out of reach of any short-range transmitter that might have conceivably been smuggled on board without my consent, we can now get damned well back to business and I can brief my crew. I had everyone gather in the lab just after breakfast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CRight boys and gals, listen up,\u201D I said. \u201COur agency has been instructed to locate and study any further evidence of the alien presence in our system, in particular more of those big black floppy disks they left lying around that you may know as the Monuments. If we find one, we are to attempt to communicate with it and gather whatever intelligence we can, including information as to the possible locations of any others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CWe are starting with Mars because we can get there with our present technology, and because the Lunar Monument, or Second Engineer, implied that at least one of its crewmates went there at some point. Naturally, we will not be able to make a detailed search of the entire planetary surface in a single mission. The Lunar Monument\u0027s location was revealed by a magnetic anomaly, but it took me a long time to analyse the data, and we got lucky. We cannot count on detecting them all from orbit. So we have to start somewhere.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CWe\u0027re going to the Pyramid, then?\u201D asked Desfal cautiously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI looked at him for a moment, wondering what conclusions he and the other investigators had drawn from the data gathered during the previous mission and the debriefings of my predecessor, Angun, before he had been sent off to drill ice in the North. I flashed a brief knowing smile at my colleague.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CNo,\u201D I replied \u201Cat least, the Pyramid will not be our primary objective. Our solar-powered drilling equipment and life support systems require us to choose a site much closer to the Martian equator. The Pyramid is situated at over 160\u00B0 South and will be difficult to get to, even with the rover. Besides, the images of the Pyramid and data sent back by \u003Cem\u003EType-G Seven\u003C/em\u003E suggest that it is just that: a large rock Pyramid with no obvious way in and no particular features of interest on its surface. No magnetic anomalies or electromagnetic signals were detected in its proximity. We won\u0027t even attempt to reach it unless we find nothing else to go on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CI have another location in mind. During his debriefing, Angun revealed to us the other locations he had selected as potential landing sites for the two other \u003Cem\u003EType-G \u003C/em\u003Erovers. \u003Cem\u003EType-G Eight \u003C/em\u003Elanded in Noachis Terra and never got anywhere, but after taking a second look at the data, I\u0027m more tempted by the site he had planned for \u003Cem\u003EType-G Nine\u003C/em\u003E. The rover itself is still in orbit and was switched off a couple of years ago during the blasted budget cuts, but its intended target is most interesting. It is situated due north of the western end of the Martian Canyon, not far from Tharsis Tholus. Once you get away from the Canyon, it\u0027s all gently sloping highlands, so it will be ideal rover territory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CMy plan is for us to go down near the equator, maybe on the high ground just north of the Canyon if a suitable water concentration can be located, allowing us to visit both the anomaly and the Canyon itself. I must make it clear that this is still a mission of scientific discovery, not just a wild chase for alien robots. We need to search for evidence of life, past or present, as suggested by the signals emitted by the Monuments. Visitors from another star or no, this would still be a crucial scientific discovery. The Canyon will be the best place to carry out this search.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CBut what about the anomaly, PI?\u201D cut in Karanda. \u201CWhat makes it so interesting?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CWell, in the visible spectrum it looks like a small, oddly shaped hill. But spectrometry shows that it is made of a different material than the surrounding terrain, which suggests that it was altered in some way, or perhaps even... manufactured. Someone, or something was definitely there, and they might have left behind clues about their purpose behind them. Here,\u201D I said, producing a printed picture taken by Vers Eight\u0027s orbital camera, \u201Ctake a look for yourselves.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022oN4KaDu.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oN4KaDu.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAs they passed round the picture I gave my final, and most important instructions. \u201CI must ask all of you to consider the consequences of this rash decision by our sponsors to order an all-out search for alien intelligence. We don\u0027t have a clue what we might find, or what this Crew might be setting us up for, if they still exist. I don\u0027t believe that a bunch of artificially intelligent constructs travelled light years just to hand out their technology for free, so we must proceed with the utmost caution.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nDesfal had started to speak, but the mere thought of the Board\u0027s profit-driven intentions had got my blood up and I blew over his attempt to interrupt. \u201CDuring this mission, any, I repeat \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E contact with an alien construct or life-form must be reported to me immediately, and I alone shall be fully responsible and accountable for any response we should choose to give in return. I hope this is damned clear to all of you, and if it isn\u0027t then I can only point you towards that airlock, because you sure as hell have no place on my damned ship.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe silence that followed was uncomfortable, but I had at least got the point across.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nLater on, after the briefing, I sat alone in my personal cubicle situated in one of the rotating crew modules, mulling over what I\u0027d told the crew and, above all, what I hadn\u0027t told them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe first matter I hadn\u0027t raised was what I considered to be the strangest \u2013 and potentially the most significant \u2013 element of the debriefings of \u003Cem\u003ECernin\u0027\u003C/em\u003Es crew. It had happened between the moment they had left the surface of Phobos and their nearly disastrous rendez-vous with the crew ship. Camwise had reportedly spotted something orbiting the moon and they had managed to make an unplanned interception of the object on their way up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nSome poor quality video footage had apparently been taken, but the camera had been left behind in the following scramble to save \u003Cem\u003ECernin\u003C/em\u003E. There was therefore no proof that anything they said was true, but all three, even Jonnie, had given exactly the same account of what they had seen: some sort of life-form that resembled the great sea-creatures of the ancient days, before they had become extinct along with most other lineages nine hundred thousand years ago.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThis just didn\u0027t make sense. What business would a giant squid have orbiting one of the moons of the Red Planet? Just calculating the fuel requirements of propelling such a massive beast into a Mars intercept trajectory would have our engineers foaming from their mouths. Would we have to throw out everything we thought we knew about our planet\u0027s natural history, or am I missing something important here? It was so damned uncanny, I was tempted to believe that the stressful situation had caused the crew of the \u003Cem\u003EC\u00E9r\u00E9\u003C/em\u003E capsule to suffer some kind of mass hallucination.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe second thing I hadn\u0027t told anyone about was an item hidden in a locked box beneath my bunk, secured by a six-digit code, and no-one would ever know about it, unless I considered that the situation was dire enough for us to use it. Only two living Kerbals knew of its presence on board \u003Cem\u003ELaroque\u003C/em\u003E and what the code was: myself and Froemone, who had supplied me with the item in question. Well, two of them actually. The other one was in a similar box he had personally dissimulated in a false bottom underneath the left-hand cargo pallet of the \u003Cem\u003EArcambal\u003C/em\u003E rover, currently on a parallel course to ours and en route to Mars also, inside the belly of \u003Cem\u003EEspedaillac\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nFeeling foolishly paranoid I nevertheless dialled in the code and opened the box, as I had done every day since we left Earth, to check if its contents was still there, untouched. I was greeted by the sight of the dull grey, shoe-sized device wrapped in a thin sheet of paper with its electrical detonator and timer. And as on each previous occasion, I felt a combination of relief that it was still safely locked away, and dreadful apprehension at having such a thing on board my ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe Second Engineer had told us that its crewmates were programmed to erase their drives rather than let the data they contained be examined by a third party.
