The question I have is this. I\u0027ve sent some time making a station in orbit around Kerblin for use as a space dock/refueling station and I am wondering if it is more fuel efficient to build a base on Mun to refuel my station or if I should stick to shutting fuel up from the ground? The reason I\u0027m wondering is the amount of effort I spend trying to get fuel off the ground and to the station seems a little much. I launch a huge ship and only get a small amount of fuel into orbit. I think my best so far was 5% or so of my capacity on the station. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E It seems a little rediculous to try and keep the station fueled from the ground.

By that logic, it\u0027s more efficient for the operation as a whole to refine at the point of extraction rather than drilling the kethane, transporting it, then refining it. Now, because kethane is slightly lighter than the equivalent volume of rocket fuel, it\u0027s more efficient for your tanker craft to ferry raw kethane as opposed to rocket fuel. To sum that up, it all depends on where you want the efficiency. Also, for getting fuel to orbit, I can get an orange rockomax to orbit with 8 FL-T800 fuel tanks and 8 LV 909 engines. It should take less (maybe 6 of those stacks instead of 8) on the Mun,\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brofessional","CreatedById":2080,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-12T19:41:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s better to put your Kethane operation on Minmus instead of the Mun.

First, the Kethane tanks are empty...so however they get to the surface they need to be landed with regular fuel/oxidizer. Second, a deposit (apparently) does run out, requiring a move of the drilling operation. I haven\u0027t done enough to see how long it takes, but that struck me as another reason to have a mobile drilling rig. So my lander is basically a 16K Kethane tank with 4 standard engines, 2 drills, a small Kethane generator for power, a small converter and a scanner. I scan, land, drill (using the generator for power) and refuel using the convertor. Then I have my main conversion plant in low Minmus orbit, and I have nuk-u-lar tugs that move the refined fuel back to my fuel station at 130K around Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven that I have a dead-reliable HLV that launches a full orange tank into LKO, I\u0027m questioning the overall approach to some extent.

They don\u0027t need to be fast, just efficient. Got enough DeltaV left to attach 1-2 smaller rovers if I wanted to.

One around Mun or Minmus has a little utility, but not much since outbound flights are usually better off maximizing the Oberth Effect to leave from low Kerbin orbit. My main use for a Minmus base has been as a depot for INBOUND flights, where a ship coming back from Jool or Duna might not have quite enough fuel left to get back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut fuel depots around Duna, Eve, and Jool have been essential to my enjoyment of this game. The thing is, as others have pointed out, you\u0027re better off refining Kethane into fuel/oxidizer on-site, not hauling the raw material up to orbit. So, I have three basic classes of craft that refine Kethane:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1\u0026gt; A self-contained 300-ton station/refinery/lander. It lands on low-gravity moons (Pol, Gilly, Minmus, or Ike), fills up the fuel tanks using a metric buttload of Kethane, converts as much as possible, takes off, flies to wherever it\u0027s needed, then acts like a station until it\u0027s low on fuel again. It\u0027s a little inefficient to haul drills and a refining module up and down a gravity well, but it saves quite a bit of fuel that you\u0027d otherwise use for rendezvousing your refinery with a station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2\u0026gt; Rovers with refineries. These drive around the surface until they reach a Kethane field, then drill and refine to fill up. If a vessel lands nearby, they can drive over to it, use KAS connectors to link up, and refuel it while on the surface. If the vessel landed on the Kethane field as well, then the rover can drill and refine while it transfers, so capacity isn\u0027t an issue. I\u0027ve got a small 30-ton rover for general use, and a massive 400-ton rover that also acts as a manned base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3\u0026gt; Self-fueling Grand Tour vessels. I made a 55-ton one-man vessel with onboard Kethane refinery, which Jeb used to make a Grand Tour, landing on every planet and moon other than Jool itself. Being able to refuel on the surface makes it much easier to take off from places like Tylo, or get to and from Moho without running out of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf and when we get an economic system that encourages SSTOs and reusable craft, something like Kethane will be essential for even Kerbin-orbit craft. But even there, you\u0027ll be limited by the amount of easily accessible Kethane since it\u0027s definitely not cost-effective to lift it from Kerbin itself, and sooner or later Mun and Minmus will run out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
