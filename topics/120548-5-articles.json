You can also choose from some fairing logos or add your own via firespitter like so: (instructions are also in the firespitter.cfg)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlace your files anywhere and add a .cfg containing\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022pln\u0022\u003E@PART[HGAProtonFairingA*|HGAProtonFairingB*]:NEEDS[Firespitter]\n{\n\t@MODULE[FStextureSwitch2]\n\t{\t\n\t\t@textureNames ^= :$:;my_path/my_texture;my_path2/my_texture2:\t\t\t\n\t\t@textureDisplayNames ^= :$:;My Texture Name;My Texture Name2:\n\t}\n}\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll upload a layered template later this day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I included a togglable guide mesh in all fairing bases (right click on the base). Use it if you want to use the built in procedural fairings and you want to built a fairing shape that is original to the proton. The upper edge is the reference for the extended payload fairing, the lower edge is the guide for the standard fairing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022cWpac4X.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cWpac4X.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI added the link to a .psd template for those who want to create their own fairing logos in the starting post.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-08T22:40:03Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2016 10:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by InsaneDruid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Elink to template file added\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal01","CreatedById":57322,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-01T15:55:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny updates on TKS-VA?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
