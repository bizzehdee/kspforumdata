The question is, how long exactly does it take to get a decent map of deposits? the sats don\u0027t work when you are not piloting., unfortunately, and they miss information if you warp. so is the only option letting the thin scan in real time for days?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Thanks in advance\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majiir","CreatedById":7550,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-16T07:57:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETime warp requires a bit more battery capacity to keep running at full speed. Try adding a battery or two to your probe and you should find time warp gives better results. There will still be gaps, but a gap of 1-2 pixels between dots is fine. Finding a deposit usually takes on the order of 10-15 seconds, and a \u0022full\u0022 map might take 5-20 minutes. It all depends on what you consider enough for your purposes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pulstar","CreatedById":57193,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-16T10:03:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you want a full, mostly-complete scan at warp with minimal gaps then a polar orbit scanner takes about 30 minutes in my experience, usually though it\u0027s usable with far less than that. Depends on the planetary body though. Overall if you just want a refuel base and care less about location I recommend putting it in a low inclination orbit so it only scans a small belt around the equator, since it\u0027s fairly easy to land and get back from there. That should take a fraction of the time needed for a full map and you should have fully scanned deposits there anyway without major gaps in scanning area in the band.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELikewise if you want to go for the poles (because drilling ice on Duna is cool, *badum tish*) a polar orbit satellite will always scan the poles in the most detail first.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TMS","CreatedById":57134,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-16T10:37:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAltitude of the scanner also affects the granularity of the map at time warp.
