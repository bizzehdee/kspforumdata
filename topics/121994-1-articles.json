Also we should get a visual reminder in the stock categories that a part exists in a custom category. A \u0022save/load\u0022 button for the custom categories would allow us to go into Sandbox mode, sort everything and then save/load those categories in a career play. Only when adding new mods would we need to do this again, with the new items clearly visible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA debug/dev menu in the VAB would also simplify modding for the user. For example, right clicking a part to enable/disable a set of modules with custom values. In this way, a mod like \u0022tweakscale\u0022 could be added per part and a new cfg file added to the mod\u0027s folder (or simply a new stock folder called VABTweaks). Currently, some mods are easy to add to parts but it means getting out of the game, finding the part with Notepad\u002B, making a modulemanager config, etc. This takes time and most players don\u0027t even know they can mod the game themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-29T23:53:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is already some of the functionality you describe in the game.
