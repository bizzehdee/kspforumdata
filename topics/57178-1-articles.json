A major feature of the normal asparagus staging is having the extra thrust when the fuel load is heaviest, which is more or less what you need on ascent from the KSC pad. The only time you should really be considering it is if you\u0027ve got a design which has significantly too much thrust off the pad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vlk","CreatedById":57928,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-21T15:29:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think i ever did that, but i can imagine a scenario where that may be useful. I think its rare because usually you need more thrust power for additional fuel tanks. And when you ascend from kerbin with a big ship, if the fuel tanks are not \u0022supported\u0022 well (with thrusters under them), then the ship can break apart, even if you use struts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-21T15:35:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI do that sometimes, but not usually if I have 6 or more asparagus stacks. The only problem with asparagus is when you drop a stage, you loose, say, 450 kN of thrust, so if you drop one your TWR will only increase. And you don\u0027t have to add an extra engine if you have a good TWR, because then you just have extra fuel to burn with no real downside since there is no \u0022useless\u0022 dry mass or increased fuel consumption.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Soda Popinski","CreatedById":92416,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-21T15:39:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe the term is \u0022slack tank\u0022 staging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a thread on it: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57294-Different-staging-techniques\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57294-Different-staging-techniques\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-21T15:40:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you need a lot of Delta-V, using drop-tanks can crank up your Delta-V a little higher by getting rid of the fuel tanks once they\u0027re empty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4057920/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/v0.22/Screenshots/screenshot130.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot130.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft depicted in the image above was designed for a quick intercept of an object in an inclined solar orbit, and has a single LV-N for thrust.

You can take a \u0027stalk\u0027 and make sure it has a reasonable TWR for upper atmosphere, then you can add asparagus tanks until the TWR approaches about 1.5. The higher the TWR the better of course. You\u0027ll then have as much fuel as your stalk can support. Put more engines on the stalk (or the asparagus) if you need more thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you put engines on your asparagus then you risk having too much thrust during your ascent and a lot of the thrust is wasted.
