Crafts, or perhaps craft-names that are designated as part of this programme will be named sequentially on launch (I.E. Gemini 1, Gemini 2, etc.).\n\nSorry if my English has let me down - let me break it down into a \u0027flow-diagram\u0027 type thing:\n\n1. Define a new programme, call it \u0027Project Beale\u0027 for example.\n2. Add a craft name to the programme, \u0022Moon Lander\u0022 for example.\n3. Add another craft name to the programme, \u0022Satellite\u0022 for example.\n\nNow whenever a craft called \u0022Moon lander\u0022 or \u0022Satellite\u0022 is launched, it will automatically be renamed as the \u0022programme name \u002B number of the mission in that programme\u0022.\n\n\u0022Moon Lander\u0022 -\u003E Launch -\u003E \u0022Beale 1\u0022\n\n\u0022Moon Lander\u0022 -\u003E Launch -\u003E \u0022Beale 2\u0022\n\n\u0022Moon Lander\u0022 -\u003E Launch -\u003E \u0022Beale 3\u0022\n\n\u0022Satellite\u0022 -\u003E Launch -\u003E \u0022Beale 4\u0022\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\u0022Moon Lander\u0022 -\u003E Launch -\u003E \u0022Beale 42\u0022\n\nHope I make sense! \n\nReally this thread is half request, half \u0022how I might do this\u0022 if such a plugin does not already exist.\n\n*Further fun stuff?*\n\n- Keep a log of all missions in a particular programme?\n- Automatically assign a programme flag to the mission?\n- Total cost of the programme so far?\n- Kerbals involved in the programme?\n\nKind Regards.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-13T19:13:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2015 07:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Beale**"},{"CreatedByName":"tg626","CreatedById":112361,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T19:10:34Z","Content":"I\u0027ve never heard of such a thing, tho the idea is an interesting one...
