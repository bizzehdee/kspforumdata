Liquid fuel does.\n\nOnce you can use ISRU converters, iyou can exploit this.\n\nLaunch a ISRU converter with many full ore tanks \u002B many fuel tanks with no liquid fuel \u002B launch clamps to supply power.\n\nTurn on the converter, have it make liquid fuel.\n\nTime warp until all the ore is consumed.\n\nRecover.\n\nProfit.\n\nI just did a trial.\n\n14 empty orange tanks, 14 full large ore tanks, probe core, 6 convertors, 6 gigantors, a lot of launch clamps.\n\nLaunch cost: 154,424\n\nRecovered funds: 186,562\n\n\u003E20% return, over 1 night (3 hours) - I just time warped as I wanted KSC in daylight for a SSTO recovery, I don\u0027t know how much time it actually took to convert everything (I had it convert the remaining ore to Ox after LF was full).\n\nLooking at the unit cost of resources, monoprop should give an even better return: 1.2 funds per unit instead of 0.8 for LF.\n\nIts also slightly lighter per unit, but I\u0027m not sure you get a 1:1 mass conversion ratio for monoprop. (in the .cfg file, it seems ot have a 0.5:1 input:output ratio for the monoprop module...1 unit of ore = 2 units of monoprop I guess, but that means 1 ton of ore converts to .8 tons of Monoprop)\n\nIt seems like basically, you can spam empty fuel tanks \u002B full ore tanks, and get free funds without doing contracts, or launching any vessel."},{"CreatedByName":"kStrout","CreatedById":116630,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T18:58:55Z","Content":"I imagine they will fix this, but you should still be able to make mining bases and transfer the fuel back home for funds, after all, that\u0027s legitimate."},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T19:02:12Z","Content":"Did it take 3 hours in real time?

Besides, isn\u0027t the whole point of ISRU to save some funds? It enables you to refuel without using more rockets to send out a tanker, or just making the first rocket enormous.

It sounds instead like you\u0027re referring to some mod, but not giving us enough context to understand your post.\n\nokay, I thought mentioning extra planetary launchpads (the mod) is obvious enough.\n\nsimple explanation: that mod adds an ore, a metal and rocketparts, aswell as a way to construct vessels anywhere. the orbital dock and the extraplanetary launchpad-part act as a sort of docking-port, where a new vessel can spawn. vessels just cost their mass in rocketparts, yet the value in roots depends on the value of each part.\n\nfor example: a small probe core is 50kg, a few instruments like thermometers and so give a total value of 100kg, and yet the vessel is worth more than 50000 roots, which can be easily recovered.\n\nin other words, the same problem which surfaced here in ksp stock already existed in several mods which by themselves added harvestable resources and production.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-21T19:53:34Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2015 07:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hotblack Desiato**"},{"CreatedByName":"amorymeltzer","CreatedById":111542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T19:48:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s just a manufacturing facility.
