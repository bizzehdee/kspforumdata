And I would like to give some suggestions (if they are not already in the game) Well, there could be a system of problems that could happen in your rocket, like there was a problem with your energy / solar panel, you have to get out of the rocket with your Kerbal and fix it, and if it\u0027s just an electric rocket (without a crew) you have to take a manned rocket to the rocket and pack it up! It would be really cool, because most of the time in normal KSP you don\u0027t have to get off the rocket, and that\u0027s kind of boring. Because in real life most of the time, astronauts go out to fix things on rockets. I think it would be really cool. Well, now I have another suggestion, when you have a space station you can have cameras inside it, where your kerbals can be walking and you can see them through the cameras, or you can control it inside the rocket, it would be really cool ! Cameras everywhere Well, I only gave these two suggestions, sorry for the bad English I am not an American.

However, to be worthwhile it would need to be a pretty rich system -- for example, engines should have some base failure probability and be rated for a certain burn time, after which the failure probability would start going up. You\u0027d want to deal with stuff like micrometeorite damage and thermal stress; a spaceplane for example would experience wear and tear in its airframe when flying fast and high. You\u0027d want to be able to design in failure modes, for example if one engine in a cluster fails, automatically shut down the one opposite it so the craft doesn\u0027t spin out of control. And you\u0027d want to have a system that lets you service reusable craft so they\u0027re fully shipshape for new missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn other words it would be a pretty complex beast, and it would make the game a lot harder and more frustrating for lots of players. Just having parts fail at random and not being able to do anything about it except go out and click \u0022repair\u0022 isn\u0027t much fun, it\u0027s just busywork.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope it\u0027ll be possible to mod that kind of thing in, but I don\u0027t think it would work as a stock feature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
