For real propellers, this is not a problem since the propellers spin very quickly;\u00A0but for a custom-KSP made propeller, there will be a speed at which your propeller doesn\u0027t produce any acceleration, and above that speed, it will even slow down your plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Note that actual life is a bit more complicated, but this \u0022speed of airflow\u0022 is a good approximation considering KSP\u0027s simple aerodynamic model)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tomtom100","CreatedById":161963,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-18T22:40:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut as there is no such thing like actual air in KSP then why my plopeler start making lifting force in wrong direction as i move even at 0,5m/s. Drag should increase with speed. But why the side on which lifting force is created change. I know how real plane works, but well KSP dont use real physics, that\u0027s why i ask.
