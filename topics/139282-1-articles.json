Need some help troubleshooting","CreatedByName":"MitchS","CreatedById":163568,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-08T04:50:24Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"MitchS","CreatedById":163568,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-08T04:50:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi, all. Never posted on these forums before (despite lurking for many ksp-addicted months--I like this community a lot!) so please forgive and be patient with me if I\u0027m doing it wrong. I promise to be coachable.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI messed up my ckan-managed\u00A0version of 1.0.5 (RO/RP-0,etc) by letting my game version update to 1.1--and I didn\u0027t really understand the importance of backups or how to use them until now. Now\u00A0my game\u00A0isn\u0027t compatible with my crucial mods anymore\u00A0because they\u00A0haven\u0027t updated in the ckan network to 1.1 compatibility.\u00A0I\u00A0don\u0027t care to play unless it\u0027s on an RO/RP-0 modded copy, so until they update, I decided to manually\u00A0build from a fresh\u00A01.0.5(.1028)\u00A0copy of the game (without ckan, gulp) by finding the last, most updated,\u00A01.0.5-compatible versions of my desired mods.\u00A0I\u00A0picked through mod pages\u0027\u00A0changelists and github release logs to find what would have been the most current versions\u00A0before the 1.1 update and added them onto my 1.0.5 copy... makes sense to me--let me know if that actually isn\u0027t how it works. I think I learned a lot about the mod process, and I\u0027m confident that all of them are both correctly selected\u00A0and correctly installed.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEverything works mostly well (against all odds--I understand computer directories well enough, but I\u0027m no programmer), and I have the RO and RP-0 that I wanted, plus some others. But it looks like some mods aren\u0027t showing up in-game--and some of the interface icons for the toolbars aren\u0027t showing up at all or are showing up blank. Namely, the ones that aren\u0027t showing up are Mechjeb2, KerbalEngineer, and MJ\u0026amp;KEforall. (How am I supposed to optimize my sounding rockets?!)\u00A0I\u0027m fairly\u00A0certain that I have the \u0022most recent versions\u0022 for every\u00A0mod in use (the latest non-1.1 builds), and the game (finally) actually does load\u00A0and run\u00A0just fine, so the typical module manager and \u0022multiple copies of mods\u0022\u00A0issues probably aren\u0027t the culprit anymore. Does anyone have any idea what the problem might be?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd while I\u0027m at it, I\u0027m curious if someone can give me a run-through of what I need to know to better understand ksp mods. For example, what exactly are config files, .dlls, and whatever else I need to understand to be able to troubleshoot my own mod installs? Or, if such a resource already exists, I\u0027d be happy to go check it out if I knew where to find it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nLet me know if you need any more info.\u00A0Here\u0027s a couple of pictures of directories you might find relevant, plus the list of .zip files that show mod version numbers:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/6Xe1v\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/6Xe1v\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks a lot, everyone.

A few issues right off the bat...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n1) Ditch Active Texture Management - its basically obsolete for 1.0.5... You can try Dynamic Texture Loader, by the same guy... People had mixed results in saving RAM with it, so it may/may not help...You have to try it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n2)the Toolbar mod is not in the correct folder. You have ksp_toolbar-1.7.10... That should be in a folder in GameData called /000_Toolbar\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3)Same with your MechJeb folder... That should be called in a folder called /MechJeb2 ...\u00A0 Also, you have an older version of it for 1.0.2... For 1.0.5, the last version was 2.5.6.0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) Also, your ModuleManager is a version outdated... Last 1.0.5 version is 2.6.20...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5) Oh, and I think you may have grabbed the wrong SXT .zip... Yours says \u0022master\u0022...Thats usually just all the uncompiled source files for a mod...You dont want that... Try redownloading it... You want v24 for 1.0.5... If you grab it from Github, you want to click \u0022releases\u0022, scroll down to v24, and there will be 2 or three blue links under it... Usually the top one is the one you want, and the name of the mod as the filename.zip, the one or two under it are usually \u0022Source.zip\u0022... Those are the ones you DONT want to grab...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6) the Desktop is one of the worst places you can put your KSP install folder, also... You want it in a non-system folder also... So something like C:\\KSP should be OK...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have a spreadsheet that has just about every mod you have, that tells me the last versions for 1.0.5... I HAVE to go to bed...I can barely stay awake, but I\u0027ll try to go thru your mods tomorrow, if no one else does by then...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-08T05:26:55Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2016 05:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Stone Blue\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MitchS","CreatedById":163568,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-08T18:05:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you!!

Most of the system folders (ie Windows, Program Files, Program Files (x86), ProgramData, AND Desktop) have limited permissions and access rights for users... This is to protect non-computer savvy users from accidentally messing up system files, as well as to help protect those files \u0026amp; folders from easily having viruses \u0026amp; malware written to them...
