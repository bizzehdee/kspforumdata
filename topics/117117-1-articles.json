But most of these are two years old and I\u0027m not sure if things have changed or not. I\u0027ve used gravity braking and small assists often enough that I\u0027m comfortable with them and I understand the concept. I am currently trying to send stuff to Jool via an Eve gravity assist. I\u0027ve seen that you can save somewhere around 1000k\u002B\u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv if done correctly and even sloppily. This doesn\u0027t make sense to me because the \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv to get to Eve is around 1080, while Kerbin-\u0026gt;Jool is ~1900, according to the Olex calculator. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial;\u0022\u003EI actually have a near perfect transfer window lined up currently, I\u0027ll arrive at Eve within 5 days of Eve-\u0026gt;Jool.

I haven\u0027t ever tried using Eve for a gravity assist to Jool, but you\u0027re correct that generally speaking, you\u0027ll need to spend at least as much as it takes to get to Eve in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne key thing is that to get a proper assist from Eve, you\u0027ll want your initial burn to be slightly higher delta-V.

It\u0027s similar to the real life mercury missions where multiple Venus flybys were done. It takes more time, but you save dV. For these kinds of maneuvers, you spend either dV, or time.

The simplest way, going from Kerbin to a flyby of Eve and then directly from Eve to Jool, is not practical. Eve does not have the gravity to throw you to Jool all by itself. You can flyby Eve really fast (leave Kerbin at over 2900m/s from a 75x75km orbit, way more than the ~1950m/s that would get you straight to Jool) and if you time it right you will continue on to Jool from Eve. Or as you point out, you can do a huge thrust at Eve to turn your orbit more than Eve can do by itself and add energy. Either way is more expensive than a direct Kerbin-Jool route.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I know of two cheap ways to get to Jool:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) K-E-K-J. You flyby Eve and then flyby Kerbin before heading on to Jool. There is always a K-E-K-J path available in any given 350-(Earth)day period. The required start boost varies from about 1230m/s to about 1530m/s depending on the window. Using a flyby of Mun would save another 50-70 m/s.

Using two flybys of Kerbin allows Kerbin to point your solar orbit in just the right direction to get to Jool with a minimum of starting dV. I fly this path with lots of pictures and explanation of what I\u0027m doing\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80455-How-To-Go-From-Low-Kerbin-Orbit-to-Jool-Orbit-for-1051-m-s\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E here.\u003C/a\u003E Note that on my second try (further down in that post) I got from the 75x75km orbit around Kerbin to an orbit around Jool for 1011m/s by using a Mun flyby as well. Without the Mun flyby it would be about 1070m/s. This path is not unique either, but the only other one I\u0027ve found costs about 1160m/s. I don\u0027t know of a great tool for finding double flybys so these are quite hard to find.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere may be ways that involve a double flyby of Eve out there, but I haven\u0027t found one. I only know of two programs that search for flybys in KSP, my \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80978-Flyby-Finder-for-KSP-V0-60\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFlyby Finder\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36476-WIN-MAC-KSP-Trajectory-Optimization-Tool-v1-4-0-RemoteTech-Comm-Analysis-Tools!\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EArrowstar\u0027s TOT. \u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Neither one searches for double flybys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd regarding your other question, the Kerbol planets have had the same orbits and masses since at least version 0.22 so anything that worked back then would work now. The big change is that time used to be kept in \u0027Earth style\u0027 with 24-hour days and 365-day years, nowadays Kerbin time is used with 6-hour days and 426-day years, be careful to figure out which time style is being used when someone describes a departure or flyby date. I always used to use Earth time, but recently I redid the K-E-K-K-J mission using Kerbol time \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117415-SSTO-to-laythe-and-beyond?p=2074863\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post2074863\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Also, it is very, very hard to fly multi-flyby missions without a node editor, if you\u0027re not using one and you want to try these paths then you should probably try one.

Randomly selected windows seem to cost in the 1100s, add 50m/s or so minimum for course corrections and you are around 1200. My 1011m/s was a result of finding one particular window that is exceptionally good, and practicing it many times with variations to figure out the tricks. That second pass of Kerbin and the deep-space correction around Duna\u0027s orbit are particularly tricky, the first path I find often needs 100m/s or more of adjustments, but extensive tweaking (30-60 real-world minutes!) ultimately finds one around 5-10m/s if I timed the earlier flybys right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E In any case it sounds like you are doing it right.
