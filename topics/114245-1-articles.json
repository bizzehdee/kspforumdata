No Error is captured by the game.\n\n - Flight Basics\n\n - Docking\n\n - Orbiting 101\n\n - To The Mun, Part 1\n\n - To The Mun, Part 2\n\n - Asteroid Redirect Mission, Part 1\n\n - Asteroid Redirect Mission, Part 2\n\nAdditionally, I did Start Game \u003E Start New \u003E Science. That loaded fine. I was able to go into the VAB and place a Mk1 Command Pod and the only solid fuel booster. But clicking the Mk16 Parachute also causes CTD.\n\nAlso, the game was playable with 1.0.2 (with only the occasional crash); but I no longer have that version to double check.\n\n**Output Files:** (Specifically for trying to load Docking Training)\n\nKSP.log [http://hastebin.com/uholowabuw.vbs](http://hastebin.com/uholowabuw.vbs)\n\nPlayer.log [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-wHLA1hDj9vc3JxQjVMRXlXMm8/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-wHLA1hDj9vc3JxQjVMRXlXMm8/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**System Specs**\n\nOS: Linux 3.19 Ubuntu 15.04 64bit\n\nCPU: Intel\u00AE Pentium\u00AE CPU G860 @ 3.00GHz (2)\n\nRAM: 7949\n\nGPU: AMD Radeon HD 5800 Series (428MB) (Using Proprietary AMD Radeon HD 5870 drivers)\n\nSM: 30 (OpenGL 4.4 [4.4.13374 Compatibility Profile Context 15.20.1013])\n\nRT Formats: ARGB32, Depth, ARGBHalf, RGB565, ARGB4444, ARGB1555, Default, DefaultHDR, ARGBFloat, RGFloat, RGHalf, RFloat, RHalf, R8\n\n**Clean Installatiion:** Yes, deleted files in ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Kerbal Space Program and reinstalled via steam.\n\n**Edit:** Parachute bug already reported: [http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/5169](http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/5169)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-26T13:39:35Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2015 01:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by shjohnson.pi**\n  \nAdded link to a reported bug"},{"CreatedByName":"Chrozayis","CreatedById":146976,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T14:38:31Z","Content":"I have similar specs and running mint, I can run scenarios but I have vehicles that can\u0027t be loaded in the VAB without a CTD"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T14:50:58Z","Content":"Yes, there appears to be an issue with KSP 1.0.4 on Mint that causes KSP to crash when it catches certain exceptions that would normally be handled (and are handled cleanly on other OSes). E.g. the selecting a parachute causes rapid log spam of exception messages on other OSes but seems to kill KSP when running on Mint. The [latest working theory](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/126462-1-0-4-Parachutes-throwing-exceptions?p=2042835\u0026viewfull=1#post2042835) is a library mismatch.
