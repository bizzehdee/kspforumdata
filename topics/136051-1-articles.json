I got up the greatest minds of kerbality to create a fully self sustaining mothership, refineries, launchpads and much more included, designed to establish bases at all planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, with most things like ore cannisters, containers and stuff unloaded, my mothership can go for 0.9 m/s\u00B2, even much less when even half filled(but at least i can get somewhere).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe question is: HOW MUCH actually is needed for a proper mothership?

An average of 2.6 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E probably meant I started with a TWR of about 0.2.
