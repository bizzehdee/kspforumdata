I would then suggest using a \u003Cem\u003Esandbox\u003C/em\u003E game to be able to do a lot of experiments to learn from explosions without worrying about funds.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nLooking at your plane, let me guess about a few things that could probably be improved. First, please try the 3 buttons in the bottom left corner: the left one shows the \u003Cem\u003Ecenter of mass\u003C/em\u003E, the right one shows \u003Cem\u003Ecenter of lift\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nYou probably want the center of lift to be a bit behind the center of mass, for stability. (Maybe it already is.)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYour elevons are probably very near the center of mass, where they have too little leverage. Try elevators at the back of the plane.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYour main wheels should be close to the center of mass, otherwise it\u0027s too difficult for the elevators to raise the nose for takeoff.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere seem to be only air-breathing engines on the plane. That\u0027s fine for an \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eair\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003Eplane, but won\u0027t work to go to \u003Cem\u003Espace\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA good part of the plane\u0027s weight is the fuel. As the fuel is consumed during flight, the weight of all the parts will become larger \u003Cem\u003Erelative to the combined weight\u003C/em\u003E of parts \u002B fuel.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYour plane has a heavy part (cockpit) in the front, and no \u0022counter\u0022 weight in the back. As fuel gets depleted over time, the center of mass will move forward as a consequence. Which will change the way the plane flies.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBecause of this, it is desirable to have the center of mass stay in roughly the same place regardless of how full the tanks are.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLanding gears are a bit weird in KSP 1.1.x.
