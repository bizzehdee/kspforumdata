That is why they start rockets before they let the rocket go and why they do the SRB\u0027s last in the launch sequence.\n\nHere is a Youtube video of a Gemini abort at the last moment: \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htmd4BrNJ5k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htmd4BrNJ5k)\n\nIf you listen to the commentary for the Gemini launch you will hear them mention that at 77% throttle, 1.6 seconds before launch a shutdown is not possible. I think that is a Gemini thing and not rockets in general.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-28T20:32:17Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2015 08:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Leszek**"},{"CreatedByName":"Beowolf","CreatedById":48927,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T20:43:30Z","Content":"Numerous launches have aborted after main engine ignition. Many rockets are designed so they don\u0027t release the launch clamps until all the engines are stable at full thrust. I don\u0027t know specifically about the Saturn V, but the shuttles could definitely abort after main engine ignition but before they lit the SRBs."},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T07:43:16Z","Content":"Falcon 9 goes full trust before releasing the clamps as I understand.
