There could be a part that allows the player to create a tiny \u0022repair drone\u0022 that would allow an unmanned craft to be \u0022self-servicing\u0022. This way you aren\u0027t undergoing such high risk of failure in sending a probe on a long trip to a distant place like Jool or Eeloo. As I see it, it would probably the size of the stock atmospheric instrument nose cone thing (single, bottom attachment point as well) but with some cameras and lights, and little robotic manipulators as well as maybe a welder or something. You could slap it on top of the thin octo probe core, along with a tiny monoprop tank and RCS thrusters and a mini docking port. It would deploy from it\u0027s mother ship, retrieve some parts from a part box, then go to repair the malfunction and return to it\u0027s port. For those malfunctions that get worse over time this would be cool because it would be more difficult to control and if it could only carry one part at a time you are racing back and forth trying to lock down the problem. This seems like it would be a very cool addition, since it adds more that the player has to think about and do before launching a mission, as well as more to do durning a mission. I made \u0022mockup\u0022 of how it might work, with the atmosphere sensor as the \u0022Repair Drone Unit\u0022.
