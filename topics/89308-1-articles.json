I didn\u0027t think FAR simulates laminar flow, but just does some fancy raycasting and math to simulate aerodynamic forces. The reason for them in real life is because you get smooth laminar flow along the whole wing. Without them, you\u0027ll get pressure gradients which would cause extra drag at the wingtips making your plane less efficient. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hate to be :that guy: but can I get a citation from ferram saying this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
