I\u0027ve been goofing around with my game a bit. I\u0027ve gotten several of the mods to work correctly and I\u0027ve realized that some mods are dependent upon others. And the \u0027toolbar 000\u0027 thing... and the parts.. and the models... and ... well. Let\u0027s just say that I find it all just a little bit confusing. I\u0027ve gotten all of this stuff to work at one time or another, but as I was toying around with the latest addition to my game, I noticed that the mechjeb had stopped working. It was still there, but the tab had disappeared from my flight display. In my attempt to fix this, I think I broke my game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I have re-installed a vanilla version of my game, and I want to set it up with particular mods (namely: Mechjeb2, Kethane, InternalRobotics, Firespitter, DMagic Orbital Science, BioDomes, and B9... and I believe I need to have Toolbar 1.71??)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was wondering, since there seems to be some requirements for some of the mods.. and some conflicts... Is there a recommended process for setting up your game.. ie, Once you install your game, first you add mechjeb2, then add the firespitter mod, next the B9, next add ... etc, etc...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould I get a little advice, please?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-19T01:09:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGenerally speaking, before you add a new mod to your game, make sure you first read and install the dependencies required by said mod before you install the mod itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince that sentence is a bit of a tongue-twister, here\u0027s a more concrete example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Let\u0027s pretend you wanted to try out my \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35043-0-20-FusTek-Station-Parts-Expansion\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFusTek Station Parts\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Before you do anything else, you would first read my official announcements thread\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The threads says that you need the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/70161-0-23-5-Connected-Living-Space-%28API%29-v1-0-4-0-%281st-May-2014%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EConnected Living Spaces (CLS)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E plugin (codepoet), for determining which compartments are habitable/traversable\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/snjo/Firespitter/releases\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFirespitter\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E plugin V6.4 prerelease (Snjo), for various tweakable part animations\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64117-0-23-5-Modular-Fuel-Tanks-v4-3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EModular Fuel Tanks\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E v5.0.3 plugin (taniwha), for reconfigurable propellant tank in the Resupply module\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E -\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219-Module-Manager-2-0-3-%28Apr-22%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EModuleManager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E plugin (sarbian), for applying patches for functionality/features provided by dependencies and third-party add-ons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/62270-0-23-5-Ship-Manifest-%28Crew-Science-Resources%29-v0-23-5-3-2-2-2-May-14\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EShip Manifest\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E plugin (Papa_Joe), for transferring crew between non-airlock compartments without EVA\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - You would thus install those dependencies first before you would install FusTek itself (in theory, you can also install them in any order you want, but in practice that would cause unforeseen problems with compatibility).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can be understandably frustrating to find that when installing one add-on, you\u0027re asked to install a whole bunch of other ones - this is because some add-ons make use of other add-ons that perform a particular feature really well, which makes more sense than for FusTek to say, code its own version of CLS/Firespitter/ModularFuelTanks/MM/Ship Manifest from scratch and effectively reinvent the wheel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
