Yes, there is probably enough nuclear fuel in a large RTG to give everyone on the planet a lethal dose, but if you split the fuel up into small enough chunk, the rate at which the radiation is released by each one is going to be so slow that it\u0027s going to take longer than human life span to do so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause Plutonium-239 has fairly long half-life, in tens of thousands of years, to give off dangerous levels of radiation it needs to be reasonably concentrated. That means if you spread the RTG fuel over a large chunk of Florida\u0027s coast, it\u0027s not going to be a total disaster. Situation with nuclear meltdowns is actually very different and produces short-lived isotopes that are the real danger, and there isn\u0027t enough fuel in RTG to result in a meltdown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut more generally, dispersal isn\u0027t going to be even that bad. The rocket will become a chemical fireball in the worst case scenario. That\u0027s probably enough to melt some of the fuel, but not to evaporate it. Most of the fuel will end up landing in a very small area. Some of it might turn into a molten spray and cover a slightly larger area. This can still be bad if this lands in populated area, but rocket landing in populated area isn\u0027t much better. Given typical trajectories, this will most likely result in some radiation of either area around the launch pad or over the ocean, but nothing too serious, so long as majority of the fuel is promptly recovered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, it is a hazard, but not as bad as it might sound. It\u0027s comparable to all of the standard hazards of lighting a controlled explosion under a giant tank of (frequently toxic) fuels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-28T02:56:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s little if any chance that a RTG module would be dispersed in mid air.
