Eating humans is just unlikely - we\u0027d probably be down right poisonous. Space is large enough that \u0022living room\u0022 doesn\u0027t make sense either - just move on to the next planet. And resources? If you can travel between stars, resources are a laughably easy problem to solve. (The Martian Way by Isaac Asimov is my favorite example of solving this.) Really, the one thing aliens would come to Earth would be to take the one thing they can\u0027t find somewhere else - our culture. So my story idea is that someone discovers that several world-famous paintings/sculptures, etc are fakes. They end up being approached by someone who claims to be working for Interpol, but that turns out to be a lie - rather they are working for an interstellar indigenous people protection agency. His job is to find out who is stealing Earth\u0027s artifacts, and return them, without the Earthlings finding out. My idea for the climax was that the thieves get found out, and decide to stop bothering with replacing the real articles with fakes - they decide to steal the whole Statue of Liberty. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFreely given, have at it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rainbowtrout","CreatedById":60253,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T21:06:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a book, I like to have developed characters.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InterCity","CreatedById":98462,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T21:12:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for all these tips...
