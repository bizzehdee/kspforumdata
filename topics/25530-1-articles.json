Hence the high G loads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7G is not the limit of human tolerance, though. 8G\u002B is not unheard of for fighter pilots. Aircraft carrier take-off is going to be in the 6-8G range. Higher G loads can be pulled for certain maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother factor is duration. Tens of G are entirely survivable if the duration is very short. It takes quite a bit before you start having actual tissue failure. Typically, the first thing that happens is the pilot blacking out due to blood pooling at the extremities. If this condition is maintained for too long, brain damage can occur, followed by death. At higher G loads, you can have blood vessels rupture in even shorter time, which can also lead to severe injuries or fatalities. All depends on how long the acceleration is maintained, what orientation the pilot is in, and whether you have any special seats and/or suits to assist him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe highest load I\u0027ve been under is 3G.
