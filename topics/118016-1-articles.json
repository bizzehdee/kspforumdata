He explained one thing but I\u0027ll explain another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJet engines consume 2 resources: LiquidFuel and IntakeAir. LF is in fuel tanks, IA is created by intakes. But under the hood, the only difference between them is their names--the game handles consumption the same for all resources. Thus, for the engine to run, the ship must have tanks of both, from which the engine draws LF and IA in the proper ratio to function, same as a rocket needing tanks of both LF and O.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, when you read the stats of an intake, you\u0027ll see a rating for IntakeAir. This is actually the capacity of the \u0022tank\u0022 of IA. This number is of no significance whatsoever because what really matters is the rate at which the intake creates IA to fill this \u0022tank\u0022. If the intake makes IA faster than the engine consumes it, then the \u0022tank\u0022 will remain full (as shown on the resource list). If the engine consumes more AI than the intakes can make, then the IA resource bar will go away and the engine will flame out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rate of IA creation is a complicated function of the intakes area (it\u0027s most important stat) and the speed and altitude of the plane. The bigger the area, the more IA you make regardless of other conditions. The higher you fly, the thinner the air so the less IA you make. The faster you go, the more air can be swept up in a given time by the intake, so the more IA you make.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack in pre-1.0 days, that was about all there was to it. This let you use multiple intakes per engine, so that you always had enough intake area to keep the engine supplied with IA even at ridiculously high altitudes, and SSTOs could leave the atmosphere on jets alone, needing only a tiny bit of rocket to circularize. But since 1.0, jet engines have had a thrust vs. altitude curve applied to them. This makes it so they just flat lose all their thrust at about 25km without flaming out, even with beaucoup IA available. Because of this, there is no longer any point in using multiple intakes per engine. What\u0027s the point of having extra IA if the engine can\u0027t use it anyway?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T15:36:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022selfish_meme\u0022 data-cite=\u0022selfish_meme\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso use shock cone intakes they are the least draggy, even better than any nosecone you can put on\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou know... people keep telling me this, but I ain\u0027t so sure.

Something else very non-intuitive is more air does not mean more thrust, at least for ram jets. I used to think that more velocity meant more air intake, which meant more thrust to the ram jets. I.e. an indirect relationship. This is not true. It seems ram jet thrust is directly related to velocity, and air intake affects it only when you don\u0027t have enough air to supply it\u0027s demand. The air demand itself is a function of speed\u002Baltitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI notice when taking off, according to Kerbal Engineer, I\u0027m only using 20% of my air intake with ram jets, and as I go faster at the same altitude I\u0027m using a greater percentage. Which indicates that velocity factors directly into the equation of how much air\u002Bthrust your jets will use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used to think it was an indirect relationship: My engines increased thrust as I accelerated because my intakes were in turn capturing more air. Not true though. If that were the case, then you\u0027d see 100% air intake usage at takeoff, and then you could attribute the increasing thrust due to increasing speed capturing more air. For example my \u003Cstrong\u003Eair intake demand\u003C/strong\u003E goes from around 0.2 up to 1.08, but the entire time my \u003Cstrong\u003Eair intake supply\u003C/strong\u003E is always greater. So at no time is air supply a limiting factor. The only thing changing is my velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you use Kerbal Engineer and add the air intake demand and air intake supply fields from the Vessel section, you\u0027ll be able to determine if at any point during your flight you don\u0027t have enough air intakes to meet demand. Consider though sometimes the small amount of demand an extra air intake will meet, will not provide enough thrust to counter act the drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother example: On re-entry I\u0027ll get below 32k altitude and have .3 air intake, and the engines won\u0027t cut on until around 25k. Now you might say there wasn\u0027t enough air to overcome flameout, however when they cut on around 25k there is .6 air intake supply, and the engine\u0027s demand is only .2. So this indicates there was more than enough air intake for the engines demand at 32k altitude. It simply was that the engine has a direct relationship with altitude\u002Bvelocity rather than air intake. Air intake doesn\u0027t determine thrust, it can only limit thrust when there\u0027s not enough air. It\u0027s very non-intuitive in my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T22:41:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AaronLS\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AaronLS\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve done tests like this with nose cones and it\u0027s straightforward, but when you introduce air breathing engines it becomes alot more complicated as some profiles only really shine on a lower angle of ascent where they have time to accelerate in thick air.
