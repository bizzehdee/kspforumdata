I know that KSP is a 32-bit game, which means that it supports and can use up to and not over 4 gigabytes of RAM. However, on my machine, it isn\u0027t even using two. I always have CoreTemp running in the background, and it says that my RAM usage only goes up by just over a gigabyte, far short of the maximum of 4. Is there a way to make the game use up more of my RAM, and therefore run faster/smoother/whatever might happen? I have 6 GB in my machine, and most of it just sits idle while the game runs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-08T22:36:10Z\u0022 title=\u002210/08/2013 10:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by tstehler1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-08T22:32:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe game only uses the RAM it needs. Performance issues are caused by the physics calculations, which is a function of your processor. You only ever need to worry about the RAM limit when you are loading lots of parts and textures. If you have a very low mod load, RAM usage is small.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tstehler1","CreatedById":61706,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-08T22:35:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see.

I suggest getting one that has very high clock speed PER core, NOT combined. I believe you can roughly estimate this by dividing clock speed by the number of threads (take into account processors that run multiple threads per core like an i7) you have.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lammatt","CreatedById":21777,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-08T23:32:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eif you run the game w/o mod, it takes ~1gb only\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
