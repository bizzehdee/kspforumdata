I picked up a Logitech Extreme 3D Pro at Best Buy, but looking at it it doesn\u0027t look like much of a step up - the button placement on the base looks a little awkward, and the throttle looks like a similar paddle lever that you\u0027d end up rolling with your thumb like what I already have. I\u0027ve been reading reviews which mentioned the Thrustmaster HOTAS X and it has caught my attention - I thought it might be fun to get a HOTAS stick of some kind but I can\u0027t justify the cost associated with a traditional HOTAS setup. Does that kind of flexibility and feel justify the extra $20 (they\u0027re both available from Best Buy, which is a plus for me).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, does it have a hat switch? I\u0027m trying to identify the 12 buttons advertised and they\u0027re not at all obvious in their placement, and it doesn\u0027t mention a hat switch at all as far as I can tell. But one of the features \u003Cem\u003Elooks\u003C/em\u003E like one. In the past I had an F-16 fighterstick (which never really worked for me), but it had four different hat switches. If it doesn\u0027t have one, it\u0027s out of the running; it\u0027s a must-have for camera control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any info.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qwertyx2y","CreatedById":22588,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T08:28:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI got a T-flight HOTAS X for Christmas to replace my missing Extreme 3d. The Hotas X is a very nice joystick, and it has a very nice separate throttle, which you can detach and move a short distance the throttle is attached via a cable. In my opinion, it is a much better joystick than the Logitech one and comes pre configured for FSX and HAWX. The stick also comes with the hat switch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-13T04:40:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a hell of a necro, but I\u0027m about to pull the trigger and buy a Thrustmaster T-Flight HOTAS - but the question right now is whether the older \u0022X\u0022 or the newer \u00224\u0022 is the best option.

Several posters on this forum have commented that such a feature would be very useful, and I\u0027m inclined to agree. Is this feature gone from the HOTAS 4?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe HOTAS X is a true 5-axis stick, with the throttle rocker separate from the twist grip. The documentation for the HOTAS 4 seems to say they are not separate, just two different ways to apply yaw? (this is the most important question, if they aren\u0027t separate then the \u0022X\u0022 is definitely the answer)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe HOTAS 4 has better sensors and a smaller dead zone?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe HOTAS 4 has up-gradeable firmware. How much of an issue is this, really?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe HOTAS 4 can daisy-chain a new pedals unit.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone have experience with the HOTAS 4 that could chime in about any of these details?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
