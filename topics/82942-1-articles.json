For instance, VTOL aircraft can be created using vernier engines with RCS turned on and using the IJKLHN keys. The obvious advantage of RCS is that its thrust is always applied at CoM (if possible). It would be better if we could set any engines to work with RCS and vice versa. Thus, for craft with asymmetry engines, (but engines at either side of CoM), they could be set to work with RCS and controlled with IJKLHN keys. However, the only problem with this is that IJKLHN are all-or-nothing and does not allow you to throttle your thrust. hmmm......\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt Snuggler","CreatedById":65092,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-26T15:39:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this idea, but I think it should definitely be handled by an additional part like you say. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe Inline Advanced Stabilizer is kind of redundant these days and would be a good contender for being re-purposed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/images/thumb/7/72/Inline_advanced_stabilizer.png/190px-Inline_advanced_stabilizer.png\u0022 alt=\u0022190px-Inline_advanced_stabilizer.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecall it a \u0022thrust control computer\u0022? that way it can be unlocked further down the tech tree and there will also be an additional weight and part count penalty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E*Edit: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022arkie87\u0022 data-cite=\u0022arkie87\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eand i would even say it should be enabled default so that beginners dont even notice the issues associated with placing engines slightly offset from CoM.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei would think this should be one of the first things a beginner should notice. if it where added it should be a high level part. unlocked in the mid to late game.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-26T15:43:30Z\u0022 title=\u002208/26/2014 03:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Capt Snuggler\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-26T15:46:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah Capt Snuggler, that\u0027s the part I was referring to.

Sometimes there is no realistic alternative to breaking existing craft and saves, it\u0027s a necessary cost of progress. This is absolutely not one of those situations, as there\u0027s absolutely no reason why the IAS needs to be removed for this suggestion to go forward. There\u0027s nothing obsolete, broken, redundant, etc here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-03T14:49:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Etheres no need to remove it I think. make it a hair more expensive, and let it also have the toggle-able balance thrust option. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ejust like adding the suspension option to the landing gear, that didn\u0027t break all the saved craft with landing gear.

But be warned: there is terrible side effect. If you turn in the same direction often, you will burn more fuel on one side of your ship, causing a weight imbalance, burnings lots of fuel just to balance things out again. if you Turn in the same direction too often, you will have to stop and transfer fuel just to fly straight enough to overcome the imbalance... by burning more fuel. Great on early takeoff, and a possible nightmare in space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
