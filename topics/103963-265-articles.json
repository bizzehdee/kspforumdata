Perhaps it doesn\u0027t happen to everyone\n\u003E \n\nHmm, I only need KSP 1.3.0 and a freshly unzipped Scatterer 320b to create the NREs. See [here](https://youtu.be/n1warM7qcDE).  Maybe it helps finding it. o/\n\nIn my normal career I load the game, switch to my minmus drilling rig and directly get the same continous NRE\u0027s. Cause of that I need to switch off the ocean shaders.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-28T00:31:43Z\u0022 title=\u002208/28/2017 12:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 28, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Jebs\\_SY**"},{"CreatedByName":"andymwat","CreatedById":180962,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-28T02:13:37Z","Content":"Are there any mirrors for the downloads?
