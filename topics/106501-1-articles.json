I knew it wouldnt do much since I only had the 15 units of mono from a command pod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcept when Val got back in the pod, I noticed the pod\u0027s mono wasnt being consumed.

It didn\u0027t work as well in practice as it did in theory, and without a total rewrite of the RCS flow logic, which we just didn\u0027t have the time for, we had to think of something else. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, this feature was causing more aggravation than enjoyment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere were other issues as well, for instance, the mono on EVA suits had to be \u0027hacked\u0027 to zero density, otherwise the added weight would make Kerbals unable to walk properly (just those 5 units of mono was several times heavier than they are themselves). The EVA propellant resource can have its own defined properties, so it works without having to resort to hacky fixes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe switch to EVA prop solved all those issues without having to do a full reversal back to the old system.

A kerbal is 93-94kg in EVA suit. Also several mods have added monoprop AND life support to suits with no ill effects, even though the kerbals were carrying more than 20kg.
