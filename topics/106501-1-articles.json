The launch from kerbin was terrible, intercept was highly inefficient, and the landing was worse. I only managed to get to low minmus orbit on the way back and the fuel was gone. \n\nSo for some reason and got out to push. I knew it wouldnt do much since I only had the 15 units of mono from a command pod. \n\nExcept when Val got back in the pod, I noticed the pod\u0027s mono wasnt being consumed. She could refill her tank each time she got in the pod.\n\nSo long story short, after some 5 hours playing and some 35 trips back to the command pod and a slingshot around the mun I managed to get back! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nI was happy I made it back but I\u0027m wondering if it\u0027s supposed to be like that.. I had no RCS controls in the ship and that might have triggered an infinite mono bug I believe."},{"CreatedByName":"LN400","CreatedById":140595,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T06:56:37Z","Content":"That\u0027s not a bug, I believe. It\u0027s been this way for I don\u0027t know how long but at least since 0.90. Someone else might chime in with a more accurate answer there.\n\nI think of it as the EVA mono prop fuel is not the same as the mono prop used by the ship\u0027s RCS and the command pod has these tanks inside. Go IVA and look around, the Mk I has these tiny tanks, why not think that\u0027s where they store the \u0022EVA mono prop fuel\u0022?"},{"CreatedByName":"adinfinitum","CreatedById":49226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T07:02:09Z","Content":"As far as I know it\u0027s not necessarily a bug, just something that\u0027s always been like that. I vaguely recall the devs wanting to make the MMU pack use mono fuel to refuel. \n\nKudos to you for getting back so far by getting out and pushing, thats pretty much how my first Mun landing in thus save went, except with 5 pushes instead of 35 ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Cerberus738","CreatedById":100744,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T07:24:46Z","Content":"kerbal push program! it\u0027s been like that for awhile now. i\u0027ve pushed quite a few craft home. i suppose it should be a bug."},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T07:38:06Z","Content":"Yes, it was supposed to consume monoprop but it didn\u0027t. Harvester make some sort of math mistake somehow and thought that the fuel was a lot heavier than it was:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The original idea (and implementation) was indeed that the Kerbals would use the monoprop from the pods to fuel themselves.\n\u003E During experimental testing however, we noticed everyone was getting frustrated with it because those tanks, being just normal mono containers, would get drained out using RCS, and when it was time to EVA there would be no more fuel left for them. It didn\u0027t work as well in practice as it did in theory, and without a total rewrite of the RCS flow logic, which we just didn\u0027t have the time for, we had to think of something else. \n\u003E \n\u003E In the end, this feature was causing more aggravation than enjoyment.\n\u003E \n\u003E There were other issues as well, for instance, the mono on EVA suits had to be \u0027hacked\u0027 to zero density, otherwise the added weight would make Kerbals unable to walk properly (just those 5 units of mono was several times heavier than they are themselves). The EVA propellant resource can have its own defined properties, so it works without having to resort to hacky fixes.\n\u003E \n\u003E The switch to EVA prop solved all those issues without having to do a full reversal back to the old system. Now they have all the advantages of having a proper resource-based pack propellant, without the problems that arose from that fuel being the same as the one used for RCS. \n\u003E \n\u003E I decided to leave the RCS containers on the pods however, because that did prove very useful for minimal craft designs, as you noticed as well. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E Cheers\n\nNote how he says \u00225 units of mono was several times heavier than they are themselves\u0022 - that cannot be true. 5 units of monoprop is 5/250t, or 20kg. A kerbal is 93-94kg in EVA suit. Also several mods have added monoprop AND life support to suits with no ill effects, even though the kerbals were carrying more than 20kg. So he must have put more than 5 units on \u0027em or something (maybe 5\\*5 units? although even that is only 100kg, not \u0027several times\u0027 their mass)\n\nAlso RCS flow HAS been rewritten.\n\n\\*taps foot impatiently\\*"},{"CreatedByName":"Psycho_zs","CreatedById":137644,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T07:50:42Z","Content":"Here is a simple mod *[removed link to defunct website]*\n\nIt is flagged for 0.24.2, but it worked for me perfectly in 0.90.
