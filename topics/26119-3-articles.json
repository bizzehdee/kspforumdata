One trick here is to make your outer stages carry more fuel. For example, for a 400t payload I put up I use 2 x32 tanks above my center stack and first ring (of 6). I then use 3 x32 tanks above the other rings. This gives you a lower TWR (I design for roughly 1.7 at the launchpad) earlier but can keep it from falling off as badly as you lose engines. If you were really trying to maximize TWR, you could use even fewer tanks on the inner stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I sometimes design my innermost ring (around the core) to *not* feed into the center, so that I get to keep all 7 engines for their full burntime, but this means you need to feed the center stack from the 2nd ring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key to asparagus (or onion) staging is managing TWR.

All attempts to add additional tankage and SRBs in order to increase the mass to orbit resulted in horrible crashing, mostly caused by wobble in the girder-to-girder joints.

I get the impression that of launch failures that aren\u0027t attributed to human error are usually turbopump failures, especially when you realize that a lot of launches that are blamed on engine failures were actually turbopump failures, since the turbopumps are really part of the engine in most rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn KSP, you might be able to get an asparagus-staged rocket into orbit if one engine fails.

I agree with most of what you say.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first step toward asparagus staging in the real world (clustering the tanks themselves) has been on the books, so to speak, since the 60\u0027s. The Saturn I was essentially created by clustering Redstone-type tanks into one thrust structure and interstage. The next real step was multiple boosters surrounding a sustainer core. That was accomplished with the Soviet hypergolic boosters (which have now have operated continuously for almost 50 years). The American Delta IV Heavy has three cores (two boosters and a central core that generally runs through a good portion of the ascent throttled down until after the boosters separate). That\u0027s how SpaceX will run the F9 Heavy as well. ULA (the operator of the Delta IV) has offered to develop cross-feed if their U.S. government customer is willing to pay for it. By contrast, SpaceX has publicly stated they WILL develop and implement cross feed for the F9H, but it won\u0027t be in the first versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, having said that, the F9 suffered an engine failure on a previous flight and it wasn\u0027t a turbo pump failure, but rather (apparently) a manufacturing or metallurgical problem in the fuel dome above the combustion chamber. Given the scale at which they have to produce Merlin engines (10 for each flight - 9 first stage, 1 second; 28 for each F9H) they are building at a scale not seen since the height of the Space Race. They are more likely to have manufacturing issues as they ramp up, as opposed to say PW/Rocketdyne who essentially hand-build their products at a much slower pace.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wilt57","CreatedById":64653,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T16:18:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bsalis\u0022 data-cite=\u0022bsalis\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOne thing to be mindful of when using asparagus-style staging is that if all the stacks are the same, the payload becomes proportionally heavier as you drop stages. So the TWR will go down. That is not what you want at, say, around 10Km where you clear the thickest of the atmo and want to start hammering it east. This can be fixed if you make the stacks smaller (less fuel, same engine, more TWR) as you progress the staging sequence.\u003Cp\u003EOr... just don\u0027t use asparagus-style staging. I do not. Sure it\u0027s more efficient, but more complicated and harder to build robust large craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry to quote from so far back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is true, but with the right ascent profile this can be negated. Many players use LV-Ns with total ship TWRs of around .2 once in space because our orbital speed has reduced the effect of gravity on our ship. Even up in the thinner atmosphere, if we get our orbital speed up, our launcher can have a lower TWR than the initial stage. My Jumbo-64 fuel launcher has a payload of 40.42 tons. The core launch stage is a Jumbo-64 with a TVR-400L at the base with four LV-T45s for thrust vectoring. This stage only has a TWR of .98. The rest of my launcher consists of four Jumbo-64s with TVR-400Ls using LV-T30s and is asparagus style dropping 2 at a time. Total vehicle mass is 248.02, for a payload fraction of 16.3%. I use MechJeb to launch it to 80k, starting the gravity turn at 10k, ending at 70k, and using a 40% curve. There may be a better launch profile, but this one works.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
