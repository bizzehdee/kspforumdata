The bug has no effect on launching rockets at full throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-14T17:22:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi there Avatar98 and welcome to the KSP community \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a mod to fix the fuel until 0.17 rolls around, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/16439-0-16-0-Hacky-Fuel-Consumption-Bug-Fix\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eyou can find it here.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-14T17:33:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Avatar98","CreatedById":40007,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-15T02:46:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the link and the mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
