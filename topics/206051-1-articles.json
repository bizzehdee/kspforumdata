There would be a loophole of charging with higher energy loads than the battery could normally take IF there was coolant to keep it from overheating. Doing this you could chargd vast amounts of electricity in shorter periods of time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScience: Strangely, I read that batteries are slightly (very tiny amount) heavier when fully charged. So I imagine if one went and poured vast amounts of energy into the battery that over time it would become heavy for it\u0027s size. Meaning apparently physics won\u0027t let you cheat by having a low mass high energy source and increasing energy storage forever. There is a breaking point where the said mass will turn heavy.... so long you are using normal mass and not antimatter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is ironic because mechanical energy is much the same. You cannot rotate a tether or steel beam to infinitely faster speeds BECAUSE before you even reach light speed rotation the tether or beam would tear apart, since the ends would be much heavier than the mid-sections. I imagine if one did spin any object to infinity it would spiral out as it disintergrated... into relativistic shrapnel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReal world applications of such are battery: Obvious... yet generating the power to use one depends wholly on how much power you wanted to store. I imagine one could charge higher amounts of electricity faster into the infinite battery if sufficient coolant was available. Which means charging facilities would have massive coolant tanks filled with LH, and proabably located near a water source where water is continually converted into LH.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLikewise discharging a lot of energy from the battery without overheating it would require plenty of coolant.

But the problem is the amount of electric energy measured in joules is staggeringly high to reach orbit from an Earth-like world. Which means that you need a middle man... coolant, to offset overheating your infinite battery while you discharge massive amounts of energy to fly.

Of course, with any known storage method, you aren\u0027t going to get anywhere close to that ratio. The best we have a working theory for that works remotely like an actual battery is nuclear isomer batteries. The hafnium-178 isomer\u00A0\u003Csup\u003E178m2\u003C/sup\u003EHf can hold about 1.3GJ/gram. Sure, that\u0027s almost 10,000 times worse than antimatter, but it\u0027s also more than a million times better than Lithium Ion batteries, which top out under 1kJ/gram. This particular nuclear isomer has surprisingly good shelf life, with half-life over 30 years, making it an ideal candidate for batteries. Unfortunately, getting it to liberate that energy on demand has proven to be rather complicated, and the only known way to charge it is to chuck it into a particle accelerator, which is not ideal in too many ways to count. There was some optimism about it a decade or two ago, which even led to some research getting classified for the fear that somebody could weaponize it, but that fizzled out, and research has seen been released to the public. The conclusion has been that if there is an efficient way to store and release energy from this isotope, we lack technology to do so at present. But if you\u0027re looking for a \u0022nearly magical\u0022 battery for your science fiction setting, you can do a lot worse than hafnium nuclear isomer batteries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-21T15:33:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224067830\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206051\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221640046101\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022197504\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spacescifi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 hours ago, Spacescifi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo... the situation is different in two ways that have been said at length.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRealistically you would just blow up the battery... and your spaceship in the blast... as all the batteries stored energy is released at once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow with sufficient heat exchangers... perhaps maybe?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Not even then.
