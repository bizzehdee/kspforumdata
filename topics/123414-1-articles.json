The \u003Cstrong\u003Eboldest \u003C/strong\u003Eand most \u003Cstrong\u003Eartistic \u003C/strong\u003Eand true to the sci-fi genre. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It explored further than any of the three and it pushed the boundary to its limit. Yes, some things were not completely realistic. The same can be said about The Martian and Gravity, and some mistakes in those could\u0027ve been fixed easily. In Interstellar, the complexity is way above Gravity\u0027s or The Martian\u0027s level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Interstellar raises the most important and relevant issues of our time. It questions our future path, about our negligence towards the precious world we live on and how we decide to play it safe and stay here instead of venturing out into the unknown. The movie heavily emphasizes these points, that Earth cannot hold us forever. It shows the incredible wonders of space, the final frontier. While being the most challenging, it is what we were born to do, because it excites us. We are natural born explorers, and Earth cannot stay our home forever. Interstellar was one of the most inspiring and mind-blowing movies I have ever seen, on par with classics like 2001 and Solaris. I\u0027ve been watching movies for years and reviewed lots of them, but Interstellar stands out from the crowd. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It is the most important movie of the century, or even this generation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I hope as many young people as possible see it and become inspired to strive for something more and try to reach for the stars, to make the unknown known and to make Earth a better place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Gravity and The Martian are good films, but when it comes to this, they don\u0027t even come close.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027ll leave you with the original teaser for Interstellar, which expresses my point the best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/827FNDpQWrQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.
