\u00A0For me the joy of the game comes from new and interesting decisions. \u00A0Have some constraints around funds forces some tough decisions. \u00A0I care about unlocking parts. \u00A0I care about relative costs. \u00A0I have a reason to build reusable vehicles and to keep from over engineering. \u00A0The hard mode increases in unlocking building plus having to pay extra for the first part already put more stress on funds than normal. \u00A0However, having 100% funds rewards means I haven\u0027t had much in the way of repetitive grinding for the purposes of funds only. \u00A0Instead, gathering science is my primary motivator with funds merely being a check on the outlandish. \u00A0I don\u0027t mind \u0022grinding\u0022 for science for 2 reasons. \u00A0First, science generally requires you to keep going to NEW places. \u00A0I want a nice reason to go new places so its not a minus, but a plus. \u00A0Second, it makes the use of the Science Lab a balanced part of the strategy and not just \u0022easy mode\u0022. \u00A0(I refuse to fast forward time for the sake of science alone) \u00A0Finally, I feel like a see MORE of the science tree. \u00A0I used to click through nodes purely on the way to latter nodes. \u00A0With slower science, every science expenditure NEEDS to get me something useful AND/OR I\u0027m pressed into making use of stuff that\u0027s merely \u0022on the way\u0022 to the \u0022good stuff.\u0022 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the part of no reverts, I\u0027m pleasantly surprised to find the game is BETTER without reverting. \u00A0I think when learning the early part of the game when you\u0027re new, reverts make good sense. \u00A0But once you\u0027re able to do the basics of orbiting, I like revert going away. \u00A0First, I like how it forces me to do a better job thinking through the missions, double checking everything. \u00A0Second, I enjoy how it forces me to consider the cost of testing new ships. \u00A0Going from 1.25 rockets to 2.5 is not straightforward. \u00A0Sure, some things are still relevant, but until you launch a few new rockets you don\u0027t really know how they will fair. \u00A0I guess you could cheat and actually do math, but that\u0027s not the Kerbal way! \u00A0Fund concerns combined with no revert and permadeath for my pilots, means I actually have to consider what might go wrong before hitting GO! \u00A0I\u0027m actually putting probe cores onto to rockets to launch before putting crew on. \u00A0Crew safety is actually a concern! \u00A0With revert (and MIA instead of KIA) I had never considered the launch abort system. \u00A0Now I\u0027m considering it. \u00A0(Considering, I still haven\u0027t actually used it...) \u00A0Finally, I like how I no longer \u0022need\u0022 to do missions in one sitting anymore. \u00A0Sure I could have saved instead, but I always preferred the revert function. \u00A0Now that its not an option, my only concerns regarding in-game vs real-world times is during launches and burns. \u00A0Otherwise, its always a pretty quick exit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust wanted to share!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-17T17:47:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really like the idea of no quick saves/reverts but after trying it myself I realized (at least for me personally) it doesn\u0027t mesh well with the games tendency to crash or screw you randomly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve seen way too many Kerbals fall through the ground, or poof into non existence for no reason, ships randomly exploding, crafts and Kerbals getting flung out of the solar system by phantom forces to trust the game that much lol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGlad to hear you\u0027ve found something that works good for you though!

But, I\u0027m not really a career guy anyway so it\u0027s not much of an issue with me, and maybe if I played with these settings I\u0027d like them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tranenturm","CreatedById":143304,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-17T20:05:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKnock on wood, the kraken has been kind to me. I\u0027m also not trying 500 part space stations. I also tend to exit the game every now and then, particularly when I see signs of code being broken (after a while clicking on the buildings at KSP stops working, stuff like that). Next start I will enable auto save for the sole purpose of kraken insurance.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs as for punishment, the 100% funds helps make sure I have extra cash to run new ships for testing. Most of the time I\u0027m making profit even with screw ups and testing. So I\u0027m not hesitant to test. It does mean I\u0027m unlikely to try more outlandish configs. But if I\u0027m cash poor but really want to try something unconventional I can always \u0022simulate\u0022 in sandbox mode. So far though, I haven\u0027t gone far enough off the scales to warrant that. It also makes me think about \u0022safe\u0022 testing. I\u0027ve never really done space planes but I\u0027m going through a testing phase to make a space bus. I\u0027m getting science stations around the Kerbin system and want a way to transfer crew. I\u0027m currently too low tech for a true SSTO so by strapping on some kickbacks to the wing tips (and then ejecting them) I can make orbit. In figuring this out, I both made sure I had a probe core driving (and not Jeb or Val) and plenty of radial parachutes. I recovered a fair number of mistakes during the process for a percentage of funds back lessening the sting. In some ways it drives my science research as I know once the tree is done I\u0027ll be converting the science into funds for the more crazy expensive tests. Currently my tech level is too low for most things. I\u0027m close to the 3 mil in funds needed for the level 3 R\u0026amp;D. Only a couple of 300 sci techs, lots of holes at 160, and even a few 90s are missing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WuphonsReach","CreatedById":130759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-19T01:18:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo way I could function with no reverts - too many bugs. \u00A0But I do make extensive use of KCT (Kerbal Construction Time) to test out vehicles prior to assembly \u002B launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy ideal start would be \u0022moderate\u0022 difficulty with 2500 science and 3 million in funds. \u00A0That\u0027s enough to upgrade most buildings to level 2, plus get mid-deep into the 160/300 science\u00A0tech tree nodes, and have enough left over to start putting up meaningful vessels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(KCT also has an auto-save feature - which works as well as the auto save add-on.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
