The RCS is perfectly balanced so it\u0027s incredibly easy to dock. All the pictures show it docked to a lander that I used when I was doing a fancy Apollo-style mission. It launches vertically and jettisons the two 1.25m tanks (and all the space-specific hardware except the engines) before reentry. Then it uses the two jet engines to make sure it lands at KSC (this was when I was worried about not being able to recover vehicles in career mode that landed far from KSC). In one picture you can see one of three landing legs on the nose.
