I am running 63 mods currently, and the ones that apply to my questions are RemoteTech, Community Tech Tree, RealChute and Tantares, I believe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI set up\u00A03 short range Sats at 2848400m for keosynchronous orbits. They each had an L-LG1 Low Gain antenna for their Omni range (4mm), and 3 Reflectron KR-7s (90mm) for transmission. It is my understanding, that the omnis should pick up the signal from the KSC, and the cone antennas will send the signal further. I aimed them each at the Mun, Minmus, and the Active Vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI then set up Sats around Mun and Minmus, with a single\u00A04mm Omni,\u00A0four 90mm cone antennas, and\u00A0four 25mm cone antennas. The idea was, aim\u00A0one 90mm each at the SR ComSats around Kerbin,\u00A0one each for active vessel, and the 25mm\u0027s for aiming at each other (the other sats around Mun and Minmus, respectively). These were all set up in 500k orbits, polar and equatorial.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, here is where I need advice: Are those designs sound? Are the orbits I chose, the right choice? Did I over or under engineer them?\u00A0I ask, because when I send Scansats out, I still need three cone antennas in order to not lose connection, I can\u0027t get away with just omni\u0027s. I can send out flyby satellites with just omnis, but I tend to lose connection mid flight, and I ALWAYS lose connection before I can deploy chutes on my return to Kerbin, but Real Chute keeps my probes from dying. I have watched the \u0022Remote Tech School\u0022 YouTube series by Grunfworks, but, I think I missed something. Does anyone have any advice?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
