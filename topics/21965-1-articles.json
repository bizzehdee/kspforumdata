I also think you should remove those solid fuel boosters, and replace them with regular fuel tanks and engines. Aerospike engines would be good, as their ISP is always 390 no matter where-ever they are. I also suggest switching the large engine in your stage that also uses the boosters and use the slightly smaller one, not the smallest, so you have some thrust vectoring, which would go great with the aerospikes.
