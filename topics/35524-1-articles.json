I got KSP about 2 months ago and I\u0027ve been ramping up, watching TONS of people playing on youtube, the Twitch channel, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis game has taken over my brain. I\u0027ve completely stopped devoting time to other hobbies besides fitness activities, including SWTOR which I used to play several hours a week.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve finally achieved what I think of as credible novice status, having flown a lander to Duna and then returned the crew home to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have really enjoyed the learning curve to this pursuit, and I\u0027ve been flying stock with no mods for most of my career. Before I installed Kerbal Engineer, I built spreadsheets to calculate Delta-V so I got the hang of it, for example. I basically decided to work with stock parts while I learned about exploring space, and to only seek out mods as my ambition to create things grew along with my experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI very recently added the Kerbal Alarm Clock, the B7 Aero pack, the Kerbal Attachment System, and finally Telemachus Telemetry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m stoked to pretend that I know very little about the bodies in the system and send unmanned probes with sensors to crash into them and use the telemetry system to learn what I need to know to build the appropriate landers, rovers, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realize that astronomers can learn a lot about a planet\u0027s atmosphere and gravitational force long before probes are sent, but, well, KSP doesn\u0027t exactly model that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, hello!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sesni","CreatedById":50625,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-02T14:55:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy exploring!

After reading your post, I think it\u0027d be a neat idea for squad to implement procedural solar systems at some point, so no two games are the same. Now that\u0027s probably quite a feat from a technical standpoint, but it\u0027d make it easier on those who want to figure out what they need to know themselves, rather than from a stock set of wiki-tips.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SuperWeegee4000","CreatedById":71621,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-08T17:23:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello there!
