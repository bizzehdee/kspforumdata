Having been experimenting with a few lately, I\u0027ve come to realize just how much fun, and how much of a challenge they are to fly. Digging into Wikipedia I found a number of \u0027records\u0027 people have set with these flying machines and, any time I see a record regarding flying or rocketry, I think... humm, can I do that in KSP? So, I thought I\u0027d share.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour challenge is to develop a multi-role helicopter using the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/firespitter-propeller-plane-parts/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFirespitter\u003C/a\u003E mod and complete any or as many of the tasks listed below as you can/desire with that single (flexible) design. You may submit multiple designs (please limit this) but the goal is to do as many as possible with the single design. Some of these will be rather easy, some (lifting 40 tons which can be done btw), VERY difficult. You need not complete them all with a single launch but, if you\u0027re particularly masochistic, have at it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not certain what effect FAR has on helos since I don\u0027t use it but if you guys believe it should warrant a separate category, say so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDesign rules:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter some long thought, I realized that it would be nearly impossible to complete all the tasks with one fixed design. A heavy lift helo probably wouldn\u0027t do well in an endurance flight. I also have realized that aircraft and helo manufacturers create different aircraft variations around the same frame in order to perform different tasks. In order to do all of these tasks, Kerbals would need that same flexibility. Therefore, I\u0027ve relaxed the design criteria a good bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are allowed to make modifications to your basic design provided the basic frame shape remains unchanged (or mostly so). Some examples I\u0027d allow:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding or removing rotors or relocating them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChanging rotor types.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExchanging a fuel tank for a fuselage of the same size and basic shape.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding or removing drop tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe basic rule of thumb here is: Your engineers created a frame. Stick to that basic frame design and rearrange it as you need to complete each task. If you have any doubts as to whether a change is acceptable, simply post a before and after shot and I\u0027ll give you my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe big rules:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may use any mod that has \u0027reasonable\u0027 capability.

You must take off and land vertically, or at least mostly so. If yours looks more like a plane than a helo, rethink your design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may use jet or propeller engines to provide forward propulsion. Please be judicious with this should you even get it to work. The purpose here is to fly like a helo, not an aircraft. You must still take off and land vertically. To clarify. If you can shut the rotors off and still get and remain airborne using your other means of propulsion, you\u0027re flying an airplane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may use a VTOL with rotating wings (similar to the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Boeing_V-22_Osprey\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOsprey\u003C/a\u003E aircraft).

I try not to make boring or single minded challenges. If you like this one, be sure to click the purple EVE challenge in my sig. That\u0027s the other challenge I started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, KSC2 is a good distance away. I\u0027m pretty sure that getting 6 Kerbals there will be doable. Hauling 10 additional tons may require some work in the design stage but I think it\u0027s doable as well. I don\u0027t know if mine can make it. You\u0027ll notice the large clamp on the bottom of mine. I have lifted 10 tons off the runway with it and, using some creativity, dropped it from 2k altitude with 8 radial chutes. It landed unscathed. I didn\u0027t say you had to LAND the helo at KSC2 with the cargo, but the cargo should arrive at KSC2 intact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECircumnavigating will be a real challenge, especially a non-stop. I know mine can\u0027t. As it stands, my design, even in cargo throttle, only reaches about 120m/s. I didn\u0027t say you had to use electrics for ALL the challenges. But, it\u0027s an option. And for at least the one circumnavigation challenge I specifically noted that it doesn\u0027t have to be non-stop. It took Scott Kasprowicz 11 days 7 hours and 5 minutes to make his circumnavigation. And, if I\u0027m not mistake, the old record holder even rented a ship to land his Jet Ranger on in the middle of the ocean in order to refuel (if that gives you any ideas).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought about a scoring system but I think those are better reserved for specific challenges, like how much cargo can you lift and hold at 2k altitude. Since this challenge has such a wide variety of tasks, a scoring system could over-complicate things. That and I\u0027ve seen some scoring challenges where one person out-thinks the challenge creator, racks up a HUGE score and then nobody wants to try to beat them (I\u0027ve done that at least once). While I do participate in scoring challenges, I find that I rarely go for the points anyway and instead go for a creative solution to solving the challenge. The last challenge I did I scored a ONE. But I was thrilled with my design. Rather than pitting people against each other, I prefer to pit people against themselves and the environment. Moar drama that way \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut thanks for the ideas.

My concern regarding infinite fuel is more related to modding modules to do things the creator never intended or using mods that are overpowered by Kerbal standards. One example I would allow is Kethane. All of the tanks come empty. I\u0027d have NO problem if you modded one to be full of Kethane on launch, the creator intended it to eventually hold Kethane anyway and modding one to be pre-filled is simply saving time.
