These two mods are very large and just packed full of many, many parts. There are a lot of mods that are around the same idea as say Kethane, but it is by far the best that I know of. The developers of Kethane have really done a fantastic job with it. As Spica said though, just check out the Kerbal Spaceport and download away \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E You can always remove them if you find one you\u0027re not happy with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helped a little bit \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-17T15:49:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENovapunch is quite lovely, has almost every part you might wish for (including much stronger struts), however I\u0027ve had some issues in 0.21.1 with regards attaching parts in the VAB. I\u0027ve also crashed 5 metre rockets into the floor at silly speeds and watched them bounce due to NP parts tending to have a rather high durability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EISA Mapsat is awesome for finding anomalies in a semi-realistic manner as you\u0027ve already mentioned, however make sure you get the \u0022unofficial\u0022 version that lets you turn off mapping in the atmosphere and stops a horrific lag-bug by doing this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb (either 1.9 or 2.x) is an almost required mod that I think should have been rolled into stock somehow a long while ago (though some people will have not very nice words to say to me about that), and Procedural Fairings may help you with packing stuff up into aerodynamic shells.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, yeah, get to the Spaceport and knock yerself out!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jderica","CreatedById":79239,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-17T16:32:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you all for replying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve looked into Procedual Fairings and that is exactly what i want \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E.

Altho mods that add more engine don\u0027t really apeal to me, I don\u0027t like to get the game imbalanced, I read in the description that it also adds size adapters, so hopefully a way to make a nice looking tri Ion Drive.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
