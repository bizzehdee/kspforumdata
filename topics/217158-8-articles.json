He was invited to the ESA event on the 9th meaning he knew the performance of the game \u003Cstrong\u003Eplaying on a 4080\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E... \u003C/strong\u003E8 days before the reqs were released. He said not everyone experienced problems, and he only suffered micro-stutters and anything else wasn\u0027t consistent in occurring. He then goes on to say that the PCs on the event \u003Cstrong\u003Ewere having performance issues\u003C/strong\u003E which he magically didn\u0027t experience but show up on all non sped up footage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s all for performance, and he goes on to talk about content, he doesn\u0027t mention the lack of re-entry heating for release, so he maybe still has the information that it was gonna be part of release like he mentioned before? Later on he talks about the game having 300\u002B parts, and say PD has been very open to the game being EA and missing content, saying it\u0027s ok to wait for more content to arrive and that it could be that way for quite a while. After that, he criticizes the price, something I agree with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, a clear lack of critique and an even more dreary feeling that he either got extremely lucky, or is reluctant to actually take an issue with a game having performance problems in a 4080. I hope by now you can clearly see how this softball approach is something I strongly disagree with.
