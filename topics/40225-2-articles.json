When they were born, like most people they lived with technology little changed from the days of Rome. But they saw WW1 and WW2 totally change how the world was organized. They saw airplanes and even cars come from nothing to being commonplace. They saw electricity spread across the country (they didn\u0027t get it until the 1930s).
