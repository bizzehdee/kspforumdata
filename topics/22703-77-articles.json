That\u0027s what I\u0027ve heard anyway. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough for the player, the advantage of using Curse is that if you\u0027re looking for an older mod for an earlier version of the game, it keeps archives of mod versions. So say you\u0027re still running a .25 gamesave, and you want to find a version of a particular mod that\u0027s compatible with that version, look up the mod on Curse and then check the earlier game and mod versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso - some mod makers use Github for mod uploads. But I DESPISE using that site, the UI there is confusing as HELL!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of the above is why I\u0027ve taken to using CKAN primarily, then if a mod isn\u0027t showing up there, looking for it on Curse or Kerbalstuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and BTW Devo?
