The NERVA engine works by sucking in hydrogen gas and heating it then expelling it out the back of the engine to create thrust. So I was wondering if it was possible to use a thick apnosphere like Eve\u0027s or Venus\u0027s instead of gas as fuel. Besides the obvious safety concerns could something like this actually work? Any thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GreeningGalaxy","CreatedById":66813,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-27T02:16:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you get KSP Interstellar (which I\u0027m feeling like a walking advertisement for lately lol), it adds a part called a thermal turbojet, which allows you to pump whatever atmosphere you have available through a hot nuclear reactor and out the back of your ship, which can and will allow you to SSTO from Eve.
