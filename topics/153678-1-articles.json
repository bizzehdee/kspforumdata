I had a custom-built box that was foam-lined for moving it to launch sites. \u00A0Flew twice - first flight is pictured, second flight was on an Aerotech single-use I161. \u00A0The onboard altimeter reported 556 feet on the first flight (with the H220 Smokey Sam motor). \u00A0The I motor got it to 600\u002B -

This was considered an entry-level skill level. \u00A0In the beginning (back when skill levels were first introduced), that meant a very basic 3FNC (3 fins and a nose cone) rocket. \u00A0Not many parts, usually around 20 or less. \u00A0Fins were either die-cut balsa, a pre-molded plastic fin unit, or a sheet of balsa that you traced the fin pattern on and cut out yourself - that\u0027s how I started out. \u00A0Depending on the kit, you would have either a 13mm mini-motor mount, or an 18mm standard mount. \u00A0These kits could be assembled in a couple hours\u00A0or so, depending on how fast the glue dried, and not including finishing - sanding sealer to fill the balsa grain, paint, decals (if any).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrent SL1 kits are generally plastic fin units, plastic nose cones, pre-colored body tubes, and also come in either the 13mm or 18mm motor mount flavors. \u00A0These can be built somewhat quicker than the older kits, and that\u0027s if you even need to build them at all. \u00A0Estes offers many beginner \u0022kits\u0022 where the only thing you assemble is the parachute.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSkill Level 2 - Somewhat more involved than\u00A0SL1. \u00A0This might involve new techniques, or possibly a tube-fin rocket. \u00A0Maybe there\u0027s an adapter and two different body tube diameters. \u00A0Estes used to have a high-performance 3FNC called the Sprint that was SL2 because it involved elliptical fins, a boattail reducer at the motor end, and the fins needed to be airfoiled for the best performance, which ain\u0027t easy on elliptical fins. \u00A0It was streamer recovery, rather than parachute, because if built correctly, and on a good day, it could reach 2500\u002B feet on an 18mm C6-7 motor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nModern SL2 kits DO require assembly, although they still come with plastic nose cones (TBH, I think only certain boutique kit makers still offer balsa nose cones anymore). \u00A0Fins will be either very heavy card stock, balsa (rare), or plastic, all of which are usually pre- or die-cut. \u00A0Many will also have pre-colored body tubes, or a single large decal wrap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSkill Level 3 - Now we\u0027re getting to the fun stuff, if spending a bit more time (several days) putting the thing together is your idea of fun (it was for me, anyway). \u00A0This usually meant much more involved construction, sometimes having to shape balsa parts into small details (for scale models of real rockets), staging, clustering, stronger construction techniques, and so on. \u00A0This is also where you might step up to 24mm motors (Estes D motors). \u00A0You can start to get into larger models as well. \u00A0The early Estes Honest John scale kit was a SL3, but it\u0027s a bit involved to explain why. \u00A0Oh, yeah... this is also where boost gliders start to come in - goes up under rocket power and glides back, sometimes well, sometimes... not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrent SL3 is actually about the same as the old, albeit still with plastic nose cones, and some will have plastic fins. \u00A0Modern SL3 scale kits will usually have plastic detail pieces. \u00A0These can be built a bit quicker than the older SL3 kits, mainly due to the simplification that has occurred over the past 20 years or so. \u00A0Some will have you step up to 24mm E motors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSkill Level 4 - Pretty much building on what I\u0027ve already gone over, and then taking it up a couple notches. \u00A0Much more involved work in construction, odd shapes, larger or more detailed kits, clustering and 24mm motors fairly prevalent. \u00A0Might need to invest in a somewhat bigger launch pad, as larger, heavier rockets may require a 3/16\u0022 x 36\u0022 or 48\u0022 launch rod, as opposed to earlier SL models usually only needing a 1/8\u0022 x 36\u0022 rod. \u00A0The original Estes Mars Lander\u00A0was a SL4 kit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNowadays, SL4 is more for much larger rockets, some of which may have pre-cut model plywood fins, slots cut in the body tube for TTW (through the wall) fin mounting (makes for a stronger mount), again with the plastic nose cone, definitely a bit more clustering - usually in 24mm motors. \u00A0Twenty-five or so years ago, Estes reissued their Saturn V kit, as well as a \u0022new\u0022 version of the Saturn 1B. \u00A0These were sold at SL4. \u00A0\u0022New\u0022 is in quotes because what they did was used Centuri\u0027s S1B kit after they bought out Centuri. \u00A0The advantage was that it was 1/100 scale - the same as the Sat V. \u00A0Both reissues had A LOT of plastic parts, obviously sharing some of the same ones between kits. \u00A0I\u0027m not sure if it holds true anymore, but back in the late 1980\u0027s, Estes dropped SL5, probably for several reasons - not cost effective (fewer people bought the more expensive and complex kits), new manufacturing techniques made them less complex (read: more plastic parts), and the rising popularity of larger motors - E and above, in both standard black powder and composite - meant clustering wasn\u0027t necessary for larger, heavier kits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSkill Level 5 - Might take a month or so to build. \u00A0Mostly used for scale kits. \u00A0The original Estes 1/100 Saturn V and the 1/70 scale Saturn 1B were SL5. \u00A0The 1B was especially fun because you had to build the eight fins, which were a framework of balsa\u00A0covered with light card stock, you had to shape the ullage motors out of balsa, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E was made with wooden dowels, the body tubes used for the eight tanks had to have sections cut out of them in order to fit over the four-motor cluster mount, and painting the thing was a nightmare. \u00A0As I mentioned above, Estes dropped SL5 for awhile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNowadays? \u00A0I\u0027m not sure there ARE any SL5 kits. \u00A0Probably from other rocket kit manufacturers, but from Estes...? \u0026lt;shrug\u0026gt; \u00A0Apogee Rockets\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.apogeerockets.com\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.apogeerockets.com\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0sells some L5 kits, including a 1/70 Saturn 1B AND a 1/70 Saturn V. \u00A0They also have some great info on their site for beginners, and have rocket design software that you can use to design rockets, and even fly them before you ever build them. \u00A0The software is great and uses much better aero calculations than KSP (of course, it\u0027s slower than what would be needed for KSP). \u00A0I used it to work out stability calcs for the Terrier-Sandhawk shown above, as well as several other scratch-built models.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe stuff that \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/58462-gdj/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002258462\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/58462-gdj/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@GDJ\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0mentioned, as well as myself at the beginning of my post, is what is known as high-power rocketry. \u00A0First, a couple of things: Low-power rockets are pretty much anything you can get at Micheal\u0027s, Wal-Mart, etc. \u00A0Generally, the rockets mass less than 16 ounces (I\u0027m not converting to grams or kilos - sue me), and contain less than 4 ounces of propellant. \u00A0This generally means clustering no more than 4\u00A0Estes E motors. \u00A0Mid-power rocketry allows up to 3.3 pounds TRW (total rocket weight, including motors), and means you can fly on F or G class motors. \u00A0At this point, you may need to contact your local airport with a Notification. \u00A0There are certain G motors, in combination with certain kits (not Estes) that can break the sound barrier and hit altitudes of over a mile. \u00A0All that\u0027s required is a notification - let them know you\u0027re flying at such-and-such location at X time, and that you expect some rockets to reach whatever altitude. \u00A0This has been done enough over the past 25-30 years, that most airports are aware of the hobby and will wish you happy flying. \u00A0They cannot deny you to fly - it\u0027s a courtesy to notify them - unless you plan to launch in the flight path of the airport less than five miles away, at which point, they\u0027ll probably just suggest finding another launch site.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHigh Power Rocketry (HPR) is what we were talking about earlier. \u00A0HPR is anything over 3.3 pounds TRW, and H motors and above (BTW, all motors discussed from this point on are composite motors - APCP, or ammonium perchlorate composite propellant - and can be single use, or reloadable. \u00A0Some motors are hybrids, using a solid propellant with Nitrous Oxide as the oxidizer). \u00A0As GDJ mentioned, he\u0027s a member of CAR (Canadian Association of Rocketry). \u00A0In the US, there are two organizations I know of - the NAR (National Association of Rocketry) and TRA (Tripoli Rocketry Association). \u00A0These organizations are authorized to Certify anyone wishing to fly HPR, and usually will recognize certs from the other organization (I had dual membership in NAR and TRA, but if I didn\u0027t, a NAR cert was good at TRA launches, and vice-versa). \u00A0There are three cert levels - 1, 2, and 3. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nL1 is limited to H and I class motors, or the equivalent propellant weight in clusters of smaller motors. \u00A0You CAN cluster I motors to technically get above a J class, but why?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nL2 is J, K, and L class motors. \u00A0Same as above, but with higher propellant weight limits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nL3 is for M thru either O or P class motors. \u00A0This level has special requirements, as you need to submit a proposal for your rocket, detailing construction and bunches of other info. \u00A0If it\u0027s approved, you still need to fly the thing, AND recover it in good enough condition that you could theoretically fly it again the same day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nANYTHING falling under the HPR heading HAS to have an FAA waiver filed. \u00A0It CAN be refused, although if you fly with a large group, they usuall have things already taken care of. \u00A0I DO NOT recommend EVER attempting to fly HPR on your own. \u00A0Also, if you keep HPR motor at home when not flying, there MAY be some issues with the BATF. \u00A0I believe the court case was settled some 10 years ago, and NAR and TRA won, but there may still be certain storage requirements. \u00A0Check their respective websites for more info: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nar.org/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.nar.org/\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.tripoli.org/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.tripoli.org/\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0 I\u0027d suggest checking out the NAR site for model rocketry info -
