My laptop started with 8GB, and I added another 8 GB for $80. I took out two 4 GB modules from my tower and added four 8 GB modules for $224, and I paid retail price for these at a local vender. Online would have been as much as half these prices.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then I was picky also and bought higher end memory. Amazon had the same brand of 32 GB I paid $224 for, at $179. Other brands were even less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same brand of 4 GB modules I took out of my tower are now going for $22 each online.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-23T01:22:47Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2015 01:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wild Cobra\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-23T01:31:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t remember what the latest version of Kopernicus for 1.0.2 is, but I doubt it had great on-demand support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have only 2GB of RAM, well, you can make up for that with a page file but things will get rather slow then I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny particular reason you\u0027re not on 1.0.4?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
