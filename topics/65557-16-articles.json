Gravity took over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt really looked like it had propulsion. The machine did swing back and go past the middle line again, so it never stayed completely on one side.

I do have to remain skeptical, however, because of two observations:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The device turns a lot about its z-Axis\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The laser pointer is clearly mounted way to the right (from the camera\u0027s point of view) of the average center of mass during operation, both the gyros and the drill turning the central axis are to its left\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe strict and irrefutable version of the pendulum test requires that you attach one laser pointer to each rope pointing in the direction of the rope, that the ropes are perfectly vertical at the start and that during operation, all laser dots are displaced to the left for an extended period of time simultaneously. Averaging the position is somewhat acceptable in this situation, but only if the device does not twist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA single laser pointer is also somewhat acceptable, but only if it is in the center of the suspension ropes AND aligned with the average center of mass (ideally, you\u0027ll also have the center of mass not wobble around, but it\u0027s OK if the center of mass moves back and forth, not sideways, on timescales small compared to the natural pendulum frequency, which is the case for your device).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason for these rules is that it is very easy to deliberately cheat without them. Take your exact setup, but instead of the device, I step on the harness. I put my feet close to the two left ropes, facing left myself. I put all of my weight on my left foot and push my right foot forward. The harness will turn (clockwise when seen from above), your laser pointer and the three wires that don\u0027t support my weight all move to the left (forward from my point of view). Only the wire next to my left foot is going to move to the right, and far less than the others moved left. I can hold that position for a while, but eventually, the torque from the twisted wires is going to undo the turning. No matter. I shift my weight to my right foot and push the left foot forward. As long as you allow me to push one wire to the right, I can abuse that to push pretty much any reference point to the left (on average).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving a laser on each wire and demanding they all are displaced to the left continuously would catch me. Forcing me to stand in the center of the harness and not lean to the sides would foil my plan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour device is doing something similar without the malicious intent. Its weight is mostly on the wires on the left (and shifting weight from one wire to the other is not required to cheat, it just enhances the effect). If you look at those in 00029 0019-0054 !!!.MTS, they seem to be displaced to the RIGHT on average during operation, and thus they will apply an average force to the left (compensated on average by the forces from the other wires, of course). I think that is the thrust you would like to see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it stops raining cats and dogs here, I can try and make a video of me dancing on a swing as described above.

If so, that would mean the average COM would be more to the left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd horrifyingly, I remembered what else gyros can do (and that drill, too). Their torque can shift the weight between the wires without actually shifting the COM around. So even though you never move the COM forward and backward (camera view), the torque can put the weight of the device to the front and back wire pair. Just like a slowly precessing gyro on a string puts almost its whole weight to the pivot point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me emphasize what I tried to bring across previously, poorly: It\u0027s really all about the wires. The deflection of the wires determines the direction of the force in the xy-plane they can apply to your device. And if you want to be strict, only the direction, not the magnitude. The magnitude also depends on how the device throws its weight around. If all wires are deflected to the right simultaneously for significantly longer that the pendulum would take to swing, I\u0027ll be forced to shut up and concede (or, more realistically, demand you do the same in a vacuum, without the power cable \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo achieve that, you probably need to get rid of the rotation around the vertical axis.

There is no use having a reactionless drive if it makes your craft spin uncontrollably.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest practical way I can come up with is this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec) Add a long rod to your device, sticking out two meters left and right (camera point of view). Ideally, that rod would just move along its axis and up and down a little. Constrain it to that motion with two pairs of vertical rods on each end, as far away from the device as you can. Yes, this introduces friction again, like your earlier rail system. However, the friction now is proportional to the force between the rods, which in turn is given by the torque your device produces divided by the distance of the constraining rods from the device. So you have a parameter that controls the amount of friction you get: the distance of the constraining rods. Do different runs with different configurations, make sure the friction is low enough you never get sticky friction, and if the different runs produce similar enough results, friction can be reasonably ruled out as source of thrust. Of course, to have the runs be comparable, you need to keep the device on continuously, or driven automatically and not by a manual switch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, nothing I say is meant to discourage you!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"N_las","CreatedById":31280,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-09T11:53:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELets just wait for the result of the analysis.
