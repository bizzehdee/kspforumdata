One part is an orbitter to scan the planet and (hopefully) act as a communication link between Mission Control and the other part, which is a lander. The orbitter has a GX-128 linked to a satellite orbiting Kerbin, which in turn gives it a good, continuous link to mission control, a DP-10, a Communatron-16 and a KR-7. The lander has a DP-10, a Communatron-16 and a KR-7. Initially, I thought I could send them out using just the DP-10s to maintain the communication link when they first separated while I linked the two KR-7\u0027s to each other. But that didn\u0027t work, so I added the comm-16s to each figuring that maybe the DP-10s don\u0027t link to anything but mission control and that having an active, omnidirectional antenna would provide the short range link until I got the KR-7\u0027s connected up. But that didn\u0027t work either. I can\u0027t point the KR-7s at each other before the orbiter and lander part company, so how am I supposed to do this, short of putting a whacking great GX-128 or KR-14 onto my little 1.25m lander?

Think of it as you are looking down at Kerbin from the north pole. Also imagine the lines going from comsat to comsat, the closest you can get to kerbin is the point at which the lines from a polygon and an inscribed circle. this means that the more satellites you have, the closer you can get to Kerbin. In my old .22 save I had a 4 satellite constellation of antenna based satellites at 400 km and I had a 3 satellite configuration with dishes in geosynchronous orbit. I would also recommend throwing a few extra satellites into the same/similar orbits as a redundancy measure against the constellation drifting out of position.

I\u0027m trying to find the optimal altitude to ensure 100% equatorial coverage with the minimum number of satellites. I\u0027m assuming the best antenna to use for Kerbin orbit is the dipole antenna.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin can be covered with 3 satellites (I did 4) excluding the poles. Here\u0027s how I did it fairly easily with Mechjeb and Flight Engineer -- but really all\u0027s you need is some way of determining orbital periods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESatellite Design\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to basic requirements, each satellite needs a minimum of two dishes (to link with with the \u0022previous\u0022 and \u0022next\u0022 satellites in the orbit), a means of communicating with KSC or your existing network, and probably a means of communicating with other craft. My satellites have 4 dishes (pointed at: Previous Satellite, Next Satellite, Active Vessel, \u0022future use\u0022) and two antennas (reaches KSC, really only need one)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELauncher/Deployment Vessel Design\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI built a single craft that carries multiple satellites. Mine carried 6, but I only used 4. I made it manned, primarily so I can control it when on the wrong side of Kerbin in the process of getting the network set up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EInstructions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Choose target altitude \u0022A\u0022.

Adjust if you use different numbers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Launch into an orbit with an apoapsis of \u0022A\u0022. Adjust periapsis so your orbital period is either P-t (4.5 hours) or just \u0022t\u0022 (1.5 hours; may not be possible in synchronous orbit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Ensure all of your antennas are configured in such a way that your satellites will be able to reach KSC when they have line of sight to it. Have one dish per satellite pointed at \u0022Active Vessel\u0022, at least for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. While in range of KSC/your satellite network and on the \u0022upward\u0022 (reached periapsis, en route to apoapsis) part of your orbit, undock/decouple your first satellite. Set the satellite to circularize at its next apoapsis. The satellite\u0027s orbital period should be \u0022P\u0022 (6 hours) when you\u0027re done, you might use RCS to fine tune depending on how picky you are. \u003Cem\u003EIt\u0027s not necessary to have a perfectly circular orbit, as long as it\u0027s relatively close and the orbital period is correct.\u003C/em\u003E Timewarp/etc until your first satellite is positioned correctly. Switch back to your launcher vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. By now, your launcher should either be nearing its apoapsis (or just passed it). On satellite #2, \u003Cstrong\u003Epoint a dish at satellite #1 before undocking\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E, then repeat step 4. Satellite #2 should have an uplink to satellite #1 by the time it reaches Apoapsis, and due to the orbit timings it will be exactly 1.5 hours \u0022behind\u0022 or 1.5 hours \u0022ahead\u0022. If satellite #2 doesn\u0027t have LOS to #1, you either warped too many orbits or your target altitude is too low.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E6. Repeat steps 4\u0026amp;5, always pointing one dish of the new satellite at the previous satellite to be deployed.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E7. When your launch your final satellite, connect the additional dish back to the first one. You should have links that look like #1 \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; #2 \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; #3 \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; #4 \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; #1. Note if you\u0027re doing 4 satellites like I did, #1 and #3 will never have direct LOS to each other so there\u0027s no need to link them -- same for #2 and #4.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENotes\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Kerbisynchronous orbit is not required, but is helpful. The drawback of not doing it will be that your first satellite won\u0027t have 100% LOS to Kerbal Space Center, so your subsequent satellites might lose uplink during the positioning process. If you\u0027re clever enough with timings or your launcher vessel can control (6 crew \u002B whatever the special dish for it is), that is a nonissue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. If you don\u0027t want to fuss with Molniya orbits, you can do this exact same process with a polar orbit once your equatorial network is functional. The catch will be that -- while your polar network will always have LOS to your equatorial network, you can\u0027t determine which satellite in it they\u0027ll be able to reach, and they may not be able to reach KSC. Solving this is an exercise for the reader.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Other orbital periods for step 2 work as well, either P*x\u002Bt or P*x-t for any integer value \u0022t\u0022 \u0026gt;= 0. The goal is that every orbit of the deployment vessel has it either \u0022x\u0022 hours/etc either \u0022behind\u0022 or \u0022in front of\u0022 the last deployed satellite while at apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. You can also get away with swapping \u0022apoapsis\u0022 and \u0022periapsis\u0022 all of the above instructions. It takes more time to get set up, but works and is a must if you want something like... a communications network of satellites in say a 30km orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bobe\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bobe\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso, say I have a long range dish in orbit around Kerbin, perhaps pointing at a deep space ship, can that relay to a dipole antenna within 500km?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a link to happen, both ends of the link must be within transmission range.

However, wonky orbit drift will cause long blackouts since keo orbit is so slow. The lower layer of sats at 742 km ensure that blackouts are short and ensure multiple redundant communications paths are always open.
