If it has to be bent at the ends because of Kerbin curvature, so be it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* This idea needs a little more development, but can the game not monitor it\u0027s own memory use and start unloading parts which aren\u0027t being used in the current savegame, if it\u0027s starting to get near the upper limit? I realise that will just move problems to the VAB/SPH, but in theory it should prevent a lot of in-flight crashes unless the savegame is using all the mods in existence... note that this looks like it\u0027s doable within the API so even a mod might be able to, it\u0027s just better done by the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bilfr3d","CreatedById":75448,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T21:20:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the idea of having the parts taken out, but not automatically. I think there should be a button in the VAB/SPH where it loads up a little window of all the parts, and you can select which parts you want loaded at the moment, and the other parts you don\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-27T22:11:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe way I was imagining it was that it\u0027d start unloading unused parts - and this would be an absolutely ideal place for a background thread - which weren\u0027t referenced in the savegame in flight - you\u0027d never notice that while you\u0027re in any flight related scene. Then when you go back to the VAB it\u0027d reload the missing parts either as you switch tab, or as you enter the VAB. That would cause a pause in the game the first time you re-enter the VAB from a long flight ( and if you\u0027re very overloaded might well crash the game anyway ), but repeated reverts to the VAB after short flights shouldn\u0027t see any delays. Memory leaks aside...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively you could generate thumbnails of everything \u0026amp; only load the part when you try and use it in the VAB; that\u0027s straying close to one of the areas on the not-up-for-discussion list though. My suggestion was just to help mitigate some of the current crashes by dumping assets which aren\u0027t being used anywhere. It looks like you can unload parts via the API, I\u0027m just not sure how you\u0027d load them again - and mods doing part management like that is duplicating something the game does, which is a bit of a horrible workaround.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-27T22:15:08Z\u0022 title=\u002208/27/2013 10:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Van Disaster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T15:41:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, forget the second idea - I heared a better one which boils down to \u0022load a low res texture until the high res one is needed\u0022.
