Addons/mods are great. They customize your game experience to remove stuff you don\u0027t like and add stuff you like. After all, we all play games to have fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheating only applies if you are somehow competing with someone. So, if you wanna race someone to Duna, you should both be using the same set of mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use MechJeb to put my ship in orbit. I know how to do it and I\u0027ve done it many times, so it is very boring now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t use MechJeb to land on a moon. I can do it, but I haven\u0027t mastered it yet. I fail sometimes and have to reload. It is very fun, so I do it manually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor docking, I only use Smart ASS to keep ships pointing in the right direction. I can dock very efficiently, with less than 5 mono propellant used. Even joining multiple docking ports simultaneously is easy with Smart ASS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManeuver node editor is a feature that should be in stock KSP. Dragging icons to set up your maneuver is not a good way to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use maneuver editor to do simple stuff like changing AP/PE. More complex stuff I like to do myself with maneuver editor. I also use it to execute the maneuvers because the stock interface is broken and does not show you the correct burn time. Also, stock SAS just makes my ship wobble.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
