So manual programming like in kOS isn\u0027t entirely far off how it is actually done. Though I assume mission control auto-generate most code from more high-level GUI based tools, rather than only using a Command Line Interface. Then again, a CLI only approach would probably have prevented the Feet/Meters SNAFU of the Mars Climate Orbiter \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dreadicon","CreatedById":117295,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-08T20:19:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomeone once pointed out that if you are using career mode/science mode, Mechjeb functionality only becomes available at points where you likely have already performed the maneuvers reliably yourself a few (or more than a few) times. It also gives a reason to buy the silly probe nodes, which otherwise are pointless besides form factor. Realistic? yes. Easier? Also yes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut for me, it comes down to designing the nodes and tedium reduction. Without Mechjeb, I could do all the same orbital transfers, rendezvous, and orbital insertions it does; I know how to do the math, how to find dV, Isp, TWR, etc. But I have a job, and a wife, and friends, and plenty of other cool mechanics, math, and physics to learn rather than doing the calculations for these by hand after the first 4 or 5 times. IMHO, Mechjeb is like a calculator; an excellent tool in which there is no shame in using it, provided you know how to do what it does yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoreover, it still doesnt work so well with FAR; especially airplanes/spaceplanes \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
