It was going to have 2 spacecraft and a telescope off of one end(2 hollow tubes with lights in them)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI ditched the telescope because I realized I put it on in a weird way. Before this docking I have never gotten within 1km of another vessel in space. anyway, I have some pictures! The pictures include some pictures of the\u00A0space station, Mun, Star backround, space, and the telescope. xP\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/gallery/ELGLs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/gallery/ELGLs\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMission 2: Land Rocket on ground to collect ore, orbit, dock with MSS(Mun Space Station) Failure\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI got in an orbit around Mun and thought that I was gonna land on Mun and turn the ore into some fuel, I landed, got some ore, and realized that I did not pack the ConvertoTron 125 to convert ore into fuel to get into orbit again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJan, 16,17 5:50pm - 8:36pm\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMission 3: Rescue MSS-3 Partial Failure\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Launched MSS-4 rescue vehicle, this time with a ConvertoTron. I docked with the MSS and I refueled my Monopropellent and Fuel. Waited for the right time to undock. I have never landed close to another landed vessel before, so I might fail. Crashed. Try 2: Reloaded last quicksave, turns out I need to dock again. I\u0027m gonna skip that because my fuel is full, I wanted to dock earlier because my monoprop was running out from trying to dock, lol. Successfully landed, fell onto side because I had no landing gear. Low on fuel so I rolled out of the crater, and used my engine to drag me across the ground to MSS-3 Lander. few monoprop thrusters exploded, kept going, wondering why I need wheels, monoprop thruster explodes, command pod hit ground and explodes. Revert! back in crater, gonna roll out of crater\u00A0 and\u00A0gently glide above surface. Revert fails, I load in the ground and explode. with the little fuel the Ore Driller has left I\u0027m gonna try to orbit Mun again. Only 8 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E left, not gonna work but I will try anyway.\u00A0Decided best way was to hyper edit the rescue vehicle to a higher elevation and fly back to MSS-3 Lander. Gave a new quicksave point above the Lander so that I wont have to hyper edit to a coordination every time. Close to landing 200m away from lander, quicksaved just in case. Landed! I did not learn my lesson from earlier and fell on my side to launch the rocket slowly on the ground towards lander. I just remembered that I had monoprop left(full tank because I didn\u0027t waste on docking) so I used it hover over ground and push my self a few meters above surface. Success! I tried to push the rescue vehicle, but it didn\u0027t work. Since both vehicles where on their side I decided to roll them around to dock them. Another Success! It flung into the air and I immediately activated the engine, it went up(obviously), now trying to get into orbit and get a rendezvous ready to go. Low on fuel, but I have ore and electricity and so I start up the\u00A0ContertoTron and get fuel! Ran out of ore but still have fuel, got into orbit and am trying to get a rendezvous set up. Got rendezvous set up and tried to dock, Lander was now dead weight with no monoprop thrusters. Undocked them proceeded to try docking the rescue vehicle with the MSS. Almost out of fuel, docked and refueling. Gonna add to the MSS, but don\u0027t know what besides the\u00A0four things below. Anyway, Overall Mission is a partial failure, I did get it to orbit. I will have to send a different kind of rescue vehicle with multiple docking ports.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPics:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/MkmNG\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/MkmNG\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJan 21, 17\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMission 4: The Kerbin Space Station, Docking Hub \u0022Red\u0022 and Power Grid \u0022Blue\u0022 Success\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwas gonna dock, and when I got close the entire thing exploded...\u00A0 mission end I guess... or is it(its not, I\u0027m gonna build a new one in orbit around Kerbin.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI got the \u0022Red\u0022 Docking Hub into an 85km orbit and then got a \u0022Blue\u0022 Power Grid into a 125km orbit, I placed a few maneuvers and got a rendezvous set up, I did the maneuvers and it took me a few times of catching up to KSS \u0022Red\u0022 I finally got there and some solar panels where in the way, so I extended them and they turned to not be in the way. I docked to the KSS \u0022Red\u0022 and turned the lights on(\u0022Red\u0022 had red lights, \u0022Blue\u0022 had blue lights). This station is in orbit around Kerbin btw (Kerbin Space Station) next I will add the \u0022Green\u0022 Module with some stuff for help with making my next mission, I will add some stuff for making a ship in orbit, and I will add kerbals with life support. oh and I am in sandbox mode so I\u0027m not adding science, well maybe a telescope but that\u0027s all. So next will be adding Launchpad \u0022Green\u0022, Hexcans \u0022Yellow\u0022, and Construction Workshop \u0022 Orange\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMission 5-7: The KSS \u0022Green\u0022, \u0022Yellow\u0022, and \u0022Orange\u0022 Success\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst up will be the \u0022Yellow\u0022 Modules and then \u0022Orange\u0022 module, and then lastly the \u0022Green\u0022 Launchpad on the end of the station. I got \u0022Yellow\u0022 into a 225km orbit and am waiting for a time to do a rendezvous maneuver. multiple quick saves, and quick loads to get the rendezvous, I got close to the KSS and started getting closer I was 7.2 km away and getting closer by 45m/s. I am now 3.4 km away, slowly going towards it. I start slowing down. at 2.5km at 2.2 km I see the red dot of the space station at 1.5 km I see multiply dots of red. at 500m I am at 5m/s I slowly wait for it to come closer. The \u0022Yellow\u0022 module is a 3.75m unmanned mission at the top is some adapters and a small docking port. It will be hard docking this. full of 23800 RocketParts with 2 7xHuge rocket parts hexcans. I\u0027m at 300m now, 100m, 50m I found the port I wanted to dock at and set that as a target, slowly brought the massive ship to it(around 3x the size of the station) and it took a while for it to want to dock. Docked! Next is \u0022Orange\u0022 The new name is Kerbin Space Station and Construction Base, or KSSACB for short. The \u0022Orange\u0022 module has an extra 1,600 rocket parts in the construction workshop, full kerbals, piloting is unmanned. Jeb, Bob, Bill, Valentina will not be here to see this space station unfold before Kerbalkind\u0027s eyes. They where the hope and heroes of the story, sacrificing themselves for a great step forward to all of Kerbalkind.\u00A0The only survivor was Bill, he is stranded In a retrograde orbit around the Mun, forever stuck with no fuel hoping someone will rescue him. Which is where This space station comes in. The next big mission is a surprise, but Bill will be a hero once more for the mission, he will do it for the other three. Wilrina, Derfieild, Annie. The died in the \u0022Red\u0022 module. The \u0022Red\u0022 module was put into its orbit as a piece of debris until \u0022Blue\u0022 came. The three where stranded with no heat shield, and a broken procedural fairing that cant decouple. unable to follow the original plan of docking to the hub on the side, they tried to deorbit instead, no heatsheild, because it was planed to stay in orbit, they got to 17km and then burned out, we lost their signal... they are the three other heroes, once again sacrificing themselves for Kerbalkind.(though they could waited for a rescue, I didn\u0027t think of that until it was to late). Jeb, Bob, Bill, Valentina, Wilrina, Derfieild, Annie, these are the 7 heroes, one remains to be a hero once more for the mission that will once again change Kerbalkind! next launch is manned, but unmanned pilot, this is the first manned mission since \u0022Red\u0022 It will be dangerous, but it has to happen. 15 Kerbals will be sent into space in \u0022Orange\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile in an alternate universe(a different window open for almost the whole day)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSigwig and Nepha a enjoying their stroll in the Kerbol system with no fuel limits and going at half the speed of light(4 times speed, whole day, engines running) it is 12 hrs. into the launch. The End. Light Speed is the goal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack in the normal universe\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaunch: \u0022Orange\u0022 was ready to launch, the 15 Kerbals grew more and more impatient, when suddenly they felt a large push and heard an explosion, the rocket started going up, the rocket, despite its size and lack of Monoprop for all stages, was really controllable, the orbit went perfect, an orbit just above the KSSACB, but, it wasn\u0027t named that, so I quickly changed the name, Then, I was adding some more screenshots to the imgur post(link below) when the game crashed, I am heavily modded, I think, with over 50 mods, plus one of my own(in early development) planet packs. So I had to restart the game. I get bored easily, unless it has the slightest bit to do with space or physics(never gotten bored of those). The loading screen is like the worst thing for me with all my mods, so I decided to type this, not even done yet, so I got a drink. brb. Ended up eating dinner, game loaded. I jumped to \u0022Orange\u0022 and waited for the best time to rendezvous, put a maneuver, did the maneuver, waited. I got with 2km and I started blasting the 2.5m rocket towards the KSSACB. I took a while again for the docking ports to connect, but they did. the station looks very neon pink than any other color(note to self: make lights less bright). Okay, next is \u0022Green\u0022 Launchpad. It is gonna be a manned pilot mission this time, we need pilots to do the mission. The Plan so far: Launch \u0022Green\u0022 and dock to KSSACB. Rescue Bill. Build Mission Rocket. Special Mission. comms and a telescope can be added later. I found that Kerbin is easier to dock then at the Mun. Launch was normal, but the engineers realized they added no monocrop thruster blocks, so they went and fixed that. The KSSACB was at the right time, the time was morning, the KSSACB was a little behind the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E this will be easy docking. Then I forgot a docking port... it was going to be easy to dock without a docking port(not easy at all). Sooo almost to orbit, reverted, put a port on. I also added some SRBs. I got into orbit\u00A0at 125km and ended up missing the easy chance to dock with KSSACB, I did find easy ways to rendezvous so its not that bad.\u00A0I wait as it goes ahead of me and soon is behind of me so I can do the rendezvous. It takes along time at such close altitudes. \u0022Green\u0022 is the last mission that is required for the Special Mission and for the rescue of\u00A0Bill.\u00A0The mission will be hard to do, never before done, by anyone who ever played KSP. \u0022Green\u0022 had to dock from its side, which ive never done, so I had to do it weirdly it took longer than it should\u0027ve to dock because, again, never done this before. The ships docked. I need to rename it then it will be ready for the special mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYEAH!

Green-Blue color.\u00A0Not that bumpy.\u00A0That\u0027s basically it. Oh, and by highly inclined, its basically in a Polar orbit, 3 degrees off... it also has a ring with a slightly inclined orbit.

Thank god for VoronoiCraters, but it was mainly because my planets where too small. The \u0022White\u0022 Interplanetary Traveler while look like those battle ships in movies(or anime).
