The issue with trying to control the pitch on the rotor blades is that you need to then be able to control each blade independently. Otherwise you\u0027re not actually going to get a proper control input. Furthermore... You also then need some wizardry that will adjust the blades as they [the blades] change from advancing to retreating. Secondly, if you then take the load off the bearing you are probably going to get RUD as you use the VTOL assistance, unless you also design the bearing to be solid and not move when it\u0027s at less than 1G (relative to the rest of the craft).

You need a little bit of freeplay in your bearing, then you need to have something that pushes on the rotor disc\u0027s assembly.
