I sought to apply the same here. Now, Kermankind is not a militaristic race, so what use would they have for such a vehicle? Science, of course! The Orbital Deployment Vehicle, or ODV, is designed to enter an 80 kilometer polar orbit to collect science data from remote biomes. It\u0027s equipped all of the surface experiments, so isn\u0027t useful for progression out-of-the-box(The late-game experiments and engines can be stripped, of course, if you can handle the lower specific impulse), so\u00A0much as being for completionists. And sure, it would be cheaper to fly\u00A0an aeroplane over, but not everyone wants to fly a plane halfway around the planet repeatedly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/vLVfq/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaunches via a standard gravity turn, with plenty of spare delta-V for reentry(Approximately\u00A01 km/2\u00A0out of a total of 4675 m/2, assuming you launched it particularly well). 45 parts, not counting launch clamps, at 25.3t. 13.0m tall, 7.7m wide and 7.1 long, though being in 3x symmetry its horizontal area would perhaps be better measured by radius.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDownload from KerbalX: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/SingABrightSong/ODV\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://kerbalx.com/SingABrightSong/ODV\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
