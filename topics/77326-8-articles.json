Imagine being given a contract to launch 25 satellites in the most efficient way possible or building a space station over kerbin and being paid to run supplies and crew from ground to orbit. The game will always have players doing something just to allow us to maintain our space program. If we stop doing contracts, we stop making money and we stop building rockets = game over. NOW we are simulating a space program management and design system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing is for sure though, our orbital parking spots are gonna get CROWDED.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally am going to use SANDBOX to simulate my rocket designs before I import them into my career file. Test the rocket before she flies in reality.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rufledt","CreatedById":115067,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-13T23:40:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s gonna be awesome.
