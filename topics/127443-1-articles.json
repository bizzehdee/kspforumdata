Still a newbie to the game, but getting better. I\u0027ve landed on Mun and Minmus a few times, done some orbital rendezvous, and sent one orbital probe each to Duna and Eve.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EI got a contract to rescue a kerbal in high Minmus orbit. No problem, I say, I\u0027ve done rescues before. All I have to do is get a rendezvous within ~2km, switch to the stranded kerbal, and do a spacewalk to the rescue ship.

This current contract doesn\u0027t give me any info the orbit of the stranded kerbal, only a \u0022last seen\u0022 position and that it\u0027s a type A tiny object. Without knowing the inclination, eccentricity, or heck, even whether the orbit is prograde or retrograde relative to Minmus\u0027s rotation, trying to chase down this kerbal seems like searching for a needle in Eve\u0027s Explodium Sea. I\u0027ve been stymied by this for a while, so that kerbal has been in motion for a long time and only heaven knows where the poor kerbonaut is now.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EI\u0027ve got my tracking station upgraded all the way, but it doesn\u0027t give any more info. Am I missing a game mechanic here? Am I just supposed to send a rescue ship and hope? Maybe when I get close to it, I\u0027ll get another data point or full orbit info. Am I missing a part, upgrade, or mechanic that will give me more info? Now that my tracking station is all the way upgraded, I\u0027ve started to see asteroids in the neighborhood of Kerbin, and they\u0027re showing up in the same way, with no orbital info, just a last seen position.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003ERunning 1.0.4 on a game that started in 1.0.3.
