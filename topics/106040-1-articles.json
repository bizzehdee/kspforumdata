I took the extra precaution of putting mechjeb on the capsule itself and using SmartASS to keep it pointed toward retrograde, but even then it was a few degrees off from heat shield being pointed directly along the axis of travel. Probably just using the SAS from the probe core would have worked equally well, though I think my current \u0027tourist\u0027 build is going to get an SAS module added between probe core and heat shield (I wonder if the weight dist. will be better that way or worse?)\n\nAnother interesting note: the tourist gained 2 XP. I wonder what that\u0027s for? Fascinating.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Well he is a tourist. It\u0027d be prity insulting to ask tourists to man the ship.\n\nActually I would think space tourists would enjoy being given something to do in-flight, and I\u0027d imagine they usually are. I wouldn\u0027t want to go up just riding as \u0027cargo\u0027. I\u0027m more perplexed as to why the chute deploy isn\u0027t automatic (i.e., why it requires pilot or probe AI, rather than just being set off by altimeter/pressure)."},{"CreatedByName":"sdj64","CreatedById":100819,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T20:02:15Z","Content":"You can deploy a parachute \u0022automatically\u0022 by setting the min pressure and the deploy altitude to what you want before you decouple, then stage it in space before you let go of the probe core.
