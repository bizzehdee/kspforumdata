I took the extra precaution of putting mechjeb on the capsule itself and using SmartASS to keep it pointed toward retrograde, but even then it was a few degrees off from heat shield being pointed directly along the axis of travel. Probably just using the SAS from the probe core would have worked equally well, though I think my current \u0027tourist\u0027 build is going to get an SAS module added between probe core and heat shield (I wonder if the weight dist. will be better that way or worse?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother interesting note: the tourist gained 2 XP.
