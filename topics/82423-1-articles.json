Today my Sundiver One, with Macdo Kerman aboard, was trying to get \u0022near the Sun\u0022 science and return home. First, carrying enough fuel to get a Sun orbit that close in the first place. Then, got the science done, but my Kerbin rendezvous (7000 m/s delta-v, and then some) used up all my fuel before I got close to Kerbin orbit. Loaded up a different design, tweaked some things, and made it there and back, only to find that this particular craft never had chutes installed. D\u0027oh!
