Like I said, the best thing Squad could do is use the deployed state of the first gear/leg placed on the craft (which btw is tweakable in the editor). That will result in the button being correct MOST of the time, and in special cases, the craft designer just needs to learn that mechanic and place the gear in the right order.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-20T01:27:36Z\u0022 title=\u002204/20/2015 01:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tsotha","CreatedById":120361,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T03:13:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003ELike I said, the best thing Squad could do is use the deployed state of the first gear/leg placed on the craft (which btw is tweakable in the editor).\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EThe other possibility is to use the position the gear is actually in if it\u0027s in all the same position, and if not then assume the gear is starting extended.
