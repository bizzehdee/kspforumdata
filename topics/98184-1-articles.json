I have a two part mothership, front-end and back-end with a heavy Duna lander, a lighter Ike lander and a rover for transportation on Duna and every time I control the thing my FPS drops insanely low. I\u0027ve heard about the physics thing or whatever and its at the default setting but I was wondering if there are any fixes or mods that can solve this issue without having to restart the station construction because I\u0027m lying when I say it\u0027s taken at least 8 hours. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhoever can figure this out gets eighty bucks and a hooker.
