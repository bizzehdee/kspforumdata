I\u0027m currently using the RPM only interior, but I would like to update to the next step if it exists. I found a .cfg file that is supposed to implement one like what I\u0027m looking for, but I do not know how to install it, or if it even works with 1.2.2.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nLink to cfg file:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://pastebin.com/ceV2rnNM\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://pastebin.com/ceV2rnNM\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
