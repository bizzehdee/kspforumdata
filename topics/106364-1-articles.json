Wasn\u0027t quite sure where exactly was appropriate.\n\nGreetings,\n\nI\u0027ve been making some models for parts to KSP recently, but have noticed a rather odd thing.\n\nThe type of part I\u0027m working on is a surface attachable part. The main question I have is the proper orientation/facing inside unity.\n\nBasically, I\u0027ve noticed that to have the part face \u0027away\u0027 from the part attached to it needs to be facing the \u0027-Y\u0027 axis? (See images)\n\nIf facing \u002BY it faces \u0027inside\u0027 the object instead.\n\n[blender 2.71]\n\n![Blender_02.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/66594579/Blender_02.jpg)\n\n[unity 4.3.4]\n\n![Unity_01.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/66594579/Unity_01.jpg)\n\n[KSP 0.9]\n\n![KSP_01.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/66594579/KSP_01.jpg)\n\nIs this correct? And if so, will this orientation create issues with other parts like lander legs?\n\nJust want to make sure I\u0027m not doing something incorrectly or that could create a future bug.\n\nThanks for your time ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T21:30:15Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 09:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Udsahn**"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T01:27:54Z","Content":"Is what correct?

Every other tutorial or example I\u0027ve seen has had it completely different unless that changed recently.\n\nThe other reason is because things like landing gears or engines wouldn\u0027t be facing a specific direction (down -Y for instance).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E In blender rotate your part x = 90, apply rotation (rotation x/y/z: should all become zero), then rotate part x = -90, part should then appear with the same orientation in game as it does in blender\n\u003E Basically you always want rotation x = -90 for the root part of your hierarchy for going into .blend \u003E Unity \u003E Export to KSP\n\nInteresting, although in text one would find it odd because that rotation seems a bit counter productive since it ends up in the same rotation in the end (Not in blender atm). Guess it has to do with how Unity or KSP sees it though.
