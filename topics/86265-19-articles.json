Kudos for doing all the docking manually - I\u0027ve done it a few times, but now I\u0027m just too lazy and let MechJeb do it.

Good mass optimization with the use of asparagus staging, KW tanks (which are slightly better than stock) and scores of 48-7S engines. 637 tons for a three-person pod Eve lander sounds about right. The only thing missing that would really seal the deal for me is a picture of the propulsive landing, somewhere between 60 km and touchdown, to really drive it home that this is a Jebediah\u0027s level entry.

You have completed the Eve Rocks challenge with a level 2 entry!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery good looking mission. At first I thought there were some big gaps in your documentation, then I realized that imgur was only loading up the first 10 images in each album for some reason. Good solution for the descent tanks/parachute problem, and you avoided having to stage the landing gear by using the massless aircraft gear. Also good use of the newer spaceplane tanks, which have a better empty tank mass fraction in exchange for costing more. I liked the rover - somehow landing 20\u002B kilometers away just added to the authentic non-MechJebian nature of the mission. Nice recovery after discovering that your nuke engines were in the wrong spot in relation to the lander - you got into a bit of a pickle in part due to the use of two different size docking ports on the front and rear of the Wasabi Maru. Good use of the KS-25-4 motor - I\u0027m not sure I\u0027ve seen one of those before on an Eve lander. Because of that engine, TWR per stage kept going up on the ascent, instead of staying flat or going down slightly as some other designs tend to. My only suggestion (other than checking the size of the capsule vs the size of the cargo bay and making sure the docked configuration allows the LV-Ns to work \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E) would be to watch the atmospheric efficiency number in KER and throttle back a bit during the ascent - there were a couple of screenshots where the atmospheric efficiency was well over 100%, which means you\u0027re losing a lot to atmospheric drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to add the badge to your sig, and please spread some rep around if you enjoyed the challenge!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T20:35:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks so much, really appreciate the review, the kind words, and the sound advice!

This was the third or fourth time I tried to do this mission, lots of hours and explosions to finally get it right, which makes success all the sweeter! FYI, the landing gear on the rovers was to help protect the wheels when the rovers disconnect and fall from the lander, and they also keep the rover from rolling away while the Kerbals plant flags and such. I planned for the return pod to use Xenon starting from a low-Eve orbit, but the high altitude landing spot (6 km) and my paranoia from previous failures resulted in the launcher reaching not just orbit, but very nearly escape velocity!

The lander on the other hand has no part clipping except for cubic octagonal struts being used as attachment points.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) My lander design was faulted. I forgot to add ladders so I hyperedited the original lander back home, added ladders in the VAB, hyperedited it back to the exact same spot, but did the parachute descent again (including the correction burn), so it should have had the same amount of dV and weight as the original craft. Still... you could count this as a violation of the rules. As you can see in the video the design in principle works, regardless of the ladders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) This is a big one. And I am very ashamed of it. I did not quicksave from Eve ascent till Kerbin landing. Why? I wanted to keep that quicksave to return to a point in the mission where I could try out something different. But I forgot to turn off the monoprop engines. And when the main engines fired they fired as well and ... well there was no more fuel left in the lander can. I could have quickloaded again, do all the ascent with the lander again and all of the tedious transfer burns. But I was pressed for time and I resorted to infinite fuel to get the now empty tanks working again. The final lander stage would have had about 2000m/s of dV after resupplying (the Mothership had monopropellant reserves), enough to slow down the descent right before splachdown. Technically and in theory it would have worked. But I don\u0027t have any proof of it.
