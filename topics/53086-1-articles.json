The resulting camera angle shifts and zooms around the map view can be quite tiresome because of this one annoyance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to suggest a tweak that makes the various identity icons them behave like how the node control icons pop up when you click a node to edit it. Much like how Google Earth nests a cluster of panoramo icons in one icon you can expand into a cluster. This way, when icons overlap, clicking the cluster splits them into a clean tree that allows you to select what you want without having to bang your head on the wall of your lander can... (Running the risk of punching a hole in it.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a similar vein, working with orbital nodes with any form of accuracy is highly frustrating when the orbital path being edited is at one end of the screen, and the node (and its controls) are squeezed into another corner. Especially apparent when trying to accurately prepare a highly elliptical, long range path. Perhaps a camera option to \u0027center and zoom\u0027 on the orbit of a node rather than the object itself would help, as well as popping up a dedicated \u0027node edit\u0027 sub-window with easily accessed, fixed node control sliders containing clones of the existing node controls. (Pro, Retro, Normal, Antinormal, the other two I can\u0027t remember the name of, and a slider to \u0027advance\u0027 or \u0027retreat\u0027 the node without having to drag it with the mouse. Something that is extremely inaccurate when you\u0027re trying to edit the position of the node at Kerbin, while your camera is staring at Minmus.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo simple (in theory) suggestions to smooth out headaches when dealing with the map mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T10:38:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really like the idea of being able to expand icons that are very close together.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Algiark","CreatedById":83907,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T12:23:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomething like this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/haystack/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/haystack/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AdmiralTigerclaw","CreatedById":92104,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T17:52:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Algiark\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Algiark\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESomething like this?\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/haystack/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/haystack/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENope.
