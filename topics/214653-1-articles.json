From what I have noticed so far, when you load a save, the game enters a somewhat buggy state and unexpected things can and will happen. The launch button not working being one of them. The current workaround I have found for this is to just start a new campaign if I ever leave the game, because loading is currently not worth it. And yes, this includes quicksave and quickload as well, which means all my missions are currently \u0022one shot\u0022 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Elfmaze","CreatedById":136622,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-10T20:45:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust ran into this one as well.\u00A0 Can\u0027t seem to figure out how to fix it.
