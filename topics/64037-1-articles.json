The He-162 was to counter and solve that problem. It was made with wood and metal and had a light armament of 30 or 20 mm cannons. It had one turbo jet mounted on top of the fuselage, had stubby wings and was very sleek and was slower than the Me-163. But it took less maintenance, and had a lot more fuel, actually had time to shoot a decent strafes at bombers and could had the option of a throttle, unlike the Me-163. Sadly (well...not really) most of the German jets entered production and service too late.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery smooth to fly, SAS off? No problem!, very good glider, \u003Cstrong\u003EI recommend infinite fuel to be activated (you can still fly with out it)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESAS on: Has possible chance of producing oscillation at high speeds. Smoother controls\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESAS off: More difficult to control. A lot more fun, maneuverable, and sets a challenge to the pilot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft file: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./view/mkj5hc33d6jj22x/Heinkel_162_Project_Salamander.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./view/mkj5hc33d6jj22x/Heinkel_162_Project_Salamander.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/H4JwMIl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022H4JwMIl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CljB8Vw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CljB8Vw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/90yOivW.png\u0022 alt=\u002290yOivW.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
