The point there being that it links to an old forum thread: \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed2925059366\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/34737-090-magic-smoke-industries-infernal-robotics-0193/\u0026\u0026do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:207px;max-width:500px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Please can a mod go into this old thread and delete the second download link (I mean, delete both of them sure, because the curse one doesn\u0027t work, but specifically the link to kerbal stuff. It brought up a warning on Malwarebytes which I ignored, thinking it was just old so the SSL cert had run out or something like that. Instead it lead to a really dodgy website that locked up my internet browser and started spamming an audio message telling me to call a phone number due to viruses etc. Naturally I just closed the browser in Task Manager, deleted the exclusion and all was fine (after running a scan), but this could catch other forum members out if they are as stupid as me (or don\u0027t happen to have a Malwarebytes subscription). Sorry for writing it in this thread but I wasn\u0027t sure where else to put it! Thanks.\n\u003E \n\nThank you. I\u0027ve fixed the link in [Extraplanetary Launchpads](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/54284-13-extraplanetary-launchpads-v582/) to point to this thread instead and removed the bad links in the old thread.\n\nWhen you find bad links like that, please use the **Report post** feature found in the upper right of the offending post. It is a much more certain way to get the moderator team\u0027s attention."}]}
