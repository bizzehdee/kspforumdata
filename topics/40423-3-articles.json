I\u0027m currently exploring alternative methods, however, so if anyone has inputs I\u0027d like to hear them. Also, at least for now, the roll indicator only appears when the alignment indicator is on screen.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-07T16:47:51Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2013 04:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by NavyFish\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T17:00:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NavyFish\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NavyFish\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eyou\u0027ll see what I mean soon enough!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t wait!
