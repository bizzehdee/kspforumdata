Despite the paradoxical fact that this scientific and exploratory \u0027movement\u0027 emerged out of a potentially apocalyptic ideological competition between to nuclear-armed superpowers, I would say the Space Race has done as much to accelerate human cultural and intellectual evolution (or perhaps \u0027revolution\u0027) as did any of the preceding eras of exploration and \u0027conquest\u0027 in our long natural history. It is difficult to contemplate how much \u0027worse\u0027 life on Earth would be for humanity if _not_ for the Space Race.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt troubles me slightly that, at present there seems to be a lack of a comparable solidary spirit of discovery among any humans (much less all of them).

Visionaries like 20th century Science Fiction writers certainly foresaw such things, but the fact that it has been brought into fruition as soon as it has is I would argue anomalous relative to where the world was in say ~1950 when the seeds of the Space Race were being planted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Arab Spring could be argued to have been an indirect outcome of the Space Race in that it relied quite heavily on mobile telecomms and web-based social media.

I think you may be quite right!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was playing Minecraft and got to poking around on wiki, etc., learning up on gold mining. A couple of points struck me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. It is estimated that all of the gold (which it seems is an exceedlingly useful element in myriad devices and functions, and not merely a pretty metal for jewelry) humanity has extracted from Earth would fit within a roughly 20-meter cube. Wow . . . that little?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. It is hypothesized that most of the gold that is accessible in the upper crust of the Earth was not present when the Earth originally formed, but in fact has been brought to Earth after its coalescence into a planet by meteorite impacts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The \u0022Tau Tona\u0022 mine in Witwatersrand district of South Africa is \u0027in\u0027 one of the impact zones of one of the most notable deliverers of gold. This mine has been in operation for many decades and is CRAAZZY deep (4 km if memory serves). Despite its being less than 50 years old, it has already produced the majority of the gold humanity has ever extracted from Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Rocks in space are likely to have untold fortunes of this metal (and I reckon lots of other ones, e.g., I was reading up about \u0022metallic hydrogen\u0022 which is only a confidently hypothesized elemental state at this point. But assuming it does actually exist under the surface of Jupiter it would seemingly promise incredible possibilities).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022Age of Discovery\u0022 was certainly driven by the fact that the \u0022New Worlds\u0022 of the 1400s promised untold riches for European kingdoms and their subjects, but surely the distant celestial bodies of our own solar system must promise millions of times more?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-04T14:53:59Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2013 02:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Diche Bach\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Themohawkninja","CreatedById":9628,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-04T14:57:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESeeing as any sort of international competition always creates wonders, I hope this happens some day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat would spark such a thing is an interesting question. On one hand, this could be started as easily as a new ISS, whereby countries try and 1-UP the modules of other countries. On the otherhand, the Cold War may have been the end of international government based space races, and now a space race may consist of the private companies trying to win a massive contract with the government to accomplish some task (like refueling the ISS, manned mission to Mars, etc). In the far future, we may see ads, like we do now for fast food companies, who try and show why they are better than the other companies to try and persuade you to buy THEIR ticket to LEO, and not someone elses.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbface","CreatedById":58573,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-04T15:15:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think China could end up being the one who sets off another space race, combined of course with the commercial space companies helping advance technology faster.
