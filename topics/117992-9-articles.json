SMURFF improves part performance to match the (real-world) aerospace state-of-the-art and reduces the required rocket mass from 70x payload mass with stock parts to 25-35x (as is the case with real rockets).\n\nHowever, if you want to get that down to 7x (the typical rocket mass in stock), by my calculations you should try setting tankLever to 4 or 4.5.  The pod lever should not be set higher than 1, as it might lead to negative part masses.  I\u0027m not sure about engineLever, but it should be fine to leave it at 1, since the total rocket mass will be smaller and the thrust buff won\u0027t need increasing.\n\nBe advised that putting any lever above one will void your warranty.  I understand that KSP\u0027s joint strength system has changed quite a bit in the 1.2.x series, but in the past it has been known to depend on part mass, among other things, so having tanks that are paper-light when they\u0027re empty may cause structural problems, and your vehicles\u0027 CGs may move surprisingly far as fuel is drained, which may cause stability issues."},{"CreatedByName":"mcfunk0017","CreatedById":156032,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-25T23:40:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 12/15/2016 at 4:16 PM, Kerbas\\_ad\\_astra said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E It should be, although I haven\u0027t tried it yet.
