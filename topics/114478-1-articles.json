Things are as they are and are not going to change. The game is released. The worry now is that much waited-for bug fixes are looking more and more unlikely.

Even the \u0022media team\u0022 on youtube is backing off. Just look at the viewer numbers in recent weeks.\n\nThe only differences between Squad now and during \u0022alpha\u0022 are words. To many that means we can expect little practical change between now and the end. We must expect every release from now until the last to be mod-breaking. We must expect every release between now and the end to be save-breaking. And we must expect every release from now until the last to introduce new bugs, most of which will go unfixed forever. Those are very depressing thoughts for everyone other than Squad, who doesn\u0027t seem to mind this state of affairs one bit.\n\nBut the port to console will at least be entertaining. Console users do not take bugs easily. Let\u0027s say the port comes out in six months. Would your average console user expect so many bugs from any game after 5\u002B years of development, nearly a year of which is post the official release?
