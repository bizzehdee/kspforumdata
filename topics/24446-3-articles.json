I\u0027m not sure what to edit, or how to implement it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDITEDIT: If there were a way to have it poll the mass similar to how Mechjeb does, or even the new stats screen in 0.20, then I think it would be a lot less laggy. I\u0027m pretty sure it polls the masses of every single part and adds it together, then does the same for resources. I noticed this when I tested if it was working with a 3 part ship with no lag compared to loading up Kerbal X and there is a lot of lag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this to do with why it is so laggy?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you are saying that the line\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edouble mass = SpaceDockUtilities18.DetermineMassOfVessel(vessel);\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eis executing every frame, causing the lag?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownloading visual studio now, I think this may be a good mod for me to learn ksp coding - no 3d maths involved \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"evilC","CreatedById":60370,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T16:15:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK, so I replaced that line with double mass = 1 and the lag went.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis should be very easy to fix, gimme a few mins.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"evilC","CreatedById":60370,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T17:33:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERight, I have fixed it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGimme a bit before I release tho - I am adding some refinements - eg allowing you to release docking clamps then immediately \u0022build\u0022 (teleport).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"krystar","CreatedById":68306,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T18:01:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei was thinking of changing mass to a object property and moving the determinemass to onAwake or onStart. it only needs to execute once since mass shouldn\u0027t change. wasn\u0027t sure what exactly those methods tie into on the unityengine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei know we\u0027ve always said that spacebuilt vessels shouldn\u0027t have the stability enhancers..but i think we need to code in an option to strip the stability enhancer parts off of the vessel so to allow designing vessels that cannot hold together under 1g, but are fine in 0g. that\u0027s at least half of the reason why you would build a ship in an orbital shipyard instead of a terrestial one.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-03T18:16:54Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2013 06:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by krystar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"evilC","CreatedById":60370,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T18:41:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022krystar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022krystar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei know we\u0027ve always said that spacebuilt vessels shouldn\u0027t have the stability enhancers..but i think we need to code in an option to strip the stability enhancer parts off of the vessel so to allow designing vessels that cannot hold together under 1g, but are fine in 0g. that\u0027s at least half of the reason why you would build a ship in an orbital shipyard instead of a terrestial one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have this working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am also making the UI more friendly, if you have suggestions, post em.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurely it does not matter about mass once it has been put into orbit and the designator deleted?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure it may chug while porting around but that does not matter.
