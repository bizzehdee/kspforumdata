This had to be tweaked with different rockets but overall this was how I did it. In 1.0 I\u0027m doing the same and it seems fine, until around 40,000m when I\u0027m flying level I start to heat up and bits explode. \n\nCan anyone shed any light on why this is happening?"},{"CreatedByName":"Aerindel","CreatedById":109952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T02:06:00Z","Content":"You just need to go higher up.

I was lead to believe the Gravity Turns in FAR were correct. Or at least close to being correct. Obviously if bits and bobs pop off of rockets doing these turns in real life they wouldnt be done ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"MechaLynx","CreatedById":108866,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T02:37:54Z","Content":"Which bits explode first? Perhaps you have too many things hanging off the side (I assume not, if you\u0027re used to FAR, but I\u0027ve never used it and have no idea how heat and drag work there compared to 1.02). I generally don\u0027t have a problem with overheating, just tumbling over."},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T03:12:43Z","Content":"Above 30-35 km the 1.0.2 atmosphere starts to really thin out, so I have not really had heating problems after that high. My 3200 vacuum dV ascents have come from a smooth turn profile, but starting a little later around 4-5km and turning over to 45 degrees near 15km. I then continue rolling over to about 20 degrees around 30-35 km, followed by 2-5 degrees up to around 50km. After 50km I might as well be in orbit in terms of atmospheric resistance, but I usually have MECO already at that point."},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T04:07:34Z","Content":"Many parts, like batteries and goo canisters are pretty sensitive to heat and will explode on a fast ascent if they aren\u0027t kept in a protective enclosure, like a fairing or cargo bay."},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T04:41:43Z","Content":"The KR 1x2 booster also gets pretty warm in the upper atmosphere.

The main bits to explode are fins. I was finding that when I get to the 2nd / 3rd stage (depending on design) no matter what, when decoupling, the remaining parts (final stage with pod) flipped over unless I put basic small fins on there (which are enclosed in a fairing until this point so as not to mess up the CoL). These then explode."}]}
