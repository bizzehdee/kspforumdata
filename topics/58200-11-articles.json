Guns produced to US specifications would use inches from the large 14\u2033 guns used by the USN Battleships to the caliber of small arms. Before WWI the US would adopt arms from the UK or other European Arms manufacturers. (Krag-Joergensen rifles from Norway) But when WWI started, the US lacked modern arms other than rifles and hand guns. The UK and French had placed orders for artillery in the US and so many were adopted by the US for the War. The US Expeditionary Army also had to use arms supplied by the Allies in France.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#282829;font-size:15px;padding:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EGenerally if not US in origin, if a weapon is measured in inches, it is an adoption of a British weapon. Examples are the 8\u2033 howitzer, and in WWII the 4.5\u2033 gun. If it is measured in millimeters, it usually means that it was adopted from a French weapon. Examples are the 155mm gun and howitzer, the 75mm gun, 60mm and 81mm mortars. For the first two, after the War, the US developed their own versions of the gun and howitzer but kept the 155mm designation. The 105mm howitzer came from an examination of the German WWI weapon and they decided that that caliber would be used for the new light howitzer. The 37mm anti-tank gun also was adapted from a German weapon. From the mid 1950s most weapons would be measured in millimeters but some habits die hard, such as the 50 cal heavy machine gun and the 4.2 inch/107mm mortar.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.quora.com/Why-did-US-in-WW2-mix-weapons-with-caliber-in-either-imperial-or-metric-units-Small-arms-were-imperial-50-BMG-30-Carbine-30-06-and-45-ACP-while-mortars-and-artillery-had-various-metric-bores-and-naval-rifles-were\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESource\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bigger question is why the Soviets used inches?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-25T09:10:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224122400\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002258200\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221650877341\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002262955\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Deddly\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 minutes ago, Deddly said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bigger question is why the Soviets used inches?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExactly this is absolutely natural.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe backward compatibility with stored shells and with equipment for their mass production which was in use much longer than in US.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs in pre-Soviet times the industry was historically not developed, the Western standards were prevailing in ammo, pipes, etc. So, in inches.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSome later cannons are metric: 73, 100, 125, 130.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-04-25T09:11:26Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2022 09:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by kerbiloid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Codraroll","CreatedById":163815,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-25T10:04:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGotta wonder if the Russians will switch to metric artillery calibers eventually too.

But now everyone is running out of those, and NATO is re-supplying with 155 mm artillery ammo (and by necessity, guns) instead. Effectively, 152 mm ammo is phased out all over Europe, which means Russia is left having to maintain a supply chain for 152 mm ammo only for their own use, or make the switch themselves as well. There are a few other countries that still use 152 mm artillery, but those are being phased out all over the place too. 155 mm is emerging as the global standard, and recent events only serve to accelerate it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-25T10:39:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224122406\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002258200\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221650881054\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022163815\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Codraroll\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n35 minutes ago, Codraroll said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n155 mm is emerging as the global standard, and recent events only serve to accelerate it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2S19_Msta\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2S19_Msta\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt has a 155 mm version for export.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheSaint","CreatedById":70033,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-27T15:53:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224122383\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002258200\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221650875767\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129408\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerbiloid\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 4/25/2022 at 1:36 AM, kerbiloid said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSoviet howitzer: 152.4 mm = 60 lines = 6 inch.
