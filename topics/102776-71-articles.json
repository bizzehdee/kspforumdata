It\u0027s had no real love since it was initially released so ill be working on that soon. The whole rework was based off the idea of realism (mostly) i wanted to create bodies that looked mroe like they could actually exist rather than over the top ones that in no way could. Unfortunately the real world is slightly more bland than the bright colors of the original NH, but i did what i could.
