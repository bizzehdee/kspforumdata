For the most part this work has been involving fixing non critical ui related issues and spelling errors. I also haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t seen any real programming exceptions with the ui yet, which is a good thing, because those tend to crash the game for silly reasons.\u003Cp\u003EThe hardest part of writing tests for this system is to figure out what constitutes a design concern. It gets tricky fast because whether it is an error or not depends on what you intend to use the rocket for. Consider missing parachutes. There is no way to determine whether a vessel is never supposed to land (ie. no parachute required in the first place). Or the case where you use a single docking port on your vessel to release a probe Not an error in itself, but the released probe will likely not have docking capabilities. Still not an error because it could be a satellite. And what if you intended to land that \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cthing\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2.
