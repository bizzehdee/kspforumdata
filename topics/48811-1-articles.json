BUT, only because in one of the weekly updates it was mentioned that there was was over 43 parts to unlock through research, so I had the \u0022bazaar\u0022 assumption that there was going to be 43\u002B new parts (which led me to believe they were going to have some mining parts, and then some... considering its been 10 months)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t get me wrong...
