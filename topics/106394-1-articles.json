And indeed there several stock parts with drag cube overrides in the part .cfg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeveral stock parts have multiple drag-cube entries in the PartDatabase.cfg file, -without- multiple overrides in their part.cfg file. They also do not seem to have any additional colliders/bounding boxes when the .mu is imported into blender. I have a feeling that those parts have new custom bounding boxes or such created in unity to define these custom drag cube properties (tags/layers/naming convention)(which may not be supported by the .mu importer yet). May need to wait for some dev response to know what is up on the part-tools/proper way of doing things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, I can note that in the PartDatabase.cfg there is an A and B drag-cube entry for each part with an animation; these cubes seem to roughly correspond with the size of the part at each animation state. Parts with -multiple- animations get drag-cubes listed only as \u0027procedural=true\u0027; I\u0027m guessing this tells the game engine to recalculate the drag-cube based on the current combination of animation states. Here is where the problem will likely be for any mod-added parachutes at the current time--without knowing how to specify the custom drag-cube overrides in the model, these will likely all default to \u0027procedural=true\u0027 due to multiple animations; the default procedurally calculated drag-boxes are nowhere near appropriate for parachute-like drag, and are not named appropriately for the drag-cube-modifier module to take effect properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach drag-cube entry has a name (first param), followed by 24 comma separated values. As near as I can tell, these value are broken into 8 groups of 3, representing the 3-dimensional coordinates for the corners of a bounding box. Makes sense for something called a \u0027drag-cube\u0027. I\u0027m still working over the conversion of these values into the bounding box, and how it relates to the part orientation and dimensions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did notice for stock parachutes that the drag cube seemed to be offset quite a bit on the X\u002B axis (if X is the first coordinate given...still working on that...), up to 100 units for the larger parachute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--going to import some of these .mu models into blender, and map their drag cubes over top of them, to see how they correspond to model-space. This should hopefully give enough information to specify some custom drag-cubes that -work-, with further tweaking in the part.cfg through the drag-cube multiplier stats.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- further edit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA quick plotting in blender of one of these \u0027cubes\u0027 (as 8 groups of 3, each a 3-d coordinate), fails to make any sense as a geometric shape.

The first 6 sets are the projection of the part as onto a plane for each of the six faces of a cube. The last 2 sets are unknown. In each of the first six sets of values, the first number represents the area (w/h), the second the drag coefficient, and the third is the depth. They are listed in X\u002B, X-, Y\u002B, Y-, Z\u002B, Z- order as far as I\u0027m aware.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDrag Coefficient stuff: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_coefficient\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_coefficient\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKnowing this, I\u0027ll be working through some of the drag-cube stuff today, figuring out the best way to manually specify drag cube(s) for custom parachutes; will post up whatever information I can find/figure out. I will likely start by comparing some stock values to see how they \u0027look\u0027, and do some trial and error from there to find how each value effects the outcome. Some real, hard, info on how this stuff should be properly calculated would be much appreciated if anyone can find it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cocox","CreatedById":108646,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T15:44:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow do I make an MM patch to add \u0022\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EbodyLiftMultiplier = 0\u0022 to all parachute parts?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T15:52:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStock parachutes (and those from other mod authors) should already have that line in them.

All three named cubes get inserted into the PartDatabase.cfg, but instead of starting with cube = DEPLOYED, etc... they start with DEPLOYED = DEPLOYED, and are not registered/loaded properly as far as the parachute module is concerned. I examined the stock pieces that have drag cube overrides in the part.cfg file, and they have the same bug/issue in the PartDatabase.cfg file; their drag cubes are started with \u0027Default = Default\u0027, rather than the proper \u0027cube = Default\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for now, I\u0027ve removed the extra animations from my part (some cabin light emissive stuff....), so that the game auto-calculates the drag cubes properly, I can use the parachute drag-cube-multiplier modules, and possibly be able to release my parts one day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose I should probably report this find to the KSP Bug Tracker?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
