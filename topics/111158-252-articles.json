(The reason we don\u0027t let people just delete posts themselves is because of the potential for abuse, e.g. from trolls and such.)\n\nWe\u0027re happy to remove a user\u0027s post when they request it... on one condition:  **only if nobody has quoted it or responded to it.**  Because if someone *\u003Cu\u003Ehas\u003C/u\u003E* responded, then deleting the original would leave the responder looking like they\u0027re responding-to-nothing, which would be weird.\n\nSo, for example, suppose you wanted to remove your post that I\u0027ve just quoted above.  Since people have already responded to it (for example, Gargamel\u0027s initial response), that means that that particular post of yours would not be subject to removal, even upon request."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-22T18:37:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 12 hours ago, CFYL said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So...

Since something needs to be there, software will often stick in the default date of 12/31/69.
