I hope you do go into the math (a bit) on your next one. The Goddard Dilemma doesn\u0027t get much attention at all, even though it is so crucial to our missions. So thank you!

Very steep ascents (67% and 75%) were horribly inefficient. In the related challenge thread, we figured out that we should adjust that curve to keep our rockets at terminal velocity Vt. So a slow rocket should turn lower and flatter, while a fast rocket should turn higher and steeper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe exact figures will change with the updated drag model.

IF you\u0027re trying to get to a higher orbit than 72 x 72 km, your ideal ascent profile changes substantially: generally you want to make your gravity-turn a bit later and slower when launching directly to a higher orbit (and you generally want to launch to a higher orbit than 72 x 72 km so that your orbit won\u0027t turn you too much when making a long ejection-burn: although periapsis-kicks are an option to help get around that...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunching directly to slightly higher orbits (say 150 km instead of 75 km) is generally more fuel-efficient when you\u0027re trying to get beyond LKO as it gives you more time to perform your circularization burn, and thus allows you to get by with a lower upper-stage TWR (which allows you to increase your total Delta-V with better fuel-fraction or higher-ISP engines...) and also allows you to perform your ejection-burns over a longer period of time or more accurately...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the ascent profile that will get you to orbit with the most mass remaining (including engine and empty fuel tank mass), most Delta-V remaining (a combination of fuel-fraction and engine ISP), and most fuel remaining are generally different things. Rockets with higher upper-stage TWR ratings (in multi-stage rockets) will often get to orbit with more total mass, but less fuel: which can be useful if you plan on refueling and using that upper stage as a transfer-stage for a substantially-larger interplanetary vessel, for instance, but sub-optimal for a one-off mission profile. There\u0027s also the trade-off between TWR and ISP in your engines: a rocket with higher-thrust (but lower ISP) upper stage engines might consume less fuel to get you to orbit (due to shorter time-to-orbit), but actually leave you with less Delta-V to get where you\u0027re heading in the long run...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrying to optimize rocket designs is what real-life rocket scientists spend DECADES on.
