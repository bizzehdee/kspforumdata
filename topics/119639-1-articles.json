When I say formulaically determine the mass based on the parts stats I mean all the parts stats (crew capacity, resource storage, crash tolerance, heat tolerance, commandable, science lab, crew can, the works) as it stands the crewed parts have absolutely no rhyme or reason and none would be agreed on by being in any way arbitrary. Basically there needs to be common ground to avoid community controversy. Assuming absolute soul crushing realism isn\u0027t everyone\u0027s cup of tea (it isn\u0027t mine I don\u0027t even drink tea) the answer is a common formula for determining stats. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe end result would be the same as you eyeballing it, but no one can complain about the result because it was calculated by a means that was fair to all pods. Station and lander parts would be lighter and more fragile than their space plane and reentry capsule counterparts is this not what everyone wants? though people would disagree as to how much more fragile or sturdy any one part would be for a given mass that is why I insist on formulaic generation of mass based on stats so that the parts are given their unique roles fairly and thereby the inevitable firestorm over fans being displeased with the balance like they were with the general engine nerf can be more easily quelled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Of course beyond saying \u0022I think the answers a copout\u0022 going on about capsule balance is probably straying further from the topic than one should... \u0026gt;.\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-29T16:26:47Z\u0022 title=\u002208/29/2015 04:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by passinglurker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T16:35:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow do I see the chatlog for each video?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moesly_Armlis","CreatedById":112247,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T17:19:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have read all of the squadcast summaries and never have thanked you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreat job and thanks for making these summaries.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T17:34:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Squad via 5thHorseman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Squad via 5thHorseman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EClick through is annoying but you can work around it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry.
