The falcon 9 is designed to boost a payload \u002B upper stage halfway to orbit. It\u0026#39;s far, far, FAR bigger, heavier, more flexible, its engines don\u0026#39;t allow it to hover like the New Shepard, etc. SpaceX has to overcome a whole lot more difficult problems.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat being said, this [I]was[/I] a historic event: it was the first rocket that passed the Karman (I swear I almost typed Kerman there) line and come back down to land safely. The team behind it definitely deserves all the recognition and credit for that. And I definitely agree that the civil response from musk would have been to say \u0022hey, good job on achieving your goal. Now we\u0026#39;re going to go back to work on ours\u0022. I have great admiration for what Elon Musk has done and continues to do to drive technology forward to a more sustainable future, but I really dislike how he reacts to these sort of things, or to people investigating technologies or things he considers not worth researching.[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt was the first rocket that passed the Karman line and safely performed a propulsive landing.

The falcon 9, being a bigger better rocket, doesnt have enough mass left at landing to hover even on minimum engine settings of 1/9 of their engines- it\u0026#39;s just too powerful. The New Shepard has a mass fraction poor enough that a single engine capable of lifting fuel\u002Brocket\u002B payload to the karman line can throttle down low enough to hover on just the rocket dry weight, which makes correcting to a landing far easier, as shown in the Blue Origin video.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nElon cant get that hover capability with a falcon 9 booster because of the power the Falcon needs, which means he needs to get a soft landing on a crash burn, unlike New Shepard which can correct onto target and set down smoothly.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mitchz95","CreatedById":82292,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-26T17:26:46Z","Content":"\nI feel like Musk isn\u0026#39;t really hating on Blue Origin, he\u0026#39;s just trying to clarify some misunderstandings people might have about reusable rockets and it\u0026#39;s being taken the wrong way.

Any comercial company that gets a launcher to space is already impressive just by doing that.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, it\u0026#39;s not rly comparable to what spacex does, not rly because spacex is better (they have yet to get it done), but because the problem is a different one. The falcon9\u0026#39;s first stage HAS to operate on vastly stricter margins in order to be somewhat efficient and of any use for an orbital launch with a payload. NS is more like an oversized lander and is build to be reliable, but not to be as efficient as the first stage of launcher that goes to orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAgain, they did something cool here (and say that they are the first -\u0026gt;comercial\u0026lt;- company to do that kind of thing; they never compared themself to NASA on any source I saw). \u003Cbr\u003E\nFor the task at hand NS is a pretty good vehicle from what it looks lile. However, BO would be facing a vastly harder challenge if they were trying to build a similar craft, but with falcon9\u0026#39;s margins.
