You need to install the Lazor plugin which allows you to increase the draw limit to 99km. Then you need a camera that can TRACK the target ( that\u0027s key ). There\u0027s only one I know of, but the window is too small for some reason. It\u0027s the Lazor camera from the same mod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut the Lazor camera on a probe then move the probe to a nice view. Load a rocket on the pad, switch to camerabot. Activate camera ( small viewing window pops up ), Target the rocket, hit track target. Switch back to the rocket ( the camera window remains open and will track ) and take off. As you pilot/mechjeb your flight you can watch it in 3rd person. And with max zoom you can watch your rocket go all the way to orbit and set past the horizon. It\u0027s a beautiful thing.. Especialy with multiple views.. my camerabot watches my rockets from the island with the second airport and I have one on top of the VAB. And on the beach. REALLY cool stuff. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only problem is the crappy little window the camera gives you. So does anyone know of a camera that can zoom and TRACK and at the same time giving me a full screen window? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can really achieved some cool effects with this setup. Because its not just launches. I can watch all my space stations go by from the ground. And I watch all my crafts reentrys from the ground aswell. All the way to touch down. And let\u0027s say you did an Apollo mission to the Mun. From the CM orbiter I can look down on the landing site as I pass over and see my kerbals on the ground with their head lights on. AND watching skycranes fly away and crash on Duna is great. Lol its A LOT of fun.
