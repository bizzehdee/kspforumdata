I am compassionate with people that loss their job. Heck we even employ people as long as it had to for them to find another job. So much for not giving a damn. I plainly said that these things happen and people have to adapt. Did anyone cried for all the programmers that google laid off on last year and a half? As much as i see on forum people were blaiming devs for everything while i mantained distance from that and blaimed bad management. As for AI, people that know basic programming will be impacted as for true developers and engineers i don\u0027t think there is any worry.
