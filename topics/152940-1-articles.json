The \u0022Build a new unmanned probe...\u0022 is not being checked even if I build a completely new craft. The same craft worked before 1.2. The one I tried has a Probodobodyne OKTO for probe core, Communotron 16 and DTS-M1 antennas, and OX-STAT solar panels.

They did not complete in the same way you describe, and a bit of experimenting showed that they needed to have a working connection for active probe control in order to complete. Either enabling all ground-stations (I had chosen only \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E as I\u0027m ex Remote Tech user) or disabling CommNet entirely in the difficulty settings would do the trick, or just launching a 2G antenna polar orbit craft and waiting for alignment. But note, acquiring\u00A0a connection while the contract satellite is loaded does not re-evaluate the contract condition, you\u0027ll need to switch away to the space center or other craft and then back to the contract satellite while it has connection for it to complete.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"petersohn","CreatedById":153211,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-26T10:05:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am also using RemoteTech, so I have CommNet completely disabled.
