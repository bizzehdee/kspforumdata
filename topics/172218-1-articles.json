If you take an honest look at your internet life in general (from a US perspective here) there is no such thing as anonymity or even security- many large entities who have your info that you have no control over have been compromised already, including Steam. It seems that many mobile apps want access to folders that have nothing to do with their main function, or at least could handle it in a less skeevy way. If you don\u0027t have a facebook account they still have ways to monitor your activity. It\u0027s an ugly mess that is really hard to avoid. That being said, that\u0027s no excuse for a company to engage in shady (or broadly generic) practices or for users to accept it as the norm.

The value of, say, the MH Gemini capsule is not that it\u2019s just a 2-Kerbal capsule, it\u2019s the Squad (\u003Ci\u003Enearly \u003C/i\u003Estock) capsule. Having a mod that allows you to load a vessel that uses the MH parts with \u003Ci\u003Eyour identical \u003C/i\u003E(name, id, geometry) would undermine sales as its aimed at the Expansion Pack and \u003Ci\u003Ethen\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0they will go after you.

Instead, they could pull their collective thumbs out and craft a reasonable agreement that\u0027s more suitable to a game like KSP which has grown up as an early-access game with a heavy emphasis on community involvement.
