Perhaps players have become complacent with the current system but I find a fair bit of difficulty to build even simple crafts. Placing wheels on a vehicle body in the VAB is a MAJOR pain. The spaceplane hangar makes this a lot easier but placing almost anything else on the rover in a symmetrical fashion such as solar panels or batteries is once again, frustrating. Further more there is no official way in game to transfer vehicles between assembly buildings in the currant system. If I wanted to build a rover in the SPH, test it from that building, then launch it on a rocket built in the VAB to send it to Duna or something I can\u0027t do that! I would have to attempt to rebuild it in the VAB which completely defeats the purpose of using the spaceplane hanger for connivence; Yes I know there\u0027s ways to do it thru save files but that\u0027s besides the point. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuilding rovers right now feels like an exploit. With the current system it seems to heavily imply \u0022You\u0027re using a system to build rockets to trying to exploit it to make something completely different\u0022 but that\u0027s not how it should be! I love using rovers to explore body\u0027s and all the parts are included vanilla so it\u0027s not an exploit! They are an integral part of the game! So WHY is the core foundation for building these vanilla supported vehicles so flawed? A spaceplane hanger was added to the game, why not a rover assembly building?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sedativechunk","CreatedById":112761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T05:32:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI guess this is an interesting idea. Although I don\u0027t have a problem necessarily with the VAB, I think the editor for building them could use ALOT of work. It can be so furiously frustrating trying to add wheels and other components to parts in KSP, especially if you are building rovers that are set in a vertical position. Another flop with rovers is that, currently KSP doesn\u0027t have any legitimate parts for storing a rover. You know, like you basically have to mount it on top of a rover or some other goofy configuration, you are unable to put it in some storage bay like most realistic rovers are without mods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Twreed87","CreatedById":50017,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T09:22:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ability to transfer from SPH to VAB would go along way. Perhaps it could be as a subassembly, too. Also, more symmetry options in both buildings would be nice. Just a few more tools to make building easier (vertical snap, please?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, i think the assembly buildings could use a rehaul. Hopefully they make a point of it once they\u0027re done implementing Career, but it\u0027d be nice to see a few updates made along the way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
