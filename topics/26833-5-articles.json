I would like to see your old version reworked into storage and/or instrument panels on either side of the old central corridor. Also, the new 4m crew deck is fine for orbital stations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[EDIT, I NO LONGER BELIEVE THIS PART: ... but not very practical for a planetary/moon base.

I have started making a Skylab looking mod veeery similar to this. It is a 6 meter diameter modular hull that can be branched into 4 quarter-pieces and each can be used for a specific purpose. I initially wanted to make just a way to store lots of fuel or spherified tanks, but then it grew into a modular system with hatches and an airlock\u003Cp\u003Ehere you can see the hull with one quarter taken out, and cargo holds exposed. With one quarter exposed you are able to go into the central shaft and enter the space inside\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0c141OOl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220c141OOl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AMudjZzl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022AMudjZzl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edo you have a download for this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
