Some thing along the Surface Lights Mod that used to be on Kerbal mods website. Alas all or any light packs are pretty much out of date regarding the KSP version number. Has anyone found or know of a different website where i can find ones that are compliant with the current KSP version number, the stock lights are way too bulky and big. \n\nThank you."},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T20:19:25Z","Content":"Surface mounted stock-alike lights for self illumination mod is what you want I guess\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-29T20:20:51Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2015 08:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Feradose**\n  \nslight typo"},{"CreatedByName":"hazens1","CreatedById":129789,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T20:35:24Z","Content":"These have not been updated in a long time, but since they are purely part based they don\u0027t need to be updated very often.
