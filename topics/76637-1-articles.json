I want to give you a present. It\u0027s a pretty present, and I like it quite a lot, but I know not everyone is going to like this present. But I\u0027m going to give it to you anyway, so those that enjoy it get some merriment, and those that don\u0027t can feel bad for a while. ...because if you don\u0027t find this funny, you should absolutely feel bad. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGeneral premise\u003C/strong\u003E: I want to introduce you to a think called the \u003Cem\u003EBatsu Game\u003C/em\u003E. It\u0027s a kind of a televised thing in Japan, where people make a wager, and whoever loses has to do something terrible. The terrible doings is the actual part called the batsu game. Batsu means \u0022Punishment\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESpecific premise\u003C/strong\u003E: The show is called \u0022Downtown\u0027s Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!\u0022 and I am of the opinion that is rates amongst the most impressive works ever done by man. They\u0027re a variety show of sorts. In Japan, obviously. The two main guys are Hamada Masatoshi and Matsumoto Hitoshi. They\u0027re a comedy duo group called \u0022Downtown\u0022. A Boke/Tsukkomi group. Or more literally, a fool and a straight man. Or more accurately, a Laurel and Hardy. They didn\u0027t pioneer this genre, but they altered it severely through their interpretation of it. Prior to them, a Boke/Tsukkomi would always do things a certain way. The boke would dress like a kid, playing the fool, and the straight man would dress sharp and act like an adult. Downtown changed that. Matsumoto, the boke, dresses very sharp but plays the fool. Hamada is the straight man and dresses casual. It was a kind of metaphorical rude-gesture towards the authoritarian types in their earlier days. Needless to say, they became very popular early. They share the show with semipermanent co-hosts Tanaka Naoki, Endo Shozo, and Yamazaki Hosei. Tanaka and Endo are another boke/tsukkomi group, but I haven\u0027t seen much of their standup, so I can\u0027t really tell you how they work. Yamazaki? He\u0027s a solo man... and does a unique form of comedy. Basically, he\u0027s funny because he tries hard to be funny and fails, therefore being funny. Think of him as a Japanese version of Will Farrel who is actually good at it and doesn\u0027t make you cringe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, this show is a variety show. They don\u0027t do batsu games all the time. They can\u0027t. Bodies need time to heal. In between, they do a myriad of strange and esoteric things that are fun to watch. They range from \u0022Let\u0027s put everyone in god-awful costumes nobody would want to be caught dead in, get on a bus, play a version of simon says, and whoever loses has to get out and walk back to the studio in very public and humiliating shame.\u0022 and \u0022Let\u0027s do a cooking show where we try to invent delicious new dishes, but instead come up with something obscenely vile and try to get Hamada to eat it.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong story short, you have to see this show. Lucky for you, clip follows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMore specific\u003C/strong\u003E: This is the first half of the infamous \u0022High School Batsu Game.\u0022 Four men lost the challenge, and one won. Hamada wins, so he gets to design, run, and interfere with the game. His word is stone. Unfortunately for the four, one of Hamada\u0027s knicknames is \u0022The Super Sadist\u0022 and you\u0027re going to see why haha!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rules are simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) Do not laugh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) If you do laugh, you will be punished immediately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it\u0027s easy to not laugh for a whole day, right? Well... what if people who have known you for twenty years all conspire against you? And set trap after trap after trap after trap to force you to laugh? What hope do you have?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy with Vigor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#EDIT: In case you\u0027re wondering, that inset window in the top right?
