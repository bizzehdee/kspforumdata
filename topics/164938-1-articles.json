Get the pot going. I\u2019m going to want a double-double when I get back.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C2-Heelo, Dancers, copy that,\u201D one of the controllers. \u201DYou\u2019re projected for Eliza. Catch you on the brownside.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDancers, 2-Heelo. Bingo fuel. I\u2019m ballistic till landing. She\u2019s whispering now.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo,\u201D Jebediah whispered. His hands clasped the railing. His knuckles were white. \u201CIt\u2019s cursing her.\u201D Walt glanced over at him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA grunt and the sound of tearing metal came through the speakers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDanc \u2014 \u201C Her voice shifted to have a faintly folksy slightly bored drawl. \u201CMayday. Mayday. Mayday. Taxi 132-Heelo. Taxi 132-Heelo. Taxi 132-Heelo. I have lost one of the control fins. Felt like some of the hull as well. Do not know if there is\u00A0other damage. Still have remaining fins. Wheels look to saturate and leave me short of authority. Going\u00A0to keep\u00A0damaged side high and in the shadow. Heading, 90 Tango. Angels, 51. Surface speed, 1.9 kilo. Position 0.1 North, 155 West. Five kerbals on board.

SAR has been alerted. You will have radio blackout in approximately two minutes. We have your radar track.

Break.\u201D Her voice shifted back to the slightly excited cheerful tone.\u00A0 \u201COkay folks. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re strapped in. We\u2019re in for a ride that would make a Kisney E-ticket pale. This will be one to tell the grandkids about.\u201D She laughed in response to something said in the cabin. \u201CLots of time to find someone for that when we get back. The first round at the Plant will be on me.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWalt looked over at Jebediah, \u201CWill they make it?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe didn\u2019t respond. He stared through the far wall of the control centre. His hands had clamped to the railing. His arms trembled trying to drive controls he wasn\u2019t holding. The sound from the speakers dissolved into static.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLater, Walt stood looking out a window of one a Search and Rescue helicopter. He had to push to get on. The co-pilot eventually tossed him a helmet with a curt, \u201Cstay out of the way.\u201D He listened to the regular calls to 2-Heelo. Nothing had been heard back from them, yet. He watched hoping he would not see a crater. He feared they would.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSAR-12, 2-Heelo,\u201D came over the radio. \u201CI copy. We\u2019re all here, just a little bit knocked about. We\u2019re sitting nicely around a campfire.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSAR-12, copy that 2-Heelo. Send up a flare when you get a chance. Break. All SAR, SAR-12. We have comm with them. Everyone came down.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWalt saw the flare out of the corner of his eye. He started to say something, but they were already banking towards it. As they flew over Walt saw only two of the three parachutes were draped over the brushes and ground. The side of 2-Heelo facing up on the ground was heavily scorched.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomeone whistle over the internal channel for the helicopter. \u201COne worthy of Jeb,\u201D someone said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNah,\u201D someone else said. \u201CHe would have brought it back unmarked, and on the dot besides.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWalt looked towards the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. Someone had once described Jebediah using the phrase coconuts and chrome steel. Walt wondered again about the truth of that, or if there was a different reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
