Velocity should drop when you ditch a stage because of the reduced thrust. This doesn\u0027t happen so much at altitude, but early when drag is high it is nearly unavoidable. Essentially, if your TWR is above 2.2 (the little extra allows you to accelerate to terminal in the thinning atmo) or so below 10km, you are wasting fuel and should throttle back (which means you are wasting engine mass). So really I have my lifters start each stage around 1.7-1.8 so that they end around 2.1-2.3. Except for the last 1000m/s or so of my launch delta-v, which really doesn\u0027t matter so usually I just burn what\u0027s left at whatever TWR it gives me, whether that\u0027s 0.3 or 3.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NGTOne","CreatedById":55972,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-10T12:17:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI usually build 3-stage rockets - stage 1 gets dropped during vertical ascent, stage 2 part-way into the gravity turn, and stage 3 after my apoapsis has reached the desired height.
