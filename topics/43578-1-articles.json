The most we should get is an orbiter or two. Maybe an orbiter that can also get to munar orbit and back, but no farther than that. I\u0027d also appreciate it if there were only a couple stock rockets. Maybe a small probe orbiter like Sputnik that doesn\u0027t really do anything, a one or three-manned kerbin orbiter and perhaps a one-man mun orbiter.
