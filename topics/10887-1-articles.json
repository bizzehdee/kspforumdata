They can also build expectations that Squad have no intention on fulfilling, therefore tarnishing my view of the game. Yes, the new texture mapping leads to a bit of extra lag, but it isn\\\u0027t a gamebreaker by a long shot. True, some things haven\\\u0027t been implemented yet that were mentioned in passing by Harvester. So what? People have sold games with less work put into them and done quite well.\n\nAs a wise person once said, it is better to appreciate what you have, than to want what you don\\\u0027t have. Right now I have a game I paid ten dollars for, with the opportunity to enjoy many months of updates to yet to come. Looked at another way, you already got the full KSP now, but with many months of DLC yet to come that you don\\\u0027t have to pay for.
