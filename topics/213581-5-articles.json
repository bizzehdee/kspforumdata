Take Two is the one variable that makes me doubt my decision in buying the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, I wouldnt claim the devs only worked on shiny stuff. The more I play, the more hidden features I find (like what seems like a more complex damage model for vehicles and parts, something I\u0027ve always wanted, or struts that WILL bind to the part you tell it to, regardless of part occlusions... Which imo, is a big improvement over KSP 1 struts). Also, BECAUSE they\u0027ve been rushed, I wouldnt be surprised if the last few months of dev work has actually been about stripping out stuff that simply wasnt going to be ready in time. We already have a load of in-game footage for content like the late game propulsion systems, and the other solar systems... Do they not get credit for developing stuff that is in progress, and that had to be stripped out to try and make, what is ostensibly a dev version of the game, somewhat playable?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsidering what they were working on in the dev videos, I get the impression the dev team was under the assumption they wouldnt release the game until that content had been reasonably finished, and probably got a rude awakening from Take Two.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts a reasonable criticism to argue they should have made a solid core game before EA... I just get the impression they intended on doing exactly that with, well, a larger and more feature rich, core of game than their publisher allowed time for. Had they gotten all the parts and planets done first, then they could have more completely and easily squashed bugs after that (rather than introducing both parts, planets, AND bugs, piecemeal, the same way KSP 1 did that made that game a slog to develop).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow that it\u0027s out, Im more concerned about them rushing bug fixes and feature development in a bandaide solution manner, the same way KSP 1 feels like its held together by hopes and dreams sometimes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS, planes wobble themselves apart on the runway in KSP 1 too. Its a known problem with a known solution, Matt Lowne even made it a point to Nate Simpson himself. The nosewheel is the problem. Disable automatic friction control, and braking, on the nose wheel, on all your aircraft. Ive done nothing but make planes in KSP 2, and theyve all gone down the runway just fine with these settings (except one really botched landing).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-27T21:23:41Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2023 09:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by justmeman117\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EPs\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-27T21:22:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224246489\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022213581\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677528288\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002284618\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022justmeman117\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n23 minutes ago, justmeman117 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEXACTLY this, I made this point in youtube comment. I get the anger over the price vs the quality (because that IS a genuine discrepancy), but it makes complete sense to me if you want to limit the game to committed and invested players who dont mind paying that much to play test a mess. The price would have been infintely more disturbing if they\u0027d tried to obfuscate the game\u0027s actual progress prerelease like Anthem tried to (which was a serious cash grab).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPrice is a useful filter. I actually figured this out trying to do photography as a side business. One of the biggest complaints in that field is that customers wouldnt know what quality photography looks like if it smacked them in the face, and most customers just want the cheapest deal they can find. And new photographers run themselves ragged trying to take on too many clients compensating for their \u0022new photographer\u0022 price with sheer volume. That might work initially to get a few clients as a nobody with no portfolio yet (I actually did most of my photography for others for free just to build a portfolio, and not feel obligated to push out a product asap), but can quickly snowball if your work truly is good, and truly does get popular. Something I realized is that, if you truly are a decent photographer, one way to work less for the same amount of profit, and deal with less crappy customers, is to just increase your price. It weeds out metaphorical tire kickers that waste your time, and focusses solely on customers that appreciate your product. A lot of people complaining this game didnt release at 15 dollars, or comparing it to KSP 1s early access (when 8 dollars a copy could pay a 1 man dev team doing it as a side hustle reasonably well in 2011) are the very sorts of people who would have bought it, then left a ton of unhelpful angry hot takes as \u0022feedback\u0022 to the point of drowning out invested players. As price goes down, number of players and opinions goes up dramatically, and the quality of those voices tends to go down... I can point to just how toxic (and also terrible at the game) the teams are in free to play games like World Of Tanks as an example. By virtue of being free, any moron can (and does) play it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI started playing KSP 1 back in 2013 on a crap laptop. It too was a 5-20 fps experience on minimum settings, in a game full of bugs. But I was there for most of the game\u0027s development, and enjoyed having a voice in that development... So I plan to be here for KSP 2\u0027s as well. I\u0027ll play till I get frustrated, give feedback, then put the game down till next patch, and pick it up again when bug and content patches come out. That was one of the few things that ever got me hyped in gaming, seeing KSP 1 drop a new patch. It was fun playing with the new parts and features... And I expected new bugs everytime, as the new parts inevitably broke something previously working. I feel like KSP 1 didnt really get popular till the last like, 5 years, after the game had already improved immenseley. And perhaps older players have some rose colored glasses. I actually have to think pretty hard to try and remember WHAT bugs early KSP 1 had, but then a few memories start popping up, and I\u0027m just like \u0022Oh yeah... That game was broken as all hell, lol\u0022.

But as a teen with parents who hated video games, and no credit card, I must admit, I pirated it. I probably have another thousand or more hours in the game that Steam hasnt logged, because of this. In 2015, I finally bought. Ended up getting the DLC anyway, but I was kicking myself for not just finding a way to buy it back in 2013.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI watched every ESA video I could, and I dunno man, it seemed pretty buggy even then to me. One of the youtubers showed their plane just... disintigrating into a pile... IN THE \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E (lol. It wouldve been actually funny if it didnt destroy that persons work). So far, it\u0027s actually been less buggy than the ESA videos to me. I have yet to have a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E vehicle do something that insane to me. To be fair though, the most time I\u0027ve spent in space is one suborbital flight in a plane. And it seems like most of the truly game breaking bugs people are complaining about are quicksave/quickload on longer missions, kraken attacks on big rockets, and phantom forces interferring with orbital dynamics. I\u0027ve mostly avoided all that so far, just playing with planes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBtw, Im running the game on an i7-6700k, GTX 1070, and 64gb of ram, 1080p min settings. It definitely chugs, but I can get like 15-20 fps with small planes around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. I wouldnt call it unplayable, I\u0027ve been enjoying it actually. The multiple running engines and fuel flow calculations do make the game chug though (one of their current optamization priorities). Im probably going to go see if I can improve framerate with my jumpjet by making one that flies well with only 1 engine on, instead of needing 5.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d kill for a 4090.

But I\u0027ve had other similar experiences. I used to work as a jet engine mechanic in the military, so there was always a balance between getting fixes done right, vs in time enough for planned missions to please bosses... At some point, I realized it would never be \u0022fast enough\u0022 for them, especially with out resources, and just tried to do it right regardless of time crunch. It also gave me a lot of troubleshooting experience (a lot like bug hunting), which is a lengthy and methodical process. I\u0027ve also tried to teach myself programming, and will probably have to actually learn it as a physics major at some point... It\u0027s insane how one missed thing can completely implode a program, and KSP 2 probably has a couple hundred such lines of code hiding in its bowls somewhere. It\u0027s easy to judge from the outside looking in, but programing and game development isn\u0027t easy, and it gets even harder when you got a soulless corp like Take Two calling the biggest shots like release dates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m also sure the devs and Take Two are as unhappy with the launch as the player base, this will probably hurt their profits and reputation in the long run. I\u0027ve also wondered if Steam fines publishers for refunds, in which case, KSP 2 has incurred a massive cost that wouldn\u0027t have happened it they just left it in the oven as it were. I still ultimately blame Take Two. It was most likely their call to release it by this arbitrary release date. And it\u0027s such a TRASH way of managing developer time. They\u0027ve wasted how many developer hours now having to gut the entire game of anything unfinished, and whats left never had a chance to be optimized? And now they have to optimize what\u0027s left, and THEN return to the unfinished content, THEN finish it, THEN implement it piecemeal, THEN optimize each piece, THEN still get bug reports from annoyed players that then become your play testers now that it\u0027s \u0022released\u0022. It reminds me of doing 4 times the work to cannibalize parts off of grounded planes, just to get other planes up and running slightly sooner than waiting for parts to ship through the supply system. This is the kind of trash workflow that leads to developer crunch and burnout culture. I get that games need to come out SOMEDAY, but Take Two are literally blind if they think this was done enough. You can\u0027t just WILL a game into being complete enough by an arbitrary date, to release. I get the impression publishers put release dates on devs to pressure them into working harder to get it done by that date, but when it\u0027s SO out of line with reality, it becomes physically impossible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-27T22:24:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224246673\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022213581\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677535959\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022220814\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022whatsEJstandfor\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 minutes ago, whatsEJstandfor said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnrelated to the thread, but dude congrats.
