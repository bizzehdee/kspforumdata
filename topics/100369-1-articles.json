The great war with the Pentanian Empire had plagued it for over 200 years. The war was won, and technology advanced rapidly. The only problem was, no one had a clue what to do with it. Then the great Wernher Von Kerman suggested that a space program be started. Since no one else really cared what happened with the technology, a ton of money was thrown at the program to get it started. This is the story of the Hexanian Space Program.\n\nI will be updating this as often as I can. This may be pic intensive.\n\n**Parts**\n\n**Part 1:** [Baby Steps](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111362-The-Hexanian-Space-Program?p=1750361\u0026viewfull=1#post1750361) (Hexnik-1, Hexnik-2)\n\n**Part 2:** [First Science](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111362-The-Hexanian-Space-Program?p=1764446\u0026viewfull=1#post1764446) (Hexnik-3, Hexnik-4, Hexnik-5)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-28T19:37:25Z\u0022 title=\u002202/28/2015 07:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TaintedLion**\n  \nAdded link to Part 2."},{"CreatedByName":"TaintedLion","CreatedById":137942,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T23:49:24Z","Content":"**PART 1: Baby Steps**\n\nFunding was initially given to two small satellites, known as the Hexnik program. The second would be used as a backup if the first one was to go wrong. This was the start of a great space program that is still continuing today.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Also, the new Kerbal Space Center was finally completed, a new hub for all the activities of the Hexanian Space Program. (I\u0027ve decided to do separate Imgur albums for each mission, because a single album would be way too pic heavy)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
