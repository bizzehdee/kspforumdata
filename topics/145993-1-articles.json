And called it juno Mk2. So I was flying a drone with the cheat hack gravity. And the engine is the juno Mk2 and it has 1,000 kN of thrust. then I crashed some parts survived the crash and one of them\u00A0was the juno Mk2 it had a Max crash speed of 1,000 m/s. And it flies into space and was\u00A0orbiting\u00A0kerbol. So made a space plane to go get it. It took about 40 minutes to get to it and about 50 minutes to get\u00A0back.\u00A0when\u00A0I was near kerbin I tried to time warp but it said can\u00A0not time warp while moving over terrain But I was in space. I had reentry\u00A0at about\u00A05\u00A0km/s.\u00A0the\u00A0Space plane\u0027s cargo bay\u0027s (that I put on the very front) wall came off and the juno Mk2 fell out. but it survived the water crash that was about 47 m/s. But it\u0027s\u00A0MAx crash speed is 1,000 m/s. And the space plane did\u00A0survived but not the cargo bay wall.\u00A0And I saved a lot of money by getting back the\u00A0juno Mk2\u00A0because I made it cost 100,000 funds. So that\u0027s the end of that if I have any more things happen I might make one. So see ya\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-17T19:16:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo pics? \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
