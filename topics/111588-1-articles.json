The drag numbers shown for an intake are left-over from pre-1.0 and are now meaningless. Drag is not reduced by closing intakes now, so don\u0027t bother. \n\nIf you want to see the actual drag and that it does not change then use Alt-F12 and on the Physics\u003EAero tab select Display Aero Data in Action Menus. On right clicking an intake you will now get the old Drag values and lower down a new one, which is accurate and will not change with closing the intake."},{"CreatedByName":"Teilnehmer","CreatedById":143330,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T02:10:59Z","Content":"Thanks, Foxter!"}]}
