The drag numbers shown for an intake are left-over from pre-1.0 and are now meaningless. Drag is not reduced by closing intakes now, so don\u0027t bother. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to see the actual drag and that it does not change then use Alt-F12 and on the Physics\u0026gt;Aero tab select Display Aero Data in Action Menus. On right clicking an intake you will now get the old Drag values and lower down a new one, which is accurate and will not change with closing the intake.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Teilnehmer","CreatedById":143330,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T02:10:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, Foxter!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
