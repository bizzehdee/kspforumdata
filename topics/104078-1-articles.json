Boots on the ground over time - poking around. Even better wheels on the ground!\n\nThe scoring system reflects this goal, while leaving out all the fiddly details:\n\n- Just how fast, reliable, \u0026 ATV is your rover? hard to measure - we just used NASA lunar and planed rovers as a guide.\n- If I land at 02:00 hr do I count that as a day? don\u0027t count days, orbital mechanics means there are only 2 basic choices - short stay and long stay.\n- Which of all the different science we could do... We will just gloss over that ...\n\n**So what is left in?**\n\n- **Long Term Habitation** is more than 15 days and requires double the \u0027rated\u0027 crew capacity.\n- **Short Stay** or **Long Stay** - nominally 30 days or 500 days.\n- **Bases -** pressure living and life support.  \n\n    - **Fixed**\n    - **Mobile** - can bring fresh terrain into range.\n\n     [\\*]**Kerbals** doing **Suit EVA**.\n\n     [\\*]**Rovers** are multipliers of Kerbal\u0027s science gathering speed:\n\n    - **Open** rover with no life support.\n    - **Pressure** rover with 15 day life support on board.\n\n     [\\*]**Layers** of the planet independently make science available.\n\n    - **Surface** accessible by just walking / roving around.\n    - **Sub-surface** more information is available if you can drill in. For this you need equipment - just mock something, using KAS if you\u0027d like to get fancy. Requires a rover ( mass 1 ton ) and 2 Kerbals ( oops my bit is stuck ).\n\n     [\\*]**Robo / Telepresence** You will need one of the large Remote Probe cores to serve as a control hub. Each robotic unit will score as 0.5 \\* a Kerbal, but can gather data up to the maximum.\n\n     [\\*]**Sample Return** Cherry picking samples and returning the to Kerbin for in depth study doubles the score of units that have access to a Science Lab and the capacity to return 500 kg of samples.\n\n**To score your entry:**\n\n- You will score the **Surface** and **Sub-surface** layer independently and then sum the scores. Kerbals associated with a **Drill** score on both the surface layer and the sub-surface layer.\n- Pick the **Short** or **Long** stay section.\n- Score each **Kerbal** / **Rover** from the appropriate row; **Suit EVA, Open Rover**, **Pressure Rover** and apply any modifiers:  \n\n    - divide by 2 for **robotic** units (oops dust obscured my camera)\n\n     [\\*]Then starting at Suit EVA limit your score for that row score to the maximum available for the kind of **Base** the Kerbal has.\n\n     [\\*]Continue down the table adding in the next score to the running total and limiting to the maximum available in that row.\n\n     [\\*]Apply any **Base Multipliers**:\n\n    - multiply by 2 for having a Science Lab (mass?) and the ability to sample return 0.5 ton of samples.\n\n     [\\*]Sum the score for all your base.\n\n     [\\*]Sum the surface and sub-surface scores.\n\n     [\\*]Profit!\n\nAs we get entries that are \u0027incompatible\u0027 we will create separate \u0027divisions\u0027.

KSP units for things: it\u0027s all a bit mysterious. 1 unit of oxidizer looks like it weighs 4 liters of LOX. There are arguments over what liquid fuel is.\n2. Figuring out reaction rates and energy required: I just plugged in very high numbers to make it easy to see it working, but I haven\u0027t figured out any real numbers for input/output. DRA5 says 300 days @ 23 kW, I didn\u0027t see a number for how much Oxidizer they thought to produce.\n3. Power: if the US guys are right and 1 EC = 33 watts then running CO2 Decomp required about 700 EC 956 RTGs - 76 tons. Oh I see RO has 1 EC = 1kW, I\u0027ve not seen what RTGs make in RO though.\n4. Energy: I\u0027m no chemist so I\u0027ve no idea how much energy in and out the various reactions take - so we\u0027d have to source info from somewhere. Seems like lots of mods make Sabatier require input energy (for \u0027game balance\u0027?) when it\u0027s exothermic and generates heat.\n5. We need to get a signature badge or patch for this work.

From looking at WoW and others it seems like you want to try to arrange:\n\n- **Player population:** the game live or dies by building/maintaining population. Most of the following are mechanisms to build and maintain player population.\n- **Population breeds population:** a vibrant active challenge will be more likely to be noticed by and to convert potential to actual contenders. Views breed views, views breed contenders.\n- **Easy entry point:** Someone who just installed stock KSP and sees the challenge should be able to say \u0027yes I\u0027m going to go for it\u0027. Maximise the number of KSP players who are potential challenge contenders. Maximise the interest for lurkers/viewers. You focus is on RO, but in the big picture every RO contender would have started out with stock-ish challenges (even if self imposed).\n- **Progression:** at any time a player needs to be able to look back in progression to feel they have made progress, and forward to aspire. I don\u0027t mean just I\u0027m in 9th place and want to climb, but also taking on a bigger / harder challenge - like the WoW Heroics.\n- **Re-playability:** progression keeps contenders contending; I did stock, now I\u0027ll take on... keeps the population/posts/views up.\n- **Different strokes:** e.g. WoW - PvE, PvP, Collecting, Professions... There are all sorts of people and you need some thing for every one to get a community critical mass; each of these sub communities has it\u0027s own entry point and progression. Nothing to stop people working an all the areas, or switching from one to the other. More chances for people to be a winner in their particular pond. Lots of open ecological niches crying out for completions.\n- **Keep it as simple as possible:** like the \u0027mods will punish you\u0027 idea. A potential contender should be able to grok pretty quickly the main thrust of some progression / entry point - but may take (satisfying) a while to come to grips with all the details once they start taking it on.\n- **Patches:** everyone likes patches ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif), they are good for sigs and will point back to the challenge.\n\nI think you\u0027d want to make a matrix of challenges, or a series of challenge pipelines.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-14T02:03:59Z\u0022 title=\u002204/14/2015 02:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DBowman**"},{"CreatedByName":"Norcalplanner","CreatedById":112223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-14T03:31:41Z","Content":"What DBowman said.

How do we even represent that? I was thinking about making a giant graph but I don\u0027t know where to fit in the descriptions. Need mouseovers tooltips! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nActually, maybe we do need a whole website...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E **ISRU** using or not using ISRU makes such a big difference that it\u0027s not really the same challenge, see DPOMAC getting free (small time cost) fuel at Minmus \u0026 Duna vs hauling everything from Kerbal surface. I think ISRU or not should certainly be separate \u0027classes\u0027 of a challenge.\n\u003E \n\u003E I want to use ISRU but I\u0027m not clear on Regolith. It seems to be a substrate for building ISRU mods, and Karbonite is built on top of it. Karbonite has a Real Fuels tweak so it can produce fuel RO can use, but it comes from a magic imaginary resource - which doesn\u0027t seem very realism overhaul faithful. Is there a mod in the pipeline that is like RealISRU? I\u0027ve used DunaDirect to do Sabatier to F\u0026O on Duna, but saw a comment that it may hardcode things and not be able to be tweaked for RealFuel, Universal Storage also has Sabatier, but it cannot source atmospheric CO2.\n\nI think it makes sense to have ISRU and non-ISRU sub-category for RO vs Stock. \n\nI don\u0027t know what the chemistry is, but I think it\u0027s not that outlandish to make the a hydrazine-like fuel out of what\u0027s available on Mars in the soil or atmosphere. The challenge I think is getting the oxygen half of the equation, but maybe that\u0027s possible too if there really is water moisture in the top 5 inches of soil. At the very least, that means you only have to pack in an oxidizer. \n\nIt would be interesting to find out what the Regolith/Karbonite mods look like in RO. Would you be willing to look into that?\n\nSo, side-note, I\u0027m wondering about the permanent aspect of this mission. It\u0027s possible that it\u0027s big enough that it\u0027s not possible to do three of them. That would be something like 36, very risky 100t launches with 36 rendezvous (at least).

If I\u0027d been less prepared I might have taken on one of the higher mass challenges. \n\nThings I liked about DPOMAC: \n\n- It was \u0027natural challenge\u0027 and didn\u0027t seem arbitrary - maximize kerbals (quantity?) or achievements (quality?) for a mass budget (the most arbitrary part of the challenge).

I followed the instructions in US \u0022mod me\u0022 guide, and thrashed around with some other parts. It seemed to work ok \u0027in the end\u0027. I made:\n\n1. A clone of the US FuelCell that only runs if there is EC missing, the stock one just consumes reactants at a constant rate regardless. I think there is something funny with craft (with some parts?) at high warp though where they consume EC and run the batteries down by 500 - 700 - so \u0027my\u0027 Fuel Cell would just use all it\u0027s reactants under those circumstances. Anyway it\u0027s a test.\n2. A modified Stock radial air intake that sucks in CO2. I\u0027ve no idea if it checks that the atmosphere actually has CO2, but probably one could tweak a Karbonite atmosphere filter that probably does check.\n3. A modified US Sabatier reactor that now does CO2 Decomposition (**2 CO2 \u002B Energy --\u003E 2 CO \u002B O2**) which sounds like what DRA5 wants to use to make oxidizer (#9 from [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68797-In-Situ-Resource-Utilization-Useful-Reactions](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68797-In-Situ-Resource-Utilization-Useful-Reactions)). It will only work if you have a CO2 Intake.\n\nSo it seems like we could assemble a collection of DRA \u0027work-alike\u0027 parts by cobbling together and tweaking other mods with permissive licences. I imagine it would be easy to match RealFuel production; methane, propane, and even kerosene should be possible from Mars.\n\nProblems:\n\n1. KSP units for things: it\u0027s all a bit mysterious. 1 unit of oxidizer looks like it weighs 4 liters of LOX. There are arguments over what liquid fuel is.\n2. Figuring out reaction rates and energy required: I just plugged in very high numbers to make it easy to see it working, but I haven\u0027t figured out any real numbers for input/output. DRA5 says 300 days @ 23 kW, I didn\u0027t see a number for how much Oxidizer they thought to produce.\n3. Power: if the US guys are right and 1 EC = 33 watts then running CO2 Decomp required about 700 EC 956 RTGs - 76 tons. Oh I see RO has 1 EC = 1kW, I\u0027ve not seen what RTGs make in RO though.\n4. Energy: I\u0027m no chemist so I\u0027ve no idea how much energy in and out the various reactions take - so we\u0027d have to source info from somewhere. Seems like lots of mods make Sabatier require input energy (for \u0027game balance\u0027?) when it\u0027s exothermic and generates heat.\n\nNone of this sounds insurmountable given some time and effort.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-20T11:25:44Z\u0022 title=\u002204/20/2015 11:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DBowman**"},{"CreatedByName":"vosechu","CreatedById":106571,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T16:14:14Z","Content":"I\u0027m on the bus so I can\u0027t respond in full, but I wanted to say that the mm work you\u0027re doing sounds awesome!

My thought was to release a new challenge each week that was bite sized enough to get done, but also too hard to do right all by myself. Finding a compatible home for instance, that\u0027s a lot of work to find 3-5 possibilities. Let alone to do it in ro, stock, and stock hardmode.
