Ideally I would like the kethane turbine engines to get me to the top of the atmosphere then use a liquid engine to get me into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have encountered several problems regarding the kethane turbines however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tweaked the airscoop and ramAirIntake to intake KIntakeAir but they don\u0027t seem to increase my flame-out height the way the stock intake parts do with stock engines. I have been testing my plane on Kerbin and the engines tend to flame out consistently around 20KM. Is there some aspect of the intakes I\u0027m not understanding besides what resource it uses? Does the fact that the kethane turbines have their own intake have anything to do with it? I created a copy of the engines that doesn\u0027t but they seem to perform worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I created some tanks to hold KIntakeAir which work pretty perfectly. Right when the engines would flame-out it starts sucking KIntakeAir from the tanks. The problem is by this time the engine thrust is so low it doesn\u0027t matter that the engines are still running.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn theory if the engines were getting air straight from a tank they would be producing the same thrust as they would be at sea level. Is there a way to trick the engines to think they\u0027re at sea level when getting KIntakeAir from the tanks? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would preferably not want to use KIntakeAir tanks because it adds considerably weight to my ship, which is why I wish I could figure out how to get the ramAirIntakes to pump KIntakeAir into the engine at high altitudes like it\u0027s designed to do. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny suggestions would be much appreciated as I have spent a fair amount of time on this ship and I like to believe what I\u0027m trying is possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a side note I have yet to try this plane on Duna. I have to build a rocket to get it there which I would like to leave in orbit around the planet for the return trip. Maybe even one which could land on one of Duna\u0027s moons and refuel itself. I know the delta v on Duna and the low atmosphere means my current plane might work perfectly but I am still interested in making my ramKIntakes work out of curiosity and practice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any advice,\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-08T18:52:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe kethane turbine scales negatively with velocity.
