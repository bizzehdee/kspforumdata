It seems that the direction the engine turns is different on each wheel, causing it to spin out of control.\n\nIs there something I can do in the .cfg or in the game to reverse the direction in one of the wheels? Its pretty useless at this point."},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T10:25:05Z","Content":"Simply rightclick the wheel while on the surface, there should be a context menu that allows you to enable/disable steering and invert steering and or motors.\n\nI have this menu (though it might come from a mod D:)"},{"CreatedByName":"kahlzun","CreatedById":39989,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T11:04:30Z","Content":"I can disable the motor, and the steering, but the rover design is a tricycle (should have mentioned sorry) and with only one motor it just spins in place. Inverting the steering just controls which way it turns when steering.\n\nIt\u0027s the \u0027thrust\u0027 that I need to adjust."},{"CreatedByName":"ddenis","CreatedById":89784,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T12:00:19Z","Content":"One way is to use [TweakableEverything](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64711-0-90-TweakableEverything-1-8-For-all-your-part-tweaking-needs).
