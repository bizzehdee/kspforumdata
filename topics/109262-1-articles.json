If thrust =5x drag, then drag doesn\u0027t rob you of so much dV, and you should be climbing so that the air density is decreasing fast enough that the drag doesn\u0027t decrease, despite your faster speeds.\n\nbut also, don\u0027t climb too steeply."},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceToad","CreatedById":63992,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T12:16:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E SpaceToad,\n\u003E  Aye.
