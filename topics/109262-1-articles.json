The best monopropellant engine has considerably worse Isp than the RAPIER and mono tanks have an inferior wet/ dry mass ratio to LF\u0026amp;O tanks.

If they were still massless (they\u0027re not) then they could be theoretically more efficient in lieu of the RAPIER, but since you have to have the RAPIER to get to orbit in the first place, you\u0027d have to tack them on.
