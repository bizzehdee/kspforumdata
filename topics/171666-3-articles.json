It\u0027s conventional wisdom that you shouldn\u0027t judge a book by its cover, and yet scruffy books are thrown away in preference to neat new copies all the time. Conventional wisdom doesn\u0027t mean truth or consensus, it means general acceptance. You can accept all kinds of things without agreeing with them. Personally, my experience of the forum is substantially coloured by the requests and remarks of the dissatisfied, in many different shades, over various often-personal bugbears and issues. I have often not agreed with them, but that doesn\u0027t mean dissatisfaction hasn\u0027t been and isn\u0027t a major theme of my experience of the forum\u0027s activity. YMMV.
