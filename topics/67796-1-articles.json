I stumbled upon the site two or three years ago, can\u0027t really remember but it didn\u0027t look too outdated, so it should be still online. It had to do with space, a homepage for an enthusiast-made video or even movie in the style of the faux-documentary \u003Ca href=\u0022http://manconquersspace.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMan conquers space\u003C/a\u003E, but more realistic and modern. It was still in development, there were a few short promo videos on the page though, and a lot of artworks (sketches, 3d models etc.). The latter are the reason why I\u0027m asking at all...as far as I remember, the designs were really interesting and would be a fun to recreate in KSP \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crafts were centered on Moon and Mars exploration/colonization, but primarily Mars. One ship had the name of an Italian scientist and transferred cargo, possibly crew between Mars and Earth. There were two large habitat pods with heatshields on the sides... I assume those were meant to separate and land a base in one piece. Can\u0027t remember the method of propulsion, but the base structure resembled Discovery from 2001, only with bigger fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat would be about it. Does anyone know what this could be? I must have exercised my Google-fu for half an hour at least, but nothing showed up \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John Crichton","CreatedById":102565,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T09:02:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have no clue what you\u0027re talking about...if you like stuff like that, you might like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEuropa Report\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbw9hlBnG74%C3%83%C2%A2%C3%A2%E2%80%9A%C2%AC%C3%85%C2%BD\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbw9hlBnG74\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u00BD\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.amazon.com/The-Martian-Novel-Andy-Weir-ebook/dp/B00EMXBDMA\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThe Martian\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ravenchant","CreatedById":84260,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T18:38:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlready saw one, read the other, really liked both \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Still, thanks!
