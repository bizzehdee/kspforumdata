But one is near pol. Why pol? Cause it is the magic Boulder. Also they mention coloration. Why? Because jool is green, so is the magic Boulder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow next. Look at this.

And the kraken is kinda responsible for these anomalies.

One day, though, the orbits were as close as possible, and Pol was pulled in to Jool, and the Magic Boulder (or Vik) was slung out of the sphere of influence. It crossed paths with Duna, and had an orbit slightly above Ike.\u00A0Eventually, Ike\u0027s gravity pulled it in to a very close orbit. This was kept for a while until Ike\u0027s gravity finally pulled it in, creating a very large crater above Ike\u0027s famous dark spot.
