Having completed the tech tree, I didn\u0027t bother to attach science equipment, nor did I test my rocket whatsoever - its parachutes, rocket engines, emergency ion engines, and so on... I did, however, test the ladders - largely because I was unsure if Jeb would be able to get back in by jetpack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI threw together a new launch vehicle using some of the new parts and saved it as a subassembly, then built a quick lander for Duna - intending to land on parachutes and aerospikes, and fitted it with an LV-N for interplanetary burns - return included.

Finished the circularisation on RCS, as the lander had no RCS thrusters and couldn\u0027t use it.

The ladders and ladder-transfer procedure performed as hoped, and reports and a sample were taken by the new flag, planted to commemorate a first manned interplanetary mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/nxCDDD.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nxCDDD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen it was time to launch back into orbit and settle in for a long wait for a return window.

So, it was modification time. Six drop tanks (and later, drogue \u0027chutes) were added to a copy of the lander and Bill jumped in for some nice, safe testing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/PPqvSp.png\u0022 alt=\u0022PPqvSp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/vqHgEE.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vqHgEE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiftoff was fine, and orbit was achieved with minimal difficulty.

Our test target? Minmus, as it has similar gravity to Pol and Bop - which would be ideal secondary targets for ion landing if this ever does go on a Laythe mission. Perhaps on another test, I\u0027ll try Mun to get an idea of how it\u0027ll be for Ike if I return to Duna - its gravity is about halfway between them, isn\u0027t it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/EIEt55.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EIEt55.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/R7nUzG.png\u0022 alt=\u0022R7nUzG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGot a nice, low orbit using most of the remaining fuel in the LV-N\u0027s tank, then detached. Or rather, decoupled at the docking port I\u0027d used in the connection. Unfortunately, because of how I\u0027d attached the ion engines, they were stubbornly clinging to the tank, and it took a lot of twisting, wrenching and spinning to actually detach from that stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/dyBeea.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dyBeea.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/zqePL4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zqePL4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landing went well, and didn\u0027t require high throttle, which is a good sign for a prospective Mun landing with this ion lander. When Bill got out, I had him check that he could reach the capsule\u0027s parachutes from the ladder (he could, so those could be used and repacked in future missions), and also checked the EVA report. I already had the report for \u0022Space low above Minmus\u0027 Midlands\u0022, so I made the assumption that I\u0027d already made a Minmus Midlands landing. A second surface sample doesn\u0027t hurt, though, so I decided to get one when I planted the flag. To my surprise, it turned out that I hadn\u0027t made any such landing! So I took a sample, a crew report and a surface EVA report, planted a flag and lifted off for an uneventful return to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/Ehsrs4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Ehsrs4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/cRiGpn.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cRiGpn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/L7s9XR.png\u0022 alt=\u0022L7s9XR.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext I wanted to test the combined landing and ascent on a Kerbin-like body. I already knew that I could do it on Duna, but I wanted to try to land on parachutes alone. So, the new version of the lander was put atop the same lifter as before, planning to detach from the launch stage once orbit was achieved, deorbit itself, land, and take off again to orbit. Bill stepped up once again, confident.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/dWbjXw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dWbjXw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/KWjncJ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KWjncJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe additional mass of the drop tanks and their \u0027chutes, along with a few small tweaks - such as an FL-R10 and an octagonal strut to separate the capsule and the docking clamp/decoupler on the LV-N\u0027s tank, along with some RCS thrusters and a few Roundifieds in places - posed little to no problem to the launch. More monopropellant was spent on circularising, but there was still about a sixth of the last launch stage\u0027s liquid fuel left. The lander was detached, the launch stage deorbited itself and things were going just fine...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/bB0kwQ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bB0kwQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/2lVo5F.png\u0022 alt=\u00222lVo5F.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcept... The launch stage entered the atmosphere just before I managed to switch back to the lander. And so it became a race to crash the launch stage into the ocean before the lander was deleted by the atmosphere as it entered on its own, higher path. Facing straight down and burning all remaining fuel at full throttle sent the launch stage hurtling into the water just as the lander fell below 68km ASL. I don\u0027t know how much longer it would have been before it disappeared, but a swift switch through the tracking station got my control to the lander before that could happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/Cb7EuQ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Cb7EuQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/d3RmZd.png\u0022 alt=\u0022d3RmZd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, everything seemed on track for a nice landing in the sunny grasslands. I learned a little about when to deploy drogue \u0027chutes, and I was sure I could land safely on parachutes alone. Somehow, the legs glitched into the ground, the \u0027spikes spiked in a little, and the whole thing began to shudder. They say \u0022any landing you can walk away from\u0022 is fine, but the plan to ascend back to orbit was destroyed as one of the aerospike tanks ripped itself free and the lander fell over. I recovered it (and Bill), then later took this image of the debris:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/TjQhkG.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TjQhkG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter Bill\u0027s testing wrapped up (for now), I determined that even if there may not be enough left in the tank for Jeb to get back on his LV-N outside of a good transfer window, the ion system on the capsule should be more than capable of providing that power. It took some fiddling with maneuver nodes, but I managed to get an encounter with Kerbin prepared. My solar periapse would fall between Eve and Moho orbit levels, and I would catch Kerbin on the return up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/UQsoWq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022UQsoWq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/pjKcXw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022pjKcXw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe LV-N ran out of fuel a little over half-way through the burn, so I decoupled the capsule from it... and ran smack into an issue I had only fixed in later iterations of the lander - specifically, the ion engines clinging to the tank there. As it was clinging to a stack decoupler rather than a docking clamp, the grip was much tighter, and no amount of twisting seemed able to remove it. So I went to the tracking station...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/iJt2MA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022iJt2MA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E... and terminated that irritating piece of debris. This ended up losing me my encounter, but I could burn some more with the ions until another appeared. One did, but it was blinking in and out, and generally being difficult to work with, so I set up a maneuver at the ascending node to fix inclination and lower the periapse for aerocapture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/cfH3SP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cfH3SP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll burn that another time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Concentric","CreatedById":103320,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-19T23:29:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EApparently \u0022More \u0027Chutes\u0022 is not the answer.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother round of testing with Bill before Jeb\u0027s final return burn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/HMpbeg.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HMpbeg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ENote the additional radial parachutes.

I set the lander to come down in the grasslands, giving a nice, long stretch to aim at (my precision landing in atmosphere is pretty terrible).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/MxcjjS.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MxcjjS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurprisingly, this version of the lander managed to land rather perfectly on \u0027chutes alone - even the landing gear was kept clear of the ground by the I-beams. Jeb repacked the \u0027chutes on the pod, and then it was time to try to get back to orbit. Unfortunately, either the I-beams added too much weight, the launch was too poorly piloted or the starting location was too low - the pod only barely managed to clear the atmosphere and couldn\u0027t circularise. Now, perhaps on Laythe that\u0027d be good enough... but I\u0027d prefer to have something that can succeed on Kerbin before I send it on a Laythe mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/m8cXM7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022m8cXM7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/wZ5T7m.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wZ5T7m.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJeb fumes in the pod. Next time, space. Next time.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next version of the lander reworked the fuel-lines on the droptanks and added a little asparagus: three more tanks (each with an aerospike, a landing gear, a reaction wheel and two radial parachutes) replaced the redundant landing gear. I also added a pair of droptanks to the lifter, to counter its fuel shortage. These also carried some monopropellant and a reaction wheel each to make things easier to control. I tried adding separatrons, but they just smashed the empty droptanks into the central stage. Things were fine once I removed them, and the droptanks emptied and were dropped at about the same time as their attached monopropellant tanks emptied, making them the last radial attachment to the central launch stage to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/xedV8V.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xedV8V.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had to send this up twice when I realised only after a successful landing (without engine softening) that I had forgotten some of the fuel-lines and the asparagus bit wasn\u0027t. Both launches achieved orbit with over 200 liquid fuel left in the central launch stage, and both descents touched down on the landing gear and parachutes without engines firing. The landing gear broke (which may have been a contributor to previous problems), but Jeb got out and performed repairs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/NUigk7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NUigk7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the landing gear was raised and the lander stood on its I-beams, it was ascent time. The droptanks dropped clear, the asparagus functioned as planned, and, though it took using the ion engines and much of the monopropellant for thrust, orbit was achieved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/SLI6gp.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SLI6gp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, Jeb was off to the Mun on ion power. Getting there was just a matter of a long burn, and wasn\u0027t really any trouble. I didn\u0027t complicate it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/v6F83l.png\u0022 alt=\u0022v6F83l.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried to follow some advice I half-remembered from the last time I attempted an ion landing on the Mun: make a very low orbit, then burn retrograde full power when coming over a crater. This probably isn\u0027t the advice in the form that I received it, but successful low TWR landings are not something I have any particular experience in. From that sentence you can probably guess where this is going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/FzJSfz.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FzJSfz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELow...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/wsrmyO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wsrmyO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E... and a far-too-fast impact. Quickloading was followed by a series of attempts that ended similarly, culminating in asking myself, \u0022Why not go around another orbit and start slowing down earlier?\u0022 and subsequently clipping a mountain shortly after periapse, destroying the ion lander (again). Next quickload, I\u0027ll raise my orbit slightly and then decide whether or not to keep trying with this ionic-secondary-lander plan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/joiPOv.png\u0022 alt=\u0022joiPOv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, a successful Kerbin descent-ascent-Munorbit.

So, I sent another, this time with the fully tweaked Duna (not Laythe) lander, the five-engine ion lander-capsule, and 100% more interplanetary mission experience (and infinitely more manned interplanetary experience: from 0 to 1).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt launched the same, finished its circularisation on monopropellant and burned almost all the transfer to Duna using only leftover fuel in the lifter.
