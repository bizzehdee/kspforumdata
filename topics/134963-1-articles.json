It should have enough fuel to make your launch pad TWR around 1.2 or so. This might see a bit low, but that\u0027s what we want, because otherwise it would be really easy to go zooming past your speed target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGoing that slow is going to really waste a lot of fuel, so you\u0027ll probably need a second liquid fuel stage to get to altitude. Then put the solid booster to be tested in the third stage.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFlight profile would be something like \u0022take off going fairly slow and straight up, then use the throttle to keep you going up and slowly gaining speed.\u0022 Keep going like that until the altitude/speed requirements are met, and quickly kill the LF-O stage engine, and start the solid booster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you do that, immediately turn towards the horizon. The reason being that going straight up and then back down is a good way to end up as a fireball when you cash into the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically when you\u0027re that high up, gravity pulls you down so fast when the air is thin that the thick air close to the ground can\u0027t slow you down enough to use parachutes. You can get around this by prolonging the time you spend in the thicker air. The way you do that is by flying sideways. So when you fire the booster to complete the contract, point sideways and a little bit up, that should work pretty well.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn all honesty though, that\u0027s a really narrow window to complete the contract. It\u0027ll probably take lots of trial and error to get it. If you find that you still can\u0027t get it to work, post a screenshot of the rocket you\u0027re using a give a detailed description of what your flight profile is like. From that you\u0027ll hopefully get some more specific and helpful advice.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-26T05:55:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy take is always go straight up and adjust appropriately.
