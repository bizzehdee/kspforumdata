I\u0027ve resorted to shamefully leeching science from all parts of Kerbin. I\u0027m not playing stock RSS either, which makes things a little easier (the Bootleg command pod makes starting missions possible). I think the most annoying part is the stock re-size (I went in and changed some rescale factors to 1.0 but I accidentally deleted the file when I re-downloaded RSS yesterday and now I don\u0027t feel like changing it again).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for me, it\u0027s slow going, and I should have an orbit today with the least space-worthy craft ever created.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny luck for the rest of yous?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"saabstory88","CreatedById":110598,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-01T00:10:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI messed with this for about an hour. I think that you really have to change the tech tree. With the stock contracts system, you also end up getting lots of impossible tasks, and suddenly your gateway to new contracts via Minmus is gone. Don\u0027t get me wrong, I love ironman challenges, but I think RSS 0.24 is a bit much, mostly because contracts have become such a necessary part of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry Rockomax, I can\u0027t test you part in an 80km \u0022orbit\u0022, because, well, it isn\u0027t one. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure it will only be a matter of time before someone comes up with a brilliant plugin to make RSS a joy with the new system. Until then, RSS for sandbox, normal system for career, at least for me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-01T00:28:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERPL kinda works in .24.2, it\u0027s waiting on some updates.
