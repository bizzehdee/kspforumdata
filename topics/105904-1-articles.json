I didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t remove that, but I did come up with a more elegant way to implement the control binding switching, so we could do away with all those duplicate input mappings on the settings screen. Now, there is only one input mapping for pitch, yaw, roll and linear translations, and the docking mode mapping is done using the secondary key bindings and a new state toggling system which is simpler and more flexible than the old way. So much more flexible, in fact, that you can now use docking mode as an alternate control scheme in any way you want. Rather use it to swap about yaw and roll inputs for controlling rockets and spaceplanes with a joystick? Now you can. Also, Axis bindings now also have secondary mappings of their own, so you can have a second axis bound to each action, either as a redundancy or with a different set of UI mode toggles.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m actually not sure what this means for how we should configure our settings in practice, but it might be the \u0022Switch Translation/Rotation\u0022 control, which is located in the Flight tab of the Input tab of the Settings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I don\u0027t think that\u0027s the whole story.
