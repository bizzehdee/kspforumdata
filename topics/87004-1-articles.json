Currently, I\u0027m using I-Beams as the skids but these are very heavy and throw off your crafts CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould someone be able to make landing skids like the X15 or Arado234 has? Maybe so when they contact the ground they produce a certain amount of drag to help slow your craft down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ep.s. It would be an interesting mod to have landing gear failures or popped tires past certain speeds, and maybe using skids or other types of landing gear would have different pros and cons.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-12T14:22:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi i\u0027ve made a set of proof of concept landing skids for snowmobiles and aircraft that are available through Kerbal foundries. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERE popped tyres\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E and gear failures, these can be simulated by using custom gear that does not use the standard landing gear module but is constructed following the rover wheel method, I make loads of these for my own stuff and it;s not difficult to to once you get your head around all the transforms etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Las-pen","CreatedById":121174,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-25T16:24:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think LLL has something like that\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-25T16:42:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/41290\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/41290\u003C/a\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Abdu","CreatedById":102145,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-25T16:44:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Las-pen\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Las-pen\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think LLL has something like that\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei can\u0027t find it can you please give me the link ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T22:25:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Abdu\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24906\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELack Luster Labs\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T22:38:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou know, i bet just using a stock I-beam might do the trick.
