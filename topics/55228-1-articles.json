With a real rocket, you are much better off having a manifold sitting atop the engine\u0027s main pump, and running a fuel line from manifold to each tank. Then simply switch which of these lines are feeding the manifold, and drop tanks as they are expended. There is no need to move fuel/oxidizer from tank to tank.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrue, not unheard to have multiple drop tanks on fighter planes for an ferry or long distance strike mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you do this in KSP you would pipe from tank one to tank 2 then to plane. As this is simpler to code than having an switch to select fuel source.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thescientist","CreatedById":69046,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-06T17:27:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Deathsoul097\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Deathsoul097\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EActually, the fuel lines wouldn\u0027t create much in the way of drag, so you would gain Delta V from using asparagus. The problems are primarily:\u003Cp\u003E1- Getting a fuel pump powerful enough to pump the fuel as fast as or faster than the engines are consuming it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2- Getting a fuel pump light enough so as to not significantly affect the mass of the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3- Though the losses due to drag would be minimal, the fuel lines would have to be strong enough to withstand several Gs of aerodynamic drag without warping or breaking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4- It isn\u0027t exactly safe to dump a fuel line during ascent, as the fuel line would have to be closed and detached within less than a second, and would have to be dropped in such a way that it moves as far away from the craft as possible, as fast as possible, because there may be some residual fuel left in the line, and it could very well explode and damage the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5- These fuel lines could act as fins due to aerodynamic drag, and put the craft into a spin.
