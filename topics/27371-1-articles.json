At least I think.

It just sits in the background and angles one engine (the SSME/OMS)to ensure net thrust for the vehicle doesn\u0027t cause any rotation (lines the CoT up with the CoM effectively). It works \u0027behind\u0027 the standard gimbal (feeding it the current position as it\u0027s default position), so you still get a couple of degrees of steering gimbal on top of that. The only option is to disable it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t want additional lag then I\u0027d advise not using the DR hinges as they do use physics joints so they can rotate other parts attached to them.
