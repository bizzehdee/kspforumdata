When the camera pans so the root of the wing is outside the camera\u0027s FOV, the wing disappears.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had this problem with a mesh generator I was working on, and I\u0027d like to spare you the trouble of going through what I did to fix it: it\u0027s caused by a mismatch between the MeshCollider of an object and the MeshRenderer. The camera is doing a thing called frustum culling, where it removes anything outside its frustum (that\u0027s the name for the camera\u0027s FOV shape). However, it\u0027s using the collider to test whether it should cull. So in the case where the render mesh is inside the camera but the collider is outside, the object stops being rendered, so you see it disappear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are two possible fixes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Make sure the collider mesh matches the render mesh. If you do this, you can\u0027t just set MeshCollider.mesh = generatedMesh; You need to first set it to null and then assign the new mesh, which will prompt the collider to update its cache. Just assigning the new mesh won\u0027t prompt the update and nothing will change. That\u0027s unfortunately not in the documentation. Updating the cache can be slow for large meshes, but the wings seem to have fairly simple geometry, so I can\u0027t see it being an issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. If you don\u0027t need a MeshCollider, don\u0027t use one. If there\u0027s no collider, I don\u0027t think the frustum culling happens, so it\u0027ll always render.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I don\u0027t know how the mouse picking is working if the collider doesn\u0027t match the visuals, but that was the problem when I encountered this bug myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s all. I\u0027ll take a look at the code myself and see if I can elaborate on that, but I might not get the time soon. I\u0027ve worked in Unity but never modded KSP before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I should say I\u0027ve only noticed this bug in the editor, not in gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT 2: Nope, it happens in gameplay as well. It\u0027s just harder to pan the camera away from the wings during a flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-02T06:09:11Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2014 06:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Excrubulent\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DYJ","CreatedById":8636,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-03T14:27:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe wings always have colliders, otherwise the mouse interactions raycast wouldn\u0027t hit anything, and the collider (like you can see by moving the mouse cursor over the wing) matches the shape of the wing somewhat closely, as the collider is a simplified version of the wing geometry that follows the same modification as the wing.
