It\u0027s quite a few missions so this one will be multiple chapters in one thread. This starts a short time after Chapter two finishes.

What\u0027s the word?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIpdel jerked, looking around as if wakening from a dream.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Wha..? Oh... yeah, on course.\u0022 He said, before dipping his head back towards his screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb just shook his head and looked back at the main monitor. All the info was there, he was just trying to be sociable... a point that was coming home to him real hard during his \u0027rehabilitation\u0027 of Jedwig. It was proving harder than he imagined to get the guy to actually act \u0027nice\u0027. To give him credit though he was at least trying, but he still acted like a jerk... seemingly without thinking. Well, the guy\u0027d just have to get by without Jeb for a little while. Munar Four was nearly ready to be launched, just as soon as this flight got into it\u0027s orbit around the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb had overlooked the Munar Four, \u0027Mark Ten Launch Vessel\u0027 capsule yesterday as it was locked onto the upper stage in the VAB. Nice sight, if a little disappointing. The old Mk Sevens with their dual cockpits had been fun to ride, plus it meant Bob had joined him on the Mun a couple of times. There was still one Mk Seven left ready to use, but they were testing out the new systems on this \u0027improved\u0027 model. Yes, it only had one cockpit, but it had RCS and... more importantly... LADDERS! He\u0027d waited a long time just to simply climb down the rocket without risking his neck. That would be worth it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Go for gravity turn.\u0022 Gene said and at a glance Jeb saw the rocket was still performing well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Alpha%20Site/03%20R1%20Booster%20separation.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002203 R1 Booster separation.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStages fell away as he watched the screen, blurry, shaky camera views from the rocket showing boosters falling back to Kerbin. Boosters like that had been a problem. Right now they were minimizing how many stages were ditched in orbit without falling back to a solid body. Kerbin mostly. However even if they were minimizing the problem now, and aiming for fully reusable vessels in the future, it didn\u0027t stop the problem they already had. There was now a ton of free floating debris in Kerbin orbit from over a hundred launches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolutions had been suggested, some were even practical, but right now it seemed to be on the back burner as far as the council was concerned. Despite Jedwigs near miss on launch, then near disaster returning home, the council in it\u0027s infinite wisdom had decided the Munbase and a tenuous plan for a Jool mission were more important than clearing up Kerbin orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm. Said a lot about the council in Jeb\u0027s opinion!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThankfully, now Gene was recovered from his minor bout of Kessler syndrome (his neck still looked odd some mornings) he was again talking about becoming KSC director when the position opened.

The guy sure was dedicated, but often sealed himself off in a world of his own. Actually, the guy was more sociable than most, just he had a tendency to get REALLY wrapped up in his work!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn screen they could see the \u0027Rescue One\u0027 vessel on the plot with it\u0027s transfer stage and descent stage still attached, the transfer stage\u0027s three engines burning merrily as it headed for the Mun. Jeb still wished they\u0027d gone with his name selection for the automated, four man craft. Something that rescues people from anywhere on the Mun was about right for a ship called \u0027Liberator\u0027. Unfortunately they\u0027d gone with the boring \u0027Rescue One\u0027 monicker. *sigh* The council just had no sense of style.

Any long term flights or bases need double occupancy to account for extended life support. So a hitch-hiker capsule seats four in short hops, but only two for long flights. For flights a long way from home (ie Duna again, or Jool etc) and if supply runs couldn\u0027t run about once a year, they\u0027d spend a lot of time in \u0027hibernation\u0027. Again, cut crew count in half to account for hibernation equipment. If they have both long term life support AND hibernation it cuts it down to a quarter! I\u0027m going to show the development of the Hibernation equipment soon, but basically it\u0027s a cop out as I\u0027m not using any life support mods. The Munbase won\u0027t use it, just the long term habitation, but they\u0027ll also have access to regular supply runs from Kerbin and I\u0027ll show the setup for the infrastructure of getting personnel (and presumably supplies as well) out there. It\u0027ll help with such a base, but isn\u0027t absolutely neccessary.Trips out to other planets though will have their crew go into hibernation (if they have the equipment) for the long flights to save on snacks...

People were always talking about uber advanced, futuristic technology that might (someday) do away with rockets all together. Some kind of laser launch, or anti-gravity. If they ever came up with that kind of thing Jeb wasn\u0027t sure he\u0027d want to actually fly it. To miss this? The sheer feel of power rumbling beneath you as you roared skyward?.. OK, who was he kidding? If they did make antigrav ships of course he\u0027d fly them. Still, he would miss the \u0027good old days\u0027 that he\u0027s sure of!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mark Tens were actually a little bigger than the Mark Sevens, despite only having one cockpit. Extra equipment, more \u0027spare\u0027 fuel in the launch stages, and a truly huge booster section. True, they hadn\u0027t gone for anything close to a reusable system, but the Mark Tens were designed to shed most of their fuel while still in atmosphere so the booster stages fell back to Kerbin and burned up. Jeb had to admit after Jedwig\u0027s close call he was starting to get worried about the whole \u0027orbital debris\u0027 thing too. Hopefully the council would decide to do something about it soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Alpha%20Site/20%20Circularizing.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220 Circularizing.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally the last launch stage rumbled to a halt and Jeb leaned forward, staring out the familiar, tiny window at Kerbin rolling below him. The image of clouds swirling in the depth of the black sky, the glow of air surrounding it, was just magical. He\u0027d never get tired of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen he looked at the readout. Right now he should be sub-orbital, ballistic for the last launch stage to fall back... and his periapsis was high in the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Um, Flight. I think I might have overdone the launch. Can you be too efficient on your flight curve?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We see it Munar Four. Well, it\u0027s one stage... and hopefully it will eventually burn up. After a few orbits it should slow enough to come down.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb chuckled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, with a periapsis of sixty six kilometers I think it\u0027ll be a LOT of orbits! But yeah, it\u0027ll come down eventually. Separating Flight.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA final clunk left him in orbit with the transfer stage drop tanks and the descent stage.

The first couple of tries left him clutching air, but eventually he found the big red trip catches and felt the pack clunk free.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHolding the catches he hauled it forwards and grunted as it thumped him in the back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You alright Munar Four?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb scowled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Fine, just the pack is a bit heavy.

His suit had special mounts to clip to so it would be rigid against him.

Heading out Flight.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECarefully he attached a safety line to the mount beside the hatch then pushed with his feet, easing himself out through the hatch. Coming outside his view seemed to switch, from seeing the hull of Munar Four as the ground... to seeing as him hanging upside down beneath it. Very weird. He\u0027d done EVAs before, but this was the first time he was floating free.

Be careful.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engines on this didn\u0027t do more than release compressed gas so the temp gauges were more for safety and watching that the sun didn\u0027t heat anything up than anything due to firing the thrusters. Slowly he fired the engines and spun himself around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Whoah! Hey, this thing has some pep! Uh, takes a little while to stabilize it. \u0022 He said, spinning a little before coming a halt. At least he managed to not get caught up in his safety line! \u0022Got it. I\u0027m doing a few simple lateral movement tests.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlowly he slid away from Munar four, then stopped, jetted up the hull a ways, then back, then flitted over to the port tank and back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022OK, three words... I LIKE IT!\u0022 Jeb said, grinning from ear to ear. \u0022Permission to release safety line?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Was that a petulant tone I detected Jeb?\u0022 Gene said\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh I love asking for permission to do something simple like this. It\u0027s what I live for!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well in that case, permission denied.\u0022 Jeb\u0027s eyes went wide open for a second. \u0022Oh alright, go flying EVA One.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You do sometimes surprise me Gene.\u0022 Jeb chuckled as he released the safety line then looped it back on his belt. \u0022OK, I\u0027m heading over to Rescue One. Dang that\u0027s a wonderful sight.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb stared out at the ship ahead, with the Mun off to the left.

The view here, drifting in the depths of space, with nothing but a small piece of glass between his eyes and the spectacular view.... priceless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stars were piercing, not glinting. He could even see feint colors which were barely visible through the thick glass of the various vehicles he\u0027d been in. Even on his EVAs on the Mun he didn\u0027t see this too well.

Unsealing now.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, things seemed to be going well. The design team had refined the systems on this ship so it could (in theory) stay here for years in it\u0027s parking orbit and still be perfectly functional when needed, but who knew how well their \u0027upgrades\u0027 functioned in practice?

They really weren\u0027t very large inside and you had to plan how you got in so you could sit into the seat. He got most of the way in, carefully winding his line up as he went, then unhooked the safety line. He couldn\u0027t sit properly with his EVA pack on, but it was good enough to check things out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Alpha%20Site/41%20Checking%20out%20the%20systems.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002241 Checking out the systems.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Flight, I\u0027m in. Doing a systems check now.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Roger Rescue One.\u0022 Gene\u0027s voice said tinnily through his helmet. After a while he got confirmation of powerup and then the data link to Mission Control. \u0022We read all systems nominal Rescue One. Please power down and let us do a remote startup. If you can monitor the systems we can see how it does.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Roger Flight.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb grinned as he watched the systems go through their own startup routines and monitored the panels. It was all going like clockwork. Then Jeb\u0027s grin faded. Ah... best not think like that. Thinks always went pear shaped whenever you thought they were going well!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThankfully the Kods of mechanical systems didn\u0027t throw a monkey wrench in the works. Maybe he\u0027d caught it in time?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Everything looks good here Flight.\u0022 Jeb finally reported. \u0022Tanks have gone down maybe less than a tenth of a percent during storage. Low temp out here seems to do \u0027em good! I recon\u0027 these\u0027ll last out a while yet. Might have to top the tanks up in a year or two though.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene, when he responded, sounded pretty chipper himself about the results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022By that time the base should be fully operational and hopefully have a fuel mining and transport setup. Besides, with a base fully operational there\u0027ll be less need for an orbital rescue vessel. They should have a vehicle at the base that can do the job pretty well.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Never hurts to have a backup.\u0022 Jeb said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Alpha%20Site/42%20Nice%20view.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002242 Nice view.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeering down as he hunched over the console he stared up through the familiar tiny window. The Mun in the view was beautiful to behold. The sharp contrasts between light and dark on the many craters with infinite variations in size just fascinated Jeb. He could stare at it all day. Shaking his head he managed to draw himself back to his job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Mabey we can play later girl.\u0022 He muttered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What was that Rescue One?\u0022 Gene responded. Damn that guy had good hearing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Nothing Flight. Packing back up for the trip back to Munar Four.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWasn\u0027t much to do, shut the system down carefully, making sure not to disable anything that they couldn\u0027t re-initialize from Mission Control later, then check out his suit and pack and re-attach his safety line. He didn\u0027t really think he needed it just to get out of a hatch... but Bill\u0027s missed Protocol still came back to haunt him, and Jeb didn\u0027t want a similar experience. Forget his \u0027devil may care\u0027 persona, he wanted to do this right!

Wake me in twenty.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb drifted to sleep with the sounds of Bill chuckling on the speakers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022WAKEY WAKEY!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb jerked up with a start. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Wha, how, who... What the heck?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA raucous laugh was his response. A familiar laugh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ahh... HA! You\u0027re awake then. Good that those finely honed reflexes are still working.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Jedwig? Jeez, don\u0027t do that!\u0022 Jeb said, though curiously he wasn\u0027t as ticked off as he could have been. Glancing at the clock he saw he\u0027d got about twenty minutes rest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, someone woke up on the wrong side of the space ship.\u0022 Was it Jeb\u0027s imagination or did Jedwig sounded disappointed. Oh, of course, he\u0027d done this just to irritate Jeb. Seems that automatic reflex of Jedwig\u0027s was still going. Looks like Jedwig still needed some work. Plus, it now it seemed Jeb owed Jedwig one when he got back. That\u0027d be fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Naw, I\u0027m left handed, this is good.\u0022 Jeb said with a chuckle. \u0022So, you just making conversation or was there something you wanted to chat about Brains?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Um... Well to be honest... yes there was something.\u0022 Jeb heard a click. Looks like Jedwig had switched him to a separate circuit. Then he actually whispered into his mike. \u0022I need some help Jeb, desperately!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022OK, what\u0027s up Brai... er, Jedwig?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was a significant pause and Jeb heard Jedwig gulp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I... You know you\u0027ve been focussing me, helping me avoid cultural faux pas?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You mean trying to stop you putting your foot in it every time you open your mouth? Yeah, what about it?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJedwig sighed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Look, I\u0027ve been trying to get along with the... people here... Well, it seems with some it actually worked. I... have a date.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022BWAAAAHHHAHAHAHAHA HA HA!\u0022 Jeb couldn\u0027t stop it and could just picture Jedwig going crimson in reaction to Jeb\u0027s laughter as he tried to avoid doing anything to attract attention from the others in Mission Control. \u0022Oh this is priceless! Who\u0027s the unlucky gal?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hey!\u0022 Jedwig said, his whisper getting strained.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh, I\u0027m sorry Brains, couldn\u0027t help it! But seriously, who grabbed your attention?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb monitored the flight data on his console and smiled as he noticed Flight put a temporary hold on a few preflight details. Heh, Gene had noticed Jedwig and was delaying things a bit so he could talk. Jedwig always underestimated his team mates. Like he could get away with this without someone noticing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Nillian over in block nine.\u0022 Jedwig whispered nervously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022She\u0027s on the tech staff, right?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Do you know ALL the girls at KSC Jeb?\u0022 Jedwig said, almost out of his whisper for a moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, I don\u0027t like to brag... OK, I do like to brag... Heh, so sue me Brains. So what\u0027s your problem? You got a girl, that doesn\u0027t sound bad to me.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But... what do I do?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb froze, and a grin slowly spread across his face.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh... oh you are kidding me? The great simulator ace hasn\u0027t had a girlfriend before?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No! I mean Yes, Of course I\u0027ve had girlfriends before... it\u0027s just... Well, things have generally ended badly on my dates. I\u0027d always thought it was just bad choice in girlfriends... but since you\u0027ve been helping me I\u0027ve wondered if it was just me.\u0022 Jeb rolled his eyes. Kod the guy was slow! But he got there eventually. \u0022Given my past record with dates I wanted to try to avoid a disaster this time. Look, if you don\u0027t want to help just say so!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Of course I\u0027ll help you ya doofus!\u0022 Jeb said as he plugged the burn stats into the nav comp and got things started. \u0022I\u0027m a little busy right now, but I can tell you this. Don\u0027t treat her like you do your fellow Kerbonauts. Try... and I know this is hard for you... to think of things from her point of view. What would you want to do if you were a girl dating the great and powerful Jedwig?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Gah, that\u0027s it? Look I...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m serious Jedwig. Are you telling me you\u0027ve spent one moment considering what it\u0027s like from her perspective yet? Honestly?\u0022 Another pause came across the line. Jeb smiled and continued. \u0022Didn\u0027t think so. Just do that, but don\u0027t assume she likes everything you do, or thinks like you. Try to really put yourself in her shoes, OK?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Kod, I think I\u0027m going to have a headache tonight!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb shook his head. The guy never ceased to amaze him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022OK, well, I think Gene\u0027s done covering for you so you better hang up Jedwig.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Right I... wait, what?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb cut him off before he could splutter any more and switching comms to Flight Control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So Flight, what\u0027s the word.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You\u0027re good to go Munar Four.\u0022 Gene said with no hint he\u0027d overheard any of Jedwig and Jeb\u0027s conversation. \u0022We read you as on course. Burn in thirty seconds.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Jeb warmed up the Descent engines and made final checks on the remaining fuel in the transfer tanks he smiled as he heard Jedwig switch his comms off. That guy! Sooner or later he might actually turn out to be likeable... maybe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Alpha%20Site/48%20Ditching%203rd%20stage.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002248 Ditching 3rd stage.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout thirty minutes later, after the orbit shift and ditching the transfer tanks, Jeb lined up on the target site, a spot on the north west edge of East Crater, on the north-most tip of the Kethane deposits scanned so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Alpha%20Site/49%20On%20course%20for%20landing.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002249 On course for landing.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Munar Four, all systems check out here. Are you readings good?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb made a few final checks and watched the light blink green.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yup. All good here Flight. Lined up for descent burn in... two minutes.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow the huge rim of the Mun swelled large, his destination clearly visible now towards the northern crater rim.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m getting bounce back on the radar Flight, reading Two hundred seventy one kilometers to target. Activating RCS system for descent control.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was pretty new stuff, and rather different from his suit. He\u0027d done a couple of tests of this though in orbit recently. The suit RCS had been pretty much new off the research shelf for this flight. Didn\u0027t mean no bugs could creep in of course so Jeb took it through some basic manoeuvering tests. Everything seemed in order.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022OK, at Two fifty eight kilometers and descending. Starting descent engine on low.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Alpha%20Site/50%20Descent%20stage%20firing.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002250 Descent stage firing.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the way down he just tickled the drive with the RCS aiding to fine tune the course. The bulk of the descent stage beneath him did throw things off a little, plus he\u0027d managed the orbit matching with Rescue One ahead of his fuel budget so it was nearly full. Better than he\u0027d hoped, but the weight of the fuel did get annoying for manoeuvering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe slid lower and lower, watching the scan reports and matching overlays to his plots of the Munar surface. Looked like he was heading for the eastern edge of the Kethane deposit on the northern tip. He\u0027d try to adjust it to get a little more central during the next few minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Approaching suicide burn threshold.\u0022 Jeb said, loving this. \u0022I\u0027m going to engage the full burn about ten seconds before threshold to allow for ditching the descent stage before touchdown Flight.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Roger Munar Four.\u0022 Gene replied.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a \u0027Whumpf!\u0027 the engine lit and pushed into his back, burning hard to slow his descent. His speed fell and he adjusted the burn to drift him east a little, getting nearer the center of the Kethane prominance. Now to look for a decent landing spot! The Munar maps of this region weren\u0027t accurate enough to predict the terrain flatness, and they needed to find a good spot for the base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Alpha%20Site/51%20Trajectory%20looks%20good.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002251 Trajectory looks good.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Alpha%20Site/52%20Descent%20stage%20fuel%20good.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002252 Descent stage fuel good.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Down to two hundred meters per second.

The system beeped as the fuel redlined and he flicked them one after the other.

Maybe it would survive the drop? \u0022Six hundred meters. Five. I think I\u0027ve got a few landing sites below me. Some good looking flat spots visually at least. Two hundred meters. Drifting to port, aiming for a site a little south west of current vector.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDown he went, details now visible as he got closer and closer, cancelling his sideways drift as he went, his RCS pulsing around him in little white jets. As he neared the ground he eased off on the main throttle and watched the dust billow up around him. His shadow slid towards him and he saw the legs near their black twins.

Besides, we have a Rescue vessel to drop on me if something goes wrong don\u0027t we?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Let\u0027s not rely on that, shall we?\u0022 Gene said with a slightly icy tone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Um, sure Gene.\u0022 Jeb said and strode off with a bounding gait towards the plain he\u0027d spotted. Seemed Gene\u0027s humor was waring slightly thin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe used the fuel tank as a visual reference guide as he bounced along and found himself covering the ground pretty quickly. Whistling to himself (and to those in Mission Control, unfortunately for them) Jeb made pretty good time and soon found himself skidding to a stop in front of the descent stage. It had hit pretty hard, which is hardly surprising given a several hundred meter drop. The engine bell had absorbed most of the impact, crushed and splintered, leaving the tank surprisingly intact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Alpha%20Site/62%20Engine%20destroyed.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002262 Engine destroyed.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You know, with a little refurbishing and new engine I think we could re-use this.\u0022 Jeb said, patting the white and black tank affectionately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, first we\u0027ll need a base full of technicians to do the refurbishing.\u0022 Gene said. \u0022So lets get the survey for that base done, hmm Jeb?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Alpha%20Site/63%20Site%20Recon.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002263 Site Recon.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a last look at the tank Jeb bounded off again veering slightly north towards the flat hill top he\u0027d seen earlier. The top wasn\u0027t quite as flat as he\u0027d hoped and his portable instruments said it was a few degrees off true, but overall pretty good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I think this looks good. Regolith seems even, fairly firm for landing legs to avoid sinking in. There\u0027s a slight slope, but within tolerances for the base. Good view of Kerbin from here too.\u0022 Jeb said, staring off at the distant blue green orb. \u0022Hey guys, I think I can see my house from here!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022OK Jeb, put a marker down so the base can home in on it.\u0022 Gene still hadn\u0027t regained his sense of humor it seemed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb put the flag down and activated the transponder. Since it was a modified version of the conventional flag he also typed an entry into the keypad and felt the \u0027thunk\u0027 as the plague was stamped then uncovered on the stem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Alpha%20Site/64%20Found%20a%20flat%20spot.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002264 Found a flat spot.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Not a terribly inspiring message.\u0022 Caldin piped in, reading his telemetry from the flag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hey, they\u0027ll probably pull this down once the base is up. It\u0027s not like it\u0027s gonna be a monument or anything.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking back Jeb saw he had come quite a ways from the lander. He looked down at his RCS controls by the side of his suit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You know Flight... I know this isn\u0027t exactly rated for this, but I\u0027ve been going over the numbers. The flight pack should have way enough thrust to lift off here. Heck, it could probably just about manage to get up on Duna.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022EVA One, I strongly advise against that!\u0022 Gene said. \u0022The EVA packs were not designed to work in a gravity environment. There\u0027s no compensation for gravity in the thrust manifold equalisation. Every time you thrust forwards you\u0027re going to loose vertical thrust. You could pile-drive yourself into the ground really easily!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Aw heck, I\u0027ve flown ships with more problems than that. And don\u0027t go over the limitation of lack of instruments either Flight. I\u0027ve played with some of the bedstead vertol rigs with no instruments. I can fly them fine. Don\u0027t worry, I can handle this.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a cavalier flourish he grabbed the controls and engaged the pack. Dust flew about as the RCS jets engaged and Jeb momentarily found himself disoriented. However the dust easily cleared with no atmosphere present, and soon he was hovering twenty meters above the grey plains on intermittent bursts of white gas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Alpha%20Site/65%20Jetpacking%20back.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002265 Jetpacking back.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Works fine. I\u0027m heading back to the lander. This is way quicker!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb found it a little tricky to keep his altitude steady, but he just kept his altitude over fifty meters and soon was sweeping across the plains at quite a clip. He was probably over a hundred meters per second right now! However the lander was coming up so he started braking, slowly easing up. After a few minutes he came to a halt in mid air then slid to the ground. He had wondered if he should use the pack to go right up and grab the rungs on the lander... but Gene would probably have had a fit if he\u0027d tried it. Letting go of the controls of the RCS while hovering was not a really good idea. Maybe if they installed a deadman switch on the controls in future? He\u0027d have a word with Dunkel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022OK Flight, I\u0027m down safe. You can breath again.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Very funny EVA One. Now what say you get back in your ship and head home. Mission accomplished.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Affirmative Flight. Conducting ladder utilization protocols.\u0022 Jeb said as he started to climb. A groan was the only response from Gene.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGeez! Some guys just couldn\u0027t take a joke!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
