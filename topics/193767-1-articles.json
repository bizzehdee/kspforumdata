What are your PC specs and do they meet the requirements? Do you have any mods installed? What operating system are you using?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the game is crashing, there should be information about it in the log file called KSP.txt inside your KSP game folder, probably at the bottom with an exception or error recorded. Check that and if you find anything, upload the file to a file sharing site and link to it here. There are other, more detailed log files but without knowing your OS I can\u2019t say where to look- try searching for Player.txt or output_log.txt, then upload those too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hadron27","CreatedById":199904,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-13T19:44:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSolved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
