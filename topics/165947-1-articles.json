So when you are landing, and of corse your rocket is facing the sky, you don\u0027t have any clue if you are going in the right way, because you don\u0027t see the direction (the marker is in the other half of the navball, and you can see it only pointing the spacecraft \u0022nose-down\u0022).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone knows a mod that add it?
