It is part of human nature because we are a nomadic species. We will go where the food and shelter is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the past, colonization was only possible because it was funded by governments as a means to increase their wealth (and therefore power) through trade, or by individuals who were seeking to find a \u0022better life\u0022, but those destinations always had in common the perceived promises of food and shelter once they got there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace provides neither wealth, nor comfort, nor safety. There is no food, no shelter, no living off the land and not even any breathing without life support. You are totally reliant on supplies from home and technology. I don\u0027t want to be around when the conditions on Earth make living in a -60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C radioactive desert with only CO2 to breath a \u0022better life\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd you are doing biased comparisons again. There even more examples of technological dead ends that went nowhere or were simply bad ideas: Dirigeables, daisywheel printers, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.cracked.com/article_15669_the-10-most-insane-medical-practices-in-history.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Einsane medical treatments\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Nucleon\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Enuclear cars\u003C/a\u003E, the Segway...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe tend to take note of our successes but forget all the failures that we have left on the side of the road. Space tourism might end up being as much a bad idea as the Ford Nucleon or time travel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I don\u0027t doubt that we are going to improve the cost of getting to orbit. I think that reusable spacecraft are promising (I hope SpaceX delivers a reusable Falcon one day), but the amount of energy required to get to orbit will always be prohibitive and I don\u0027t think spaceflight will ever be a recreational activity for the masses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I saw that coming while I was writing ^^\u0027.

As long as I don\u0027t mention the Mayflower and pilgrims (I had in mind the Vikings when I mentioned the first Atlantic crossing), I should be OK. Yeah, we are nomads. But first of all, we are curious monkeys: we try stuff to see what happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to space being hostile: Duh. But so is 90% of Earth, without technology, to naked primates. And with enough technology, you can literally re-build you favourite place in the middle of the sky. If I leave Earth (and I don\u0027t mean me personally, though I would like to), I want to go somewhere better, with a climate I choose, a gravity I choose, and as much room as I choose. If you don\u0027t get it yet, I\u0027m talking about free-floating rotating space colonies. So any comment about temperature or surface pressure is irrelevant: I choose those to suit my needs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to abandoned technologies: you are making my point for me. Yeah, we abandoned blimps, but that is because nowadays we fly in planes, or helicopters. We still fly. Land transportation still happens even if a lot of land vehicles were bad ideas, like nuclear cars (it seems, however, that we are on the verge of electric cars, and if the electricity came from nuclear plants... but I digress). Space tourism is not a technology, it\u0027s an idea waiting for the right technology to implement it. So is human expansion beyond Earth. Reusable rockets may be the solution (I personally believe they could bring the cost down by considerably more than an order of magnitude), or they might not be. But then, that just means we have to come up with something else to make it happen. Like using transistors instead of vacuum tubes (or abacus) to perform complicated calculations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd at some point, I have no doubt someone will come up with a material suitable for a space elevator (nothing in physics is against it, and we have promising candidates, even), and then we are set: importing materials to Earth becomes a source of energy, and exporting people something trivial.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
