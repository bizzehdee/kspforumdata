I have FRAPS and I\u0027ve used it, and yes, I shot about 90GB of video to put together a two and a half minute video. So unless you have a dedicated drive, it\u0027s going tobe expensive. But for any of these things you\u0027ll want to have a decent computer. If you can\u0027t run KSP with a decent frame rate normally, these programs won\u0027t help it much regardless of the one you choose. If you want to do commentary, I would recommend using Audacity instead of the built-in recording for FRAPS. That way you can edit the track in yourself and handle volume levels separately, but that\u0027s more on the editing side of things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xacktar","CreatedById":88876,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-05T04:25:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://obsproject.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://obsproject.com/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOpen Broadcast Software is a free program which can record straight to hard drive, I believe.
