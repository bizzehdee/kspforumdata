I think it would be awesome if they added Kerbals and vehicles that wander around KSC outside the VAB/SPH. The kerbals could walk from building to building, wave to other nearby kerbals and walk around other kerbals. With vehicles, they could be similar to kerbals but stop when there is a kerbal in front of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, if a kerbal or vehicle gets hit by a part of a vessel, they should be destroyed or killed to add to make KSC more treacherous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the Kerbals and trucks in the VAB/SPH don\u0027t collide with each other and float above the ground... this looks silly...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope people think these ideas a good\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cwhiz","CreatedById":109362,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-31T01:58:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis does sound cool but I am concerned with how this would impact performance on the launchpad or in the vicinity of the KSC.
