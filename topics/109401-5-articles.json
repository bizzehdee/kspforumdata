As for IVA tutorials, there\u0027s [TT\u0027s IVA tutorial](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/45070) from a while ago, it covers most of the basics, but is more geared towards the Unity end of things. \n\nOn the modeling end of things, You have two options. A: You just leave a hole in the mesh where the window goes. make sure this lines up with the window on the external model, though! A quick and dirty way of doing it, but you miss out on window details like dirt streaks/tint/whatever. \n\n![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) On the model, take the faces that make up the window and turn them into a separate object. This will allow you to apply a seperate normal map to the windows. Then, in Unity, you assign the usual KSP/Diffuse|Specular|Bumped shader to the IVA components, then to the window you add the KSP/Alpha/Translucent shader, and make sure that your window texture has transparency or an alpha layer. \n\nI can throw up some pics later if those would help."},{"CreatedByName":"Dr. Jet","CreatedById":99880,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T16:44:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E On the modeling end of things, You have two options.
