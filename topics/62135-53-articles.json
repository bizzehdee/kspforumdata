I don\u0027t use FAR. When I was having issues with MJ\u0027s Spaceplane guidance, I tried it with several of my own designs, and with all of the stock planes. None of them even made it to the runway. I flew them manually around to the back of the KSC, then activated MJ, turned on spaceplane guidance, and every single on crashed. Many a Kerbal died that day. I was about 1Km up, and about 5Km from the runway. I like MJ, but it\u0027s spaceplane guidance sucks in my experience. Also, yeah, that\u0027s exactly what was happening. It just kept pitching down, and tried to pull up from a 30 degree dive at over 100m/s about 10m from the ground. That was the most common one.
