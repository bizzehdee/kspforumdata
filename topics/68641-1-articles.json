Beyond that there are already a decent amount of parts to make \u0022versions\u0022 of other parts. There are some gaps, such as half sized or full sized liquid fuel only parts.

If you put 75 oxidizer and only 35 liquid fuel in a said tank, aren\u0027t you wasting a good portion of the weight to oxidizer?

This would allow us to consolidate the airplane tanks. We could even add texture switching, so we can tell if a tank is LFO, LF, or LOX.
