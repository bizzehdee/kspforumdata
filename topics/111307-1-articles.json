Why is it that I can scan all the biomes on a planet/moon with ground scanners, and yet if I set the cutoff to say, 70% there will be no ore? Shouldn\u0027t the cutoff show the highest concentration on the planet/moon as 100%? Should I be using the narrow band scanner? Last time I used it, it didn\u0027t show very much detail.\n\nI\u0027ve been trying to find a concentration over 8.25% on Ike."},{"CreatedByName":"MathmoRichard","CreatedById":113752,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T21:56:48Z","Content":"Once you have done ground scans of all biomes the narrow band will be 100% accurate. The 70% thing I don\u0027t know for sure but it\u0027s probably saying that there are no medium sized regions which have an average over 70% of the highest value found on the body. Try using dots, this is the most accurate orbital overlay."}]}
