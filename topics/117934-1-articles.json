I\u0027ll be developing it at some point and was just looking for other people\u0027s thoughts.\n\n**The Concept**\n\nThe game would be like KSP career in a way, where you accept contracts to get funding and launch rockets and developing tech. It\u0027d 2D and most likely pixel graphics.\n\nHowever, the \u0022science\u0022 would be a little different. Instead of using science points to unlock tech, science is more towards learning more about the solar system around you.\n\n**Science**\n\nDeveloping tech and processing science would be a slow process, where you put a limited team of scientists (and depending on the size of your team is how fast its done) to develop the new item, like a new engine or solar panel, or control pod. If your team is too small, you can contract a company to do it.\n\nSince the solar system is randomly generated, every universe is unique, adding complete replay-ability. Since you can calculate the location of planets by eye (theoretically, like Galileo and Copernicus did), you know the positions and orbits, but not what they look like at start. Using unlocked tech of either a flyby or a space telescope you\u0027d be able to render images of the planet in different detail.\n\nFlybys would give you visual data (basically the high-res image of the planet), but nothing more, other than approximate size data. You\u0027d need to hire scientists to get data gathered and compile it to return data like SOI and atmospheric height.\n\nTime acceleration is a thing. I\u0027m not sure if I could conceptually program physical acceleration, but I could do simulated time acceleration.\n\n**Rockets**\n\nDepending on what you already know, you could develop engines that were better for each environment. Kinda like tiers. So, there\u0027d be atmospheric engines (jet engines), surface engines (rocket engines for an atmosphere), vacuum rockets, future-tech rockets (nuke engines), and economy rockets (less expensive, but less efficient).\n\n**Probes/Pods**\n\nSimilar to rockets, there\u0027d be tiers. Probes (and their tiers) and Pods (and their tiers) would all have to be researched.\n\nOne thing that would be a really cool concept is something where you can develop your own pods. The skin would be the same, but the internals would be custom researched. Same with engines and tanks and probes and all other items.\n\nWhat do you think? Is it worth programming?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-11T01:52:21Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2015 01:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KASA Space**\n  \nClearing up some stuff."},{"CreatedByName":"KASA Space","CreatedById":108702,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T14:27:27Z","Content":"I\u0027ve made a mockup of what the tracking station would look like (maybe) and a look for what the graphics would look like (probably)\n\n![37593d34b1.png](http://puu.sh/jtWRz/37593d34b1.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Thegamer211","CreatedById":149354,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T14:47:59Z","Content":"Nice! \n\nWill there be some sort of sandbox mode?"},{"CreatedByName":"KASA Space","CreatedById":108702,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T15:01:49Z","Content":"I\u0027m sure that would work. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"KASA Space","CreatedById":108702,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T00:45:58Z","Content":"For anyone still interested, here\u0027s SpaceX\u0027s Falcon 9 drawn by me in the style I want for the game.\n\n![fead4d6a95.png](http://puu.sh/juvKp/fead4d6a95.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"SemiaCloud","CreatedById":138816,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T15:23:37Z","Content":"Shut up and take my money!"},{"CreatedByName":"PatPL","CreatedById":115556,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T19:18:32Z","Content":"Looks like Simple rockets with more realistic choices.
