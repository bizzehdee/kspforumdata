I\u0027ll be developing it at some point and was just looking for other people\u0027s thoughts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Concept\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game would be like KSP career in a way, where you accept contracts to get funding and launch rockets and developing tech. It\u0027d 2D and most likely pixel graphics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the \u0022science\u0022 would be a little different. Instead of using science points to unlock tech, science is more towards learning more about the solar system around you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScience\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeveloping tech and processing science would be a slow process, where you put a limited team of scientists (and depending on the size of your team is how fast its done) to develop the new item, like a new engine or solar panel, or control pod. If your team is too small, you can contract a company to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the solar system is randomly generated, every universe is unique, adding complete replay-ability. Since you can calculate the location of planets by eye (theoretically, like Galileo and Copernicus did), you know the positions and orbits, but not what they look like at start. Using unlocked tech of either a flyby or a space telescope you\u0027d be able to render images of the planet in different detail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlybys would give you visual data (basically the high-res image of the planet), but nothing more, other than approximate size data. You\u0027d need to hire scientists to get data gathered and compile it to return data like SOI and atmospheric height.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime acceleration is a thing. I\u0027m not sure if I could conceptually program physical acceleration, but I could do simulated time acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERockets\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDepending on what you already know, you could develop engines that were better for each environment. Kinda like tiers. So, there\u0027d be atmospheric engines (jet engines), surface engines (rocket engines for an atmosphere), vacuum rockets, future-tech rockets (nuke engines), and economy rockets (less expensive, but less efficient).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EProbes/Pods\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilar to rockets, there\u0027d be tiers. Probes (and their tiers) and Pods (and their tiers) would all have to be researched.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing that would be a really cool concept is something where you can develop your own pods. The skin would be the same, but the internals would be custom researched. Same with engines and tanks and probes and all other items.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think?
