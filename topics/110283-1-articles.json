As an alternative to trying to install your mods yourself, you could look into using [CKAN](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100067). It is a standalone program that can manage your mods for you. I suggest you take a look at it to see if it might help. \n\nWhat it does is keep track of what mods you have installed, and let you know when a mod is updated. It will also perform the install/uninstall for you, much like the Curse client does for world of warcraft (if you are familiar with that).\n\nMany folks love it for the convenience it provides. The only down side, is that it is not quite a current as I would like, as it is not instantly aware of new mods and new versions as they appear.\n\nI can help with getting ckan up and running if you choose that direction.\n\nHowever, as you get to know the game and its structure better, is is good to know how mods are installed in the game. Once you \u0022get it\u0022 it is actually very easy.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-22T15:28:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2015 03:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Papa\\_Joe**"},{"CreatedByName":"lowfan","CreatedById":144572,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T18:16:33Z","Content":"Sure, Ill try it out.

I am unfamiliar with computer gaming. I have used mostly consoles. I clicked ckan.exe and now have what appears to be a dos window and another one.\n\nRight. The executable is designed to run on windows osx or linux. the dos box loads the runtime engine.\n\nThe app itself is pretty straight forward. [CKAN has a wiki](https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN/wiki/User-guide) to explain how it is used, but basically you can connect it to your installation, and it will scan your game for addons.\n\nAddons that have already been manually installed will have n \u0022AD\u0022 in place of a checkbox. There is a filter to show only your installed mods or different combinations of mods... you can also search by name for a desired mod. The search is affected by the filter. Mods that CKAN has installed will have the check box checked.\n\n![6IhI1bj.png](http://i.imgur.com/6IhI1bj.png)\n\nIf you see an AD next to the mod, then you will need to remove the mod to allow CKAN to manage it for you. For example in the screenie above, Ship manifest is not managed by CKAN, as I\u0027m the developer and it is manually installed.\n\nRemoval is simple... remove the folder for the mod where it is, inside the GameData Folder. If you are not sure of the folder name, look at the contents tab at the far right. it will show the install folder. \n\n Or, you can use this tool: [CKAN Mod Migration Tool](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106636).\n\nOnce you have removed any existing mods, you can simply check the mods you want to install, then click on \u0022go to changes\u0022 once there you will see a list of all mods that will be installed and any dependencies they need (other mods). Click Apply, and CKAN will download the mod and install it for you.\n\nOnce a day, run this application and click on the refresh button to reload the list of mods from the server. any available updates will then appear in the second column of the list with a Checkbox\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-22T23:53:07Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2015 11:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Papa\\_Joe**"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T04:55:42Z","Content":"Yeah, I definitely also recommend CKAN too - it makes add-on installation/management much easier than the typical manual method. There are even CKAN-specific plugins that allow you to pick what portion of a parts pack you want to install."}]}
