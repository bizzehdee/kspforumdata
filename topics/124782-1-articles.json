How do I know if I oversized it or undersized it? I\u0027ve never made a tug before, so not sure how big it should be or how high I should get the TWR. Also, can I presume I should use large tanks and clear out the oxidizer rather than using LF only tanks (which don\u0027t come in massive sizes)? Does what I have look adequate for getting around Duna/Ike (and other places, primarily Jool, in the future) and cleaning out its biomes of science, as well as being able to set up a return trip for every kerbal I plan on bringing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPic 1 is the tug itself, pic 2 is the tug with its cargo (to be docked in LKO) of 2 unmanned miner landers on the top and a kerbal lander on the bottom. I could switch that to one miner and one lander, each on one side of the tug, but there\u0027s an 11.4t difference in mass between the two so I\u0027d have to balance it out first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: my staging was off so KER gave results that don\u0027t match. The TWR with a full tank while in LKO burning should be around .15(.20) rather than those numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/O6vv3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

So start with the intended payload and work backward from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally speaking, you want a pretty low TWR so that you\u0027re not wasting too much mass on those heavy LV-Ns. There\u0027s not really any such thing as \u0022too low\u0022 from an engineering perspective, it\u0027s more a matter of how much patience you have to sit there through really long burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing LFO tanks and leaving out the oxidizer is a really bad idea, you waste many tons of mass that way. Use the large LF-only tanks (there are some \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Mk3_Liquid_Fuel_Fuselage_Long\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ebig ones in Mk3 format\u003C/a\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing you definitely want plenty of on a tug is torque authority-- I\u0027d suggest adding a fair number of reaction wheels. Also make sure you have a reasonable distribution of RCS thrusters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving some lights that self-illuminate the area around the docking port comes in handy for when you need to dock in darkness (which is annoyingly often).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe prepared for the fact that docking-port connections are very wobbly and bendy; this can cause a problems for tugs that are pushing big loads. Some ways around that:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Use larger-size docking ports for docking to big-size vessels; they\u0027re stiffer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Use Kerbal Attachment System. They have some nice deployable struts: basically, \u0022strut sockets\u0022 that are attached to the two ships involved. After docking, send a kerbal on EVA to connect them by right-clicking, and it puts struts in place to stiffen the connection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Design your tug so that it \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Epulls\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E the load rather than pushing it (i.e. the tug\u0027s engines are way off to the side).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Just run the tug at really really low TWR so that it\u0027s pushing so gently that the bendiness doesn\u0027t cause a problem. This is very easy from an engineering point of view, but requires a lot of patience on your part during long burns. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-09T05:46:13Z\u0022 title=\u002211/09/2015 05:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Snark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ForScience6686","CreatedById":144187,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-09T14:25:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUse the rocket equation to determine fuel needed.
