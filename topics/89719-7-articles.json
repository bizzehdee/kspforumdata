It\u0027s not the final product. The reason for the negative comments and complaints is that with the last WIP that Squad showed us (admin building), \u003Cem\u003Enothing\u003C/em\u003E was changed between it and the final product. It\u0027s either not a WIP or you just say \u0027eh.. it\u0027ll do\u0027 and call it a day.

We are a little crazy, yes, but when we point out textures that are objectively bad (observatory path and wall textures), we kind of have a point. They are things we would like to be improved upon as this is, as said, a WIP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I\u0027ve been asking for transparency and for all the little WIPs they come up with, but when the WIPs turn into what\u0027s actually released (the admin building), I\u0027m like \u0027I thought this was still being developed and improved?\u0027. I\u0027d say it\u0027s similar to the old resources thing - Squad promised us something, dropped it, community went nuts - but it\u0027s flipped. In this case, the thing they\u0027re promising (and have, in the case of the admin building, dropped) is objective improvements to WIPs. That\u0027s the whole point of them. They release a rough draft and say \u0027this is what we\u0027re working on\u0027 and the community says \u0027looks good, but the textures need improving\u0027.

People took issue with the art direction Squad is taking, the whole point of sharing the WIP images is to allow criticism at the early phase, when things can be changed more easily. I think that while the general idea is right, Squad needs to change a few things. Not only polishing (that goes without question), but also regarding the artistic direction they\u0027re taking. KSC should not look run down, and low-tech doesn\u0027t equal shoddy.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Devo","CreatedById":22750,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-09T21:53:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReally? jokes being deleted now Sal? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-09T21:54:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou have a strange sense of humour \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Devo","CreatedById":22750,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-09T22:00:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou have a strange sense of humour \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo does Vince Gilligan \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CCKinnison","CreatedById":71439,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-09T22:04:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1.

Kerbals did not follow the human approach to rocketry. I don\u0027t think SQUAD has addressed this canonically, but I always thought they progressed roughly the way humanity did through early aviation (say, end of WW I). The Robert Kerman launched the first test rockets... and something in the racial Kerbal mindset went NUTS for space. KSP starts with 1920s technology. No jets. No transistors, no printed circuits, no electronic computers. This interpretation of the first KSP base is appropriate for my headcanon. It\u0027s obviously not perfect, since even their first parts have better electronics than my thoughts allow for, and the first planes in KSP use jets... But Kerbals are FAR more driven to get into space than humanity is/was. This explains their risk tolerance, and putting mostly-unskilled shmoes like... oh...

As I said, I love the farm idea, I love that they bought a run-down place and are running a space program from it - what I don\u0027t like is that it\u0027s not a good looking run down place. Minecraft is basically huge pixels, it\u0027s not going to win GOTY for graphics for sure, but it does its style extremely well. There\u0027s a difference between style and execution of style. I don\u0027t think many people have a problem with the style, it\u0027s the way it\u0027s been executed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for your other points, I guess I just have to take your word for it. I hope that these shots are indeed a WIP and will be improved upon. Also, why couldn\u0027t this reveal be the stuff that they\u0027d \u0027made look better\u0027? Or was this the result of that? Devnotes on Tuesday, this reveal on Saturday.. Just sayin\u0027, is all. Much like I\u0027m just sayin that it would a shame if these textures were in the final game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-09T23:49:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EQuite sure.
