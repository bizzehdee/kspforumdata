Vanamonde is right, though; it sounds like your CoM is shifting aft as you burn fuel and it\u0027s going far enough that your final CoM is behind your CoL, which makes your craft unstable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a craft like that circa 0.23; ultimately I redesigned it to include a \u0022ballast\u0022 system using one quad of full RCS cylinders aft and one empty set up at the nose. Upon reaching orbit, I\u0027d shift the fuel forward. Did the trick but boy was it a pain. Alternatively you can set all your fuel tanks parallel to one another; that should make it where the CoM doesn\u0027t shift as much but building the craft may become problematic depending on its size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might also recommend installing RCS Build Aid. It will show you a \u0022dry center of mass\u0022, i.e. where the CoM will be when your tanks are dry. It\u0027s handy for spaceplane construction for that very reason.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CDK","CreatedById":114733,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-23T20:17:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that happened to me once too.

As you fly, the program takes fuel from the tank farthest from the engine first, which is usually the one in front. As this happens, your center of mass moves steadily backwards. Once it creeps behind your center of lift, your plane will only want to fly bass-ackwards. Either pump fuel forward during your flight or redesign so that the fuel drains in a more balanced way using fuel lines etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
