I am constructing it as four parts: Propulsion, avionics, logics, and an adapter. The adapter piece will allow a stock docking port to added, although I may look into a second adapter to fit the docking port from the ISS parts pack. I have completed a basic model of the propulsion and avionics module and will probablly have the logistics and the adaptor modules done by today. Before I go any further, I wanted some feedback on the size of the parts. I started using Bobcat\u0027s standard of 64% size but this resulted in a roughly 2.8 meter part, so I switched to a 56% scale the results in a 2.5 meter part. What I wanted to know is wheter you guys would rather have a scale the is more consistent with other real spacecraft packs or one that would fit nicely with the stock 2.5 meter parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn an additional note, I have no artistic talent and may need someone to create a better texture than the one I will eventually first release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/0aNaH#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
