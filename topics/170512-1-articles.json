The ship below is an asteroid-catching design I\u0027ve used many times, with many different variations. This particular ship was supposed to complete a bunch of contracts (bring a Class D asteroid to Laythe, space station around Laythe, pick up a stranded Kerbal, and a couple others). I decided to swap out my usual Mk1-2 for the Mk2 Lander Can. No real reason; just hadn\u0027t used one in forever. The result was that I could not launch the ship with Kerbals on board. Very strange. I found a workaround, and the results are in the video below if you care to see it. I made it for Bewing the Bugsmasher. He checked the craft file and said it had so many errors it was pretty much impossible to figure out how it happened. Strangely, I removed the Mk2, and added an Mk1 Command Module and Lander Can and it worked just fine. I had no explanation, and just chalked it up to \u0022one of those things\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/uSAjsBZpNwI?start=12\u0026amp;feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-02-05T18:30:50Z\u0022 title=\u002202/05/2018 06:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 5, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Cpt Kerbalkrunch\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-06T16:01:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223286258\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022170512\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221517852019\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022166071\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022HalcyonSon\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n22 hours ago, HalcyonSon said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m curious if anyone has seen a rocket repeatedly explode at 2,500 m as if it had hit a brick wall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA couple of things:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAre you running any mods?\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 I\u0027ve had some experiences with some mods that caused unusual glitches where they think I\u0027ve collided with some \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E building even though I\u0027m a couple kilometers away.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat does the F3 dialog say?\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 If you hit F3 after one of your disasters, it will tell you \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eexactly\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E what happened, as far as the game is concerned-- e.g. messages like \u0022Part A collided into Part B\u0022, or \u0022Part A overheated and exploded\u0022, or whatever.\u00A0 (By itself, that information won\u0027t necessarily tell us \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewhy\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E or \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ehow\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E it happened, of course... but at least knowing \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewhat\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E happened could be a useful clue.\u00A0 It\u0027s like recovering the \u0022black box\u0022 after an airline crash.)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HalcyonSon","CreatedById":166071,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-06T19:44:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223286274\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022170512\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221517853227\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022175588\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cpt Kerbalkrunch\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 2/5/2018 at 9:53 AM, Cpt Kerbalkrunch said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve had that happen a few times.
