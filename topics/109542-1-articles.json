And you can almost complete the science tree without leaving the Kerbin system if you explore the different biomes of the Mun and Minmus and get science there."},{"CreatedByName":"rcp27","CreatedById":129752,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T18:30:46Z","Content":"It kind of depends where you want your career to be going. When I hit that sort of position, I was beginning to find the Skipper was a bit weak for some of the bigger launches I wanted, so I headed for the Mainsail (\u0022heavier rocketry\u0022). That gives you the oompf you need for bigger launches. Also the \u0022Propulsion Systems\u0022 node gives you the 48-7S \u0022Spark\u0022 engine, which is extremely useful for things like satellite contracts and all manner of other purposes (it has its uses in lander engines on lower gravity places like Minmus too)."},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T18:39:56Z","Content":"Don\u0027t look at distances, look at dV...\n\n[http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/thumb/7/73/KerbinDeltaVMap.png/600px-KerbinDeltaVMap.png](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/thumb/7/73/KerbinDeltaVMap.png/600px-KerbinDeltaVMap.png)\n\nThe dV to orbit for worlds with atmospheres is a bit out of date.... but the important thing:\n\nIt doesn\u0027t take much more dV to get to Duna, than it does to get to Minmus (1 way probes are easy, getting to the surface, back up, and back ot kerbin is significantly harder/ takes signficantly more dV than a trip to minmus)\n\nOther than unlocking more science parts so you can get more science without leaving kerbins SOI... look for the nuke part, unlock the other prerequisite for that.\n\nLV-Ns are great for interplanetary stages (or even just the transfer to Mun/Minmus)"},{"CreatedByName":"Dyingsoul","CreatedById":143027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T20:42:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Use science to unlock science to get more science.\n\nYeah I was thinking about it but i wasn\u0027t sure about it.

Too bad I am unable to track biomes in-game. Okay I see that where I\u0027ve been in the Research Archives but still cant see WHAT TO DO next, on those planets that I\u0027ve visited. Yeah I can compare the biome lists in the browser and my science archives but would be better if I could do that ingame without searching.
