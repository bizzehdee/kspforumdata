Just reinstalling the MFD folder should work as long as its directories are correct, but just for thoroughness, you should be able to find this document GameData/Hyomoto/MFD/menus/menuDefault.txt\u003Cp\u003EIf it doesn\u0027t exist that\u0027s the problem, if it DOES exist then I admit I\u0027m a bit stumped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got pretty much exactly the same problem on mine using linux. Could it have something to do with the path case sensitivity? Windows doesn\u0027t have case sensitivity on the file paths, so you can get away with having a mistake in the file path.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETop left is the home screen, with same problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the sub pages of the FLT section work, but nothing else does. Hope that helps somewhat with solving the problem?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tcaT7KC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tcaT7KC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DoubleOSeven1","CreatedById":57582,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-01T05:18:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProblem is still occuring after reinstall...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know anything about this but could kellpossible be true?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
