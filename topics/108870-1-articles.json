No shaking at all happened the first time, I was able to land, mine, takeoff, and transfer the ore my orbital refinery. This time however I cannot seem to do anything to get it into orbit alive. I\u0027ve tried taking off with everything deployed, nothing deployed, only some things deployed, and nothing has been able to stop the inevitable explosion. The only difference is it has slightly less fuel this time than the first, because then I finished up my transfer stages fuel while landing. I know a few of the parts are clipped together, but it\u0027s nothing the VAB wouldn\u0027t allow, and no more than some of my other ships.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T06:37:17Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 06:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by adinfinitum\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T05:09:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor me, lightweight \u002B clipping \u002B struts = shaking boom of death.

It was a small lander just like yours and i have used it many times. But one day it just decided to cut itself in half so i just tought it wasn\u0027t really a problem and rare kraken attack. Then i just quickloaded and tried again and same thing happens... Hmmm... At this point i tried 5 times and the lander always seems to cut itself in half.. Then i tried something new. I just moved the craft a bit then landed again somewhere else. After that i switched to another craft and returned to my wonky lander. This time it took off fine for some reason... Well just another day in ksp folks. Atleast these kraken attacks are more rare then before so im not complaining \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adinfinitum","CreatedById":49226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T05:16:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried without SAS, but I\u0027ll give it a try with turning the gimbals off.

So i just find it fraustrating to play like that. You can always set your own limits. So what if you saved and your lander crashed you don\u0027t have to return to that save. But when a bug happens atleast you don\u0027t have to restart the game instead you can experiment on whats causing the bug and possibly solve it easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adinfinitum","CreatedById":49226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T05:58:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EChanging to a satellite and switching back seems to have fixed the problem, of course it was also night this time and it is KSP after all, so that coulda fixed it too, who knows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the first game affecting bug I\u0027ve had so far in 1.0.2, but there\u0027s just something about how the game feels with no reverts and quicksaves that\u0027s really made it a dozens times more compelling for me. I feel like it adds to the whole space program feel, I can be as careful as I can designing a rocket, but if I got too confident and it flips on takeoff with no escape, 4 kerbals are gone, its a tragedy in funds and life, but like the first Apollo mission, bad stuff happens sometimes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T06:24:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt may be worth noting that quick\u003Cem\u003Esaving\u003C/em\u003E still works even when quickloading is disabled in the difficulty options.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it is possible to play with no quickloads/reverts and still keep quicksaves for insurance against Kraken attacks and other bugs.
