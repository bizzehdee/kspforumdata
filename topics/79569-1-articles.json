Uses one large radial RCS tank stuck under the lander can, and one small fuel tank with LV-909 for descent stage. Descent stage surrounded by 4 mat science bays and 4 goo cans. The parts overlap a bit but part clipping was not used. I think this really matches the aesthetics and functionality of Apollo with only stock parts and nothing too complicated. Also it\u0027s narrow enough to fit within a 2.5m-\u0026gt;3.75m conical fairing under the CSM with a 3.75m S-IVB third stage.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-26T03:25:46Z\u0022 title=\u002207/26/2014 03:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by quantumpion\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-26T03:46:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome!
