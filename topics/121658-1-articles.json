The burn time estimate only calculates after the engines have run for a second or two (it doesn\u0027t take long), and it will calculate based off your current acceleration. So if you only turn the throttle up a little, the estimated time will be a high estimate compared to running at full throttle. KSP\u0027s built in burn time estimate is really (really) basic. It won\u0027t remember previous calculates after certain events (such as saving and reloading), and it won\u0027t take into account things such as staging to a new engine stack, or dropping fuel tanks along the way. (I think most of that might have been said already...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I use MechJeb for burn time estimates, but KER works just as well for that too (personal preference for how information is presented).

I recall in the past having to hit Z then X (again, immediately) to get a good readout, but that can be dangerous with large, spindly ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing KSP doesn\u0027t do is guess ahead based on fuel consumption or staging. It goes based of how much thrust you have, possibly also with some calculation based on percentages (If you thrust at 33%, it multiplies it by 3. This would explain why I can just hit shift and then X and get a good readout) but I\u0027d like to test that before saying anything for sure. What I mean by it not guessing is, is if you\u0027ve got 20m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E of thrust and need to go 2000m/s, it will say you need to thrust for 100 seconds, regardless of the fact that your TWR (and therefore thrust) will increase as you burn fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dhafeuwst","CreatedById":151569,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T02:43:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alshain\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alshain\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENow I find even after a burn it can be 1 second for every 5 seconds of burn off, and that is assuming you split the node (the proper way).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep, that\u0027s quite the behavior I seem to have too.
