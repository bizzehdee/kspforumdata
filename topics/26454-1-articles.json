What this results in is an inverse exponential curve of effective delta-V as you add more fuel. Generally speaking, if you can, you should seek to improve specific impulse (ISP) as much as possible for a rocket before you try to solve the problem of insufficient delta-V with more fuel. Someone else here recommended Kerbal Engineer Redux, and I second that suggestion. It saves a ton of busywork to have the calculations for delta-V, thrust-to-weight, and engine firing time done for you in real-time as you build your rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sadron","CreatedById":61671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-12T00:17:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Daze\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Daze\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe dV is the variation of velocity needed to perform a manuever in orbital mechanics (for example manuever node in KSP is measured in how much dV do you need...)\u003Cp\u003ETaking for example the system Kerbin-Mun on the picture we can see how much dV we need to perform a successfully landing on Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting from Kerbin you can see 4500dV, this means that you need about 4500dV to put a spacecraft in LKO (Low Kerbin Orbit), after this we see that on the line which connect Kerbin to Mun there\u0027s a \u0022860dV\u0022 this dV is the dV that you need to perform a transfer from LKO to a Mun orbit intersection (For example: the velocity when you are in LKO is about 2300-2400 m/s right?
