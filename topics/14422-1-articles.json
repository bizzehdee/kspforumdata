As the subject suggests, been locked into Skyrim the last 7 months or so, so big kudos for producing something good enough to take my attention away from it for a while. I\\\u0027ll return to Murdrous Removanov and his stabby, thieving ways soon enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStumbled across this game courtesy of a comment in a thread at Fark, downloaded the demo and was pretty much instantly hooked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlayed for a couple of days, ponied up for the full version (figured I\\\u0027d already had my money\\\u0027s worth even if I never played it again). Have sent many Kerbals to fiery, watery and crushy deaths, and one sad crew orbits forever after I accidentally separated their booster turning the rig around for re-entry. Have managed to achieve a couple of orbiting ships now, although generally fairly eccentric and high - suspect my ascent speed\\\u0027s a bit high and I\\\u0027m not changing course hard enough early enough, but we\\\u0027ll get there. Have resisted getting tips so far, just working to my own pace, trying out designs and tweeks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently working on good staging and separation techniques after an embarrassing incident where my clever three tanks feeding one rocket design discarding all of its hardware somewhat prematurely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m trying to work with modular type designs and was wondering if at some point we might be able to merge designs. As mentioned I have a tri-tank design upper stage I quite like and it would be good to save it as a modular type design you could slot in on top of various lower stages, rather than rebuilding it every time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DomAzaris1996","CreatedById":25990,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-16T08:47:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome from Melbourne Australia ;D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt truly is a brilliant game!

I\u0027m unashamedly using Mechjeb - I can kinda fly the ships, and have had some success with interplanetary probes and manned missions in prior versions, but find the mission planning, ship building and maneuver planning more my thing in this game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also trying to be a bit more disciplined in my approach to missions. I\u0027ve developed a spreadsheet with mission objectives, outcomes, lessons learned, that sort of thing, and taking a more progressive approach to developing capabilities. Started with a simple ISA mapping mission with a satellite, fairly basic launch platform, which then became a one man orbital mission, and then developing a launch platform for the larger three man capsule, testing that platform\u0027s orbital capabilities before moving to a Mun-orbit and return mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment I have a small ISA mapping mission orbiting the Mun, with the next mission a similar one for Minmus. From there, I need to develop a lander and test whether my large launch platform will be able to get it there, and then develop the lander into a return-capable vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMain lesson learnt so far - always put a small solar panel on the pod, as you will forget to deploy the extendable panels before the pod runs out of electricity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AfterburnerDave","CreatedById":77799,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-11T05:16:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello!
