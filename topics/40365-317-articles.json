You can also just spam probes at varoius places and still max it out or come close enough to not mater. I do recomend you include at least 1 probe designed to transmit that is carrying a nuke preferably or alot of solars as it takes a ton of power to transmit the impact data back.

For starters the hardware requirements for the laser / ion arrays to generate fusion are massive. Even scaled hypothetically in KSP, to be even close to how they work you would be talking about microwaving power to the spacecraft in order to power the lasers in order to generate fusion, at which point why not just use the microwaved power. As well, as of yet there has not been a break-even or models to show break-even using inertial confinement.
