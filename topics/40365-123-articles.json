Solar panels have relatively realistic power/mass ratios at that conversion and likewise the unupgraded nuclear reactors are close to values for real nuclear reactors that have been tested (but not actually used) for space applications. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, everything in this mod conserves energy - i.e. the thrust of all the engines is based upon engine power and specific impulse (enough information to derive a thrust). Unfortunately, some engines both stock and modded don\u0027t do this, but even if I used a different scheme for balance, there is no reason to think others would use the same one so the way I see it, I might as well stick with this scheme.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BrickedKeyboard\u0022 data-cite=\u0022BrickedKeyboard\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI suppose this counts as a cross-mod interaction, however, even the stock ion engine becomes super OP because you can run a limitless number of them off of the smallest reactor.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s actually the stock ion engine that is already super OP. Its thrust is probably scaled up somewhere between 100,000 and 1,000,000x compared to reality.
