I was able to build it and get it into orbit for about 28000.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo after feeling like I had just made fire my Sat was orbiting for about 30 mins and I was looking at it.. admiring it.. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E and suddenly...it exploded right before my very eyes. I received a message that said my Sat had overheated WUH?! It only had the stuff on it that the mission had required..well I also put a thermometer on it but that was all, last time I checked the temp it was orbiting on the Sun side of the planet and it had a temp of -40 that was about 5 mins before BOOM time. The orbit was also set along the mission parameters, I made budget, and received an increase. Right now all I can do is scratch my head about what went wrong any opinions?\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T11:43:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWere you in close orbit around the sun?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mlb1m7J.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mlb1m7J.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf not, it might just be a glitch with your satellite.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chazz Ulric","CreatedById":89377,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T16:09:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELOL no I was not orbiting the Sun I was orbiting around Kerbal the planet, I just happend to be on the side facing the Sun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
