If I take a fuel tank, put an engine on the bottom, then radially attach a couple fuel tanks on the side of the center tank, then the single engine in the middle should draw fuel from all three tanks, without needing fuel lines or anything, right? No decouplers or girders or anything involved, just 3 tanks and an engine. Mine\u0027s not using the side tanks.
