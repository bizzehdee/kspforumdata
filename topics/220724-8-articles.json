The city of Portland, which is probably smaller than what the Mars city will be due to lack of farmland, is 233km squared area. I\u0027m going to treat the volume of the dome as if it were a cube, and the extra volume that wouldn\u0027t be there on account of shape will go to the farmland. So let\u0027s just say to have good circulation and allow birds to live in it, it will need to be a generous 1 km tall (the artwork shows it higher). So, the volume is just 233km cubed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, it would cost $233 billion dollars to build a pressurized dome \u003Cem\u003Efor the city\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom r/theydidthemath\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s be generous and use the lower estimate. About 250 sq km for 1 million people.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCost of dome \u002B homes (minus maintenance, services, sewage, transporting dirt for farming, etc.): ~$488 billion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe article from Payload Space that estimated SpaceX\u0027s revenue I found put operating costs in 2022 at $3 billion. They launched 61 rockets in 2022, rounding that down to 60, we get $50 million to launch one rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow many Starships will it take to build the city? Way more than Musk theorizes. An interesting Seattle Times article did the calculations and the weight of a home came in at about 300 tons. So 300 million tons of material need to be moved to Mars \u003Cem\u003Efor the housing alone\u003C/em\u003E. Starship 3 can bring 200 tons to LEO, and with 4-5 refueling flights could bring that to Mars. So 1,500,000 Cargo Starship launches would be required to send the materials, ignoring things like volume restrictions and what have you. Add 4 tanker flights per launch, and that would be 7,500,000 Starship launches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus SpaceX\u0027s operating costs including the launch of these rockets, in total, would amount to $375 trillion. This doesn\u0027t include the 10,000 Starships needed to launch the million colonists, nor the cost of launching the dome, dirt for farmland, robot laborers, and so on. And of course the associated tankers. Nor the actual cost of the materials themselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese would be internal launches and thus generate no revenue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn contrast, the Earth\u0027s GDP in 2022 was about $100 trillion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStarlink had 2.3 million subscribers in 2023, and generated $4.2 billion in revenue.

And it won\u0027t even turn a profit when it is complete. It will just be a regular old city, but costing $50 million to send stuff to and fro on a good day. Contrast with how sending a 20 ft shipping container to Japan costs about $1,200 dollars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA Mars city will, in all likelihood, never turn a profit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd remember those failed predictions about technology in the early 20th century? Let me introduce you to some more bad projections. In the 1920s, people predicted the end of poverty, infinite growth, and even declines in culture because people were becoming so wealthy they wouldn\u0027t want to do anything. Then after the crash of \u002729, people were predicting permanent damage, endless poverty and unemployment, and no hope of recovery ever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo even though Goldman Sachs predicts the global GDP being $227 trillion in 2050, which maybe could put it at $1 quadrillion by year 2300- at which point the US GDP might be about $300-400 trillion (all at a rate of growth of $100 trillion every 25 years), that would still require a company with the ability to invest an amount equivalent to the US GDP in something they will get no return on investment in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll that assumes there is no Second Great Depression, no nuclear war, no AI disruption to the economy, and no disastrous damage from climate change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really dislike the idea of things being inevitable. If we want something to happen in the future, we have to work for it, we can\u0027t assume it will just come to us. No one is really working towards anything right now, and I feel like that\u0027s just going to allow another bad cascade of events that will lead to great damage and set humanity back 50 years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvery generation has talked about something being inevitable, then had things turned on their head and started saying the other way around was inevitable. There is great collateral in the process. I wish for once we would recognize the future is unknown and try to shape it by our own will, instead of letting it take the trajectory set by people who are either in retirement homes or dead. Because it isn\u0027t a trajectory at all, just feeling our way through the dark with no interest in our existence beyond the present.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, now for fun let\u0027s see when a company might have the wherewithal to fund its own Mars colony, based on these unchanging linear projections that I simplified.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpaceX\u0027s total revenue was about $8 billion according to that same Payload Space estimate. So 3/8 of that was operating costs. Assuming SpaceX\u0027s revenue can grow with the economy: maybe SpaceX and Tesla merge into one mega corporation, along with Twitter, maybe it produces the world\u0027s best mac and cheese, who knows. I\u0027m going to use that trend as the GDP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo SpaceX\u0027s total revenue will be $16 billion in 2050, and $32 billion in 2100. I\u0027m gonna round it up to $10 billion in 2023 so this is easier. So $40 billion in 2100.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n$64 billion in 2200, $128 billion in 2300. By the year 3000, it will be $400 billion. $800 billion in 4000, but let\u0027s bump that to a trillion. So it will be $3 trillion dollars by the year 8000.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that, it would take about 200,000 years for SpaceX\u0027s operating costs to reach $300 trillion dollars. The extra 75, also rounded up, to 100, would take another 667 years or so to gain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo SpaceX will have enough money to build a city on Mars starting in 208,667 A.D. By this time, two moons of Uranus will have collided, the Arecibo message will have reached its target, and Pioneer 10 will have passed within about 3 light years of Ross 248, a red dwarf, which circa 60,000 A.D. will have become the closest star to Earth for a brief period of time (10,000 years).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDisclaimer:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is half serious attempt to calculate the cost of a Mars colony, half tongue in cheek criticism of statements that say things like \u0022All we need to do is send some software engineers to Mars and the colony will be profitable.\u0022 I did not check my math.
