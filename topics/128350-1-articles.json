I only got the first to engines, but want to build the SSTO now. It should be only a small thing to make a kind of experience in that area. What my idea was is to get with the engines at an altitude about ~25km over Kerbin and than fire a LV 909 to get into space. Thats the theory, but in praxis i never reach 10km with the normal engines because they get very weak as soon as i lift off. I already added some more air intake to probably solve the problem, but that wasn\u0027t a real solution.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nCan you guys give me maybe some advice how to get into orbit.

all.\u00A0 And 10km is a great place to start with a rocket-- for example, it\u0027s high enough that even a Terrier is reasonably efficient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut yeah, in general I agree with you-- it\u0027s not hard to get to orbit with purely rocket-powered vehicles in early tech.\u00A0 Where I find the early-tech air-breathing engines to be the most handy are for suborbital hops, particularly for contracts of the \u0022go to \u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;place near KSC\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;do thing\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E at

rockets aren\u0027t a great answer either:\u00A0 either you try the \u0022efficient\u0022 approach (a single parabolic launch from KSC to the target), which is a difficult navigation challenge, or else the \u0022inefficient\u0022 approach (try to fly the rocket like an airplane and guide it into the target), which is hard to have enough fuel for.\u00A0 A simple suborbital spaceplane, powered by Junos and a Terrier, works great for that.\u00A0 The Junos fly you to the site and get you up to 10km or so, then the Terrier pops you up to the needed altitude to complete the contract.\u00A0 Then the Junos can fly you back home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime
