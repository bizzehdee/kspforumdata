The complete set of shield parts can be delivered to orbit in a single launch, assemblage is easy and it fulfilled its mission with 850 units of Ablator left (from 12.600... ok ok... it was pretty close).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe shield decelerated the craft enough, to establish an elliptic orbit around Jool with no fuel usage at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to bad balancing of the test craft it entered a little of a em errr totally predicted (say uncontrollable) spin, exposing 2 of the trusses to too much temperature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis resulted in the loss of 2 shields before they were actually burned up. So, with a decent craft this should work as intended \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 with Ablator to spare...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the final version, i plan to dock the trusses to the ship as well, to reduce profile.
