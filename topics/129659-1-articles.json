I have both a Steam controller and an XBox 360 Controller; I use the Steam controller, but I checked and this is a problem for both. The Steam controller\u0027s left stick is mapped to a controller left stick.\u00A0I can map pitch/yaw/roll arbitrarily to any joystick or controller axis I like for flight, but there doesn\u0027t seem to be a way to map a controller to movement on a Kerbal in EVA. In control mapping on the \u0022Kerbals\u0022 tab, the character axis bindings have places for translation and roll/pitch/yaw, but none of those things really make sense here. I tried mapping to translate, but that didn\u0027t seem to do anything (as in, if I move a controller axis mapped to any character translate action, nothing happens).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor now, as a workaround, I can still use a/s/d/w for Kerbal EVA movement, but it would sure be more convenient to be able to use those same controller axes that are working great on rockets on Kerbals. Did I just miss the setting somewhere? Was one of the translate actions really the one I was looking for and this is just a bug?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance if anyone has suggestions!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-11T16:32:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi ZeroG, those bindings are for the Kerbal jetpack rather than for walking, it\u0027s a shame it isn\u0027t made clear in the options screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZeroG","CreatedById":97986,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-12T02:44:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222357194\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022129659\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221452529936\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002216426\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, sal_vager said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi ZeroG, those bindings are for the Kerbal jetpack rather than for walking, it\u0027s a shame it isn\u0027t made clear in the options screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAh\u00A0OK, thanks, that helps.
