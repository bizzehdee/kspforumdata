None of the things that have been discussed increase the level of complexity of play within KSP (save adding an Engineer-style information panel maybe, which a lot of people want). They do, however, fix behind-the-scenes inaccuracies. Even FAR can be used without the data analysis tools (I do it all the time); look at NEAR, for instance, which is basically just a rewritten, more forgiving FAR without the \u0022confusing\u0022 tools.

Like massless parts, lack of n-body physics, nose cones that are nothing more than a crippling parts, lack of any in-game comparison of the components (especially important for engines), lack of in-game Delta V screen or any other basic information (eg. GUI never tells you what\u0027s the aerodynamic pressure (so you know if you ascend too fast or too slow) and G-force gauge is so tiny and badly scaled that you can\u0027t get anything useful out of it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew players really struggle to get anywhere because of all the oddities that KSP has (eg. that counting on a gravity turn is an idiotic thing to do - instead you should ascend till ~10km and then make 45 degree turn - game NEVER bothers to tell you that). In comparison getting a basic understanding of how orbital mechanic work with current navigation nodes is a breeze! (I did try KSP over a year ago - got discouraged by random guesswork after getting into the orbit - when I played it with the nav nodes - I instantly decided to purchase the game for myself - again an example that explaining stuff to the player makes an enormous difference)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame with docking - docking wouldn\u0027t be even nearly as much of a problem as it is now if we\u0027d have a proper docking camera with proper data displays (eg. velocity on XYZ axis in comparison to the target) - for me it\u0027s still MORE difficult to dock when I use \u0022set target as\u0022 option on a docking port than doing it manually by observing the craft and moving the camera around - I automatically switch my focus the the gui which gives you some info, but there\u0027s just so many gaps between what I can seen and the info I need for successful docking that I usually end up either crashing or spinning off course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP does relatively little to explain anything - hoping that players will \u0022\u003Cem\u003Efigure it out\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 (which ends with: read the forum / wiki / watch youtube or in most of the cases: RAGE QUIT) - and at the same time it does A LOT to add crapton of it\u0027s own oddities that are NOWHERE to be explained in the game itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m4v","CreatedById":67965,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-05T21:28:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ferram4\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ferram4\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EA lot of the current unrealistic stuff just makes the game more confusing (do you remember when you learned nose cones were useless?
