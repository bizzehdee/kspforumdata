The most important one obviously being real fuels. I dont think my issue with oxygen boil off is related to real fuels as I\u0027ve made a config file with the FINAL designation to change all the\u00A0 tanks with the variable \u0027loss_rate\u0027 to \u00270\u0027 and have confirmed that it is working by checking modulemanager.configcache. So my only conclusion is that its a different mod. I had cryogenic engines and tanks installed and found variables called BoiloffRate and some other localization stuff related to that mod, but I wasnt sure I had found all the instances within its configuration so I elected to play without it. Deleted my configcache so it would generate a new one and I\u0027m still experiencing Liquid oxygen boil off and I can\u0027t find the variable responsible for it, so I\u0027ve come here for help. Here\u0027s a combined pic of my mod list. Appreciate everyones time. -\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/L9ldERG\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/L9ldERG\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
