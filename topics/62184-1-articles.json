As you can see the ship on the blue orbit is inclined to 24\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. The ship above and on the left has got the same inclination, orbit is just shorter. Inclination being the lowest latitude you can reach, choosing the same inclination as the ship you want to rendez-vous does not means you will have same orbit !!!

As far as LAT and LON I really have no idea nad tend to ignore them anyway. Also, I seriously doubt that either of your craft in the first pic (The ones on the grey orbits) are in a 24 deg orbit. If they were then they would be on the same orbital plane as the blue orbit. Just because MechJeb says they are at the same inclination doesn\u0027t mean they are relative to eachother. Your best bet here is to send a refueler.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gilflo","CreatedById":62881,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T22:01:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree with the refueler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInclination is angle of your orbit with equator, so you can have same inclination North or south from equator and not being on same orbit.

If you target your other ship, you can read that angle off the node and calculate whether you have enough left to do the plane change. For large plane change maneuvers, you can also use a bi-elliptic strategy, where you would burn prograde at a node (ascending or descending) until your apoapsis is near the edge of the sphere of influence, coast to apoapsis, do the plane change there (which will be much cheaper due to the lower orbital velocity), then re-circularize at periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the reason your two 24 degree inclination orbits don\u0027t line up is that your orbital plane is defined by two numbers, inclination and longitude of ascending node (which is where the orbit crosses the equator, and confusingly has nothing to do with terrestrial longitudes). So even though your two orbits have the same inclination, they have different longitudes of ascending nodes (238 vs 167), and so they\u0027re on different planes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gilflo","CreatedById":62881,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T08:56:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, Alexmun, thank\u0027s a lot for those explanations, great help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
