My small planes were on good track to achieve Kerbin orbit, but I was ending up lacking fuel, even when I didn\u0027t left wasted fuel for jet engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was trying to fly it this way:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- at beginning of flight I was going with almost 45 deg. up, gaining altitude as fast as I could\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- when I saw Intake Air starting getting low (something about 10000 m.)

If you employ the turbojet intake stacking trick, you can keep your engines running for much longer, and keep pushing. It\u0027s possible to get to 2000 m/s velocity on turbojets alone, and wind up on suborbital \u0027hops\u0027. Hitting the rocket engine once you\u0027re on a 60,000 m \u002B \u0027hop\u0027 should let you get into orbit a bit more efficiently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut you\u0027ve got the right approach. If your plane can climb at 45 deg off the runway, do that and then start to level off around 18,000. Try to aim for the horizon and maximize intake air, building up speed and slowly going higher. Throttle down as your intake air starts to approach .08 per turbojet, and then throttle down further and further. Then kick on the Rocket engine and go for it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-11T11:38:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst up, if you have not done so already, i would put the outer two jets and the inner two jets on separate Action group keys. You will want to shut down the outer two first, and let all intakes feed the inner two before shutting them down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext up, do one or more test flights. Open up the Resources Tab. Then fly up to high altitudes, and purposefully cause an engine flameout while watching the IntakeAir on the Resources Tab. that will tell you the threshold that you need to be mindful of. Repeat this running on the inner jets only.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo armed with those numbers you should be able to do a better ascent. I would say run all 4 jets as high and fast as you can until you are not gaining much speed. Then engage the rocket and shut the outer engines down. Climb, then shut down the inner two jets when they are near flameout. Also close off all the air intakes to reduce drag.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
