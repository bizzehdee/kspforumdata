For optimization it is generally desired for the non-propellant mass ratios to be the same for both craft. In the case that the effective velocity of both stages is the same the required delta V will be the same. This is generally not the case outside of textbooks or craft which operate entirely within one regime. Also there are many situations when designing to maintain similar mass ratios between the two stages may not be possible due to the non-linear weight-volume scaling relationships. However except in extreme circumstances (i.e. hydrolox or electric upper stage or solid lower stages) splitting the delta-V between the stages is normally a good first order approximation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sereneti","CreatedById":163637,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-19T14:37:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mass of the first stage are.... nearly .... not important.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nyou can use cheap \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E ore cheap hybrid-rockets.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe second stage has to be as light as possible.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBuuut:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nyou have to ignite the second stage, after the staging. ...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nyou cann use a bigger \u0022second stage\u0022 ignite it on earth, and add \u0022some\u0022 booster....\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jovus","CreatedById":117163,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-19T15:27:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre we talking about paper rockets, rockets for a \u0027real\u0027 launch company, or rockets for your backyard?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt makes a difference.

low) is critical. \u00A0Since neither the upper stage (nor the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E boosters) would ever be recovered, they can have all the
