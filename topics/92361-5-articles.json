got me thinking- a spacecraft designed to carry crew to Low Earth Orbit from a mid-sized Mass Driver (let\u0027s say one that can shoot craft above the atmosphere, but with\u00A0less horizontal velocity than something like the StarTram Gen 2 design)\u00A0actually shares a lot in common with an Interceptor Ship designed to rendezvous with a Cycler...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor one, both craft need a fairly high Thrust:Weight Ratio with a vacuim-optimized engine and a good chunk of Delta-V, but not enough to justify a second stage and the complexity/cost it adds. \u00A0A Mass Driver launched capsule needs to circularize its orbit when it ascends above the atmosphere, but it will still probably carry a reasonable chunk of velocity with it from the Mass Driver launch (StarTram requires less than 1 km/s to circularize, a less powerful, more economical Mass Driver might require 3-4\u00A0km/s to circularize if I were to guess...) \u00A0An Interceptor Ship needs to reach a fairly high-speed interplanetary trajectory, but probably would still only comprise a single stage...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother commanality is the need to deal with fairly large amounts of heat- the Mass Driver fired capsule during its ascent, where it starts out at high-hypersonic velocities in the lower atmosphere\u00A0(the 2nd Gen version of StarTram has an\u00A0insane scheme for extending\u00A0the firing tube into the upper atmosphere, but I\u0027m assuming most actual,\u00A0practical man-rated designs would look like their Gen 1 design- with a tube originating a bit underground and climbing/boring up the side of a mountain to fire near the peak...) an Interceptor Ship during Mars re-entry after detaching from the Cycler Ship (using the Interceptor Ship for this purpose would be simpler than having a dedicated lander, although a bit less mass-efficient)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth craft need to be very compact in their design, and would optimally not be designed to support humans for a long period of time, but instead carry a crew of humans and perishable cargo a short distance very mass-efficiently (the Mass Driver capsule because unmanned vessels can be accelerated through the Mass Driver at much higher g-forces, and thus can be fired from a seperate, shorter, and much cheaper Mass Driver like the Star Tram Gen 1 design- or alternatively be fired from the same Mass Driver at a much higher velocity, and thus require less Delta-V to reach otbit) where they would meet up with unmanned craft to hold the crew long-term.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd finally, both craft need to be capable of docking and loading/unloading its\u00A0crew and cargo, including fuel. \u00A0A Mass Driver capsule because the entire architecture of a Mass Driver system relies on firing lots of small spacecraft very frequently, to limit the size and power of the Mass Driver needed to accelerate spacecraft to a suborbiral trajectory, and amortize the costs of the Mass Driver over many\u00A0launches (so an ideal Mass Driver capsule would probably only carry one or two\u00A0people- just like an ideal Interceptor Ship approach would be that of a \u0022swarm of ants\u0022-\u00A0both to allow launch of the Interceptors\u00A0on smaller rockets, and to provide an abort-mode if one Interceptor should experience a failure and require rescue before reaching the Cycler Ship...) an Interceptor Ship, well, because docking with the Cycler Ship is its entire purpose. \u00A0Neither ship type would work well as an all-inclusive design that carries out its entire mission without needing to ever dock with another spacecraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, all of this leaves me wondering- would there by synergy between the two technologies?\u00A0(Mass Drivers and Interceptor Ships)\u00A0 I can certainly imagine engineers designing a rocket that meets the operational requirements of both missions. \u00A0And in some ways, the requirements on a Mass Driver capsule are actually harsher (higher\u00A0atmospheric heating, higher g-tolerances required from the structure, potentially greater Delta-V requirements, and more need for reliability:\u00A0as engine-failure on a suborbital trajectory means smashing into the ground or burning up during re-entry before you have time to attempt any fixes to the problem)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the very least I would think that a Mass Driver launch system could make ALL space exploration more affordable and provide a cheap way to launch the pieces of a Cycler Ship in many modules (a Cycler Ship would look a lot like a space station in design and construction, as the ability to accelerate it to its orbit with ion engines neans that it would experience VERY low g-forces after each piece reaches Low Earth Orbit. \u00A0In fact there\u0027s theoretically nothing stopping you from strapping an ion propulsion stsge to the International Space Station and using *IT* as a Cycler Ship...) \u00A0In a best-case scenario a\u00A0capsule designed to carry crew to LEO with a Mass Driver would also make an ideal Interceptor: although admittedly so would something like the Orion Capsule...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn fact, all this\u00A0me an idea- what if NASA tried to go to Mars with nothing but what they had in the next 10-12\u00A0years? \u00A0I mean what if they *LITERALLY* evacuated the ISS of all crew, strapped a VASIMR or large cluster of existing ion engines to it and accelerated it to an Aldrin Cycler Orbit over the course of a few\u00A0years (including maybe some gravity-assists from the Moon and Earth), and then used an Orion or a modified Red Dragon (SpaceX\u0027s coming Mars capsule)\u00A0as an Interceptor Ship to rendezvous with it the next time it passed by Earth? (the Red Dragon, at least, should have enough fuel to orbit Mars and then return to Earth- the Orion would probably have to limit itself to establishing orbit and then docking with a return-vessel waiting around Mars: perhaps one of the Orion variants NASA was looking at using for a Mars flyby\u00A0sent unmanned via a transfer-stage so it had enough fuel to return to Earth...) \u00A0A silly idea I\u0027m sure (what would be the point? \u00A0This seems like it would be a waste of the ISS), but amusing to imagine nonetheless...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, to return to my discussion from before- I can imagine a lot of potential synergies between \u00A0Mass Drivers and Cycler Ships. \u00A0Not the LEAST of which would be to someday in the distant future be able to set up a Mass Driver powerful enough to send an Interceptor Ship on an escape trajectory (or at LEAST a very high suborbital trajectory with an apoapsis close to the Moon...) in the general\u00A0direction of the Cycler Ship when it swings by Earth...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, try not to hate on my insane, crazy-big ideas here. \u00A0At least I KNOW these are crazy, nutso ideas compared to anything I suggested before (like classical Cycler Ships, which are an idea that goes all the way back to before Buzz Aldrin- and are actually in many ways EASIER to implement as a mission-architecture to get to Mars than something like the Mars \u0022Constellation\u0022 misdion plan, for instance, with its many more highly-specialized vessels and longer Mars transfer-times for the crew...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegards,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNorthstar\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-27T05:51:31Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2017 05:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
