Its also, terrible TWr aside, a great craft that has a very interesting (even if useless) weapon on it. Well ok the weapon isnt useless, but i have major trouble with it, inaccurate, and its very inconsistent too at least from my experience. I dont know how you managed to cut my SK-CRV-III with it, perhaps a 1 in a 100 shot, but i havent even been able to destroy a bloody FIGHTER with that weapon. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/ELyVN\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Its surprisingly tough to 1 shot even with a Tripedo-S, is basically immune to short ibeams, and best of all its small and thus hard to hit in the 1st place. That and the new wing layout looks (at least for me) super cool and kinda looks menacing/evil, especially when i set lighting to red. That and the wings act as sacrificial armor that seems to deflect or just destroy many projectiles when hit. Ohh and it can aerobrake too since the wings are flaps and actually create quite some drag when needed, havent tried interplanetary yet though, that might now work too well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if you can tell, it shares some of the armoring scheme of your fighter, its still my own design and the internals are basically same as they were before, but the armor plate added doesnt weigh too much, and it helps so much against enemy fire!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly thing i cant stand is teh abyssmal TWR of .19, its not SO BAD that its unplayeable, but its a major annoyance imo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, im looking for a weapon to replace the Ibeam-S missiles i have in this thing. Does anyone have any weapons that are effective vs unarmored or lightly armored vessels that are compact, can fit on a 0.6m docking port, and preferably have 2\u002B shots in as short a profile as possible. Weight and part count arent the biggest issues for me, i need multiple shots and most of all a small profile/size.

Tripedo-H aside, im like to test this against my Tripedo-M, which i believe should still do some nice solid damage to the vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUntil they are going to release 1.25m ion engines, ions are for me limited to craft below 15t. I just cant bear very long burn times (even if ions had a isp of 900000000 they would still be worthless above 15t). Pretty much to have a TWR of 0.2 (what i call bare minimum im willing to use), you would need 100 ion engines. That is just the ions, not to mention teh sheer number of fuel tanks, batteries, solar panels, ect, not to mention the weight of the engines alone adds up to ~25t, 1/4 of a 100t ship. With enough batteries to run this for a 1000dV burn continuously, thats another 300 parts right there minimum (the 2.5m ones aint useable since they are too large to fit in a SK-CRV styled hull), more if i use the smaller batteries that are easier to fit in a ship. Finally, at a part count of 1000, i dont think very many people would even be willing to fight you. ~600 is the absolute max id fight against, since i cant have proper fights above 1000 parts in one area as physics actually starts to derp out at higher part counts and very weird stuff happens like perfectly good ammo desintegrating or puny weak ships, or ibeams obliterating massive vessels. Regardless of armor, at that part count, you just wont be able to use it against most of us (i think only zekes can handle above 1000 parts well). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, im curious as to how its armor holds up, and id love a download once you complete it. I will have to strip its of weapons and ion systems, but im really interested in testing my firepower against its hull, if its anything like that bomber i expect the Tripedo-S to be unreliable is not useless, the M might be useful and might be useless, and the H should still vaporize it. That said, i am developing a new weapon, the Tripedo-S/H which should address the part count and mass problems while still giving me a very powerful missile that weighs UNDER 3t and has almost as much firepower as the Tripedo-H. Really the only thing keeping me from deploying this new weaponb on all my ships is the weapon\u0027s very awkward shape and profile, which has lots of stuff sticking out of it sideways and it wont fit in a 1.25m tube, forcing them to be placed externally to the vessel like some of my earlier ships has mounted Tripedo-Ss.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the ion tug concept is very similar to me repair drone ive started equipping many of my vessels with recently. Mine just has 2 claws to reconnect the ship in the (fairly common) event of being shot in half. Ohh, and im working on a SK-CRV-VI now, as the IV and V were promising on paper, but just lost too much armor and didnt shed enough parts to compensate. Had they been some drastic change like 100 less parts, the weaker armor would more then make up for that, but at a measly ~40 less parts, and considerably worse hull intergrity, i feel this is not worth bothering with. The VI model is actually a step in the opposite direction, minor part increase for extra armor plating and external fuel tanks added\u002Bextra engines in nacelles to compensate for weight increase. This should be ~100t and the middle weakness is heavily mitigated, although like most ships that use a similar construction, it still posesses that inherent weakspot in the central girder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for nuke changes, the biggest killer for me is the annoying change to LF only. before i could have backup vernors using the SAME fuel the nukes used. Now i need to either forego the vernors (and any sort of redundancy or docking ability), or carry dedicated oxy that cuts into teh already terrible dV my ships have. That and the fact that massless parts are actually now nolonger massless, means more dV losses from vernor useage. Its not that big of a deal (and a change i was assuming would come sooner or later), but its all the little things that add up to much tougher to create ships. That said, nukes are the ONLY engine that makes any sense for me. Ions are just too part count intensive and they have abyssmal TWR regardless of how many you spam, not to mention the sheer mass and part count needed in batteries/solars to use them for anything that isnt a super small burn on a low-gravity planet. What id do for some longer batteries (larger capacity say 1.25m ones that are as long as a FLT-400 or so) and more powerful RTGs so we can actually use them to run the ion drives and not have to rely on crappy solar panels. This would open up ion drives for capital ships, until then though, ions are probe, fighter, and light bomber exclusive at least for the part of teh community that cant bear to have 1000\u002B parts in a ship. And i dont even need to say why LFO engines are worthless if you care about armor. to get even 2K dV, you need a really large fuel fraction, and this devolves into large volume and also alot of weight. A nuke vessel with equal mass will have way better armor and or better firepower. It just makes no sense at all to use LFOs in a serious battle (unless TWR gets added into the combat rules somehow wher eTWR for exapmle lets you attack 1st).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-24T15:31:46Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2015 03:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Three1415","CreatedById":85754,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T17:58:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022\\\u0022 data-cite=\u0022\\\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUntil they are going to release 1.25m ion engines, ions are for me limited to craft below 15t.

It is around as reliable as most 5-7t warheads, and the only real downside to it is the very difficult to work with profile. Btw, if you want to have a hint as to what it looks like, ill say your \u0022wheel of misforture\u0022 weapon is extremely similar in composition, i just scaled it up to be heavy enough to kill off capitals and made it guided. Still very similar concept though (even if i had the idea well before i saw your missiles, just never bothered to implement it as i wasnt trying to develop OP firepower at the time).

The only major issue with it is that it has lowish TWR, and needs to be fired from an excess of 2km for maximum effect (although even at lower speeds itll still hurt, just wont 1 shot dreks then).
