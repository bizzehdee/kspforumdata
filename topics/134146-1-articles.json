After a bad landing, I made some adjustments to the lander itself, but left the LV alone. For some reason, the game crashes completely now when I stage the first time (stage to fire first engines and release clamps is fine) and I can\u0027t seem to get it fixed. I even deleted the entire launch vehicle and removed all the staging components from the lander, and rebuilt it from scratch, but it still crashes as soon as I press space to ditch the first stage engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.0.5, Steam, Mac. No mods at all.
