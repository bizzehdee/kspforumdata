The most complex part was to survive the re-entry and how to fit the heat shields. I had dozens of fails, when the atmosphere is making you to stop at 7G the smallest thing matters. I would like to try to so something smaller for payloads up to 5 Tons. BTW The Skylone model is pretty cool"},{"CreatedByName":"One-Way Films","CreatedById":90926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T11:40:12Z","Content":"When did Real Solarsystem update to 1.0?

Without them the SSTO is not fully stable."}]}
