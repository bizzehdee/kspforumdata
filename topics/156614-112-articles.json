I have swimmy stuff at the edge of my vision, my head feels like someone\u0027s hammering a railroad spike into my forehead, and my stomach gets dizzy.

I hadn\u0027t eaten much for lunch and was feeling the early signs of death migraines occurring (Trouble seeing the screen). I got off and had to go to a church youth group thing, where I just curled up in a ball and closed my eyes to keep it from getting worse. I took some ibuprofen as soon as I got home, and despite my pain (and the loss of some pizza from lunch), I hopped on the phone to call again.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore context: I call her on my phone in the living room.

Throughout the call, I kinda curl up and lift my stomach off the ground. This gap in my stomach reminds me of how empty it is, which makes me hurt more, which makes me curl up, etc. Eventually, it\u0027s so bad I have to leave mid-sentence and dispell what\u0027s left in my stomach (Not going to go into the details). I head downstairs, and then, as soon as I\u0027m about to say how much I love her (Which I bet would have just been\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eso\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0romantic coming from the dude who just threw up and who looks like crap), it\u0027s time for supper. I say that I\u0027ll be right back after a light breakfast of eggs and toast. I head to the kitchen, and it feels like the Hulk is pushing a flagpole into my forehead. I can\u0027t even eat the rest of the meal and just stagger upstairs to go to sleep.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL;DR: Felt terrible yesterday because I wanted to die, feel terrible today because I didn\u0027t give my girlfriend a goodbye.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DarkOwl57","CreatedById":161624,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-05T20:42:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom the wonderful land of school:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo in history, we typically have to take notes over the weekend.
