It is about a boy, Jackson, as he goes through the event of every existing thing in the universe disappearing, and then the universe itself. Things disappear at random order, may it be a simple pen, to a neighbour down the street. As more and more things disappear, it becomes recognizable by Jackson. He tries to tell everyone about the inevitable, but no one believes him. At the point in between the whole universe disappearing, and the starting point, they finally realize. The event speeds up, and more things vanish as less things exist. Jackson wakes up to realize he\u0027s an orphan, as his parents no longer exist. The next day, he discovers that almost every planet in the solar system has disappeared. Jackson and his friends rush into a school gym, and when one of his friends look out the gym doors, he discovers that the gym is the only place still existing. As parts of the gym start disappearing, his friends follow, leaving only him and his best friend. They say their goodbyes, as the basics of the universe are the last things to vanish. And then, in a moment, Jackson and his friend disappear, following the universe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I came here to ask if I should continue in my writing, or not. I\u0027d love to hear. Let\u0027s not be jerks with our negative opinions either.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
