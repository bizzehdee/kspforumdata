IIRC, given my high school bio classes, as long as the sunscreen is not opaque to visible light, just UV, the plants should be fine (from a photosynthesis perspective). The chlorophyll and other light absorbing pigments work within visible light (again, IIRC) so it should be ok. Whether the additives and stuff helping the sunscreen be the liquid jelly paste form actually harms plants IDK.
