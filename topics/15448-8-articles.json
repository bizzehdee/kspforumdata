More, and even if we discount the fully automated missions ( that are by itself a big majority ), all of the missions involving humans since Gemini and Soyuz have a big degree of automation atleast on takeoff. So, I\u0027m pretty much expecting to see more and more automation inserted in the game as the game approaches beta stage. I would even say that .17, with the need of bigger precision for the interplanetary burns than the one needed to go anywhere that currently exists in the game will only make the need more automation more visible ... not necessarily MechJeb autopilot style ( that are clearly the less performant parts of the mod , btw ) though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sp_blazer","CreatedById":38958,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-12T04:34:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI played stock for months, did all that I could with it, but now I use MechJeb, mainly for the most time consuming tasks like circularizing orbits, or warping to apogee.

I enjoy KSP mostly for the ability to design flight systems (shuttles, planes, rockets) and so for me, MechJeb is a useful tool because I\u0027m not a pilot, I\u0027m an engineer. Neither my reflexes nor my computer hardware are ideal for flight simulations per se, but MechJeb allows me to have success with my landings and other flight operations. \u003Cp\u003EI think if you ask the experts who do this for a living, they\u0027ll tell you that, while it can be rewarding to calculate a trajectory by hand, it\u0027s also highly unnecessary for an astronaut to do these days. The next generation of NASA vessels will fly almost entirely by computer, both for safety and to conserve fuel whenever possible. The landings on Mars, both unmanned and the eventual manned flights in the future, were and will be handled by computer control. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the MechJeb system is brilliant and I\u0027ll continue to use it whenever needed. Having said that, if KSP version 0.75 or whatever, decides to throw in an autopilot feature, I\u0027d like to see it include a failure mode every once in a while that may force me to fly manually in a landing phase as I think that\u0027s the most likely scenario for needing to do so. There\u0027s nothing wrong with a little adventure flying. As others have pointed out, it does make the experience more exciting and rewarding.

I have used the ascent autopilot in a limited function tho for rocket testing.
