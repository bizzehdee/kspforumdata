I think that a feature that should be implemented in a future version is a tool that allows us to design and plan space stations and ground bases in the game, rather than only finding out what the thing looks like when you finish it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe interface would have access to all the normal parts and sub-assemblies, but there would be no launch button because if you are using this editor, the thing you are planning is too large/heavy to be sent in one launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think this interface needs its own KSC building because there isn\u0027t an opportunity to actually build the whole station at once. It could be a button off to the side that brings the user to a computery-looking interface where large objects can be designed using all the standard parts. It would also be nice if there was more camera freedom here, so every angle can be captured.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETell me what you think in the thread if you want to give feedback or want to refine this idea. The purpose of this interface would be to make space station design easier and less susceptible to mistakes like solar panels that collide with other modules, center of mass for RCS, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sam.johnson841","CreatedById":104846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T10:19:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethe space plane hanger usually works fine for me\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T10:37:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBehind the scenes the SPH and VAB are already the same.
