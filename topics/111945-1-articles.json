If someone don\u0027t like the name this project es open right now so any request or suggestion es welcome.\n\nFor now this CP supports : TACLS, IFILS, USILS, KAS and MKS. Since the base doesn\u0027t have to dock with the other parts just land very close to the base core, MKS proximity logistics are supported and KAS too. Now it also support SCANSat for the scanning contract.\n\nThis uses a new sistem for letting the player choose where to build the base. I mean to choose the Celestial Body with the Scanning contract. The player just need to orbit the Celestial Body he wants and there is ready, all the base is going to be build there. \n\nAlso this is fully compatible with planet packs such as RSS and Outer Planets.\n\nHere is a github [link](https://github.com/CosmoBro/Contract-Pack-Base-Construction) for the source. All vessels listed as Bases are going to be affected by the Manteinance contracts.\n\nBeta v0.0.3 [download](https://github.com/CosmoBro/Contract-Pack-Base-Construction/releases/tag/0.0.3)\n\nPlease Test and report anything weird also check the balance from the contracts.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [Contract Configurator](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101604) (min. v.1.5.0)\n\u003E \n\u003E Contract Configurator is licensed under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n\u003E \n\u003E [Module Manager](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219) (min. v.2.6.5)\n\u003E \n\u003E Module Manager is licensed under the CC share-alike license\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E //Create Contracts\n\u003E \n\u003E 1.

I can see missions that guide you through a complex colonization game with mods like USI and TAC life support.\n\nMore ideas:\n\n- \u0022Concerned citizens are worried about our life support supply missions sending Kerbin\u0027s air irreversibly into space. I\u0027m sure the protesters will go home if we build a self-sufficient base.\u0022 Build a base [on \\_\\_\\_\\_] that recycles 100% of its oxygen. Assemble it with no more than X units of oxygen. At least N kerbals must live there (stay within e.g. 5 km) for Y days without resupply or mining more oxygen. (Where Y days is set long enough that you have to recycle 100% of your oxygen to make it that long.)\n- A similar mission for each life support consumable, the final one for all of them. Protesters could say, \u0022Eat the space program!\u0022 and \u0022What will we eat at the movies if you send all of our Snacks into space?\u0022\n- \u0022The protestors are back! They say our Mun base has mined so much water, they can see the damage from Kerbin. We told them that those craters have always been there, but they\u0027re not satisfied.\u0022 Make your existing Mun base self-sufficient. The quests continue until all your bases are abandoned or self-sufficient.\n- Another one: Hide your non-life support resource mining operations on the far side of Mun.\n- \u0022A big breakthrough for Kerbin\u0027s land pioneers was realizing they didn\u0027t have to carry their own logs across the continent to build houses. We think we just made a similar breakthrough.\u0022 Build a base with in-situ minerals with [list of Parts]. These parts must be made on [planet]. No more than X tons can be landed from Kerbin. (Needs Extraplanetary Launchpads.)\n- \u0022Our scientists say we can mine oxygen on [planet]. I have no idea how you\u0027d breathe rocks, but that\u0027s a problem for our engineers.\u0022 Generate X units of oxygen on [planet]\u0027s surface from ore [or rock-like community resources that can be turned into oxygen].\n- \u0022Komercial aviation only really took off when we realized we could refuel planes instead of blowing them up each flight. Let\u0027s do the same thing with a rocket. Refuel it, that is.\u0022 Land a craft on [planet] with less than 20% of the delta V to take off. Mine enough fuel to return it to low Kerbin orbit!\n- \u0022Bottled water conglomerate Keslee realized they could charge absurd prices for Space Water. Build them a base on [planet] that produces X units of water per month.\u0022 Further contracts could be to return said water. \u0022Kerka Kola wants to enter the Space Water market. They think water from Laythe would have twice the psychotropic placebo of their competitors\u0027 Mun water.\u0022 You can get similar contracts from Kudweizer, Kepsi, etc. You could string out this hilarious contract chain telling the story of the Space Water boom and bust... and the next venture, Space Air.\n- \u0022Ice cream giant Koldstone Kreamery thinks the next great flavor can be found in space! Their flavor lab needs samples.\u0022 Return them surface samples from each of Minmus \u0027 biomes. Next mission, \u0022Koldstone wants to send two of their flavor scientists to Minmus to investigate: How did nature make an entire moon so minty and sparkly?\u0022 Build them a research outpost with [instruments], host them for N months supervised by 1\u002B experienced Kerbalnaut then return them to Kerbin. On success, \u0022Koldstone\u0027s food scientists have released a new flavor - Minmus Mint .\u0022 Next mission: After an expose and lawsuit revealed that Minmus Mint doesn\u0027t actually contain bits of Minmus, they need us to build a base that will mine them some.\u0022 Build a base that produces N units of ore or minerals per month in the [biome] if Minmus. On success, \u0022Our new Genuine Minmus Mint flavor tastes like sand, but marketing says it\u0027ll be a hit anyway. Thanks!\u0022  \n\nThe korporate clients could give lots of funds but less reputation whereas the self-sufficiency/space environmentalist ones give science, lots of reputation and less funds (because sustainability is its own reward).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-12T14:52:29Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2015 02:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by beabop**"},{"CreatedByName":"CosmoBro","CreatedById":142301,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T23:22:45Z","Content":"Maybe a TACLS support and a self -sufficience expansion of the base.
