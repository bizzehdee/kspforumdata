If someone don\u0027t like the name this project es open right now so any request or suggestion es welcome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now this CP supports : TACLS, IFILS, USILS, KAS and MKS. Since the base doesn\u0027t have to dock with the other parts just land very close to the base core, MKS proximity logistics are supported and KAS too. Now it also support SCANSat for the scanning contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis uses a new sistem for letting the player choose where to build the base. I mean to choose the Celestial Body with the Scanning contract. The player just need to orbit the Celestial Body he wants and there is ready, all the base is going to be build there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso this is fully compatible with planet packs such as RSS and Outer Planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a github \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/CosmoBro/Contract-Pack-Base-Construction\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elink\u003C/a\u003E for the source.
