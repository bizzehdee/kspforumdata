For what I can tell it was successful, did a quicksave and tried an EVA just for fun and noticed both ships were separated. Did a quick load and the ships were not only separated but one of the docks was closed. When I right click on it I see that says \u0022Status: Locked\u0022 and can\u0027t get it to open again.
