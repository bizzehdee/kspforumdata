Changing the planets surface would be too much work for what you want to do, and doing a bump map would result in a very high visual quality, but on the same token I\u0027m not even sure if KSP can utilize a bump map for planets. I\u0027ve never seen a texture pack that\u0027s included one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, as for creating a higher resolution texture, all you need is an image editing program (Gimp, Photoshop, or Paint.net are going to be the key choices, with the first and last being completely free and without hassle to acquire) and some moderate artistic ability. Typically what I would do is pull up the original texture as a reference and go about recreating it in whatever resolution you want your new texture to be. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother method, and one that might be easier if you don\u0027t have any artistic ability, is to just upscale the original texture and then go about touching it up so that its richer and takes more of an advantage of the increased resolution. However, doing this isn\u0027t a perfect solution as the end result can run the gamut from awful looking to amazing regardless of skill level.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
