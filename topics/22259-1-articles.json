On the landers I might, but typically they jettison when I do my final liftoff, or the tank is getting low so it doesn\u0027t matter. Also always try and make sure you have a final stage that has enough fuel to get back from your destination by itself, be it mun, minmus or some other celestial body. For the most fuel maximizing return, try to burn retrograde at apoapsis, this is your slowest orbit point and as such have the most meaningful effect on periapsis, let atmospheres do the hard work for you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"robly18","CreatedById":37651,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-16T17:29:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHooray!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI followed your advice and took the RCS away...
