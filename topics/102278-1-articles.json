My vessels just freeze up (with enough battery power in stock ). \n\nDo you use a claw on your station? This part i known to be ables to summon the glorious deep space kraken.\n\nA way to fix the acceleration temporarily is to go to back to the ksp Base en reselected your vessel. A restart also helps.

Stopping time warping did not stop the acceleration. Haven\u0027t checked if all vessels where affected.

When i a had an intersection with the ground i killed the thrust with x, switched to another vessel, perfomed a manoeuver, then switched to orbit view to view the outcome.
