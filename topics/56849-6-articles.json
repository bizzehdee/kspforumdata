Something culturally wrong will always be found with a game. KSP has humanoid creatures that only remotely resemble humans but it doesn\u0027t matter because users want the characters to reflect their biology and social structures. Where the KSP creators went wrong is with making the kerbal a little too human like. Sure the body proportions are way off. Giant heads with no ears, lips or noses. Big mouths and what looks like only two teeth. Big poppy eyes with no eyebrows, eyelids or eye lashes. Only three fingers without fingernails. To top it off they are green. You know like little green men from space. Not really human at all but it doesn\u0027t matter because for some people it\u0027s really important that the kerbals mimic human social standards and biology.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadweasel","CreatedById":23123,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T19:18:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust looking back on the general trend of discussions in this thread, I think it\u0027s fairly obvious why SQUAD refuse to officially assign genders to the kerbals, and given the mouth-frothing that\u0027s trending over feminism in other games right now, I can\u0027t say I blame them.

See, this whole discussion is being based on the assumption that all kerbals are currently male, when the only possible point of reference that anybody has to go by is their names, which sound mostly male in context with HUMAN naming conventions. The fact is, though, that there are many names in the database that could just as easily be perceived as female.

Sure, I\u0027d like to see a little variation in terms of hair or skin tone or the like, but fretting over gender is both pointless and redundant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf a kerbal can be viewed as male based on name alone, the same can be done for the opposite gender as well.
