As an easter egg it is cool little place, but wouldn\u0027t be great to be able to use it? Like every time we start a new game that there is a third option on the menu that allows you to choose between the classic KSC and the second KSC. Not only would it be a nice change in the environment, it would also provide its own challenges since it is surrounded by mountains that airplanes and returning spacecraft can crash into.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bessy","CreatedById":30538,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-08T22:34:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Emaybe choosing where your space center is placed on the planet might be even better rather than just choosing out of the 2 perhaps u get to drag and drop your center anywhere on kerbin ... im sure it wouldnt be too hard for the devs to make u able have this feature with it all being 1 instance now\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iStickyDuck","CreatedById":75908,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-09T15:19:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis would be cool, but I think you should be able to snap the space center to the equator so that it\u0027s easier to launch into an equatorial orbit\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-09T15:36:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSC1 is already on the equator. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be sorta nice to have KSC2 for launching things into different kinds of orbit, though!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-09T21:56:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI feel the idea of having secondary launch (and landing spots) should be a serious consideration. KSC 2 for starters would be a nice place holder as a secondary launch and landing facility. I personally do not know how much work would be involved to make multiple launch pads around Kerbin. But i know making multiple functional landing strips should be much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel adding more than two, all with their own unique graphics should be a good thing to add before the game is released. The airfield is already a form of another KSC, with only landing facilities. With the addition of budgets and the ability to recover parts, landing facilities should become more abundant. Which would add multiple levels of new game play with just additions of more landing strips. (Airports anyone?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus the addition of new code to support multiple \u0022KSC\u0022s would help support modders who want to implement MORE launch sites and landing strips. All in all the addition of a secondary KSC would open up many doors, from game play implications to modding implications. Best part is it isn\u0027t attached to any other updates, adding it would be a task but the models are already there (use old KSC models as placeholders) but it could easily be done in the background of other updates when there is spare time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-09T22:16:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy would landing strips be any easier than launch pads?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KaBob","CreatedById":89839,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-09T22:21:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d love to be able to actually spend my hard earned contract money to build launch pads/etc in a variety of locations on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-09T22:30:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhy would landing strips be any easier than launch pads?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStrict landing strips already exist. The secondary landing strip at the original KSC is already labeled as THE landing strip. The game already recognizes there is something on ONE of the strips, just not which one and recovers it. A strict landing strip for landing only, only takes a new biome to be implemented(or a generic change to the original landing strip biome) and consideration in the recover mechanism for budgets.
