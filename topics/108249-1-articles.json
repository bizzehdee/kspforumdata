My first sat. attempt to orbit the moon failed, and has since been escaping to a sun orbit with no propulsion. It was a good 4-6 million miles away(if I recall properly) when I selected it from tracking to see if I could get any deep space data from it. When I clicked to fly it it took me to proper screen, but I instantly shot up to around 7324856435724582349246557289459234923462645629067m/s and watched as the whole system vanished to a speck. I attempted to return to mission control, when I did, the typical money/rep/science bars were at the top along with the time meter on the bottom, but the center was still the view of space. It locked up, I had to shut it down from program manager. When I reloaded, all my satellites are gone...including poor Jeb. The only remaining vessel is the Kerbal I have landed on Minmus. All other stats/money/science is still there, and it appears I could continue on...which is fine. But, I figure if this can help by reporting it, I should.

The exact trigger isn\u0027t known, but when it happens it often eats the ship completely (and sometimes the save). Hopefully you have a quicksave from sometime recent. If you do, then you can copy it and rename it persistence.sfs (to replace the existing persistence).
