Mod makers do not know whether it is worth continuing their effort if they do not receive feedback. I\u0027m glad it\u0027s working well for you.\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DeltaPavonis\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DeltaPavonis\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, yeah, no real questions. I\u0027d personally like to request a text field so I can manually input the sensitivity percentage in a later version though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EThat is on my to-do list, as I think I might have mentioned either here or in the development thread. However, it is not very high on the list as engine gimbal support will stay at the top until it is done.\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kaldak\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kaldak\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EVery nice mod. The balancing capabilities are impressive. I just wanted to mention that having a KerbCom Avionics part on my plane causes Firespitter propeller animations to not play. The propellers still work, I just can\u0027t see them spinning. Perhaps related to the RCS bug?\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EI have not tested with Firespitter parts yet, but I can think of a particular reason why that would happen, and it is not related to the RCS bug. I will look into it. Thanks for the heads up.\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kaldak\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kaldak\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it\u0027d be great if there was a way to save the settings on a given vehicle. Perhaps it could be done similar to how B9\u0027s vtol engines can be setup from the screen where you edit action groups?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep up the good work!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EThat is exactly what I am planning (both the settings editor and the \u0022good work\u0022). However, as above, my priority is engine gimbal support right now.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZRM","CreatedById":64626,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-05T10:15:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat does everyone think about the possible release of this mod on Spaceport?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am concerned that, judging from several comments on other mods where users just don\u0027t follow the installation instructions, the mean competence levels of users there may not be high enough to install and use the mod correctly, resulting in a bad rating.
