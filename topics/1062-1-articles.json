Tried a couple different variations, but I was successful with this, though I had to use a medium LFR to do it once the SRBs burned out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see I let it run for almost 2 hours and it\u0027s in a 319.8-322.1 altitude orbit\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Douglasdtlltd","CreatedById":4099,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-26T14:07:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe need better balancing configurations. \u0026gt;_\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
