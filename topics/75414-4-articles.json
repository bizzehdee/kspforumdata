The issue is that that sort of occlusion has approximately nothing to do with real aerodynamics, until you get into hypersonic speeds. That means results are just as counter-intuitive as KSP\u0027s model, with a side bonus of \u0022no aerodynamic stabilization at low speeds\u0022 (making planes near-unworkable), and plenty of places where real aircraft should see lift but the occlusion model thinks they don\u0027t (e.g. vertical stabilizers get blocked by the airframe at very low angles of attack, when real aircraft obviously don\u0027t have that happen). Furthermore, it is not simple for the computer to check these things, so it\u0027s not a lightweight aero system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny remotely sensible aero system has to implement lift and drag as related quantities; if not, it\u0027s a horrible system.
