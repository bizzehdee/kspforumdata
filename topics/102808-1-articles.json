And after analyzing rules I found perfect possibilities for it - first launch, completely free from mass restrictions. And I was really pushed up and took additional inspiration from [DBowman\u0027s mission Dash 4 Duna](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112640-Dash-4-Duna-Duna-Permanent-Outpost-Mission-Architecture-Challenge)\n\nSecond: I decided don\u0027t raise up resources from Kerbin if you can take these resources in space or recycle it. Kethane for extracting fuel and recyclers for life support (I am using TAC Life Support mod)\n\nThird: maximum re usability of launched equipment: only 2 tugs for moving things from Kerbin to Dune and back. Only 2 return ships for executing rotations of kerbonauts\n\nFourth: Safety is not our choice, no return vehicles and Dune shuttles until these things really need for return\n\nAnd finally let me introduce my big rocket for this mission \u0022Zhar-ptitsa\u0022 (fire-bird in English).\n\nRated for **160t** payload (100x100 km orbit) \n\nVehicle mass: 739 t \n\nDetails: 78\n\nStages: 2 \n\n1-st stage mass: 493 t (percent of launch vehicle mass 67%)\n\n2-st stage mass: 246 t \n\nInterval between launches: 240 days \n\nReusable first stage (soft landing on the water near KSC with parachutes and basic jets engines) \n\nFirst stage dry (landing) mass ~100t \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Undock tug and move it to Minmus surface\n\n2. Tug refuel on Minmus\n\n3. Tug move back to Kerbin orbit, dock with payload and move it to Minmus orbit\n\n4. Tug undock, refuel, return to Minmus orbit and dock with payload\n\n5. Tug and payload escape Minmus SOI and move to high Kerbin orbit (50000x50000 km)\n\nFor third expedition items 1, 2 not applicable, because tug already will wait on LKO for payload (refueling on Minmus after Dune-\u003EKerbin trip)\n\nReturn ships should start direct from base orbit with already refueled tug.\n\nIn Dune system tug use Ike for refueling and tug also refuel Dune shuttle on Dune orbit.\n\nUntil Day 0500: 3 Launches, 480 tons on LKO, Early Mission Value = **18816** Efficiency = **39.2** (thanks DBowman for pointing about this my miscalculations)\n\nUntil Day 1000: 5 Launches, 800 tons on LKO, Sustained Mission Value = **65088** Efficiency = **81.36**\n\n**Achievements Score = 6** (Mission Execution 0, Crew Mobility 2, Base Mobility 2, Crew Safety 0, Mission Robustness 2)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nHere is mobile home for 8 kerbonauts for years on Dune surface. Self landing, self sustained for O2 and water, you need only deliver food with replacement crew.\n\nFor recycling I used Sabatier Recycler and Water Purifier, with these two devices make unlimited autonomy by O2 and water. Also base has enough food for all mission (1138 days). 3 first launches include 4 bases with 8 kerbonauts in each (total 32). Also each launch with bases has emergency O2 and water supply for 300 days for 8 kerbonauts. 300 days is enough to return to Kerbin in case of problems with one set of recyclers or stay on Dune surface until next launch deliver new mobile base or more O2 and water.\n\n**Short stats:**\n\nMass: 27.86 t\n\nDetails: 48 \n\nLanding: 48-7S\u00C3\u2018\u00E2\u20AC\u00A64 engines \u002B parachute \n\nNominal crew: 8 \n\nMaximum crew: 16 \n\n![nUndebW.png](http://i.imgur.com/nUndebW.png)\n\nSelf landing emergency supply:\n\n![vUMI7Orh.png](http://i.imgur.com/vUMI7Orh.png)\n\n[More pictures](http://imgur.com/a/I2xul#0)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-31T01:39:13Z\u0022 title=\u002203/31/2015 01:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mesklin**"},{"CreatedByName":"DBowman","CreatedById":122106,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T04:29:29Z","Content":"Mesklin,\n\nI really like the engineering on your mobile base, very neat and compact.
