Everyone lifts their phones so they can catch the action happening so they can post it, yet nobody actually shows an emotional effect from what is going on. In other points, people are simply ignoring the world falling down around them. The real world is taking a back seat to our social interaction in some cases. It may not be a MASS problem, but it is there none-the-less. We see so much on our social media, that when something catastrophic actually is in the process of happening, we are just as likely to take out our phones and start recording as we are to actually intervene, simply because we begin to see such things as \u0022normal\u0022 since we have seen it over and over again.
