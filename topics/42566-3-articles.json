Musk boasts an eventual turnaround time from launch to launch of the re-usable first stages of 10 days. 30 launches per year would be incredible and if you\u0027re saving $30 million per launch by re-using them, the savings start to add up pretty quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"koshelenkovv","CreatedById":53764,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T22:06:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBut even assuming SpaceX has this problem sorted (which remains to be seen), I still wonder why they don\u0027t use parachutes.

But skydivers don\u0027t tend to have triple-redundancy on their parachutes - maybe a reserve in case the first fails to deploy, but even the Orion uses a triple-chute system like they did in the Apollo days. It can make it down on two, or even one - but you\u0027re tripling that weight for safety.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I think the heavier your descent payload, the greater your need for that redundancy. Not because it falls faster (it obviously doesn\u0027t), but strictly for structural reasons. That\u0027s why it\u0027s not simply a matter of scaling it relative to a skydiver.
