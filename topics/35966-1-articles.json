Either by importing them into Blender or anyway else. The only reason I ask is that I grew up with AutoCad and I\u0027m pretty good with it (also my old man buys the corporate version on a regular basis, so I always have a copy available to me). Given, it\u0027s been nearly a decade since I\u0027ve used it in any major respect, but I still remember the basics. That being said, this is also out of laziness, since I just got Blender and in my current state I don\u0027t have the patience to learn how to use it. I spent a good two hours with it and got nowhere. What can I say? It seems easy enough, but I just don\u0027t like the interface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically I\u0027m asking if I can model in AC and fine tune in Blender.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I just realized that this is probably the wrong forum (I\u0027m guessing either Modeling and Texturing or Plugin Development), so I that\u0027s the case, please move my thread mods.

If you have access to a full Autodesk suite of some kind, your better options are 3ds Max or Inventor. If not, go ahead and learn Blender. I\u0027m an architecture student, so I have a copy of Building Design Suite Ultimate. I use Inventor to build everything that comes out of my 3D printer. AutoCAD is really reserved for 2D design drafting now with the switch to Revit and other BIM software.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, since you\u0027re a bit rusty on CAD, go ahead and save yourself the design headaches and start learning Inventor, 3ds Max, Blender, or Rhino.

Long story short, I\u0027ve had a copy of it since before a P133 chip was top of the line. I did a tech-design class my last year of high school and finished the whole semester\u0027s curriculum in two weeks.

The amount of work required to draft the initial geometry in AutoCAD, import into Blender and optimize it/fix mesh errors in far, far greater compared with just natively working in Blender alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are numerous Blender tutorials on the \u0027net, and personally it took me around three months to learn Blender from scratch at a very leisurely pace - I can now fairly easily make complex geometries and UV unwrap texture maps all by myself (I\u0027m less competent in making the actual textures match the SQUAD aesthetic, but that\u0027s probably a Photoshop-related skillset).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nothke","CreatedById":51185,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-05T08:48:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn common sense: AutoCAD is a parametric (CAD) modeler, it looks at objects as primitives mathematical objects and not as a bunch of faces like the mesh modeling software.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make a model for a game, you need to think like a face!

I\u0027m going to give Blender another go, seeing as it seems to have a knowledgeable and fairly dense userbase. Given as I already have the program, I will probably use basic designs in AutoCad to figure out scaling issues (I\u0027m currently starting work on the Hunter-Gratzner from Pitch Black, which has surprisingly little detail on it\u0027s size specifications), and get a basic layout before I start modeling in Blender. Perhaps once I get more comfortable with Blender, perhaps I will use it for all this, but given that I found on this was an interview with it\u0027s creator (the model used for the movie was 9\u0027 @ 1/36th scale), I ended up with an approx. size of 100m (324\u0027), which I figured would have to be scaled down, which for me is currently easier in AC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, to all those who replied, thanks for the support. Also, @DYJ, I may take you up on that offer if I continue to struggle with Blender, although a touch of sobriety may aid me just as well (at least as far as last night\u0027s first attempt).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-05T18:30:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo answer the original question, I believe unity does supporting importing dxf format so autocad should be usable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"King Jareth","CreatedById":63223,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-05T20:41:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI started off making models in autocad (I\u0027ve used it for 15 years) and importing them into Blender.

Although some of the camera controls still trip me up (gotta stop right-clicking to pan the camera), all in all it\u0027s starting to grow on me, and it\u0027s safe to say I\u0027ve got the basics down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn top of that, I found a tiny little program called \u0027ImageJ\u0027 that allows me to get fairly accurate measurements off plain old jpegs so long as you have at least some info and preferably one good profile view.

Secondly, if you look at it\u0027s design, the two cargo holds are very simple designs and are basically the same, the third has shown me how to replace pieces I\u0027ve cut out, as well as the mirror modifier. I haven\u0027t started on any more of it, but the fourth and fifth cargo modules are increasingly more complex. Then you have engine module and the cockpit, which is a myriad of shapes that have to be precisely placed.
