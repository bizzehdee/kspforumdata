A synchronous orbit is any orbit with a period equal to the planet\u0027s rotation, a synchronous orbit is the one that has fixed semi-major axis but the peri/apoapsis can vary within the bounds of that defined semi-major axis.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-19T20:40:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EArgh.
