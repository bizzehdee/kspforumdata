That\u0027s not little - many games don\u0027t offer that much. But KSP in my opinion has much better potential.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy opinion is, the career mode is taken from the wrong end. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe science should not be the \u0022currency\u0022 for which you buy technology. You need a LOT of technology to reach the nearest planets, and you need only a little more to reach them all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead, science should be the goal, the driver of the story. The game should in my opinion support what many have been doing in the sandbox mode for a long time already, i.e. support discovery, not grind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea how the career mode should work is about this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- general scientific basis is okay, i.e. your progress is given by doing research at certain locations\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- as you do research, not technology but more research areas open to you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- technology is there only to support you getting to the place and yes, you are getting piece of technology here and there but not directly proportional to amount of science you made. The game should just make sure you always have enough technology to advance your research further\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the start, only Kerbin and its atmosphere are open to you. You are not allowed to exceed 70 km above Kerbin. You get some basic science tools (thermometer) and are sent to do research. You can also pick up samples and make reports. You get also some basic technology, at the start I would even suggest that it should allow you to build a simple plane rather than a rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter you do some research, pick up samples of soil around KSP, measure temperatures and write some reports, you get some rocket parts and you are allowed to do research in Kerbin orbit. The Kerbin SOI opens to you, but you are not allowed to exit it, or to enter SOI of moons. If you break any of such rules the mission is ended and you get no science points from it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter some research in space, you are allowed to enter Mun SOI, but not to land. Then you get permission to enter Minmus SOI. Then landing on Minmus, then landing on Mun. Then you are first allowed to go interplanetary, but only for unmanned probes. And so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere could be a tree of scientific achievements opening further research/entry permissions. For instance to open orbital research, you need to research atmosphere (physics) and mountains (minerals/materials). Research in Kerbin arctic zones may be necessary to open research on Vall or Eeloo. And your technology will always advance sufficiently to allow you to do the research you have just uncovered. Different research parts may even enable you the same technology if it is necessary to do that research. Combining multiple paths may give you more technology and make your research in each of them easier but it should not prevent you doing it \u0022depth-first\u0022 style. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen near the bottom of the research tree, technology rewards for research should be mostly cosmetic, such as additional sizes of wheels or items not introduced to the game yet which are not necessary to finish missions but can be used to make ships prettier. But it should be always clear that the goal, the tree you are looking at is not a tree of ship parts, but the tree of scientific research which you need to finish on all Kerbol bodies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-19T11:42:09Z\u0022 title=\u002210/19/2013 11:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Kasuha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T11:48:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWatch out though, career mode != tech tree.

That\u0027s not little - many games don\u0027t offer that much. But KSP in my opinion has much better potential.\u003Cp\u003EMy opinion is, the career mode is taken from the wrong end. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe science should not be the \u0022currency\u0022 for which you buy technology. You need a LOT of technology to reach the nearest planets, and you need only a little more to reach them all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead, science should be the goal, the driver of the story. The game should in my opinion support what many have been doing in the sandbox mode for a long time already, i.e. support discovery, not grind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea how the career mode should work is about this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- general scientific basis is okay, i.e. your progress is given by doing research at certain locations\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- as you do research, not technology but more research areas open to you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- technology is there only to support you getting to the place and yes, you are getting piece of technology here and there but not directly proportional to amount of science you made. The game should just make sure you always have enough technology to advance your research further\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the start, only Kerbin and its atmosphere are open to you. You are not allowed to exceed 70 km above Kerbin. You get some basic science tools (thermometer) and are sent to do research. You can also pick up samples and make reports. You get also some basic technology, at the start I would even suggest that it should allow you to build a simple plane rather than a rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter you do some research, pick up samples of soil around KSP, measure temperatures and write some reports, you get some rocket parts and you are allowed to do research in Kerbin orbit. The Kerbin SOI opens to you, but you are not allowed to exit it, or to enter SOI of moons. If you break any of such rules the mission is ended and you get no science points from it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter some research in space, you are allowed to enter Mun SOI, but not to land. Then you get permission to enter Minmus SOI. Then landing on Minmus, then landing on Mun. Then you are first allowed to go interplanetary, but only for unmanned probes. And so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere could be a tree of scientific achievements opening further research/entry permissions. For instance to open orbital research, you need to research atmosphere (physics) and mountains (minerals/materials). Research in Kerbin arctic zones may be necessary to open research on Vall or Eeloo. And your technology will always advance sufficiently to allow you to do the research you have just uncovered. Different research parts may even enable you the same technology if it is necessary to do that research. Combining multiple paths may give you more technology and make your research in each of them easier but it should not prevent you doing it \u0022depth-first\u0022 style. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen near the bottom of the research tree, technology rewards for research should be mostly cosmetic, such as additional sizes of wheels or items not introduced to the game yet which are not necessary to finish missions but can be used to make ships prettier. But it should be always clear that the goal, the tree you are looking at is not a tree of ship parts, but the tree of scientific research which you need to finish on all Kerbol bodies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think you are overlooking the fact that the career mode is only about testing the science gathering mechanic at the moment. Once credits are introduced you will be limited to only a set amount of parts because of your funding. This funding will only allow you to travel so far because of the price of each piece on your ship. People won\u0027t be able to strap 5 pods and 20 boosters onto their ship after 1 or 2 launches to hit the outer planets. (That is if they implement the credits correctly.) I am hoping funding will be the main grind of the game instead of \u0022asking permission\u0022 to go to other planets.
