There are some exceptions, NMS, FFXIV, and the rebound of Cyberpunk, but the average game doesn\u0027t get a second chance. I only hope that the release cadence steps up to at least bi-weekly updates and that the project strives towards the goal no matter what with fixes, optimizations, content and features. I want to see KSP 2 succeed. I also agree that this first patch will set the stage, hence we\u0027re more than likely not going to see it this week.

By then it was already considered a meme by how bad it performed, looked and how the original Arma 2 Mod was still many ways better than the Standalone, even 4 years after it\u0027s appeareance.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn 2015-16, Bohemia decided to start porting DayZ Standalone to their new In-house \u0022Enfusion\u0022 engine behind the curtains, while continuing to develop the legacy branch of the game so the playerbase wouldn\u0027t become unhappy and bored. All because the original Arma 2 engine was a complete mess and would\u0027ve led to the game\u0027s inevitable death.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nDayZ left Early Access in 2018 in a 1.0 version that was completely barebones and lacking feature parity with the last version of the legacy branch (0.62).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n5 years after the infamous 1.0 release, DayZ has released over 20 huge feature updates that have made the game resurge and explode in popularity, breaking its own concurrent player counts on Steam,\u003Ca href=\u0022https://steamcharts.com/app/221100#All\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E last one being last month \u003C/a\u003E, and that\u0027s not counting console activity.
