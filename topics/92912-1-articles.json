That makes absolutely no sense to me. Mostly because the only thing I\u0027d ever see as a spoiler in KSP anymore would be if they added new planets. I\u0027d want to get there and land there myself, before watching someone else do it. But with anything else, I don\u0027t see it as a spoiler, since it doesn\u0027t spoil my experience of the game to know things ahead of time.
