The launch gone normally. But when i tried to reenter, first the parachute is rapidly disassembled (Just under 60km) and shortly after the ablator burns out and Boctok burns due to extreme overheat. I tried PE 40km, 50km, and 60km but it always burns in the atmosphere killing the crew about 55km above the sea level. How should i reenter with an ablative ball that has an exposed parachute that isn\u0027t ablative?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
