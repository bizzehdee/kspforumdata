After this, I constantly turned over at 90 degrees, keeping pointed on the leftmost edge of the *GREEN* flight direction circle. After my apopsis bit around 50km, I flipped over completely horizontal and burned until it was over 70km. Then, I cut engines and waited until just before periapsis and burned the rest of my fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome pictures follow. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img441.imageshack.us/img441/1065/26km.png\u0022 alt=\u002226km.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img269.imageshack.us/img269/9779/37km.png\u0022 alt=\u002237km.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd we made it!
