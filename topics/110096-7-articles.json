Yeah, certainly they are gaining a lot of respect for each other and learning to work as a team. As far as getting CLOSER closer--ehh, I think I am not going to bring romance into my Kerbalverse. Friendship, yes--indeed, very strong friendship--but I am not going t*here*. I like to think of Kerbals as being very technologically advanced children, so that just wouldn\u0027t do.\n\nGlad you like the shots. I\u0027m doing my best to provide a variety, and praise be to the game designers for all the attention they paid to the interior and exterior spaces of the craft. I only wish you could see into the cockpit from outside, I could do a lot with that! I guess the other camera angle that\u0027s missing would be a controllable \u0022dashcam\u0022 shot; we can\u0027t ever see Jeb or Val from the front except for in the little windows shown during exterior view. I suppose it could work to put one of them in the back seat and pretend it\u0027s the front... I might be able to do some editing to make it look good.\n\nBTW, you guys would not believe what I go through to make sure everyone gets back to their assigned seat after a team EVA. Somehow I never manage to board them in the right order on the first try, or the second... but I know that if they sit in the wrong places you\u0027re going to see the wrong color balloon come from the wrong place and it\u0027ll give you headaches.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-11T19:30:30Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2015 07:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kuzzter**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T19:03:01Z","Content":"![sYyft4u.png](http://i.imgur.com/sYyft4u.png)\n\n![F3uaRP6.png](http://i.imgur.com/F3uaRP6.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"waterlubber","CreatedById":119333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T21:16:18Z","Content":"Meep?

Never been too interested in RT but I could go for a mod that takes transmission time into account; that is, if you are controlling a probe a light-minute away from Kerbin it takes one minute for any commands you send to be executed. You would control the probe by plotting a maneuver node, and provided the node was far enough in the future it would do the burn as programmed when it reached the correct point--timing the burn half before/half after the node. You could send an \u0022abort\u0022 command and plot a new node if things went wrong, but the probe wouldn\u0027t get your signal right away. And you\u0027d have the option to control a probe from any nearby crewed ship in real time.\n\nAnyway, that\u0027s how I would want it to work but my programming skills do not rise near that level."}]}
