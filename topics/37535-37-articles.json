Real life did get in the way.

Be aware that most of the fuel/resource load is not set up yet. For example, the shuttle itself does not actually contain any fuel yet. I just test it once in orbit with infinite fuel and infinite RCS enabled. Part masses will need to be tweaked to compensate when fuel is added, so it should still behave the same as it does now on reentry and landing. We will also need to decide about electricity usage, for example making the MFDs and cockpit lighting require electricity to function. I will also be sending you the NAV mode prototype. ENG mode is in the works, and I\u0027m adding useful things like remaining delta-V, ETA to MECO, etc. After doing a bit of research, I found that the real shuttle used the same fuel (MMH/NTO) for its OMS and its RCS.
