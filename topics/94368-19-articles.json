(Say, set stage 0 or 1, and it looks only at those).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a work around, perhaps you should design a deorbit stage into your vehicle. A small extra fuel tank with a tiny amount of fuel. Use your normal stage to get into a low orbit and circularize. Then de-orbit, blow the stage, and use the \u0027final\u0027 stage to make a correction burn, then dump it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, be aware of how much ejection force a decoupler has.
