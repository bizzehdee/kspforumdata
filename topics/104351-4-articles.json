I think for gameplay\u0027s sake it is best to have the MK-2 fuselage and similar stuff heat shielded, same with many cockpits. The new heat shields are neat, but they arent exactly useable for most of my builds, since well, i tend to make SSTOs and aircraft (a giant circle would look funny on a plane).\n\nStill, im quite happy with whats been done sofar, especially the performance improvements.\n\nQuestion about resources: can the ore be made into just LFO, or can i say pull xenon out of it (xenon would be neat as i can not only have 20000 dV, but also have that replenisheable).\n\nHopefully jets dont get nerfed to the point that they are barely superior to rockets, i kinda enjoyed the whole suborbital on just a single jet engine."},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T01:18:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Did anyone catch the part about ore just being all-purpose for now?

There\u0027s just one stock resource, Ore, that is multi functional. Up to you to add and change things around to be able to mine and convert LOX into breathable air. By all accounts, it\u0027s trivial to do so, can probably expect such a mod within a day or so of 1.0 release.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Yeah, but a quote by Maxmaps made it sound like Squad themselves had more plans for it. \u0022Ore is the building block of something larger we shall work for in the future... ore will do a lot of stuff in the future, but for now ore gets turned into anything you desire.\u0022\n\nI do remember Max saying that maaaaaaybe Engineers will be able to build stuff outside of the VAB.."},{"CreatedByName":"Aragosnat","CreatedById":60487,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T01:19:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Did anyone catch the part about ore just being all-purpose for now?
