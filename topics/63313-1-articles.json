Each outer tank should give fuel to only one inner one since looping fuel flow is unpredictable and usually leads to imbalances.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anton P.

For extra stability, though, I\u0027d recommend putting the fuel lines from the bottom tank of each booster so that the top tanks in each booster drain first. Fuel flow logic, so far as I\u0027ve gathered, takes fuel from as far away from the engine as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -- Steve\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Navy2k","CreatedById":95246,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-16T02:10:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThats not what i experienced (Inner topmost tank looses fuel while there still was some in the boosters). But then again the constellation was a lot more complex than my example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe information about trying so get the further away fuel first is worth looking into it.
