I\u0027ve been a lurker of the various KSP forums (reddit and here) for quite a while now, but decided with 1.0 that I should get more active in this wonderful community. So, with my first post to these forums I present a small .cfg file tweak I\u0027ve created that adds a \u0027ThermalPaint\u0027 resource that you can add to any part by right-clicking the part within the VAB or SPH and using the appropriate slider. Adding more helps with re-entry heating and high-speed atmospheric travel heating, but it does weight quite a lot. The resource itself is a clone of the \u0027ablator\u0027 resource used in heatshields but I\u0027m working on editing the various numbers to fine-tune heating effects. This does not make your vessel immune to heating, just adds a little more durability.\n\nPlease let me know of any suggestions or issues! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n[Download available via Curseforge.](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/230860-tps-t)\n\nEdit:\n\nhere\u0027s a link to the license I selected on curseforge, GNU GPLv3.

This has to do with FuelSwitch structure.
