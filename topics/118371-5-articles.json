Yeah, I spotted the issue with ungrounded wheels. I considered fixing it, but I\u0027m not sure if everyone would be happy about a sound mod that changed their game physics. I think it\u0027s a great example of the strength of sound as an extra information stream. The wheel spinning is something that happens in stock that you might not notice beyond having your power drained to no effect, but the sounds leave you with no doubt as to what\u0027s happening. It also highlights that wheels never lose speed to bearing friction when left spinning without ground contact. \n\nGiven the amount of work that was put into wheels for Unity 5, and the fact that Squad mentioned they had many sound effects ready for use in the game for a long time now, I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if we get wheels with sounds in stock in future.\n\nWith CollisionFX, yes, the light is too bright right now, and it annoys me every time I see it in a screenshot. It\u0027ll have to be adjusted and made configurable in the next release, which will also be bringing customisable dust colours for all biomes on all bodies.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E This mod is what I have been waiting for since I made my first space station.

I\u0027m hoping it can give Squad and everyone else a feel for what a more in-depth IVA could be, and let them see what works, what doesn\u0027t work, and what ideas this could be used as a foundation for. This thread is full of these ideas and has made for a very interesting read.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E As an idea for the gameplay mechanic, would it be possible to only be able to use the WASDQE etc keys whilst at or near the part model?

KSP has broken new ground for making real-world orbital physics accessible and fun, and I\u0027d like to see how the same could be done for movement inside a space station. I spent a lot of time figuring out how to get the free mouse movement working for just this reason. It\u0027ll be interesting to see what kind of a balance can be struck between fun, performance (colliders for each part you want to bounce from), and gameplay (\u0022Game Over: All your crew members are stuck floating away from walls/at the bottom of the craft due to Eve\u0027s gravity\u0022).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Dangit, you stole part of MY idea for an IVA mod.

All that needs to be done now is to create a simple 2D mesh for the square hatches and add some configuration file options to allow people to choose which one to use.

This is important for setting up the hatch shader and interacting with parts. To do this, we can leverage the parts\u0027 colliders. A collider an invisible 3D model which objects use for physics interactions. The more detailed a collider is, the slower the physics calculations for it are, so colliders are usually less detailed than an object\u0027s graphical model:\n\n![class-BoxCollider-2.jpg](http://docs.unity3d.com/412/Documentation/Images/manual/class-BoxCollider-2.jpg)\n\nFor a very quick check against a collider, we can use the collider\u0027s bounds. This is a box that collider fits inside which is an even simpler and faster shape to evaluate with than KSP\u0027s cylindrical and conical parts. We can use it to rule out most of the parts on the craft as containing the player. The bounds cover a larger area than the part itself, so it\u0027s possible for multiple parts to overlap, particularly when you\u0027re near the point where two parts connect. As we can\u0027t be in more than one part at the same time, we have more work to do.\n\nAfter using the bounds method to narrow down the number of potential parts we could be inside, a slower and more accurate method can be used to determine the final result. Due to all KSP requiring parts to only use convex colliders, we can raycast from the player\u0027s position to the centre of the collider to determine whether we are inside it or not. If the ray hits the collider, we are outside the collider. If it hits it, we are inside. Were KSP to use concave colliders, we could take extra steps to find our result:\n\n![klucXUs.png](http://i.imgur.com/klucXUs.png)\n\nNow that we know what part we\u0027re in, we can use that information to better interact with that part.
