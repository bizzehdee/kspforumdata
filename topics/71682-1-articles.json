This test is so difficult that only it can be done by devoting all the resources we have into this task. To make this work some every day problems right now happening will have to be solved. Ultimately this means a world without wars, money, hunger/thirst and without all other problems people on this planet have everyday. Such a society could devote all resources into one goal and that alone. The only thing of value in such a world is knowledge. Just because of this i also think we won\u0027t have to fear E.T.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntelligent life that has not mastered this ultimate test will hardly pose a threat to one that had. Also every civilization that mastered this test will have no bad feelings toward other civilizations whether they travel already to other stars or not. Because the only thing that matters at last is knowledge. There is a high probability that there will be an cultural exchange between such inhabitants of the universe. At the end either we will change our lifes and start changing towards this goal or we continue to destroy our home planet and the inhabitants of it and fail the ultimate test which was assigned to us by the universe itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs the Milky Way the limit we could explore as a race?

Depending on the technology used it becomes a progressively \u0027easier\u0027 thing for smaller groups to do. Imagine for example, two technologies. One is clones that can be grown to near-adult in machine wombs, the other is the ability to copy and past one humans mind into anothers body. Should we get both of these technologies, then all one needs to do to colonize another star system is to build a ship whose electronics can survive the journey (a \u0027difficult\u0027 task, but primarily one that is solved with money. We currently have no need [or generally speaking, desire] for a computer that can last 10,000\u002B years and operate fine, therefor nobody bothers to research one.) loaded up with a bunch (or even just several) of mind copies, a load of different recorded genetic strands. Your probe gets there, spits out a few clones with pasted humans, they use some of the equipment on board to set up a base, more humans get made, eventually you end up having second generation, etc. If we had those techs, then it is something a billionaire could finance if they really wanted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes I get that right now those techs slightly fall under magical levels, however the point was to show that a utopian society/world is not actually required for star system colonization. Would it help? Possibly, it debatedly could even hurt the chances of a colony. After all, if humans were in perfect lock-step with each other on decisions, then we likely would say \u0022Hey! There will shortly be too many of us for the planet to support! Let\u0027s cut down the birth rate!\u0022 and suddenly you have population under control. If you no longer have an ever growing population, you no longer have a need to set up a self-sustaining colony. Sure, people and groups would ever want to go to Mars and beyond, but I doubt the rest of the world governing system would feel it was worth the investment, so again it comes down to citizens with the ability to just make it happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, depending on how space tech develops in the coming hundred\u002B years, it is entirely possible that reaching other stars is a trivial task. Given that we don\u0027t know everything about physics, what if (admittedly a bit of a strawman argument, but it makes a point) we find out that around the orbit of pluto there are wormholes linking the solar system to its nearest neighbors, and that all the stars are connected this way? Suddenly the task of getting to another star isn\u0027t so insurmountable, it\u0027s just a matter of reaching the edge of the solar system, no epic 10,000\u002B year voyages required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etldr: It\u0027s a nice thought, but ultimately unnecessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor your actual questions though, mostly just money. Money for infrastructure, money for tech, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course we will! Even if we become the utopian idea that you outline there, if we come across other alien civlizations, there is no guarentee that they are as developed. If, as you posit, the utopian idea is what is required to reach the point where you can colonize another solar system, then the fact that these people are still on their planet (assuming they are) should force you to treat contact with them carefully as they theoretically have not yet gone utopian.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd of course not!

My inclination, and I\u0027m no expert (but I have done a little bit of research into futurism), is that due to increases in technology, a human who survives to the end of this century will be able to live until the end of the millenium and beyond. I also suspect that as we progress, we will end up merged with our technology (not in a freaky borg way, or even a starwars way, more like a cool way in some of those halo books that led up to halo 4, or Orson Scott Card\u0027s Homecoming series). If we don\u0027t need any resource but electricity to survive, and if we can gain that electricity simply from our movements, we don\u0027t have much in the way of life support to worry about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for a utopia, I don\u0027t think any sort of human utopia is tenable. Maybe once we are smarter (and therefore more logical and pragmatic) due to our technologcal merger, we might stop fighting because we realize cooperation is more beneficial. Perhaps we\u0027ll even end up as some sort ofinterdependent hive mind civilization (those come up quite a bit in scifi that I\u0027ve read, actually--evidently fictional humans embrace that sort of thing), but then we run into the question of what makes us human, and is progress worth whatever steps we need to take to achieve it. Anyways, as we are now, there will always be war, stemming largely from our ability to dehumanize others who have what we want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for aliens, I\u0027m torn between whether or not we\u0027ll be more or less advanced as whatever other civilizations we\u0027ll inevitably encounter. On the one hand, there\u0027s been 13.7 billion years for another civilization to develop and progress, and there\u0027s a lot of space for them to have developed. On the other hand, It took nearly 4.5 billion years for our planet to develop to the point it had an intelligent civilization (and I\u0027m assuming that should we develop to the point where we\u0027re interstellar, it will only take a few thousand years or so), which is a sizeable portion of the history of the known universe. It depends on how likely it is for life to develop on any given planet, but thanks to kepler, we can extrapolate that there are several millions of earths out in our galaxy, so its possible there is a lot of life out there. I suspect we\u0027d need to go through a few generations of star formation and supernovae before we had the right materials for complex life (at least as we know it) to form, so, even accounting for the decreased lifespan of super-massive stars, we could be in only the second or third (maybe even first) generation of stars that can support complex life. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll that to say, I believe that its very possible we could be the most advanced civilization we encounter in our galaxy, or at least top 5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for extragalactic colonization, due to the exponential nature of population growth, I suspect that by the time we are expanding enough to even think about travelling to other galaxies, it will go much faster to colonize than the milky way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-08T07:22:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA test for who and by whom ?

With the current exception of the FTL side of things these other two problems are simply a matter of scale really. Communications technology is easy. We already CAN talk with stars 10\u002B light years away if we want to. Technically we can talk a lot further, but the conversation is boring. Light hugging starships are admittedly a bit harder, but they really are not a challenge that requires all of humanity to join hands with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a wonderful example of how we could construct a light hugger that could get fairly close to light speed. Microwave laser assisted solar sail craft. Set up a few platforms (either nuclear powered on asteroids, the moon, etc. Or solar powered in close orbit around the sun.) that can beam out a microwave laser at the ship. The laser causes the ship to continuously accelerate at say 1G until it has effectively reached light speed. The ship either just flips over and lets the light from the target star slow them down, or they detach a mirror to bounce the laser back at themselves in order to slow down again. In this fashion you could easily send a ship to another solar system. Again, ideally you\u0027d compact your crew into as light a mass as possible (stored existences and whatnot) but really all you need is about 10 people and a hell of a lot of stored sperm and eggs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are referring to FTL systems, these certainly do not require all of humanity to acheive. With advances in quantum entanglement we could very well be 10-20 years away from instant communications devices, arguably this technology is advancing faster BECAUSE of conflict. The USA cannot allow someone like the Chinese to be the only ones with untappable instant communications devices, just as China cannot allow the USA to be the only one. Any time one announces an advance, the other gets more funding to catch up. FTL travel is an interesting gambling game. Either the warp drive works or it doesn\u0027t. Either wormholes work or they don\u0027t. But again, neither of these alone are actually insurmountable tasks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHell, the only reason the ISS wasn\u0027t entirely funded by the USA was simply because NASA didn\u0027t have the budget. It is one of those \u0022everybody wants in, so everybody passes over a couple bucks, and then you\u0027ve got enough to make it happen.\u0022 but I guarentee you that if Harold \u0022Sonny\u0022 White succesfully proves that warp drives work AND puts forth a possible design for one, DARPA would die of dehydration with all the cash-vomitting they would do all over him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe short and sweet of it is that we have actually proven across history, time and time again, that humans work BETTER when they compete with each other than they do if they work together. Now of course this has a scaling factor to it, this doesn\u0027t mean that every task should have a competition to it, but most can. A great example is buildings. Often times if a building is being constructed that is actually made of two buildings right next to each other, in order to finish faster the financing party will contract two different companies, one for each building, and say \u0022First to finish gets an extra million dollars.\u0022. Such situations tend to result in a pair of buildings completed in as much time as a single company would have taken to build a pair of substantial, but still smaller, buildings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an American I am well aware that the real reason the American continent was discovered was not the fantastic ideal people like to talk about when the topic comes up. We were discovered because of money and money alone. It was believed that traveling in our direction would be a shorter (and thus cheaper) route to India, thus why the Native Americans were called Indians. The same thing will apply to the first starships, but in a different sort of metric. Pre-FTL ships will be constructed not because of the idealistic view of exploring the universe (though it will likely be crewed by such idealists), but because of the prestige it brings the country in question. The USA would likely build it simply to try and have a historical stamp of \u0022FIRST POST!\u0022 written on the idea (we are still annoyed about the whole 2nd man into orbit thing).
