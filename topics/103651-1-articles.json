But oh travesty! A small design error prevents the kerbals from entering!\n\nI was sure I tested this on the launchpad, but I think there may have been a small design change, or the stresses of landing on eve slightly moved some parts. My strategy for getting back into the lander was to place a 1 man lander can at the bottom of the rocket, an use the crew transfer function to enter the main ship on the top of the rocket, thus avoiding a long line of ladders and higher part count. \n\nHowever the boosters get in the way, and the kerbals cannot climb high enough up the ladder to enter the lander can. Almost but not quite! I even tried moving the ladder a bit with kerbal attachments but no luck. \n\nI would like to edit the save file to rotate this lander can 45 degrees, which would then allow entry. \n\nI am prepared to edit the save file to gix it but I am not quite sure how. I presume I need to modify the rotation element.\n\nSo what is the name fr the lander can mk1 in the save, and how would I edit the part to rotate is 56 degrees (e.g. so the hatch factes NW nstead of North?).\n\n![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\nThanks, and fly safe.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-08T06:31:19Z\u0022 title=\u002204/08/2015 06:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jeb Coleman","CreatedById":140612,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T22:41:15Z","Content":"Use the A S D E W Q key to rotate parts."},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T22:53:29Z","Content":"Well, I don\u0027t know what the part itself is called, however I present to you a workaround (since changing parts on ships often leads to explosion and game crashing).\n\nBefore you try any of the following BACK UP YOUR SAVE. Savefile editing has the potential of ruining your entire savegame.\n\nRename your ascent stage to something of which you are sure that no ship has had that name in your save before. Quicksave. Then open your KSP directory, go to saves --\u003E then find your career. Open the quicksave file in the windows text editor (not the office one) and search for the name you gave your ship.\n\nNow open a new and empty .txt file. Copy the entire text segment that looks like this:\n\n            VESSEL        {            pid = 9113a41ee6cc4455b410c561d75326fa            name = Duna MkI Lander            type = Ship            sit = ORBITING            landed = False            landedAt =             splashed = False            met = 630543.493035062            lct = 3540387.19839442            root = 0            lat = 0.99595287958034            lon = 163.796236215368            alt = 149887.361389331            hgt = -1            nrm = 0.1403287,0.9317664,0.3348422            rot = -0.7037058,-0.6567019,0.01649558,-0.2706822            CoM = -0.000848032,-3.551316,-0.0002164816            stg = 5            prst = False            ref = 0            ctrl = True            cPch = 0            cHdg = 0            cMod = 0            ORBIT            {                SMA = 750153.000496161                ECC = 0.000368510851376625                INC = 1.16055223187746                LPE = 41.1010731341502                LAN = 230.483264606256                MNA = 2.32168271087149                EPH = 4093422.12665356                REF = 1            }\n\nNow you want to paste this to your new txt file and save that, you will need it later.\n\nThen you go back to KSP, and launch the Eve orbiter as it should be onto the launch pad (without it\u0027s ascent stage, only what you want to have on eve), be sure to remove launch clamps before launch.\n\nGive the ship on the launchpad another unique name. Quicksave, and open your quicksave file again.\n\nNow you need to search for the second name and copy the text segment that looks like the first one. Paste this into a second clean txt file and save that.\n\nOnce you have done that you will need to open the txt file from the ship on eve, copy the text in there and replace the segment (in your quicksave file) belonging to the ship on the launch pad.\n\nThen copy the text from your second txt file (the one belonging to the ship on the launch pad) and use it to replace the segment (in your quicksave file) belonging to the ship on Eve.\n\nSave your changes to the quicksave file.\n\nNow, if everything was done correctly you should be able to simply quickload, and the vessels should be swapped. The one previously on the LP should be on eve, the one previously on eve should be on the LP.\n\nIf you have trouble understanding my explanation feel free to ask, english is not my native language and I might not be able to explain some things very well.\n\nAlso, if you have trouble, check out\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/0wXVm3M2I2w?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n by Scott Manley.
