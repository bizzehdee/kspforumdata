But oh travesty! A small design error prevents the kerbals from entering!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was sure I tested this on the launchpad, but I think there may have been a small design change, or the stresses of landing on eve slightly moved some parts. My strategy for getting back into the lander was to place a 1 man lander can at the bottom of the rocket, an use the crew transfer function to enter the main ship on the top of the rocket, thus avoiding a long line of ladders and higher part count. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever the boosters get in the way, and the kerbals cannot climb high enough up the ladder to enter the lander can. Almost but not quite! I even tried moving the ladder a bit with kerbal attachments but no luck. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to edit the save file to rotate this lander can 45 degrees, which would then allow entry. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am prepared to edit the save file to gix it but I am not quite sure how. I presume I need to modify the rotation element.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what is the name fr the lander can mk1 in the save, and how would I edit the part to rotate is 56 degrees (e.g. so the hatch factes NW nstead of North?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, and fly safe.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-08T06:31:19Z\u0022 title=\u002204/08/2015 06:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jeb Coleman","CreatedById":140612,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T22:41:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUse the A S D E W Q key to rotate parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T22:53:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I don\u0027t know what the part itself is called, however I present to you a workaround (since changing parts on ships often leads to explosion and game crashing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore you try any of the following BACK UP YOUR SAVE.
