So what you do is move towards the target, zero out your speed when you get to the next checkpoint distance, realign (navball centered on the pink doughnut), switch to the other craft, align the port with your craft, switch back, rinse and repeat. Do that at 100, 50, 20 and 10 meters. Go slow; no faster than .5 meters per second when you\u0027re on final approach. Hopefully you don\u0027t have to do a realignment at five meters; that\u0027s too close for safe maneuvering of either craft in my experience.

And of course checking with camera if you\u0027re still on the spot because if the target port is not in the target\u0027s center of gravity (which usually isn\u0027t) the navball may lead you to crashing to it from the side.

Remember, the only way to slow down in space is to impart a force in the opposite direction in which you are moving, usually by means of monopropellant RCS thrusters or your bi-propellant main engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you\u0027re docking, there\u0027s usually two situations you\u0027ll be in, more likely than not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Two small craft docking 1-to-1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: A craft of some undetermined size, is to dock to a large craft that is immobile. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn situation 1, docking is really an effort on the part of both ships involved. First, when you get close enough to begin moving on RCS only, foregoing your main engine, switch to your target\u0027s craft. It\u0027s at this time you\u0027ll need to prepare the ships for close encounters. First, kill out your relative velocity to the target by burning retrograde with the navball in \u0022Target\u0022 mode. Find the ship that will be docking to this target somewhere in space. Point the docking port you\u0027re going to want to dock with toward the ship you\u0027ll use to dock, so that it\u0027s already lined up for approach. Now is also the time to retract any extremities that may be vulnerable or risky to move around, such as solar panels, as well as turning on any lights that may be intended to help you find the craft\u0027s position in space. Once you\u0027ve prepared your target for the final approach, switch back to the craft which you were originally piloting. Prepare it for docking as well, retracting solar panels if necessary and turning on your docking lights to see what you\u0027re looking at. (Not necessary, but VERY nice if you\u0027re on the dark side of Kerbin.) Attempt to set the actual physical port on the craft you\u0027re going for as a target, ensure the Navball is set for Target mode, and your camera to \u0022CHASE\u0022 mode, line up toward that marker, and translate forward to begin the approach. Watch the navball. Try to keep your nose marker right on the pink symbol, as well as your prograde marker. If they drift apart (they probably will) simply use your translation up/down/left/right to move the prograde marker around on your nav ball. Yes, it is that easy. The prograde marker, at low velocities, will very responsively follow your IJKL keys, with H and N making it harder or easier to move, due to increased or decreased velocity. Simply keep adjusting, trying to keep your nose, prograde, and target-prograde all aligned, and you will eventually be close enough for it to simply engage. A final docking speed should be, ideally, no more than .1m/s, but .3m/s could be done safely as well. Once the magnets begin to engage, let the game take over. Disable your SAS and RCS systems immediately and as quickly as possible. The magnets will guide you into place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the second situation, where the target is not easily movable to face your position, you will need to get close to the large craft using the same basic method as above, but once you get close enough, say, about \u0022one fully-extended Gigantor-XL Solar Panel\u0022\u0027s length away, then use your translation to move around the craft, just like a gigantic Kerbal EVA pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps, once you figure it out, it\u0027s super easy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LameLefty","CreatedById":57336,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-25T14:03:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy advice is just various combos of all of the above combined with this: PRACTICE!

What you need is RSC balancing, however many blocks that takes for whatever you\u0027re trying to maneuver. For a small capsule or probe-controlled stage or module, you might only need 4 quads; take a look at the layout of the Apollo CSM stack, for instance.

Any specific key bindings?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d second the recommendations to use WASD and IJKLHN (although I use UIOJKL with U and O for forward and backward). RCS ports have to be around the center of mass, to not turn the ship when you translate it. And a good idea is to switch between ships and align them at each other\u0027s docking port (right-click at own port to control from there, right-click other\u0027s port to make it a target).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother trick is to point one ship\u0027s port in some direction you can remember (say, horizon north), and aim the opposite in the other ship. (Horizon south, 180 degrees) then translate without turning to match the target marker at your pointer and forward.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-25T19:23:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Apollo13\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Apollo13\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E2.
