A teacher (professor) at OCC (Ocean County College, here in NJ) teaching a course in history, touching the subject of Roman Emperor Claudius. Said teacher states that we know a lot about that period because of Claudius\u0027 own writings, from his \u0027autobiography\u0027 discovered in ancient scrolls. Claudius had written no such autobiography. The autobiography they took for fact was from a book by Robert Graves (author of \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EI, Claudius\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E), in which he made up (\u003Cem\u003Epure fiction, albeit historical fiction\u003C/em\u003E) that such scrolls were discovered, and that they contained his own autobiography. This teacher actually taught this \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eas literal fact\u003C/span\u003E.

What we speak is more akin to Scots than tis to English. It\u0027s decidedly not the language or \u0022tongue\u0022 the rest of the country speaks. Maybe them Kentucky Folk speak the Queen\u0027s tongue, but they can keep it on their sides of the river. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe linguistic backgrounds of \u0022rural\u0022 WV are vast and many. South of the Kanawha you see a great many new immigrants, mostly of Italian, Greek, Slavic or Welch descent. (Guess how Welch got its name.) These were families brought in by the greedy pricks in New York who wanted our coal but refused to employ locals (for a variety of reason). Still some old bloods, but their numbers were drowned out by the immigrant labor. Still a few entrenched Germans, too. English down there is a dirty English, incorporating lots of foreign names and slang, but still modern. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorth of the Kanawha and up into Central WV, where my family is from, you see lots of old blood - Anglos, Scotch, Irish. Original immigrants. Some Swiss. Some more Germans. Families that have lived their since the get-go (like mine). Not much in the way of useful coal there, so no coal slaves brought in by the New Yorkers. The \u0022rurals\u0022 still mostly speak the dialects of their parents. My grandfather still used LOTS of Irish words here and there, despite being second generation American (on his mother\u0027s side...).

A few of us in the store could understand it, most couldn\u0027t.
