Anyway, the nanobots function like a roomba, but they have some sort of sensor that detects organic matter. So the tiny bots leave the box, and scour your house for tiny debris that normal cleaning might miss. They are tiny, so they somehow grab a chunk and take it away, then come back for more. Since they can detect to organics when they run into them, they preferentially remove the sort of debris that might attract household pests. Debris is maybe brought outside through the other tiny hole. Seems like a cool idea. Now, what if the box could make more nanobots, von Neumann machine style! If a nanobot gets damaged or fails, another drags it home, and uses it to make more.

Not only that, meat is your PRIMARY nutritional source. Eat other stuff and you will become ill and eventually die.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Predatory instinct is high.

Why? The predation drive is strong in pure carnivores (cats for example), which means I really doubt they would have the self control to wait long enough instead of killing/eating whenever they get hungry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mean... just as an example, consider the human drive to reproduce.
