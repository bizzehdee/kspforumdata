The ITER has been under construction for a while now, since 2007. They are now setting up some massive cranes to start building the complex. By 2020 ITER will be up and running, producing 500 megawatts of power for 500 seconds while only consuming 50 megawatts. So thats an output 10x the input. By 2050 Europe wants power from nuclear fusion on the grid, if ITER is successful.... but it will be. They have been testing it for over 20 years. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA mostly unknown project called JET or Joint European Torus was built in the 80\u0027s. ITER is based of JET. JET has been operating for over 20 years without much public knowledge. The only problem with JET is that it doesn\u0027t have a high output compared to its input. So a joint consortium of nations will build the ITER, the European Union (EU), India, Japan, China, Russia, South Korea and the United States (US senators cut funding for 2014 due to department of energy\u0027s unreliable projected funds needed). The EU, as host party for the ITER complex, is contributing 45% of the cost, with the other six parties contributing 9% each.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf ITER is successful, then a project named DEMO will step up. DEMO is the plans for a nuclear fusion reactor based of ITER and will be the middle man between experimental and commercial nuclear fusion. DEMO will be bigger and produce power at better efficiency than ITER. DEMO hopes to be operational by 2033, so 13 years after ITER is up and running. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think about all of this?

Not likely and the electrons do not have the voltage as seen in the generators of a steam turbine. You have essentially three choices, single loop steam turbine, two loop presuurized liquid sodium(98\u0027C) or liquid lithium (180\u0027C)\u00A0in which the steam reactor is the second stage. If you place lithium as the first loop you can breed fuels, but you have to extract the fission products during operation, the operating temperature will be higher which can cause problems for\u00A0superconductors and increase the rate of part wear, and increase the cost of parts.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-12T13:01:07Z\u0022 title=\u002212/12/2015 01:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Elthy","CreatedById":63317,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-12T13:23:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHelium-3 fusion wont happen.
