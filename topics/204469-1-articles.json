Of course, many players just do it manually and stage the parachute when they want to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe pressure tweakable sets the minimum pressure the atmosphere has to be at to deploy.

Keep in mind that it takes about 5 seconds for the parachute to fully open up after it\u2019s triggered so don\u2019t set this number too low- anywhere from 650 to 1000m is suitable for Kerbin, I\u2019d go as high as possible on Duna and really low on Eve (500m or maybe even less).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u2019s a third option that I think is enabled with \u201Cadvanced tweakables\u201D switched on in the main menu settings, which has three options- deploy when safe, when risky or immediately: when safe is the default and will wait until you\u2019re going slow enough that deploying the parachute won\u2019t break it, when the parachute icon is white in the staging menu, but that also means that there\u2019s a chance the parachute never deploys or deploys too late to slow you down; when risky is just that, opening the parachutes when the icon is orange, with a risk of breaking the parachutes but also a chance that they\u2019ll be fine and will open early enough to slow you down; immediate is also self-explanatory, the chute will deploy at the pressure and altitude values you set regardless of whether it\u2019ll survive or not, you\u2019d need to be pretty desperate to use this option as odds are the parachute will just break.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the staging menu the parachute icon can be white (safe to deploy but not armed), orange (risky) and red (unsafe), but will turn blue when it\u2019s armed by staging. The background also changes colour, going orange or red when the conditions are too hostile to deploy the chutes e.g. during re-entry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDrogue chutes can deploy faster and at lower pressures than mains and will help slow the craft down before the mains deploy, for high value craft (like crew pods) and larger craft it\u2019s worth adding a drogue chute or two to make sure that the main chutes will work properly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen landing a crew capsule on Kerbin I usually have the main parachutes set to 0.6atm pressure and 750m altitude, this is enough to open the parachutes well above the terrain unless it happens to be heading straight into some mountains- in which case I drag the pressure all the way down so the chutes open as soon as possible.\u00A0I always leave the parachutes set to \u201Cdeploy when safe\u201D, it\u2019s rare that the situation would require anything else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
