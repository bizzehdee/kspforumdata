Woah.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, actually before tossing the launch boosters off, it\u0027s something like 2,900. But since they\u0027re essentially spent, and intended to be temporary, it doesn\u0027t make sense to count them. In the photographed Demonstration launch, two things happened. The photo showing the single-tank bottom boosters coming off in upper atmosphere is actually from my second (not third) launch attempt. I forgot to drop them entirely in the launch that was completed until the next stage was depleted. Who knows how mucn DV I lost from the extra 122 tons. Second, there was still around 5,000 fuel left in the boosters. I had the ship where I wanted it and just tossed the negligible (on the scale of Titan) remains. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was a very interesting challenge to learn how to effectively lift something of this monstrous scale. The new ARM update\u0027s physics has been infinitely indispensable to the attempt. I tried to fly an 1100-tonner in the previous version but it would never stay intact. Not only did I have to build several other generations of Titan to become familiar with the nuances, but in the last one, I even had to swipe a whackjob technique.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAndromeda is only third-gen right now, because although it\u0027s even bigger, it\u0027s empty after launch. It\u0027s meant to be a storage depot which Titan can fill, with multiple passes. Andromeda III pictured earlier holds 589K Fuel, but only achieved its current orbit holding around 10,000. The idea is to essentially fuse the resources of several Titans into a single immense storage facility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile Titan has reached a point where I am satisfied, (who would be disappointed with 2,000 tons of fuel in one launch \u002B a half-million orbit?)
