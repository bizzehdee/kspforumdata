In real life, fairings are standardized, mass-produced components for ease of manufacturing and to keep costs low, while payloads are, correspondingly, more sensible in size and shape (giant space stations are built by docking sensibly-sized modules in orbit, not launched in one go).\n\nKW Rocketry Fairings is heading in the right direction with standardized fairing components, but its high part count, part list bloat and non-intuitive assembly method can be discouraging. Also, the KW fairings still technically allow extremely long payloads.\n\nAs such, my intention is to create an alternative payload fairing system that combines the best features of the current options on the market, while also imparting some sensible restrictions.\n\n**Sum Dum Heavy Industries AeroFairings**\n\n**Features**\n\n- Fairing bases available in 1.25, 2.5 and 3.75m diameters  \n\n- Semi-procedural two-way shrouds with tweakable options:  \n\n    - Straight or boattail bottom segment  \n\n    - One, two or three mid-segments (four would be too tall)  \n\n    - Conical or ogive nose cone  \n\n    - Three material choices: stockalike, clean, [Copernicus MTV-style heat shield tiles](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-p5bihMOGYDY/UDEUdW3SjUI/AAAAAAAAX5E/5L_QGXm0uDs/s1600/nucleartherm1.png)  \n\n- Shrouds move out of the way when editing payload  \n\n- Shrouds have mass and cost that increases with size  \n\n- Shrouds are persistent debris after jettison.  \n\n- Lower overall cost due to standardized components / mass production  \n**- Standalone add-on with NO dependencies**\n\n**Not Planned**\n\n- Three or four-way fairings (not common on contemporary 2000\u0027s and 2010\u0027s rockets)\n\n- Interstages (most contemporary payloads are launched at the very top of the rocket)\n\n**Implementation Details / Plans**\n\nMaking the models is the easy part, as all that\u0027s needed are:\n\n- One fairing base\n\n- One straight bottom segment\n\n- One boattail bottom segment (same height as straight bottom segment; upper diameter is 125% 140% of base diameter???)\n\n- One standard mid-segment (height = diameter)\n\n- One conical nose segment (height = diameter)\n\n- One ogive nose segment (height = diameter)\n\nA custom plugin will take these assets, scale/duplicate them appropriately and build them into one-piece clamshell fairing halves. The plugin will also natively handle procedural cost and mass, as well as the switching of the fairing material and the VAB/SPH ghosting animation.\n\n**Questions**\n\n**-** Any seasoned plugin authors interested in helping out? ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n- I\u0027m a bit concerned about texture scaling, especially for the Copernicus MTV aeroshell-style heat shield tiling. I would prefer that (most of) the tiles have constant size across all fairing sizes, to fit with the standardized components / mass production ethos - but at the same time, I want to keep the number/size of textures at a minimum. Does this matter to you guys, or is it okay if the larger fairings end up having bigger heat shield tiles overall?"},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T23:11:10Z","Content":"Could you make in-between-sizes fairing sizes?\n\nI.e:\n\n1.875m\n\n3.125m\n\n4.325m\n\n?"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T23:17:03Z","Content":"seems interesting!

It is really convenient I think, and you listed it in Pros section.\n\nIt\u0027s a neat idea that I considered, but there\u0027s a bit of a problem.\n\nThe fairing bases in KW Rocketry have stack decouplers, but that\u0027s only because the fairing halves themselves (being separate parts) have their own built-in radial decouplers, allowing them to be staged separately.\n\nThe staging action for the SDHI AeroFaring bases is reserved for the fairing jettison, and so adding a stack decoupler PartModule would cause the payload to be released at the same time the fairings come off (I don\u0027t think one part can have two staging icons). There are two ways to work around this:\n\n - Design the AeroFairing so that with one staging action, the fairing halves are jettisoned, and after a short (tweakable?) delay, automatically decouple the payload. Extremely convenient in most cases, but there may be situations where the user wants to manually determine when to decouple the payload (or maybe the user is dual-manifesting and wants to decouple the *upper* payload first).\n\n - Have the user just attach a separate decoupler part.
