It dissipates no heat, and generates no heat. These things are only ever calculated for actively loaded vessels. This has been true for all versions of KSP and will likely remain true in the future, because changing it would *kill* your performance with more than 2-3 vessels in space. Calculating everything fully is so expensive that it\u0027s simply impractical to do.\n\n\\* technically, if the craft is not focused but still in physics range (2.5km) of the currently focused vessel, it should be processed normally, IIRC.\n\nA select few things, like the science lab, work for unfocused vessels. This is done with a trick: the vessel in question actually doesn\u0027t calculate that itself at all. The game does it independently, and whenever you focus that vessel, it force-updates the status of the vessel to the precalculated value.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-14T17:39:21Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2015 05:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T04:33:50Z","Content":"One more activity that continues while unfocused: resource mining."}]}
