The world has been ravaged by multiple wars starting from the Third World War in 2017, where North Korea fires multiple nuclear warheads at the USA, in a move that had not been expected at all. The war ends in 2023. The Oil Wars of the 2030\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s began as the Middle-eastern countries close down their oil exports to maintain oil for their own nations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy 2040, many nations that share common goals and interests in dominating the world and saving themselves from collapse have formed \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153super-nations\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2, the main ones include the Greater European Union, which includes a large majority of European nations, the Asia Confederation, which was previously China, the Unified Korean Republic, Mongolia, and the Siberian Peoples\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 Republic (a Communist republic covering most of Eastern Russia), the Arab Republic, formed by the nations of the Middle East, and the International Union, a nation formed by nations wanting to continue the efforts of the former United Nations. This included New Zealand and Australia, India, Brazil and many other countries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETensions continue to rise between the super-nations, and eventually an all-out nuclear war ravages the whole world. The war never ended as all nations collapse. The world population falls by 89%, the survivors all live as scavengers in what is now a desolate wasteland.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurvivors formed \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153packs\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2; they hunted food and other packs together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe nuclear winter that formed after the nuclear war formed a second ice-age, much of the Southern Hemisphere is covered in a massive ice-blanket. A large and highly developed pack, known as the Polars, set to work in 2112 on developing a space program to fly to Asius I, a close-by planet that was able to sustain human life that had been discovered by the NASA in 2019. By 2588, they had fully developed themselves into a strong nation. They managed to fly to the moon that year, and by 2601, they managed to get to Mars. However, resources had been scarce and the radioactive fuels needed to power the rockets was running out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Hams, a pack formed in the remains of the town of Hampton, heard of the Polars\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 goals and wanted to also reach Asius I to form a better life. Their plan to \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153make peace\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 with the Polars in 2539 was very unsuccessful, and made the Polars plan to destroy the Hams. However, as they wanted to get to Asius I and not waste precious resources on weapons, they threw away the plans and continued the space program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Smiggonians are a race of aliens from the dwarf planet of Pluto. They had set up an \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153empire\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2, a collection of planets including the moons of Pluto, the planet of Uranus, and Neptune, all of which had settlements. A survey over 625 years of Earth resulted in them sending a ship to the planet in 2604 to encounter the humans. Their studies allowed them to understand English and other surviving languages. The first life they encountered was the Polars. Seeing an opportunity to reach their goal of reaching Asius I, they agreed to a peace agreement with the Smiggonians, and presented their goals of reach A.I. The Smiggonians made a controversial deal to help them \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 some were worried they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d use the planet\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s resources to eventually take over their empire. In return for transporting them to Asius I and setting up a colonization and hyper-teleportation systems between Earth and Asius I, they would act as a \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153colony\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 for a number of years, which included trade systems between the groups and support for when the Smiggonians encountered war with another race.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Polars set up their first colony in 2602 and were fully developed in the area by 2610. The Polars formed a galnat in 2624 (galnat: Term created by Polars to define a race or group that has full or partial control of more than one planet) by establishing new settlements on Earth and the Moon, followed by joint Smiggonian-Polar military defence bases constructed on Mars. The new galnat formed by the Polars was the IGPU (Inter-Galactical Polar Union). The IGPU actively took part in the successful Smigg-Polikrai War. IGPU separated from being a colony in 2635. In the following years relations started to break down between the two galnats, and tensions grew. A peace agreement was signed in 2639. Both were still negative towards each other, but no-one wanted a war. The IGPU established good relations with other species such as the Kolashi of Venus, and the Urantols of Solar System P-1HS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInto the 2640\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s, the Smiggonians started meeting with the Hams, as part of trying to find a way to \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153control\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 the IGPU. The Hams, with help of the Smiggonians, started developing across the Prima Solar System (aka. The \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Solar System\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 that we know). The initial plan was to develop across Earth, but as the IGPU settled about 67% of the earth and were constantly expanding, they started developing on other planets in other systems, creating the galnat Ham Republic. The only planets and moons which was developed by the Hams in Prima during the 2600\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s was Mercury and Dione, Titan, Tethys, and Triton (moons of Saturn and Neptune), and a small military base on Proteus (another moon of Neptune). Hams had mainly developed their settlements on a nearby solar system, the Hampton Solar System (named after the town Hampton, the origin of the Hams). The IGPU had no knowledge of the Hams until the early 2700\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s. When a IGPU traveller-class spaceship crash landed on Triton whilst carrying a delegation of officials to Pluto to re-negotiate a trade pact, they found the settlement of Ioks-D. Citizens, who were brought up to hate the IGPU, murdered all but one of the travelling officials, Jikob Ler, the Minister of Galactic Affairs, who managed to escape, but later died of starvation and thirst in the isolated plains of the planet. The IGPU sent two recon ships from a nearby base to investigate, and landed near the wreckage. They were too, met by the Hams, but were able to escape in their ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother group of officials flew to Pluto. However, not to negotiate deals, but to demand who the people on Triton were. Smiggonians denied any knowledge of the existence of a non-IGPU human settlement on Triton. However, spies within the government of Smiggonian Empire showed that they had helped the Hams establish settlements across the galaxy and help them develop technologies and weapons. The leader of IGPU at the time, Hans Reihmann, demanded that Pluto and the empire be invaded. No invasion was ever undertaken.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Smiggonian plans to help develop another race to help themselves grow once again failed. July 19th, 2766, saw the break of ties between the Hams and the Smiggonians, after a series of allegations that Smiggonians had been mistreating the Ham people. Tensions arose and eventually led to the Distant Prima War in 2767. The Hams technology had become superior; their own scientists developed technology in secret from 2711 onwards. The Smiggonians desperately needed help \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 their allied species were very inferior to the Hams. A delegation was quickly sent to the IGPU Outer Council in Mars, to beg the IGPU to help them defeat the Hams. The leader at the time, Joseph Hallwoord, was lenient to the Smiggonians and agreed to help attack the Hams. The Smiggonian Empire became an administrative division of the Greater IGPU Empire, and the war was now between the Hams and the Polars, a war that was 200 years overdue. The head of the IGPU and its empire, Sir Peter Doyle (\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Sir Peter\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 is his preferred name), with the administrative division of the Smiggonians, led by Smiggle Oozly, and other minor divisions, against the Ham Republic, led by Liam Rollsworth (known by his nickname given by the IGPU, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Lord Ham\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Plot of Oblivion (and possibly sequels)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe novel begins at Antarctic City, Earth. The city is the secondary capital of IGPU. Earth contains roughly 40% of the human population of IGPU (Asius I houses about 35%, other planets within the Prima contain 10%, and others contain the rest) and about 65% of the GEDC population (GEDC stands for Genetically Engineered Defence Clones \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 cloned penguins with super-\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153penguin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 abilities. The choice of penguins is because they were the first to be experimented and developed upon, and because the genetic-engineering process is very resource and time consuming, they stayed with penguins than with more \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153powerful\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 creatures. South Antarctic City houses many government officials. HR fighters attack Base-JK278 (the main base in Northern Earth, where England once stood). IGPU fighters repel the attack easily, but it was a distraction for a HR ship carrying a new piece of technology, many Polars regard it as the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153End-Maker\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2. The bomb detonates over the coast of the Antarctic County, which not only explodes a massive crater, but sends a very lethal shockwave across the planet, essentially killing just about all life-forms. Sir Peter\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s ship, flying in over Earth, is hit by the shockwave, damaging the ship. The captain tries to get to the Moon, but the ship is too badly damaged. They crash land near South Antarctic City, which is flattened and lifeless. As a rescue ship arrives, Sir Peter vows as he and the Vice-Leader and Head of Technological Development / Ping-uTech, Maxwell Carter (Max C) board, that the Hams will be destroyed to oblivion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERest of plot to be written.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENBB: Ham republic is now the New Britannic empire, IGPU is now the Polar Federation, and the smiggonians have been replaced with an alien called the wagshee (Pronounced \u0022Wok-she\u0022) who only feature in the prologue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESincerely, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Sir Peter and Lord Wagsethan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Please feel free to post opinions and any CONSTRUCTIVE criticism)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deathsoul097","CreatedById":77396,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T10:07:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReading through it now, there are so many things I should have told him to write differently, especially stuff concerning space, but unfortunately as I am an avid KSP player and I understand this stuff a bit, and he less so than me, it creates some discrepancies.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deathsoul097","CreatedById":77396,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-29T10:29:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReally?
