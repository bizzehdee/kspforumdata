Mythbusters made one out of salami sausage once just to prove a point. The tricky part is building an efficient one. There are two challenging elements to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, containing your oxidizer. GOX is good and all, but you need a pressure vessel for it, and that makes your rocket much heavier. This is why LOX is a better choice, but it\u0027s harder to work with. By far the best oxidizers for a hybrid are the nitric acid and dinitrogen tetroxide. Both are very corrosive and toxic, however. They are also not easy to obtain without raising some red flags.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond is managing pressure in combustion chamber. Again, with GOX you know that pressure at which you feed oxygen into combustion chamber is your maximum continuous pressure. There can be blowback, which involves a pressure spike, but so long as your oxidizer is not volatile, it\u0027s not a big deal. So basically, your chamber just needs to withstand the pressure \u002B a bit overhead to survive possible blowback. Of course, if you want some degree of efficiency, you also need to manage the flow rate to match the combustion rate, which depends on the pressure, and the pressure depends on the combustion rate and the outflow rate. So effectively, it\u0027s the same problem as managing the pressure in a solid fuel rocket, but you have that extra safety of both pressure and reaction rates are being oxidizer-limited, so instead of runaway reaction and explosion you just get drop in efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dharak1","CreatedById":61137,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-07T04:33:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see.
