The aircraft has about 0.2m of ground clearance below the engine while sitting on the runway, and the rear landing gear are very far behind the CG.  You can\u0027t get it to pitch up before the end of the runway.

I found that pitching the wings up with respect to the fuselage by 5 degrees helped my efficiency tremendously.  I\u0027d get up to altitude and point the craft straight at the horizon (0 pitch).  That minimized the drag from the fuselage (only the frontal area had drag--the rest was occluded) while still allowing the wings to produce lift. It also made flying for 8 hours a lot easier (thanks, Pilot Assistant!)."},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-16T08:40:36Z","Content":"**\u003Cu\u003EATTENTION\u003C/u\u003E**\n\nDue to recent inactivity, and the fact that the state of Kerbal Space has changed quite a bit I am renouncing my ~~dictatorship~~ administration status to whoever wants to keep running the challenge.

Only informal debug settings are allowed.\n\u003E - 30 Km is the ceiling. Any higher than that, and you restart. Don\u0027t worry, a 29,999 is still safe.\n\u003E - A runway takeoff is required (You may use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s and STOL\u0027s.)\n\u003E - You must land back at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E (runway landing is not required, but you must land within 1.1 Kilometers of it).\n\u003E - You must show at least one clear screenshot of your aircraft. (Preferably upon takeoff. Phoenix screenshots do not bear fruit.)\n\u003E - When your Circumnavigation is finished, show an F3 screenshot for the details of your flight.\n\u003E - No pizza allowed.\n\u003E - Do not offset parts to be separate from the craft [They must visually connect]\n\u003E - Your aircraft must stay perfectly intact the whole flight [No drop tanks, burn-offs, or otherwise lost parts]\n\u003E - Manned flights only.\n\u003E - In your submission, you must list your flight time, and the number of circumnavigations. The visual post should be able to verify this.\n\u003E - You may only do an equatorial or polar Circumnavigation only. None of that 89 degree stuff [Just kidding, but don\u0027t deviate too far]\n\u003E - One clear screenshot per Circumnavigation of your aircraft on the opposite side of the planet is required.\n\u003E - No mounting any parts on the back of an engine.\n\u003E - Anything that ruins the spirit of the challenge is also not allowed.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **Re-attempts -** \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E You are free to attempt this challenge an infinite number of times.
