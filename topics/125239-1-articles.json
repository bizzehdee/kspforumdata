All inputs, including mouse movement etc., work perfectly fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, despite most features working (buttons and mouse), KSP does not seem to accept or even notice any of the Touchpad axis when setting the Trackpads or Joystick to output a joystick axis. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is very unfortunate, since the finer precision of the Trackpads can no longer be used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have used a Joystick with KSP before, which did work fine. However, I assume the main difference to be in the way the Joysticks are handled. With the normal Joystick, linux creates a device under /dev/input/js*, however with the steam controller this does not seem to be the case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe the already set up plugin to connect the steam controller with KSP could be expanded to allow for usage of the Touchpad Joystick axis outputs? Or is this a more underlying problem, in which Linux, Steam or Unity has to fix the problem?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-13T17:31:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Xasin, KSP is \u003Cem\u003Estill\u003C/em\u003E a bit ropey when it comes to controllers of all kinds, all I can suggest is that you restart KSP with the controller attached until it is detected (usually on 2nd restart).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you bind any axis or buttons and start KSP without the controller attached they can show as \u0022Not found\u0022 when you later plug it back in, so again just restart KSP once or twice with the controller in and it\u0027ll find it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately KSP doesn\u0027t check for controllers at all after it\u0027s started, so plugging in after starting KSP, or hot swapping controllers just doesn\u0027t work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know if this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xasin","CreatedById":153487,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-13T21:07:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHeya Sal_Vager! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried my best to get it working with your suggestion (setting a Joystick Axis in both the Desktop and KSP layout), and have restarted KSP at least four times, each time having the controller connected, but sadly, no luck so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also tried a Kernel Update to see if it would do any good, since I have heard that Steam has been working a bit on some drivers for Gamepad stuff from what I have read in other Joystick-related threads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently I am running 4.1.13 on ElementaryOS Freya 0.3.1 64bit ^^\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-13T23:25:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately I\u0027m not sure what else to suggest here, the code that handles telling the Unity3D engine the new controller bindings is not working right, frankly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, Steam controller support is brand new for 1.0.5 and has only really been setup for Windows (Yes I know Steam boxes run Linux) so if it works at all in KSP for Linux or OSX it\u0027ll only be thanks to the controller drivers on these platforms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a Linux user myself I\u0027d really like to try KSP with a Steam controller, but I think I have to wait for KSP 1.1 :/\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xasin","CreatedById":153487,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T00:21:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, when the Steam Controller acts as a Joystick it seems to try and emulate the normal standard of other Gamepads, using X-Input, and should, theoretically, thusly be known by the system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, since there is no actual /dev/input/js* entry created, maybe the system does not recognize or accept the Steam Joystick output?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will have to wait for 1.1 and see if that helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I have thought of a way to work around this missing Joystick identification problem! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED-Pad \u0022analog Simulation\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen setting a Touchpad or the Joystick as D-Pad, it can simulate an analog input by \u0022duty-cycling\u0022 the button, having it 10% pressed and the rest depressed for a given time, then 20% etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever this is not a very good method in KSP since the Pitch/Yaw/Roll axis inputs slowly \u0022scale\u0022 upwards when pressing a button, and instantaneously fall back to 0 when letting go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis makes very long cycle periods necessary, which makes the input very sluggish and makes the craft wobble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I had a nice idea that could be implemented as some kind of Mod? I am not sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea was to have the KSP System measure the time between two button presses or depresses. If this value is much lower than something a normal user would press, but high enough for the Steam Analog Simulation to work, then KSP could, instead of using the normal input system, measure the duty cycle of the button press (the time between button press and release divided by the time between two button presses), and then set the according axis to the calculated value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI myself have never even touched a game like KSP, and thusly I really don\u0027t know much about coding a mod or plugin for this, however, it does seem to be easily doable, I would suppose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOptimally this should be implemented into the KSP source code, but if there is anybody out there who knows how to code such a plugin who is willing to do it ... I would greatly appreciate it!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-26T18:09:35Z","Content":"\nXasin, your issue could be the result of the libCSteamworks.so file being [U][URL=\u0022http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/5996#note-5\u0022]in the wrong folder.[/URL][/U]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTry moving the libCSteamworks.so file to GameData/Squad/Plugins/\n"}]}
