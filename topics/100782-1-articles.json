Also, should you ever create something that a lot of people actually care a lot about (and thus it has an implicit value that could be exploited), you want license terms that hold up under actual legal scrutiny. Of course KSP mods rarely venture into that realm, but if you do use one of those pre-made third party licenses, then you can be sure that they are legally sound. You are not required to pay or transfer rights to these third parties; they simply give you a template to follow. By choosing a CC license, you are effectively saying \u0022I license my work under the exact same terms and conditions as you can find posted over there on that website\u0022. No more, no less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe simplest form of a legally sound license, incidentally, is \u0022all rights reserved\u0022.
