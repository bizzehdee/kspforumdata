That way you won\u0027t have issues when users try to upgrade TS and reinstall the TS defaults.

You only do if you are using assets and material from Tweakscale. Writing a config file that interacts with it is not using the material. So you don\u0027t care.\n\nAlso my point of this was not just about knowing what you can do, but what you must do. Some licenses require you distribute modified materials with attribution, by mentioning the original author, by using the same license, etc."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T08:06:46Z","Content":"The main thing about licenses you need to understand is that it sounds awfully lawyery and complicated and official, but it\u0027s actually not. It\u0027s not even something you apply for or \u0022get\u0022 anywhere.\n\nIn absolute layman\u0027s terms: when *you* create original content, then *you* get to decide to what extent other people are allowed to use it. Because it\u0027s your work. The statement *you* make that describes what other people are allowed to do is simply called \u0022license\u0022.\n\nAs such, it can be a freeform text written by you. It can stipulate that people named Bob are forbidden from ever producing a derivative work using your material, but people named Bill are allowed to do so if they post about in on the KSP forums on a Sunday afternoon between 6 PM and 7 PM eastern daylight savings time. It would be complete nonsense, sure, but it\u0027s your work, and therefore your right to license it in whatever darn way you want! ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nThe reason why people often fall back on things like the Creative Commons license and other such things is because it allows them to just paste that in and not worry about creating their own terms and conditions. Also, should you ever create something that a lot of people actually care a lot about (and thus it has an implicit value that could be exploited), you want license terms that hold up under actual legal scrutiny. Of course KSP mods rarely venture into that realm, but if you do use one of those pre-made third party licenses, then you can be sure that they are legally sound. You are not required to pay or transfer rights to these third parties; they simply give you a template to follow. By choosing a CC license, you are effectively saying \u0022I license my work under the exact same terms and conditions as you can find posted over there on that website\u0022. No more, no less.\n\nThe simplest form of a legally sound license, incidentally, is \u0022all rights reserved\u0022. Putting these three words under your mod precludes anyone from doing anything with it without your express permission - even if you disappear from the internet forever. However, that also means that nobody can maintain your mod in your absence, which is why it\u0027s almost never chosen."}]}
