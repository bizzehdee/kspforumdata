Otherwise, it\u0027ll have lower than plates, and when they collide, your warhead will be the thing exploding. That is at same weight, but apparently weight is the second factor: not only in the amount of energy as you would think (0.5*m*v^2 for kinetic energy and all that), but in the fact that when stuff collides, the \u003Cem\u003Erelative weight \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eof the parts contacting\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E is also a very important factor in KSP deciding which one breaks. There\u0027s also some randomness, too. Other than that, I am pretty confident that the v^2 part is boop, since for light weaponry to be effective you have to get to insane impact speeds, over 400m/s, and as I understand heavier warheads composed of just more parts have dramatically better effects at lower speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, don\u0027t do like in the first example by Starwhip and put something light and flimsy on the top like a cubic strut: it\u0027ll break for sure, and it\u0027ll rob the rest of the missile of some impact energy doing so.
