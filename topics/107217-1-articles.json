However, the Gemini capsule\u0027s exterior isn\u0027t stockalike in the slightest, requiring two or three parts just to get to a standard rocket body radius. On the other hand, Kemini has a cute-if-cramped two man stockalike capsule that fits neatly on standard nodes, but the IVA... well nothing is going to compare to the Gemini IVA.\n\nI took a look at the config files and so forth, and think with a little direction I could hammer this out myself. So the first question is how do you associate an IVA to a part, and would these be compatible, IE windows etc. There are a number of little features on the Gemini that obviously can\u0027t work like the docking camera, but just the ability to look around the cabin and press buttons without excessive clipping is all I\u0027m asking for.\n\nThe second thing; if I bundled these add-ons together and repackaged them with credit to the authors, would I be immediately lynched, bifurcated or merely beaten? My life insurance policy pays double if I\u0027m bifurcated.\n\nAddon threads for reference.\n\nThe IVA: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24867-1-0-FASA-Apr-29th-1-0-Release-v5-31](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24867-1-0-FASA-Apr-29th-1-0-Release-v5-31)\n\nThe Exterior: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104925-1-0-2-K2-Command-Pod-Two-Kerbal-stock-alike-pod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104925-1-0-2-K2-Command-Pod-Two-Kerbal-stock-alike-pod)\n\nThe MFDs: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/66824-0-23-5-FASA-Gemini-IVA-Modernization-2-0-%28RasterPropMonitor%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/66824-0-23-5-FASA-Gemini-IVA-Modernization-2-0-%28RasterPropMonitor%29)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T20:13:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 08:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wesreidau**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T18:02:31Z","Content":"In the cfg you see on FASA \n\n    INTERNAL{  name = FASAGeminiInt2}\n\nEDIT- You would make the one look like if your wanting to use FASA internal on K2 Command Pod \n\n    PART{// this is a sample config file, for determining a good file format for defining part parameters// comment line - ignored by cfg parser// empty lines, or lines without a \u0027=\u0027 sign are also ignored// all other lines are split at the \u0027=\u0027 sign, and the left operand is used to know what parameter we are setting// diferent parameters require data in different formats (see docs), and each module has it\u0027s own parameters (again, see docs)// each assignment must be in a single line.
