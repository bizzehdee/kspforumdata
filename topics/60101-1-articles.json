(it works with any spreadsheet able to open MS Excel files, does not strictly require MS Excel to work).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing: total Delta-V is given from stage 1 to stage 20 here. That is more similar to how stages are numbered IRL (let me say, as NASA does). KSP numbers stages in reverse order however, so it may come useful to make that in reverse as well. In case you are going to implement something more complex, like calculating mass of every stage considering what is the mass of the stage before it, that becomes a relevant thing to consider.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother useful improvement: as it stands now, those equations are only valid in case of pure sequential staging. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn KSP it is often the case that stages are run in parallel for some time, so thrust is added from all engines active. That requires also to know the burntime for active engines (and that changes with atmospheric pressure) so to know how much fuel is spent before other engines are shut off, and then solve the equation for a pure single engine type (same ISP). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoreover, while different engines are running, ISP to use is the average for all engines.

It is still very basic at this moment. I also don\u0027t get much time on my computer to do stuff like this so it will be a while before I make it a bit better. Thank you for the suggestions and it will take me a while before I understand it as I am still a young one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
