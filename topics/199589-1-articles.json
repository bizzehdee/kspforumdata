(I don\u0027t like to, and I\u0027ve entertained the ideas of hollow worlds myself...but with my understanding of KSP, I only have negatives to respond with this time.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe same thing that makes caves and tunnels virtually impossible in KSP...still remains, and other factors rise up to stand in your way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCaves and tunnels only work on the outside of a planet because of the terrain collider (you cannot turn off pieces of it) and require custom hills, precise placement of them, and an exceptional amount of planning so that they can be made modular and can fit together nicely (like in the ancient Pipe Dream game (like Minesweeper for Win95) where you attach pipe pieces like puzzle pieces with the goal of completing a drainage system before the drainage itself reaches you and spills out). They need to be made so that you can tell where their openings are so you\u0027re less likely to block each other\u0027s pathways by placing a piece badly. (Their colliders will intersect and block each other).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHollow worlds and winding underground paths are completely impossible because:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThe PQS terrain system only allows you to carve the terrain outward or inward toward the planet\u0027s center and in no other direction at all.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou cannot selectively disable or hide terrain colliders. If you could, then whole squares (PQS tiles) would vanish, and you\u0027ve seen enough terrain glitches to know what they look like. Also, whenever you\u0027re judged as undeground by physics, you get destroyed.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI can\u0027t imagine where the sky goes inside a hollow planet. As far as KSP physics is concerned, you\u0027re going to get something that looks pretty ugly, assuming it works.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nRecursive/Concentric/Nested planets is a very, very bad idea. The PQS/terrain of only one planet at a time will be active and the others will not. They will be intangible and only their ScaledSpace will render. You also run the risk of inviting an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E kraken-- Either a boundlessly powerful kraken that ejects you at light speed or above when you enter an atmosphere that does not belong to the same \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E; or the one that instantly destroys you when you land on a planet but its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E edge is underground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDyson world physics is not present in KSP. There is no option to provide inverse gravity or bi-directional gravity (which pulls you properly from both sides of the hollow world surface) and make you stick to the ceiling inside a hollow world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are two mods that add parts that produce their IVAs underground but those only run on the idea of building a habitat into the surface (of the planet or an asteroid).
