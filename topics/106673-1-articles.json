I know i can move them by holding mod and using the left mouse button. But that attitude changes as soon as the kerbal moves.\n\nSo: How do you guys manage that? Am i just too blunt to figure out the right commands?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nRegards,\n\nLorunification"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T20:53:24Z","Content":"left shift moves them up.

I think this is a pretty big limitation since you can change the up-down-attitude only by switching camera mode - which is kind of annoying.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T21:19:57Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 09:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lorunification**"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T21:23:14Z","Content":"As far as I know the only way to do this is by switching camera angles.
