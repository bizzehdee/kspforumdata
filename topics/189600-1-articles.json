I have KSP on Steam, and yes, I am aware of the Betas tab. However, the tab only lets you downgrade to KSP v1.0, and I need to go further! Does anybody know if there is anyway to downgrade to say, v0.25? Any answers welcomed!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-09T05:04:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe the versions before 1.0 are no longer available, even the pre-commercial ones like .12 or whatever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"4x4cheesecake","CreatedById":187982,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-09T10:34:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt takes some effort but it\u0027s possible to download very old versions of KSP through the steam console. There are quite a few tutorials on this topic in general since it\u0027s possible for every steam game, for example this one:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1086279994\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1086279994\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe oldest available version should be 0.22, but I\u0027m not absolute sure about this. The \u0022manifest\u0022 list doesn\u0027t contain version numbers, just dates when theses were added to the library but if you compare it with the version history of KSP, you get an idea which manifest is required for a specific version:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Version_history\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Version_history\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, keep in mind that steam doesn\u0027t provide full download speed for these old versions. It is slow....really, really slow and you don\u0027t get a progression bar. You may have to wait for an hour or two to get finish the download.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
