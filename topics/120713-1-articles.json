My spaceplane isn\u0027t very heavy and several attempts land via parachute have been promising, but not great.

Unfortunately, depending on where I put the chutes, the plane will drift nose or tail first. A nose first approach and a water landing actually results in a fully recoverable aircraft with no damage, but not so much with tail first.
