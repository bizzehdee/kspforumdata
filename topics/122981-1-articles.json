If within that altitude parachute opens but at a speed of 130 m / s which as you will see is not enough. I think this is almost impossible to do contract. If someone has done Tell me please as they have done since I do not see the light at the issue. Of course gracias.-\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ForScience6686","CreatedById":144187,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-13T23:12:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe if you right click you should be able to \u0022 test\u0022 if not, adjust the Minn atmosphere up to around .65-.70 to allow you to stage without it deploying until in deeper atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HECHICERO100","CreatedById":42275,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-14T00:03:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done all that my friend and i do not abut the way I think I\u0027ll have to give up the contract.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-14T00:15:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome of these contracts have not been corrected for 1.0.4.
