I leveled off and hammered it below 20k with just the air-breathers, until I was surrounded by flames. Then I fired everything, and angled up to 45degrees, which took me out of the atmosphere, having lost only my two forward canards. I made it all the way to a 270,000m circular orbit. Here\u0027s a pic to prove it:\n\n[http://i59.tinypic.com/2hodxuf.jpg](http://i59.tinypic.com/2hodxuf.jpg) \u003C--Orbit\n\nGetting back was awkward, but I found that the key is taking a shallow entry profile and aerobraking as much as possible from 42k until reaching less than 900m/s. I just pitched up and down as much as I could, which seemed to work, but proper aerobrakes would be better.\n\n[http://i61.tinypic.com/2q06hxv.jpg](http://i61.tinypic.com/2q06hxv.jpg) \u003C--Swinging like mad\n\n[http://i62.tinypic.com/10omw3m.jpg](http://i62.tinypic.com/10omw3m.jpg) \u003C--Cooling down\n\nAnd to make my success sweeter, I arrived right near KSC, purely by chance.\n\n[http://i57.tinypic.com/htuqt2.jpg](http://i57.tinypic.com/htuqt2.jpg) \u003C--Back in one(-ish) piece!"},{"CreatedByName":"Argon","CreatedById":103523,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T23:24:34Z","Content":"Yes:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117469-1-0-compatible-SSTO%21](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117469-1-0-compatible-SSTO%21)\n\n-Argon"}]}
