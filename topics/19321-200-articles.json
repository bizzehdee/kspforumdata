Can\u0027t tell from how far zoomed out it is as to the size of the rocket body compared to the control surfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@thylordroot You have to make sure you aren\u0027t running too much TWR as going too fast will cause a ton of drag on top of your vessel. My rule of thumb for surface TWR is 1.2-1.6 at launch and no more than an ending TWR of 3. Anything faster and you\u0027ll cause too much drag loss. Anything less and you\u0027re losing too much to atmospheric drag to be decently efficient. Also make sure you start your gravity turn very early (anywhere from just past the tower with shuttle analogues up to 691 meters if I\u0027m using MJ for ascent). Also make sure your center of lift is well below center of mass to give you a solid amount of stability. Also if you know your upper stage will be inherently unstable (due to wide fairings producing a large amount of drag; use your first stage that has control surfaces to loft the rest of the rocket higher; see below for further information on that)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an example: My typical two-stage to low kerbin orbit puts a payload in position to circularize on its own anywhere from 75-100 kM. I\u0027ll go over TWRs and D/V totals shortly. This should give an idea as to what I look for when I\u0027m building rockets. First stage is around 1800-2500 D/V depending on payload size / mass etc. My typical burn time for the first stage without boosters is anywhere from 2:15 (two minutes 15 seconds) to 2:30. With SRBs mounted the burn time stays the same for the main engine; but the SRBs can vary wildly; I just look to end them with the main stage TWR above 1.2. My OCD dictates that they be a nice number but that is just for orderly purposes and has no bearing on functionality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy upper stage starts off anywhere from 1.00 to 1.4 TWR; I sometimes run less depending on my flight profile. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I run a more vertical ascent I can more easily get away with a sub 1.0 TWR and still get into orbit so long as my apoapsis is high enough to get above 1.0 TWR before reaching it; that\u0027s more based on experience and I\u0027m sure there\u0027s mathematical formula to allow prediction of that; I just fly by the seat of my pants in that regard. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpper stage due to DRE and FAR typically starts off between 20-30 kM depending on ascent profile and takes the craft to my final apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I run a three stage engine the first stage can go as low as 1500 D/V; I\u0027m looking to loft the rest of the craft far enough away from the space center that when I decouple the first stage it lands in ocean east of KSP. The second stage pushes it out of the atmosphere and the third stage is used for circulizing and transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-24T17:36:27Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2014 05:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Shad0wCatcher\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TeiwazVIE","CreatedById":116518,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T17:38:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERepost of the \u0022infinite glider plane\u0022...

I tend to think of myself as someone who does know quite a bit about aevionics, aerodynamics and/or flight sims, but nothing that usually should work seems to work with this plane and FAR. Maybe I still have to get used to it as I did have to \u0022realistic\u0022 gravity turns so my once fine rockets don\u0027t break themselves during a maneuver - but making a 50km\u002B approach with that little plane to maybe get it to land just doesn\u0027t feel right (but yes, that COULD work). Maybe I\u0027m a bit harsh here but I see the error more on the side of FAR... Don\u0027t get me wrong, I don\u0027t want to blame anyone for doing a bad job (I\u0027m a SW developer myself and know that sometimes tweaking can be a pain in the ass). The contrary. FAR is great, but in this case it\u0027s just super strange behaviour - and a mod as great as this one IMO should be...well...super awesome and not just awesome \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T21:06:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@Kolago: \u003C/strong\u003EThen that sounds like the chute is producing more drag than it should.
