The idea of it being a hard thing to master was appealing to me. Setting up the logistics of multiple Kethane rigs roaming my system was extremely fun for me. Now I understand they said it wasn\u0027t tabled for ever but the impression I got was the future of any resource collection would be tailored into some much easier process. Not sure how that will break down but I think I can throw my hat into the ring with those people here who feel somewhat disappointed. I\u0027m sure modders will step in here as they always do but making your game unsupported by the developers isn\u0027t a solution in my opinion so this is breaking down to be a huge disappointment for me.

The science modules you need to attach are single purpose parts, but that doesn\u0027t make that feature inorganic or bad. The RAPIER engine you\u0027re adding is almost exclusively useful for SSTO spacecraft, but I\u0027m greatly looking forward to it. Not every feature needs to be one size fits all for it to make sense, fit into the overall scheme of the gameplay, or enhance the enjoyment of the game as a whole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd who says resource gathering needs to be an exclusively end-game activity? Perhaps resource mining could help advance the tech tree in a similar way that science points do, or maybe you bring back resources from other planets, increasing your reputation to a level necessary to get to the next tier of the tech tree. Why is it that science points have to be the only mechanism through which career mode advances?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I don\u0027t see how requiring the integration of a part into your rocket design in order to exploit a feature is a bad thing. The Mars rover designers obviously needed to remember to attach cameras to it in order for them to take pictures - especially since they planned to take pictures from the very start of the mission. Obviously if you\u0027re going to another planet with the intent of mining resources, you\u0027re going to need to figure out how to integrate mining equipment into your design. That seems a fairly reasonable expectation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy point: You shouldn\u0027t have to eliminate the need for advanced problem solving on the part of the end user for the sake of making the game more accessible to everyone. Especially if a feature is optional. Just look at docking. You can make a single rocket design that accomplishes almost anything you want to, but docking is more realistic, more exciting, and gives you more practice than just doing that. On the other hand, maybe you want to challenge yourself to accomplish a mission on one rocket only, and that\u0027s okay too!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-16T20:35:58Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2013 08:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by tntristan12\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DominusNovus","CreatedById":88905,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T20:22:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TMS\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TMS\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGonna take a hit on that one, man.\u003Cp\u003EMost flights are reverted for that very reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have to agree very strongly on that one.
