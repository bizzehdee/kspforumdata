I realize that this is just nitpicking but I think that a change of label is needed, what are the rest of the community\u0027s opinions?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhat i meant by \u0022standalone\u0022 was that certain content downloaded off the internet is, itself a functioning product and \u0022supplementary\u0022 means that the product adds to or upon another existing product. the reason i am posting this here is because as a forum dedicated to a game whose Contents were DownLoaded via the internet, i thought other people might have something to say on the matter.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-11T21:30:48Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2014 09:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Nothing But Rubus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eclarification\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-10T00:19:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr just add new functionality in regular updates like a reasonable human being, and go back to making proper expansion packs for huge additions (or be nice and add huge additions into the game anyway)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure what you meant by \u0022standalone\u0022 vs \u0022supplementary\u0022 though.
