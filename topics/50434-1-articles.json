The radial engines available in-game are worse in every other respect than the main engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding engine clusters demands understanding the basics of why one engine is better than another. If you don\u0027t understand Isp and TWR and thrust vectoring, read up on those in various tutorials.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you understand those characteristics, you can compare things like: do you prefer a Skipper engine versus a cluster 2 T30s and 1 T45? Both have some vectoring thrust, which helps you go the right direction on ascent. The Skipper is 4 tonnes, whereas the cluster is 3.75 tonnes. The Skipper yields 650 kN whereas the cluster only yields 630 kN. The Skipper uses more fuel: Isp is 350s versus 370s for the cluster. The cluster is 5 parts to attach the engines, whereas the Skipper is one part (which matters for frame rate). For a short stage, it\u0027s a toss-up; the longer you go, the more you can benefit from that improved efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T21:06:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll direct you to the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Parts\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eparts list\u003C/a\u003E on the wiki.

Stick 4 LV-T30s on the end of Tail Connectors attached to the side of a tank and add a Skipper. You\u0027ve got an engine cluster that provides the slightly more thrust than a Mainsail engine, with better Isp. The downside is another 1.6 tonnes (for the Tail Connectors); if it weren\u0027t for that little factoid, it\u0027d be a superior choice to the Mainsail (that and you\u0027re talking about adding nine parts instead of just one).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T21:09:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can attach engines on trusses also: set the truss up radially on the tank, rotate it once so it points down, then attach the engine on that. Much lighter than a tail connector: 0 for a cube strut, 125 kg for a truss, 400 kg for a tail.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
