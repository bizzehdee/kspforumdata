I\u0027m not exactly new. I started playing KSP about 6 years ago with version 0.19.1. The game back then was a lot easier, and since I haven\u0027t played it in more than 3 years I consider myself kinda new to the game in its current form. And since it is Christmas holiday here in the Netherlands and version 1.6 came out I thought it would be the ideal moment to get back into the game, especially once I saw that Steam Cloud synch has finally been added.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m playing Science Mode with relatively harsh settings because I don\u0027t want to be constrained by economics but I also wanted realism,\u00A0a challenge and something to work for. Plus I think starting with only basic parts has its charm since you\u0027re required to be creative and won\u0027t be tempted to overengineer your vessels. Oh, and I never use mods btw, I always play vanilla and I bought the Making History DLC a few days ago, just for the parts. I read that many people didn\u0027t bother buying it, but I think it is money well spend, especially considering Squad owes me money for playing their game for 600\u002B hours. Curious about you peoples opinion on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I\u0027m still daily astonished by how far the game has come since I last touched it.\u00A0I never understood version 1.0 as the game was far from finished at that point in my opinion.\u00A0It is good to see that after version 1.0 development continued uninterrupted. I especially like the new communications system which forces you to construct functional satellites. But the fun is also in the details. If it\u0027s night at Kerbal Space Command the birds have stopped singing and you can hear crickets. All in all much progress has been made in the area of realism and atmosphere (figure of speech, although the atmospheric mechanics have also been revamped indeed).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I\u0027m not really here with any questions or suggestions. Just thought I\u0027d say hello.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-03T07:00:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome back to the forum and the game\u00A0\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/153758-puddle-jumper/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022153758\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/153758-puddle-jumper/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Puddle Jumper\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
