Scale requires a size reference (tape measure) in game that is adjustable to the size of the object you wish to make,   I looked at a Picture, Guessed the correct length for the CCB, made 2x copies and radially attached, Viola Delta IV Heavy.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E To be clear, There is no handy reference in KSP for how long a CCB tank, or an Atlas tank or a S-IC/S-1D tank etc. etc. etc. should be. It is not like KSP puts a perfect .64 scale picture on each wall of that profile so I can just chug blocks together.\n\u003E \n\nFirst off, you cannot get an Orion and upper stage off with anything that looks even \u0022ballpark\u0022 close by visually guesstimating since the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E will be too low. You have to make one so stubby it only looks like DIV heavy because it has 3 identical, orange boosters, even though they look to be about 1/2 the length they should.\n\nThe real boosters are ~40m, so in KSP they need to be around 25m.  The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E gives you vehicle height, so you can simply place an SSTU tank alone, then see how tall it is for different tank settings. The default MFT-B-3-0 tank is 7.5m long. The MFT-B-8-0 is 20m long at 2.5m diameter. The shrouded RS-68 is 3.75m diameter. A B-5-5 with the RS-68 on the bottom is 25.2m, so close enough. A scale DIV heavy should have the core as a B-5-5 with the shrouded rs-68 on the bottom. \n\n[@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/) ninjaed me.

Not so much of an option for your tanks, so I can see where the double density can be useful there.\n\nOrbital tanks -- Once in orbit it is really only mass fraction that matters (joint rigidity aside), and I believe we are in the same rough range for mass-fraction (though my tanks change depending on their \u0027type\u0027).  So for orbital tanks it really comes down to a player choice for aesthetics -- smaller and kerbal-sized, or more real-scaled behemoth-sized.  There are a few cross-over areas, such as vacuum landers on low-grav worlds where nukes/hydrolox might be used.... but I\u0027m personally fine using the honor system for those situations (and double-density actually makes sense for some of those, given the insane density used for the other overweight stock parts such as pods/lander cans).\n\nIn the end I\u0027m fine with \u0027doing nothing\u0027.  Having double-density tanks available from NF allows for some aesthetic choice for some craft designs, while the SSTU tanks will still allow for \u0027scale recreation\u0027 type setups that people seem to crave.  As long as the fuel ratios are kept consistent between the mods, the only real difference the fuel density makes is in the size of the craft (as dry mass/mass fraction should be relatively constant for a given fuel volume)."},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-12T23:31:59Z","Content":"At least if you\u0027re thinking about a players (not a modders) perspective; then IMO this isn\u0027t really a problem at all.\n\nMods are always a nice way to expand the game, and offer experiences building on the base game or subverting it.
