Right now it\u0027s kind of an annoyance to try and sync up saves. Could support for steam cloud saves or just a custom save location be added at some point? I\u0027d be happy to just point KSP to my Google Drive folder and do it that way. Sorry if this has already been suggested, I did try a forum search and looked through 25\u002B pages and found no other suggestions of this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"carbonFibreOptik","CreatedById":118600,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-11T17:14:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a helpful solution for all your syncing needs (and one I use myself for most games). Install Bittorrent Sync and then set up your saves/mods/whatever folder as a synced folder. Then install BTSync on the other computer(s) and tell them to also sync those folders. Now your games will sync whenever at least two computers are turned on and have BTSync running in the background. In effect, it\u0027s just like Steam Cloud; there\u0027s an advantage however, in that BTSync tries to use your local network ~before~using an Internet connection. It\u0027s faster as a result and you never have to worry about Internet or service downtime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso while it may use the Bittorrent protocol, BTSync uses a unique key system to make it completely private for your own use. No need to worry about prying eyes or someone stealing your stuff. :3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I agree that official Steam Cloud support makes sense for this game, unfortunately it\u0027s not an active feature at the moment. You gotta do what you gotta do until that time that it is.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beeman","CreatedById":28178,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-12T15:40:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s been said that they\u0027re never going to integrate KSP directly with any of Steam\u0027s systems. Like, it\u0027s just available for purchase and download through Steam and that\u0027s it. I think the reason is that Steam is technically DRM and they want to provide KSP to us as a completely DRM-free game, even if we get it on Steam. Also, I think it\u0027d complicate the update process if they had one DRM-free version of the game for every OS in addition to the Steam version of the game on each OS. But then, I don\u0027t know much about that stuff, so I could just be wrong on that \u0026gt;.\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, while some people(myself included) would \u003Cem\u003Elove\u003C/em\u003E to see a bit of integration with Steamworks for whatever reason, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s ever going to happen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
