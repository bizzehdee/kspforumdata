Actually it\u0027s pretty difficult to make \u0022precision moves\u0022 with the gizmo due to fact that a mouse can\u0027t be very precise. (Especially if you have a low DPI mouse, ugh notebook) It would be nice to have the same thing of manuever nodes, simply you can stay above the \u0022arrow\u0022 then moving the mouse wheel you can make precise movement."},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T12:27:06Z","Content":"Yes!\n\nAnd: have a selector to change the amount of degrees/distance.
