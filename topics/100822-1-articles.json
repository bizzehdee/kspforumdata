With Kerbin just the SAS using RW\u0027s or RCS can pretty much always hold the craft\u0027s orientation, but Eve is a completely different beast, and I can\u0027t seem to stop the flips...\n\nOh, and for anyone suggesting using \u0022Hold Retrograde\u0022, I\u0027m running 0.25 KSP, so that\u0027s kind of impossible... ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-27T13:07:34Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2015 01:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Random Tank**\n  \nAdded Pic"}]}
