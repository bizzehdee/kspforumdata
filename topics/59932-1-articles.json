Normally I don\u0027t become particularly active in online communities due to my tendency to migrate between games, and the tendency of said online communities to be full of trolls and whiny children. However I have discovered that KSP community is quite different. The experienced veterans are happy to help the new players on a daily basis. The modding community is thriving just as much now as it was 2 years ago (and maybe even more so). But most importantly, everyone is very polite and reserved. I must say these are probably some of the best game forums I\u0027ve had the privilege of being a part of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m glad I came, and I intend to stick around for the foreseeable future. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-15T06:04:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello Thrfoot. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rainbowtrout","CreatedById":60253,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-15T16:24:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHiya, it is a late into.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
