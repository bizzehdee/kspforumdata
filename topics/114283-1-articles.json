For a fraction of a second when the bug happens you can see heat spread out from the affected part. Instead of exploding it just heats up the whole craft. Using this the exact part causing the problem can be identified. Sometimes it will cook off an adjacent part first. At least this way we can watch the heat movement. This is defiantly a bug in the heating system. The part is instantly heating up. It seems to occur when the craft changes it\u0027s thermal properties by time warping, ejecting fairings or using cargo bays. It is annoyingly inconsistent but defiantly present. Some potential stock candidates for closer inspection. Thermometer, Pres Mat Barometer and of course the Docking Port Jr. All of them are fine unless in a cargo bay.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-09T09:25:50Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2015 09:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by nobodyhasthis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moostang","CreatedById":150480,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-30T16:57:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESame problem here.
