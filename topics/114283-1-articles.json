I am talking instant explosion with no time for warning. Seems the cargo bays are screwed up in 1.0.4. with the new heating system.\n\nUPDATE: Just thought of something. How many people are using Joint Reinforcement? \n\nIt affects physics loading. If got updated to switch the heat system on and off then warping might be safe again. just a thought.\n\nUPDATE 2: Switch off max heat in the cheat menu has a good diagnostic function. For a fraction of a second when the bug happens you can see heat spread out from the affected part. Instead of exploding it just heats up the whole craft. Using this the exact part causing the problem can be identified. Sometimes it will cook off an adjacent part first. At least this way we can watch the heat movement. This is defiantly a bug in the heating system. The part is instantly heating up. It seems to occur when the craft changes it\u0027s thermal properties by time warping, ejecting fairings or using cargo bays. It is annoyingly inconsistent but defiantly present. Some potential stock candidates for closer inspection. Thermometer, Pres Mat Barometer and of course the Docking Port Jr. All of them are fine unless in a cargo bay.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-09T09:25:50Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2015 09:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by nobodyhasthis**"},{"CreatedByName":"Moostang","CreatedById":150480,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-30T16:57:49Z","Content":"Same problem here. For me the large SAS module is the first item to overheat and everything else heats up to max after that. (with debug - ignore max temp enabled). This has happened several times and when it happens it always follows a time warp. There was little to no heat on the engines before the time warp.
