( i kinda wish they had been in the dark when i got there so i could see if my little spotlight arm works) as i couldn\\\u0027t stop their spin and without rcs i couldn\\\u0027t mach axis\\\u0027 and spin i decided to bump them which was about where i took the last screenshot, after the bump the rescue ship seemed to also get the spinning problem and even turning on mechjeb\\\u0027s kill rot didn\\\u0027t help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL:DR PICTURE TIME\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/819/screenshot27q.png/\u0022 rel=\u0022external
