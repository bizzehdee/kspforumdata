Did some science. Now I want to go home. But try as I might, I can\u0027t get a controlled takeoff from the Mun. I\u0027ve got a pretty simple lander...see attached. If I takeoff very slowly and carefully I can get maybe 1000m off the surface before my ship begins an uncontrollable spin. It becomes totally unresponsive to directional controls and it\u0027s impossible to thrust away from the mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess maybe the the issue is that goo pod? But I don\u0027t see how aerodynamics matter with no atmosphere. Or maybe my ship is top-heavy?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried with SAS on and off. I\u0027ve tried retracting the lander legs at various times in my flight. I\u0027ve tried keeping my velocity as low as possible. I\u0027ve tried cutting the engines when the spin starts and getting the ship back on course but again, the controls are totally non-responsive as soon as the spin starts. Can anyone explain what is going on here?\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/P1fLEoQ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022P1fLEoQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-11T06:50:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs I see no batteries or solar panels, I do believe you\u0027re running out of electricity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aphobius","CreatedById":79391,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-11T06:55:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs you burn fuel the mass of the goo pod becomes more significant and the center of mass moves towards the goo pod.
