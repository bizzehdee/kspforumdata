Using snap mode, everything (obviously) fits nicely but snaps to the fixed angles, but even without using snap mode I can\u0027t get parts to fit at a freely-rotated angle around a connection point if that makes sense. This is preventing me from a LOT of the more advanced construction tasks I want to do (mounting panels for cosmetic purposes, clipping engines into clusters, etc)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf someone has an easy technique even for something simple, like say mounting a nose-cone at a crooked angle to an otherwise vertical rocket, it would be a big help and I;m sure I could adapt that as needed elsewhere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, another thing I can\u0027t figure out, how are folks able to get engines mounted to the bottom of a fuel tank off-centered? For example, I\u0027ve seen youtube vids of folks with rockets with 3 small-diam engines mounted under 1 large-diam fuel tank. Even without snap mode, it won\u0027t let me attach parts off-center. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-21T20:29:38Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2014 08:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by tjsnh\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eanswered\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dkmdlb","CreatedById":70275,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-21T19:22:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShift \u002B WASDQE does small angle increments. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for off-center engines, put a cubic octo strut, then rotate it up into the fuel tank, and then attach the engines there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re welcome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tjsnh","CreatedById":108021,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-21T20:29:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExactly what I needed, thanks man!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
