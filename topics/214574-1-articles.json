I decided on on contracts pack (History of Spaceflight Stock), parts for it (BlueDog, Tantares and Probes Plus) and some other things (Outer Planets, Spectra for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E and Scatterer, Research Bodies with telescope mod, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Kolonization and other \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E packs, DMagic and Neheriam Science, Restock and R\u002B, Waterfall, RealPlume etc).\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt first I didnt know about AVC and other things, like that mods break tutorials (seen in Go For Orbit tutorial and its target marker going crazy and not working) which lead to two days in front of my PC doing different installs, adding one mod at a time and loading (imagine doing this everytime after installing parts).\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027ve finally made it to a point that I only get 2 errors from module manager on loading screen (connected to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E-IVA Extension and its parts.cfg file) and popup window with a conflict between B9 Part Switch and Free IVA. Bear in mind that everything works fine, at least at the start of the career and while doing tutorials (except said target marker, I know for sure that Restock breaks it, but there are mods that do this). I\u0027ve written posts about in respecitve threads and now Im awaiting answer.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo why am I here? During writing posts I learned that I should link my ksp.log in a post. I also learned that you can see errors more easily in N\u002B\u002B with Analyse Plugin. So I did that and... my jaw dropped, all excitement just went away and my head started hurting. I discovered I have a lot of yellow and red lines. I know quite a lot of those are parts ones which I should ignore, because everything will still work (except its strange that Tantares says something about missing parts while during \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E install it asks me to replace some russian parts) but it still worries me.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo my question is - is any of you smart Space Rascals can help me and take a look at the log? I know its a lot of text but some of you might have already encountered those and can quickly point out which problems are critical and/or wont resurface later in career playthrough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is my log:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/953mxs9iz4jy6xs/KSP.log?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/953mxs9iz4jy6xs/KSP.log?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThx in advance and stay safe ot there!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
