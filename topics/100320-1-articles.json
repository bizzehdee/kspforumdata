While there is fuel in the reactor core you have to constantly pump cooling water through it to prevent overheat. Usually, a small portion of turbine electric power is taken for this purpose. If the reactor is shut down for maintenance then it\u0027s powered by neighboring reactors or from outside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are also diesel generators for emergency purpose (power outage). However, they take time to start (1-3 minutes). So, how can the coolant pumps be powered while the emergency generators are starting up? There was a question how much time since the steam stops powering the turbines they would continue to spin and thus provide power to the pumps. So, there was an experiment planned to see how much time the turbines would spin down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the 25th, April 1986 personnel had to test it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, some load was needed for taking necessary measurements. The second problem was the emergency shut down system which automatically switched off the reactor if its thermal power dropped down to 700-1000 MW and there would be impossible to repeat the experiment because of the xenon poisoning of the reactor core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the switched off the emergency shutdown system (ESS) and use reserve centrifugal pumps. (First and second mistakes - there was no need to switch off the ESS, and they could use ANYTHING BUT pumps because this led to the tragedy).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.00 pm: Lowering the power of the reactor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.05 pm: The thermal power lowered from 3200 MW to 1600 MW. Turbine no. 7 stopped, electrical systems are powered from the turbine no. 8\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.00 pm: ESS blocked. At this time the \u0022KiewEnergo\u0022 operator ordered to postpone the further powering down (the end of week, energy consumption raises). The reactor works on its halved power and ESS has not been switched on again. This was a serious operation error but it had no impact on the outcome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11.10 pm: The operator allows to continue. Personnel continues to power the reactor down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApr, 26, 0.28am: Reactor is powered down so low that the personnel had to switch from local control to general (during normal operation they can move the control rods individually, but since the power was so low, all rods had to be moved simultaneously). They didn\u0027t do that. It was the third mistake. At the same time the operator makes the fourth mistake - he didn\u0027t issue the \u0027hold power\u0027 command to the control mahcinery. As a result the reactor power quickly drops down to 30 MW. Water stopped boiling in the rod shafts and xenon poisoning started. Now, the operators make the fifth mistake (or a crime, since all instructions require to shut down the reactor) - they removed all control rods from the core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.00 am: They managed to raise the thermal power to 200 MW (remember, the experiment had to be made at 700-1000 MW). Because of xenon poisoning they are unable to raise the power any higher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.03 am: The experiment starts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.07 am: The pump no. 8 is used as a dummy load. The system is not designed to work under such load and cavitation begins in the pumps (there is simply not enough water). They suck the water from the separator tanks and the water level dangerously drops there. A huge amount of cold water running through the reactor has lowered the steam generator to critical level. The contol machinery removed ALL control rods from the core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.19 am: Seeing the dangerously low water level in the separator tanks the operator increases the water supply (condensed water) and BLOCK the automatic emergency mechanism that had to shut down the reactor by the \u0027not enough water\u0027 and \u0027insufficient steam pressure\u0027 signals. This was the mistake (or crime) no. 6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.19.30 am: The water level in separator tanks starts to raise but since so much cool water runs through the reactor core the boiling process stopped. The last automatic control rods were removed from the core. At this point the operator removes the last manual control rod from the core (mistake no. 7) thus losing the ability to control the processes that take place in the reactor. The reactor is 7 meter high and it responds well when they are moved in its middle. When the rod is farther from the center the reactor response worsens. The rods move withthe speed of 40 cm/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.21.50 am: The water level in the separator tanks raised over the normal and the operator switches off several pumps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.22.10 am: The water level stabilizes, less water runs into the core. The boiling starts again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.22.30 am: The reactor control systesm are not designed to run in these conditions and only 2/3 of needed water now is pumped into the reactor, and the computer shows that the reactivity level is dangerously low. The personnel IGNORES that (another crime). All instructions tell that the reactor should be immediately stopped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.22.45 am: The thermal power of the reactor starts to raise slowly. The operators assumed that they\u0027d managed to stabilize the reactor and they decided to continue with the experiment (mistake no. 8 - all rods are removed, ESS is blocked, the reactivity is very low, all automatic shut down mechanisms are also switched off).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.23.04 am: Operators block another shutdown mechanism that is triggered when no steam is supplied to the second turbine if the first one has been previously switched off. (Turbine no. 7 has been shut down 12 hours before). This was the mistake no. 9 (and the fourth crime that night). The instruction prohibits to shut down this system for WHATEVER REASON). Simultaneously the personnel blocks the steam supply to the turbine. The experiment has started. The turbine starts to slow down, the supply voltage drops and the centrifugal pumps start to slow down as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe investigation later on has shown that if this last shutdown mechanism had not been turned off the catastrophe wouldn\u0027t have hapenned and the reactor would have been shut down automatically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.23.30 am: The centrifugal pumps have lowered their rotation speed and the water flow through the core also lowered substantially. Steam generation increased fast. The three groups of automatic control rods started to descend but they were unable to prevent the increase the thermal power buildup since there weren\u0027t enough of them. Since the steam was not supplied to the turbine its rotation slowed down and the pumps provided even less water into the core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point the catastrophe was imminent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.23.39 am: The chief operator orders to press the shutdown button. At this command the control rods should go down at maximum speed. This should have stopped the reaction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(see the pic below)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.ufo.obninsk.ru/2004/c3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022c3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s what hapenned: At 1.5 m under each control rod (4) a so called \u0027displacer\u0027 is hanged (5). This is a 4.5 m aluminum cylinder filled with graphite. Its task is to moderate the neutron capture. Graphite also captures neutrons but with less speed than borom or cadmium. When the control rods are raised maximally high the lower end of the displacer is located at 1.25 above the core. In this area the water that fills the shaft is not yet boiling. When all of the rods started to move down when the emergency shutdown button was pressed the parts of the rods that contained borom and candmium have not yet reached the core, but the displacers have displaced all water from the shaft and exposed the fuel pins. The steam generation skyroketed. The steam pressure was so high that the rods could not go any further - the steam pushed them back. They only moved for 2 meters. At this point the operator switches off the electromagnets that held the rods (the rods should free fall into the reactor at this command), but the generated steam pressure held them above the core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.23.43 am: The thermal power started to raise up to 530 MW and higher. The last two emergency systems have been triggered, but they did exactly the same that an emergency stop button which had been pressed 3 seconds earlier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.23.43 am: Within fractions of a second the thermal power has increased in 100 times and continued to raise. The fuel pins overheated and the casings ruptured. The enormous pressure has pushed the water back into the supplying pipeline, then the steam destroyed the steam pipelines above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was a moment of the first explosion. Reactor stopped being a controlled machine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the pipelines were destroyed the pressure in the reactor lowered a bit and the water could flow into the core again where it started to react with the nuclear fuel, overheated graphite and zirconium. These reactions led to fast accumulation of hydrogen and CO. The gas pressure in the reactor increased so that it lifted the lid of the reactor weighting 1000 ton (!) and destroyed all the remained pipelines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.23.46 am: The gases from within the reactor have mixed with the air oxygen which, due to high temperature, immediately exploded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was the second explosion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reactor lid flew upwards, rotated 90 degree and dropped down. The walls and the ceiling of the reactor hall were destroyed. Some part of the graphite and reactor fuel from inside flew onto the roof of the reactor building and started about 30 fires.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe chain reaction has stopped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.30 The first firefighting squad was dispatched to the site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResume: RBMK-1000 is a very good reactor and it takes quite a bit of effort and determination to explode it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-21T20:40:06Z\u0022 title=\u002202/21/2015 08:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cicatrix\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T22:22:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tex_NL\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tex_NL\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs I recall they where about to run emergency shut down tests.
