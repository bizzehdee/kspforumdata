Of course, 1.0 has made things so much better, and I\u0027m ready to get my feet wet. I\u0027ve been having some problems keeping payloads in the bay, and I\u0027ve seen a lot of designs that look like people somehow docked both ends of the payload? How does that work? If it doesn\u0027t, what are they doing?"},{"CreatedByName":"Nutter","CreatedById":1225,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T08:42:05Z","Content":"It doesn\u0027t. Best you can hope for is attaching one end to a node, and strutting the other end down solid.\n\nYou\u0027ll need mods if you want to get your cargo back the same way, though.\n\nYou could try some of that multiple-docking-nodes magery, but that would require a painfully snug fit, and would probably end up with your payload permanently stuck in the bay."}]}
