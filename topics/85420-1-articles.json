Jeb was dead, ( listed as missing but he did respawn) and my ship was lost. no file nothing at all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly thing I can add was, I was trying contracts and the ship jeb was flying had parts from a previous contract, a landing gear assembly, a part that I had not researched but was offered a contract to test it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E the ship has a warning ****Contains locked or invalid parts ***** debug is not flagging it as a problem so I do not know... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I can reproduce it it will let you know.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
