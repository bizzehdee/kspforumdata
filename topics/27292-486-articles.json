To reduce weight, the satellite and rovers were pumped dry of mono in the VAB. There was mistake during launch where Bob didn\u0027t check the mono in the sat and the rovers, so he could pump leftover propellant from the transfer stage mono tank to the satellite and rovers. So the Scansat \u0026amp; rovers are nil on mono. Also during the transfer to the Mun, he made the 2 new guys EVA to the habitation module and told them not to touch anything, he was going to handle the workload himself. They screamed the whole trip like 2 year olds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have 2 landers (Habitation \u0026amp; Return), Mission Control was going to land one, then on the next orbit land the other but Bob decided he could land them together while still connected. Landing went well and had some spare monoprop so Bob could transfer to the rovers that were still attached to the lander. Upon landing, he decoupled the rovers and the return lander. Once doing this, Mission Control was told they lost the habitation module. We were then notified that there was no remote guidance unit installed on the habitation module. There was no monoprop fuel to re-dock the rovers to the habitation module. Bob was livid, so he had to play with the rovers to dock them. Now one rover is left docked to the habitation module so it has a guidance module leaving the other rover usable. He also found out there was only ONE KAS fuel end pipe so he couldn\u0027t refuel the monoprop in the rovers. He ranted and raved, stomped his feet, and took a surface sample.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen Mission Control readjusted the orbit for the mun scanning satellite to 240/241 (km) in a mostly polar orbit once Bob went back into his capsule and begged for a supply mission BEFORE the mining mission arrives. Mission Control is looking at a way of sending a few more KAS supply crates, and some probe cores attached with KAS winches with the science phase which was planned for the last launch. The director is pushing for that launch to be the next one instead of the last, or as a possibility of an additional mission.

There\u0027s no way to bring it back on auto so it\u0027ll need a pilot at the controls. Mission Control sees the need to retrofit a probe core to the next generation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/J3crCbW.png\u0022 alt=\u0022J3crCbW.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe MUL\u0027s reaction wheels had failed sometime prior, and due to a spare parts conflict, can\u0027t be fixed on orbit. RCS is enough to get the ship out of orbit, but there\u0027ll be no attitude control after the service module separates. Chadvey knows he\u0027s in for a bumpy ride.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/r6vWdZ4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022r6vWdZ4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR and an offset center of mass let the MUL pod fly a lifting entry usually, keeping G load to around 4 and \u0022gliding\u0022 farther. But it\u0027s unstable and needs attitude control from the wheels. Without that, the pod falls in a ballistic course and begins rolling wildly. After being weightless for six months Chadvey is subjected to well over seven G\u0027s during reentry, and that doesn\u0027t count the spinning. He wisely refrained from eating today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/459FbCu.png\u0022 alt=\u0022459FbCu.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe\u0027s way off course too. Instead of landing in the ocean just east of KSC he\u0027s heading for the barren desert of Cocomor. But finally the chutes open, the braking thrusters fire and he thuds back to Kerba firma. The MUL pod is designed for a water landing, but can land on land. It just sucks more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BmU9bJL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022BmU9bJL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChadvey crawls out of his pod, happy to be home. His...hair... had turned from black into bright white. He said that it was from when the pod had smashed so hard (And a texture replacer head pack).
