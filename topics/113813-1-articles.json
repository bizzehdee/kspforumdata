Temp is about 600K\n\nI check the MK1 Capsule its protecting and its only at about 550K\n\nBut there is this temp warning bar that shows up. Its not for the heat shield, and its not for the MK1.\n\nBut it looks like it\u0027s right in between the two.\n\nThe temp is climbing and climbing and climbing. But the temp of the heat shield and mk1 are both bellow 50% of there max.\n\nEventually the bar reaches full RED!!! then BAM!!! everyone dies!!!\n\nWhat happened?\n\nWas that the internal temperature of the mk1? And why is it getting hotter then the outside?\n\nI used to be able to tweak the reentry heat factor to make the game a challenge.\n\nBut now I cant. Why is ksp going backwards?\n\nI used to be able to customize the game to my liking, but now it seems that I can\u0027t.\n\nHow is so much heat getting inside my capsule while the outside stays relatively cool?\n\nThanks\n\nPS : Not using FAR"},{"CreatedByName":"rofltehcat","CreatedById":145224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T07:02:57Z","Content":"If you press F3, what is the part that exploded first?"},{"CreatedByName":"Solar71","CreatedById":140993,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T07:34:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If you press F3, what is the part that exploded first?\n\nYou know what? I didn\u0027t check that. Good point. I assumed it was the MK1. But to be 100% sure I will re create the mission and check this time. \n\nBut for now, let\u0027s say it was the internal heat from my mk1. \n\nReason I say this is, it was an mk1 and heatshield. I didn\u0027t have anything external attached like science stuff. Only a single stock nose cone parachute. And it wasn\u0027t even hot at all. \n\nSo so it was a total of three parts. Parachute mk1 heatshield. All of them bellow 50% of max temp. \n\nExcept for that heat bar that I couldn\u0027t locate, but looked like it was in between the heatshield and the mk1. \n\nSorry I can\u0027t give more data right now, I turned off my PC and I\u0027m in bed on my iPad.

You too...\n\nI can tell you one thing. When I release a stage and it starts falling away, sometimes the parts will just explode!\n\nBut that doesn\u0027t effect my main craft.\n\nBut the overheating and exploding of the heat shield does... lololol ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nPS: I think this might be an actual bug because I went into steam, and now its telling my there is an update to Kerbal space program.\n\nBut I just did the update yesterday, or the day before. (cant remember).\n\nBut today its saying there is an update again. But when I go into the download manager, it shows KSP waiting for an update but it doesn\u0027t start.\n\nOr it hasn\u0027t started yet. So im wondering if a hotfix is on its way?\n\nThanks\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nOk I just learned something.\n\nWhenever im in reentry and I put the time scale to x2 the heat starts to shoot up.\n\nI put it back down to x1 and the heat literally drops back down.\n\nEventually the part still overheats and explodes. But lower in the atmosphere.\n\nSo it looks a little bit like a timewarp bug \u002B a heating bug, because time warp shouldn\u0027t make things heat up more, just faster because of the accelerated time.\n\nBut when you lower the time warp the parts shouldn\u0027t actually cool down."},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T03:45:54Z","Content":"I ran a few test runs this morning with the 2.5m heatshield and three man capsule and had the heatshield overheat and explode a few times on steep descents well before the ablator is used up."},{"CreatedByName":"Solar71","CreatedById":140993,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T05:38:50Z","Content":"seems strange right? or is that what you were expecting?\n\nI mean, shouldn\u0027t the ablator be exhausted before exploding? or does it only need to get \u0022LOW\u0022\n\nI had my heat shield blow up with 50/200 ablator and another time with close to 100/200.\n\nNot sure whats happening but I just tried something that someone else said in the forums.\n\nI renamed my KSP folder so that Steam thinks its gone. Then I click on the KSP in my games list inside steam (it still displays it)\n\nThen there is a menu that pops up, inside that menu it has 3-4 choices. One of the choices is \u0022Verify Files and Content\u0022 \n\nClick it... Then It tries to see if KSP files are all ok... It says Failed, can not Verify content.... \u0022Re-Acquiring\u0022\n\nBasically it re-downloads KSP so you get a new, fresh install.\n\nThen I copy over my mods. And so far it seems to be working better. But I will do more testing.\n\n![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
