Temp is about 600K\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI check the MK1 Capsule its protecting and its only at about 550K\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there is this temp warning bar that shows up. Its not for the heat shield, and its not for the MK1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it looks like it\u0027s right in between the two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe temp is climbing and climbing and climbing.
