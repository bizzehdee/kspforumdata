For 1 week, we do things relating to this topic. And this year, we managed to get a Kerbal Space Program Winterem. Our school will do some fundraising before hand. We\u0027ll probably go to an observatory and see a Space Shuttle. On Wednesday, we\u0027ll actually start playing Kerbal, and probably go home early. Thursday and Friday we will stay at school overnight and play a lot of Kerbal. I was wondering if anybody had any advice or tips on how our school could make this successful. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps goals we could set or objectives to meet.
