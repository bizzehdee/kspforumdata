I envision a 6 crew ship - 3 rotating shifts of an engineer and a doctor on duty - providing backup to cover for contingencies where some crew are knocked out of commision. Also spare crew to provide support for EVA, complex repairs or surguries. Could everything else be entrusted to automation or remote command?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s be realistic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGravity is not an option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is a necesscity for crew health on any long duration mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6 crew is fine, but more than likely tethered ship spun pods away from the ship will be rhe only gravity they have.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anything dangerous occurs they would need notice ahead of time since they have to reel the tether and pod back into the spaceship to work things out in weightless on the main ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpace travel is hard.
