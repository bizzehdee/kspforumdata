Throughout the war, the Army and Navy had conducted numerous trials of various early sounding rockets, including WAC Corporal and the later Aerobee.

Glushko and Korolev incorporated this research into the Soviet program, however, they knew that the war was not going in their favor. Thus, the Soviets decide to send a significant amount of their findings to the West, which would later be crucial for American engine development.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the same time, Wernher von Braun was on the verge of being ousted from Germany\u2019s rocketry program. Having already been arrested once by the Gestapo for his drunken remarks, Wernher was steadily losing the trust of the regime. Fearing for his career and his life, he and a handful of engineers secretly contacted the Allies to discuss defection. In March 1946, officers received the order to remove Wernher from Peenamunde and place him under house arrest pending further investigation of his loyalty. By the time they arrived, however, he had been extracted by an OSS team working in conjunction with Operation Archimedes, a larger series of raids along the North German coast. Wernher and his team were eventually transferred to Fort Bliss to assist the Army Ordnance Corps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus, the Zephyr series of ballistic missiles was born.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022kmnntoF.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/kmnntoF.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EAn MX-800 soars off the pad.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022cflKNVi.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/cflKNVi.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EMX-900 begins trials in the skies of New Mexico.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first Zephyr model, the MX-800, featured a detachable nosecone for payload return, a slimmer 1.5-meter airframe compared to the V-2, and a Russian-inspired XLR-41A engine. Later variants saw a larger 1.8-meter airframe, engine thrust improvements, and much higher mass overall. The Zephyr not only served as a precursor for missile weaponry, but it, like other sounding rockets of the time, provided valuable data about the upper atmosphere and space. Biological experimentation with insects and mice also laid the foundation for future manned spaceflight.

This was combined with what would be the largest and last iteration of the Zephyr, the MX-900. Zephyr-Able performed a record-breaking 5000 km downrange flight in 1953.

The American election was nothing but chaotic. The Republican Party, though ostensibly backing Earl Warren for re-election, was hopelessly splintered. Although Warren appealed to moderate Republicans on paper, his weak foreign policy, isolationist views, and the economic downturn of the 1950s lost him much of his mainstream support. The launches of Vanguard 1 and 2 were both quickly overshadowed by news of Republican infighting. A sizable faction of Republican leaders clamored for a stronger candidate, one who was more conservative than Warren domestically, but more interventionist on the global stage. This faction eventually broke off to form the American Conservative Party, which also attracted many southern Democrats who supported segregation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, there was a rising, perhaps revisionist sentiment that Democrat misguidance had led to the fascist victory. In the few years after the war, Roosevelt was credited with repelling the German invasion of England and preserving countless American lives by withdrawing from Africa. Henry A. Wallace, who had become president after Roosevelt\u0027s death, was initially lauded for making peace and putting an end to the bloodiest conflict in human history - enough to narrowly win another term in 1948. As the reality of a German-dominated world dawned upon the nation, however, critics were quick to point out his weaknesses. Opinions of the Amsterdam Treaty that ended WW2 also quickly soured. The public agreed that the agreement offered too many concessions to the Axis, especially regarding the handover of overseas colonies and the inclusion of trade guarantees.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus, competition for the Democratic nomination was fierce, with many candidates vying to turn the party around and shift its image. Major contenders included Missouri Senator Harry S. Truman, New York Governor Thomas Dewey, and Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver. Ultimately, the party nominated Kefauver. He campaigned on reviving Roosevelt and Wallace\u0027s New Deal, anti-German diplomacy, and military reform. His silence on the matter of the Civil Rights Movement further appealed to swing voters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, the Farmer-Labor Party, which had steadily gained popularity since the early 1930s, became even more important on the national stage. It rebranded itself as the Progressive Labor Party, landing 6 seats in the Senate and over a dozen seats in the House. The social democratic PLP strongly supported integration, unionization, relaxed immigration restrictions, and interventionism.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter an even closer election than that of 1948, Estes Kefauver was elected as the 36th President of the United States.

The atrocities of the Holocaust were being repeated a hundred-fold throughout Europe and Africa. The Reich was not even trying to hide it anymore. Some people had wishfully believed that Germany\u0027s 1957 market crash would slow the Pact down, but the economic conditions seemed to only heighten the regime\u0027s cruelty.

The Army Space Projects Agency (ASPA), formerly known as the Army Ballistic Missile Agency before its role was subsumed by the Air Force, was later transferred to NASA in October 1958. ASPA\u2019s facility in Edgewood, Maryland would become NASA\u2019s premier rocketry development site \u2013 Eisenhower Space Flight Center (ESFC). Its proximity to both Langley Research Center and the soon-to-be-established Goddard Space Flight Center led to its rapid growth. JPL was also placed under NASA and was assigned to develop the Deep Space Network. Wernher von Braun, who had been largely sidelined by ASPA due to his security risks, was transferred to EFSC and began work on a medium-lift launch vehicle alongside Konrad Dannenberg (and under close American supervision).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022JZFAYLG.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/JZFAYLG.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNASA\u2019s first launch would be the 8th and final Vanguard launch attempt.

In Cuba, a US-supported communist government came into power. While American businesses were unhappy with the nationalization of industries, it had become clear that Batista was developing German ties behind the US\u2019s back.

Germany also experienced a massive recession in 1957, dragging much of the Europa Pact with it. In the US, President Kefauver spearheaded economic reforms and strengthened the nation\u2019s welfare system, taking action where Earl Warren had not. While Henry Wallace managed to get the Economic Bill of Rights (originally proposed by FDR) ratified in 1949, most of its goals were only partially fulfilled. The Democrats under Kefauver sought to rectify this through increased public works projects, education funding, anti-trust legislation, and healthcare reform. As the nation pulled out of the recession, the \u201CThird New Deal\u201D became widely popular among the American public.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRacial tensions, however, continued to grow unaddressed during Kefauver\u2019s term. Although initially wary of pushing for a civil rights act due to pressure from Southern Democrats and conservative voters, Democratic leadership was facing another issue: the rise of the Progressive Labor Party. In 1959, Kefauver realized that there was nowhere to run. If his administration outlawed segregation and discrimination, there would be major backlash from the party\u2019s right, and reactionary voters would flock to the currently tenuous Conservative-Republican Coalition (which had formed in the wake of the 1958 midterm election). But if his administration refused to act, the Progressive Labor Party was poised to take the civil rights mantle, and many progressive Democrats with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this juncture, Kefauver opted for the former option and signed the Civil Rights Act of 1959 into law \u2014 prohibiting segregation in public facilities and employment discrimination based on race, sex, or religion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Civil Rights Act faced swift backlash from both sides of the spectrum. The Conservative-Republicans used it as a rallying cry for the 1960 election campaigns. The Progressive Labor Party criticized the Act for not going far enough, especially in addressing discrimination in private businesses and racial-economic inequality. Ultimately, it cost Kefauver his re-election.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Chr\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, NASA had become a poster child for integration. Its facilities were already desegregated as of 1957, and it soon employed a significant number of Black mathematicians and engineers. Although the G.I. Bill did not benefit veterans of color proportionately, expanded programs under Wallace enabled more educational opportunities, even if many schools remained segregated. Thousands of Black men received formal training and college degrees, many finding themselves at NASA. Thus, the rise of the Satellite Age was due in no small part to the contributions of the minority workers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1960 saw a new host of satellites used for different purposes. First, NASA initiated the Explorer Program to oversee science missions in Earth orbit. On January 2, Explorer 1 was launched into a highly elliptical orbit. It was followed by Explorer 2 on July 27.

Germany had already achieved the first Lunar flyby in 1958 and the first probe to reach escape velocity from Earth. With little margin for error, NASA devised a new, 1.5m AJ-10 powered stage to perform the TLI burn.
