Now when I load my save and enter the VAB, the parts list appears but the categories to the left of the parts are missing, and whenever a part is selected it just jumps to the center of the floor. Parts on existing craft cannot be selected. This occurs with and without mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the odd bit: if I load a new career save, everything works correctly, and if I load my old save afterwards, everything works! Now if I load the old save first on booting up KSP, the vab will break, and will also be broken in the NEW save if I switch save files without restarting the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess this is technically a workaround, but it\u0027s a pain in the backside to have to load two save files every time I start the game. Does anyone have any thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wojtus","CreatedById":145802,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T12:44:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve reported similar problem.
