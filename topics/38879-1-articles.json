I\u0027ve been playing KSP for a while now (since .19, consistantly), and finally got around to buying it on steam. I don\u0027t want to start a debate on the ethics of piracy, but I will say that I would never have purchased this game at all if I hadn\u0027t pirated it. I downloaded the demo ages ago, gave up on it, not having had any fun, and would have continued to let this game fade out of memory if I hadn\u0027t given it a second chance torrenting the full (and substantially more up to date) version several months later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA big thank-you to the community for building awesome things. Your massive space stations, carriers, and many other oddities inspired me to make many creations of my own and got me interested enough in the game to give it not only my time of day, but finally my money as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T23:46:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ascensiam","CreatedById":12621,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T01:18:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome aboard the forum train!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
