So the file is there in it\u0027s proper folder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan anyone give me a file example of what I need to add into the .cfg to make sound play?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0- so far I have : The part file, the visual effect cfg\u00A0file (with a lot of lines, the one actually\u00A0creating the visual effects) and\u00A0the RealPlume \u0022master\u0022 config file (the small one)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks for any help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
