I\u0027m getting to the point where Docking is going to be useful. Do I have to connect crew section to crew section, or can I connect to anywhere on the ship and have the Kerbals make it through? If I connect non-crew to crew section, will it still lock, even if they can\u0027t pass through? Will a docking Port allow fuel to pass through, or is that a different part?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RizzoTheRat","CreatedById":123362,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-03T10:36:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNope, you put them on the end of a girder and still move Kerbals and fuel through them.\u00A0 It\u0027s a bit unrealistic but you can always define your own play style to not use them in that way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeiss Ikon","CreatedById":174016,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-03T11:54:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs long as all the other parts between tanks have crossfeed, you can feed fuel ( more generally, resources) through the port.\u00A0 If you\u0027re using Passable Parts mod, what the port is mounted on will affect kerbals passing through the port as well...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
