Landing on Mun is hard, the ground around the arches is uneven which makes it harder, and it\\\u0027s a stone bitch to land safely while aiming at a certain location on top of that. And doing it on your first mission is just showing off. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E I\\\u0027m envious. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it\\\u0027s okay if it was just luck.

And it was mostly luck that I was anywhere near the arch.
