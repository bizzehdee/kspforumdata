But also a little power consumption per kerbal to account for light usage, refrigeration and what nots.\n\nBy the way, I don\u0027t if it already exists but nice icon for the alternate resource panel would be nice.\n\nTo do the immediate on strike and adding resources to crewed modules is relatively easy.
