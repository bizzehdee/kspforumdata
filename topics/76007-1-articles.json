Unfortunately, the mod appears to be dead as there hasn\u0027t been an update to the mod in over a year and the original creator also appears to be inactive for an equal period of time. The bad news is, the original creator did not specify a license, which defaults to \u0022All Rights Reserved\u0022. As such, there is no way that we of the KSP community can continue Semni\u0027s work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe good news, however, is that multiple people have taken the initiative to re-create THSS (or similiar) from scratch. Those people being myself, Biotronic (developer of TweakScale and Strip Symmetry), and Greys (developer of HexCans and Virgin Kalactic). Currently, all three of us are developing our THSS derivatives independently. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m starting this thread in hopes of starting a collaboration on the future re-development of this wonderful mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, I have worked on the models for several replacements to the aging THSS, though I originally chose to move in a slightly different direction. My inspiration for my rendition is a modular construction system with the THSS at the core. As such, I scaled down my version of the THSS so that it\u0027s radius with it\u0027s radially attached modules would be the same radius as stock fuel tanks. Which is unlike the original THSS as it\u0027s trusses were of a larger radius than the stock 1.25m tanks.

The goal here is to cut the mesh into pieces that can be lain flat with as little distortion of the faces as possible, while also not overlapping itself. For example, you might take one of the little pockets on your trihex, mark all the edges at the top of the pocket, mark the vertical edges, and mark around the circle in the middle. If it were a perfect trapezoid this alone would let the sides lay flat in a sort of irish cross pattern, but your curved edge will make that more complicated. There are several different ways to unwrap that particular section and I\u0027m probably not the best advisor as far as UVs go, I have rather asinine goals when I unwrap things. The easy way would be to take every \u0027surface\u0027 and mark it off from the rest, this will give you a lot of rectangles and some other shapes, but it will make texturing more opaque. A good unwrap really helps the texturing to make sense later on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour mesh happens to be rather complicated but you\u0027ll have plenty of time to revise it, but keep one thing in mind. Semni did almost no texture work on his parts, they were unwrapped only so well to allow pipe coloring and then the texture sheet was two regions of solid color.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main advantage that a proper UV unwrap on the main truss pieces offer is the ability to have an Ambient Occlusion layer to the texture. AO is a render blender (among other software) every pixel of the texture, finds where on the mesh that pixel goes, and do a lot of raycasting to determine where and by how much that point is occluded from infinity. This effectively creates a map of the natural universal shadows of the mesh. For instance, the bottom face of the top trihex peice near the pole is more occluded than most other parts of that mesh, so regardless of light sources and orientation that place on the part will always receive less light, therefore on the AO \u0027bake\u0027 it will be darker. Does that make sense?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s an example: This is an engine I\u0027m working on, in the first picture is the mesh rendered flatly without any texture and shaded based on it\u0027s angle vs the light source\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WcdhUDP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022WcdhUDP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this second picture is the AO bake with no lighting applied to the render, all shadows are part of the texture\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KEDHq8H.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KEDHq8H.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then take this AO bake and make it a layer in the texture as I assemble it, vary the intensity and sometimes fiddle with the levels; I bake it normalized, so the darkest shadows are black and the brightest parts are white regardless. In the end I get a texture that looks maybe something like this\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EKchS9s.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EKchS9s.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe marbling was caused by having blender set to a low bake sample count, I was only told about this setting recently, but I think it looks pretty appropriate for this material and my themes. Yours would probably look better with the higher samples.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been writing this post for two hours.... I don\u0027t remember what I was talking about, whatever. AOs make things pretty, UV mapping supports better looking and easier to work with textures, but you can largely ignore it of you want to go simple. Might be worthwhile for now just to get things moving, but in the long run AOs will make the pockets on your trihex pieces look amazing, without they may not even be visible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Oh that\u0027s right, step 2! Once you have the mesh unwrapped properly it\u0027s a matter of assembling the \u0027islands\u0027, faces of the UV that are connected to eachother, onto the texture. Blender can do this automatically, but reorganizing it by hand can make it again easier to comprehend while texturing, and aligning straight lines to the X/Y axis where possible can help to prevent jaggy edges (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cd2AxNg.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esuch as here\u003C/a\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-27T05:11:31Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2014 05:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Greys\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sudragon","CreatedById":53192,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-27T05:47:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI may be completely ignorant here, but is it possible to use procedural tech to allow variable length struts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-27T06:07:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s quite a bit of good information on texturing, UV maps, and AO in the last Open Part Mod thread: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81024-The-Open-Part-Mod-Week-23-5-Project-started-Texturing?p=1180360\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1180360\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81024-The-Open-Part-Mod-Week-23-5-Project-started-Texturing?p=1180360\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1180360\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood AO layers can really improve the look of your parts.
