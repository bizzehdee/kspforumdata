Also, in your testing, were you using skillful with it? i believe it is skillful that is doing this. I added turrets to the carrier and the bow was completely misaligned. I took them off and loaded the stock carrier and it was all good. Although the time the whole carrier teleported i had only docked the r5 wasp and shark. I dont believe i changed anything besides removing the rudder towards the front of the carrier. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother small bug i\u0027ve noticed, with the large propellers, when i turn them off using the 6 (i think) action key, the animation and sound stop, but the carrier still accelerates as if they are on. It\u0027s not a big deal. Also there is no action group to reverse the engines, but the carrier does seem to decelerate faster in the water so idk if there is a need for this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Random Tank","CreatedById":104325,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-21T02:12:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Endersmens\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Endersmens\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI added turrets to the carrier and the bow was completely misaligned.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wCcztPs.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022wCcztPs.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t have a problem with turrets on my carrier... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does hate the CoM shift though, causes it to steer slightly, so I fixed this with weight added internally; also (as shown), that thing weighs just a shy under 800t, and with the standard 6 engines it only goes 22m/s.
