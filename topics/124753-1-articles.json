Since then, I get a few odd glitches in just my saves that I played in with that mod running before. The main issue is that in the VAB, I have no categories to choose parts from, meaning I cannot make any ships. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried reinstalling the entire game twice, and just bring back the saves, but they still don\u0027t work. Although new games on a fresh install do work. Is there any way to fix this issue, or is my saved game just broken? It\u0027ll be kind of disappointing considering I\u0027ve put dozens of hours into my current save, and I have one old backup of the save that would make me lose like 20 hours of gameplay. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way though, help would be greatly appreciated. Also, please understand that i\u0027m not angry with the mod, or the creator of the mod. This was entirely my mistake, as I should have backed up my save beforehand. I didn\u0027t back it up because I\u0027ve never had a saved game break because of a mod before, but considering this was a WIP mod, I should have considered it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a pic of what i\u0027m seeing in the VAB:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2PoSBFX.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222PoSBFX.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-08T21:26:59Z\u0022 title=\u002211/08/2015 09:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by aazo5\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MalevolentNinja","CreatedById":150038,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-09T15:49:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESee that black arrow in the upper left hand corner of your screen shot?
