I dont assume a bug so anyone can tell me why this happens ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhy does the ship explodes at double speed and not at normal speed. Makes no sense, looks like im the first one to report this, otherwise this would have been fixed at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2nd: inside my mk3 cargo-bays items start to overheat without any reason and spontaneously explode, while the cargobay itself and all other parts of the ssto stay cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis happens even if the ship is already in a stable orbit, outside of the atmosphere. For no good reason at all, because the parts never cool down even with radiators installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhat did i wrong ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3rd: while setting warp (at any time) or trying to launch the ship, or for no reason at any random spot my ssto spontaneously dissassembles without no reason. or explodes without any reason at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4th: while trying to land the ship spontaneously explodes or dissassembles with no reason at all so a ssto that with no problem (if nothing of the 3 points over here hit) launched just falls apart like small babys wooden blocks. if i touch down slow enough the ship falls apart with no explosion at all just a mess of quite a large number of parts laying around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI desperately need a guide that carefully explains to me, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhat sort of \u0027looks like it fits perfectly together\u0027 game mechanic is not supposed to be used by the player. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe software designers must have published a list what \u0027looks like it fits\u0027 game mechanic shall absolutely not be used togehter because otherwise \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ereally really obvious things like \u0027fitting mk3 parts together creates a connection\u0027 would have been implemented in the game so far. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecan anyone please give me a link to that list ? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm just out of any further ideas because all parts fits perfectly together and crashing in the ground is for me a good explanation for a explosion. but\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ejust out of nothing there is no real reason to explode. things usually dont explode by being put together and being watched at higher speeds, because speeded time itself \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eonly affects the growth of trees but not the behave of machinery (let out corrosion but corrosion doesnt appear in space at all).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(maybe im to old to get the joke in that ?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eactual version i play is 1.04\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eadded screenshots:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.tholianer.de/bilder/screenshot1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewobbling all the way up is fine, adds somewhat realism to the rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut dissassembling like that\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.tholianer.de/bilder/screenshot2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand suddenly its like that\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.tholianer.de/bilder/screenshot3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edoesnt make me laugh.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-01T18:16:30Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2015 06:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sirad\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadded screenshots\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
