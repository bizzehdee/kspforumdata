I add my own systems (Waypoints, orbital waypoints) that are only used in my contracts. The Contract System is not modified, nor are any base contracts. I can tell you that there are more factors to rewards than are in the briefing, like agency personality, and good old fashioned RNG.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as how many of my contracts are showing up, again, there can be only two of any given type at a time, and it\u0027s not even guaranteed to be that.

Fine Print does not determine what contracts get chosen to fill the board, but it does limit those choices to two per type specifically to prevent the situations you are describing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t speak for the rewards on Explore missions, as those are stock and I have no way of modifying that code at all. As far as the rewards for my contracts, I\u0027m aware that they might be too hardcore in some instances, but that\u0027s because of the way the game scales the rewards based on location. Sometimes they pay way too much on the outer planets, and I have to balance the inner planets with that in mind. It\u0027s a work in progress, and I\u0027m hoping that once I implement configuration, everybody can tweak this to their own liking and actually help me balance the mod with the values they come up with.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-19T05:14:11Z\u0022 title=\u002208/19/2014 05:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Arsonide\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-19T05:09:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t suppose either of you is also using my [thread=80220]Celestial Body Science Value Editor[/thread]?

In a lot of my testing for aerial missions I did this one mission over a beautiful archipelago I never even knew existed with this river delta sort of thing going on.
