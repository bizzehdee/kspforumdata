Trying to figure out aerodynamics! 8) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I\u0027ve discovered what the B-52 is like to design and fly a bit. The tilted wings and help with take off and the forward engines are for stability. I\u0027ve been putting my center of thrust behind my center of lift. Old habbit from before 1.0 Having it behind gives alot of stability. At least to this setup. It was interesting compared to my other craft. It is also more forgiving to shifting COM\u0027s! Good for bomber/loader craft!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I just need to figure out how to stabalize it\u0027s nose without SAS on and figure out how to get into orbit in an SSTO again!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1262.photobucket.com/albums/ii613/PicsMe101/KSP/Screenshot%20from%202015-09-02%2003-52-56_zpso84cfwde.png~original\u0022 alt=\u0022Screenshot%20from%202015-09-02%2003-52-56_zpso84cfwde.png%7Eoriginal\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-02T08:37:08Z\u0022 title=\u002209/02/2015 08:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheGamingNoobster","CreatedById":94887,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-02T08:16:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst thing... When you say B-52, I (and probably many) think of the U.S. jet bomber that has operated with the U.S.A.F. for a fair few amount of years.

But I meant the wing setup. It has similar wing angles and somewhat relative engine placement. That is what I meant by B-52ish. And as far as I can tell it flies like it. The only difference may be the position of the tail fin to the wings and stuf. You could extend the fuselage or place the engines under the wing and put it back farther. I wonder how it would fly differently. As is it flies pretty stable. Outside of using the air breaks for flight stability that is. Maybe the tail back farther would stabalize the nose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I was using the airbreaks to watch the crafts aerodynamics. It lets you see it as you fly better.
