Just aesthetic reasons?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, there is several of them, first it is much easier to build on the plots that you have in your modeling software and not having to match with the terrain in game. Also, it\u0027s possible to make streets that match buildings and plots perfectly making it look \u0022harmonious\u0022. Second, the terrain might change in the future (Squad does this from time to time), so if you build something on land and follow the landscape, the terrain could change in some version and your stuff is suddenly underground and if you try to correct it you see that you should rather redesign everything. On the other hand, you are always sure that water will always be flat and at 0. The only case when I matched the road with terrain was with the road that connects Eastern island and airport, so I had to risk in case of future terrain changes, and it still was really difficult to set up in game, (I still have to perfectly match the bridge end to end). ALSO, it is possible to create your own terrain as a model AAAND it is also possible to dig tunnels through it if you wish, which are not possible through standard terrain. If you wonder what is the reason the islands are flat is just cause it\u0027s easier to put things on it (and less work for me xD).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Robotengineer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Robotengineer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECan I apply?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course you can.

Also, it\u0027s possible to make streets that match buildings and plots perfectly making it look \u0022harmonious\u0022. Second, the terrain might change in the future (Squad does this from time to time), so if you build something on land and follow the landscape, the terrain could change in some version and your stuff is suddenly underground and if you try to correct it you see that you should rather redesign everything. On the other hand, you are always sure that water will always be flat and at 0. The only case when I matched the road with terrain was with the road that connects Eastern island and airport, so I had to risk in case of future terrain changes, and it still was really difficult to set up in game, (I still have to perfectly match the bridge end to end).
