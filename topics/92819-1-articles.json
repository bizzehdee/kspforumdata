Is it possible to make a plugin, or a program, that will use some of computer\u0027s resources, that KSP dont use due to its...uhm.. unablity?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt should be like this. I run the game AND that program. When KSP starts lagging from physics calculations, or lacks some memory - here that program comes in. It basically uses unused resources to help KSP with data processing, or memody usage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis possibly will help a lot when using large crafts with numerous parts, or multi-module crafts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-14T14:25:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBe patient. When a stable Unity 5 arrives it won\u0027t take too long before SQUAD decides to use it for KSP. Unity 5 is said to support 64bit and multi threading.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rasip","CreatedById":127136,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-14T14:43:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022-force-opengl\u0022 moves some of the textures to your graphics card\u0027s ram.

You may not using them on the current vessel but maybe another one is using them and if you will fly in the Physical range (\u002B/-2.5km) the game will need to pause and load that parts ( it may take couple of secounds).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnity / physX 2.8 ( what unity 4 uses ) should have garbage collector functions , how good they are filtering unused data and unloading them from RAM idk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnity 5 will use physX 3.3 , it\u0027s much faster ( early test showed 2.5x faster processing ) and supports multi-core processing. So let\u0027s hope KSP will be moved to Unity 5 when it will be released.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
