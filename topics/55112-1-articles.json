It is a little long to put the whole thing in one post (7 pages typed, single-spaced), so I am separating the story into smaller parts and will post each part separately over a period of time. I\u0027m afraid that there are no pics to go along with it, but I think it can be enjoyed just as easily. Without further ado...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EThe Beleaguered Return (Part I)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust before opening the hatch of the capsule that would carry him home, Newney Kerman looked back down at the little flag he had planted and all the tracks he left in the fine dust of the M\u00FCnar surface. He couldn\u0027t help but marvel at where he was and how as a kid looking up at the M\u00FCn he would have never dreamed he would be walking on its gray surface. He smiled and, feeling as content as a young child, turned and opened the hatch to his little spacecraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNewney stowed the small satchel that held the rocks and soil he collected under his seat just as he had been shown back on Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Lift the seat\u0022, he muttered to himself remembering the instructions. \u0022Then, place the satchel in the container and tie it down. Once you\u0027ve done that, lower and re-secure the seat.\u0022\u00A0With the samples secured Newney plopped down into the seat, and just as he reached for his restraints he saw that he had not closed the capsule\u0027s hatch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Newney, you idiot\u0022, he said to himself, \u0022you can\u0027t go anywhere until you close the stupid hatch.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe stood back up, closed the hatch, secured it, repressurized the cabin, and sat back down in his seat. He fastened his restraints giving them a good tug making sure he wouldn\u0027t be bouncing around the cabin like he did his first day in the centrifuge at KSC. That was something he never wanted to happen again. Now as securely fastened into the capsule as he could make himself he keyed the transmitter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022KSC, M\u00FCn VI. Come in KSC. Do you read me? Over.\u0022\u00A0He waited for the distinctive beep that would precede mission control\u0027s response. In a few moments it came.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeep! \u0022M\u00FCn IV, KSC. We read you Newney, loud and clear.\u0022\u00A0Came the reply ended with the same distinctive beep as signaled its start.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027ve secured the samples and myself in the capsule. Ready to commence liftoff.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We show all systems nominal Newney. You are go for liftoff.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022KSC, M\u00FCn VI. Copy that. Go for liftoff in...five, four, three, two, one.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNewney pressed the button to re-ignite the small engine at the base of the spacecraft. Newney was jolted back into his seat as the ship lifted from the Mu\u00A8n\u0027s northern pole. At around 2,000 meters the ship pitched over just as programmed. Newney knew that all he had to do for now was to wait until the engine cut-off and he\u0027d be on his way home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout a minute and fifteen seconds into a burn that was supposed to little over a minute and a half, the vibrations moving through the capsule suddenly stopped. Newney glanced around the capsule, halfway knowing and wondering what had just happened. He checked the engine burn indicator that was no longer lit, then looked with concern at the capsule chronometer and realized that the burn had not lasted as long as it was supposed to last.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNewney keyed the transmitter and spoke with a tinge of worry in his voice, \u0022KSC, M\u00FCn VI. My instruments indicate TKI burn terminated prematurely. Can you confirm?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a period of silence that only caused Newney more concern. Nearly a minute had passed without a response from mission control when Newney keyed the transmitter again. \u0022KSC, M\u00FCn VI. Did you copy my last transmission? Over.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022M\u00FCn VI, KSC. We copy Newney. Give us a minute to check some things. Over.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022KSC, M\u00FCn VI. I copy.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNewney did all that he could do; sit there looking over his instruments trying to figure out how bad his situation could

leave the M\u00FCn\u2019s sphere of influence you will be in a stable orbit around Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COkay.\u00A0 I hear the \u2018but\u2019

able to reach entry interface.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNewney sat in stunned silence for a few moments before slowly replying, \u201CCopy that

Werner\u201D, he said in that familiar serious, but somehow reassuring tone.\u00A0 \u201CWe\u2019re preparing a vehicle for launch as we speak.\u00A0 We have modified the M\u00FCn-type spacecraft with one of our remote probes.\u00A0 This will allow us to remotely control the spacecraft and will leave the capsule unoccupied.\u00A0 We will launch the vehicle so that it will intercept your trajectory at periapsis.\u00A0 At that point, Jebediah will take control from here to bring the capsule within range of your EVA pack.\u00A0 Do you have any questions so far Newney?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI think I see where this is going sir.\u00A0 I haven\u2019t exactly trained for something like this, but I don\u2019t have much of a choice do I?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m afraid not son.\u00A0 Once Jebediah has the rescue ship within range of your ship, you will go EVA and transfer to the rescue craft.\u00A0 Once in the rescue ship, we will initiate the de-orbit burn to bring you back home.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDo you want me to bring the samples over to the rescue ship?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat won\u2019t be necessary.\u00A0 Secure your ship after you exit, then we can send another kerbonaut to retrieve the samples at a later date.\u00A0

and even some beyond.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCopy that Gene.\u00A0 So what am I supposed to do until rendezvous?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNothing much you can

out.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe capsule was now silent, more silent it seemed than it had ever been.\u00A0 This wasn\u2019t particularly out of the ordinary for a M\u00FCnar mission during the trip to or from the M\u00FCn, but this was different.\u00A0 During the trip to the M\u00FCn he had sat in silence for a good long while, but thought it was actually a pleasant change from the hectic pace of KSC.\u00A0 This time it was different.\u00A0 He had no way to change his trajectory, nothing he could do but wait and hope that everything went according to

something I did?\u00A0 Did I use too much fuel during the landing?\u201D\u00A0 Question after question ran through his head as he tried to figure out how he had gotten into this situation.\u00A0 It was a few minutes before Newney realized that he was actually saying all of that out loud.\u00A0 He looked around the capsule sheepishly as if he had been talking to himself in the middle of a crowded

towards the ship at what seemed an interminably slow pace, but he dared not move faster for fear of overshooting.\u00A0 Finally, after what seemed like ten minutes, but would later be told was only

holding the capsule to the rest of the spacecraft fired, separating the capsule for reentry.\u00A0 \u201CIt won\u2019t be long now\u201D, he said to himself, \u201CWhen I get back I\u2019m taking a

seconds before the blackout is over\u201D, he said to himself.\u00A0 Around 20,000 meters Newney could see blue sky and white puffy clouds out his porthole and decided to try mission control.\u00A0

altimeter knowing that around 500 meters the chute would be fully deployed.\u00A0 He wouldn\u2019t need the altimeter to know when this happened because there would be a quick and sometimes rather violent jolt.\u00A0 Sure as the Sun rises in the morning around 500 meters the parachute fully deployed and Newney got the biggest jolt he had experienced since launch.\u00A0 But, after the capsule settled down he knew that at long last he could relax.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA short time later the capsule splashed down in the ocean not too far east of the space center.\u00A0 Newney saw

I, however, find myself admittedly confused on some of your points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Wordiness. I am aware that I can be very wordy from time to time, which I tried my best to avoid. I do agree that I should have at the very least left out the actual \u0022beep\u0022, but I don\u0027t think that I overly expounded upon the beep. I also can\u0027t help but note that in your edit of the first part of my story you added much more description of the closing of the hatch that was far wordier than my own very short description. I wonder if perhaps you meant to comment on my word choice rather than the amount of words I used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Consistent style. I really don\u0027t understand why I should begin with a faceless, nameless Kerbonaut if I plan to zoom out from him at a later point in the story. If I will be using his name at a later point in the story, why not introduce him to the reader at the outset? I may just be misunderstanding what you mean though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Simplicity of opening. Again, I may not be fully understanding your meaning here, but I don\u0027t see how a \u0022meaningless action\u0022 at the beginning of the story complicates the exposition. I chose the action to introduce the character and provide at least a little context for his coming predicament.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Emotion. I tried, perhaps not as hard as I could have, to communicate Newney\u0027s state of mind, and I probably could have done better. If you mean that I should use the emoticons to visually indicate their feelings, that\u0027s just not something that I am willing to do in my writing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. The word \u0022as\u0022 is not only a conjunction, but a preposition (like \u0022while\u0022 and \u0022when\u0022) and an adverb. The word \u0022as\u0022 can, in fact, be used as a replacement for the worlds \u0022while\u0022 and \u0022when\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, I appreciate that you took time to make these edits and to give this advice, however, I feel that most of it deals with the style of my writing. Correcting style is a task performed by copy editors, but typically that is in a journalistic context where the writer must conform to a particular style of writing, not a short work of fiction. I guess, what I mean by that is that I feel as though I have been told that my style of telling a story is \u0022wrong\u0022, when style is mostly a preference of the writer except in journalistic or scholarly fields. Understand, that I do not mean to offend you in any way, this is just my view on the matter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
