If you don\u0027t need to haul all your water out with you to Duna- but can just set up some sort of solar-powered (or nuclear- if you\u0027re running a mod or Squad ever adds proper reactors) processing plant to (slowly) produce Oxidizer from the local atmosphere, then this saves on fuel overall.

Simply pyrolyze the methane, and you can recover all input hydrogen (LiquidFuel) and recycle it back into the Sabatier Process or RWGS Reaction. The solid pyrolyic graphene (carbon) produced as a result can be either dumped directly (would require occasional manually chiseling it with a Kerbal from the ISRU part- somewhat like resetting a parachute) or automatically oxidized with CO2 in a Mars-like atmosphere, with electrical pre-heating of the CO2 to speed up the reaction: \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EC (solid) \u002B CO2 (gas) --\u0026gt; 2 CO (gas)\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[5] Fischer-Tropsch Reaction: \u003Cstrong\u003E(2n \u002B 1) H2 \u002B n CO \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0\u00E2\u20AC\u2122 CnH(2n\u002B2) \u002B nH2O\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EUseful for producing longer-chain hydrocarbons than methane, the Fischer-Tropsch Reaction could by run off the products of Water Electrolysis (specifically, the H2) and the Reverse Water Gas Shift Reaction (specifically, the CO).

The RWGS reaction and Water Hydrolysis, with feeding back of the hydrogen into the RWGS reaction, could be utilized to produce as much CO as needed for this reaction, and as much O2 as needed to burn the hydrocarbon fuel. The nice thing about longer-chain hydrocarbons is that hydrogen- the one element that would be difficult to obtain (needing to either be obtained from local water-ice/methane or hauled from Earth/Kerbin) makes up an even smaller percentage of their mass than with Methane- allowing even greater mass-leveraging of the limited amount of hydrogen available into fuel.

The beauty of this reaction is, when used on Mars/Duna; it requires no hydrogen feedstock transported from off-planet, or mining of local ice for water. Instead, you simply decompose the readily-available atmospheric CO2, and burn the products together in a specially-designed rocket engine. Virtually unlimited locally-available propellant, at the cost of nothing but energy...\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would love to also see people suggest some useful reactions of a Venus-like atmosphere (i.e. Eve).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are a fairly simple set of highly-useful reactions to start with, and I would love to see more of them implemented in mods (KSP-Interstellar already implements the Sabatier Process and Water Electrolysis- but worryingly none of the complementary reactions such as Methan Pyrolysis or Reverse Water Gas Shift Reaction, which eliminate the waste of producing more methane than you can burn... KSP-Interstellar currently also requires a *LARGE* continuing energy input for the Sabatier Reaction, which is unrealistic considering it\u0027s an exothermic reaction, and only needs a small spurt of start-up energy...) or eventually even the stock game. They would certainly give new use to solar panels- and maybe even make the devs (if they were added to the stock game) think harder about adding heavier-duty means of power generation (such as larger solar panels, or proper nuclear reactors), or encourage more players to install mods providing these more robust means of electricity generation (KSP-Interstellar currently offers some realistically-powerful fission reactors.
