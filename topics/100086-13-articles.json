So let\u0027s end with a picture of one Duna Lander/Hab 1, with my flag symbolically lying in the dust after the 1.1 upgrade.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow well were you able to climb hills with default Traction Control? \u00A0I don\u0027t get anywhere that way. \u00A0It\u0027s like the slowing of the rover gives a false positive of wheel slip for the throttle setting you\u0027re using, so the Traction Control throttles down the wheels in a self-reinforcing feedback system that quickly brings you to a halt. \u00A0At least that\u0027s my experience. \u00A0But I\u0027ve been out of town for the better part of a week, totally missed 1.1.1, and haven\u0027t yet had a chance to play with 1.1.2. \u00A0Maybe that\u0027s changed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m glad you\u0027re having reasonably good luck with RTG power. \u00A0The main drawback with them is the price (in career games), which makes RTG-powered rovers pound-for-pound by far the most expensive vehicles in the game. \u00A0So if you have to worry about money, fuel cells might be about the only option. \u00A0Most rovers just lack the acreage of surface area to get by with solar cells.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-04T21:38:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the rover mission up the mountain\u00A0with the standard wheels, I used the default Traction Control (and friction override to 5). I didn\u0027t do as well that time as I did later with the Grippy Tires when I was using Traction Control set to zero (and friction override set to 5)...but part of that may have had to do with the different wheels, and part of it may have been experience from the previous climb (and being more careful when needed).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCertainly RTGs are expensive, and fuel cells are the poor man\u0027s option...although refueling would be a bother if you want to do long-range rover missions since we lack hoses (but I assume most people don\u0027t do drives as long as mine). I\u0027ve never played career, and my whole kerbal society is dedicated to space travel and a strong nuclear industry...so I like RTGs and have all the money I need to pay for them in my sandbox. The price on RTGs would BE cheaper if your nuclear industry was geared up to crank out thousands and thousands of the things. Also, you don\u0027t need to have as many RTGs as you might think if you just divide the wheel energy needs by the RTG output...because that\u0027s a maximum energy draw by the wheels, so for a lot of places (like mostly level areas) you won\u0027t draw that much. And in the places where you DO draw lots of power, batteries and frequent breaks can get you through.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, I miss the good ol\u0027 days when rover wheels were more effective.
