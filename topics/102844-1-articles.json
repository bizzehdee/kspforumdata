I tried different seam patterns- non of which worked, so in a final attempt to simplify the shapes as much as possible, I marked every single edge as a seam. No change. Most shapes are still distorted, even though there is not one distorted face in the frame mesh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did a lot of google-ing and I found some alleged solutions, but non of them worked either:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Remove doubles from mesh- A good practice anyway, from what I\u0027ve read, but no effect in this scenario.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-CTRL\u002BA- Apply location, rotation, scale, while in object mode in the 3d view window - No effect\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-CTRL\u002BA- Average islands scale, while in the uv editor window - No effect\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-CTRL\u002BV- Minimize stretch, while in the uv editor window - No effect\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m really keen on modeling new parts for this game, and I have some interesting ideas, but snags like this one can kill my enthusiasm quite quickly, so I\u0027m borderline desperate to find a solution to my problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://mega.nz/#!HUJ3wbhR!9G59m_z3UGdJ0Zib0-GmXG7IiDttfPMHbhGVXNuKmNY\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E.blend file\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgbox.com/LdcGS1r1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LdcGS1r1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"martinezfg11","CreatedById":59995,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T05:15:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was looking at your model and it needs a bit of cleanup. You have a bunch of vertices floating around with no real purpose. The verts will create some funny effect once you take it into Unity I would imagine. Also, you scaled your side parts too much in the UV.. for the Main face, I would try projecting from view. But I\u0027m afraid you will need to take care of some topology issues first. Also your missing a face on the center area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/a52dw0jpln2y6ss/solar-panelR2.blend?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETry this.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA quick rework and all I did on the UV side was a quick UV smart project.
