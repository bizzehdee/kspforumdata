I tried different seam patterns- non of which worked, so in a final attempt to simplify the shapes as much as possible, I marked every single edge as a seam. No change. Most shapes are still distorted, even though there is not one distorted face in the frame mesh.\n\nI did a lot of google-ing and I found some alleged solutions, but non of them worked either:\n\n-Remove doubles from mesh- A good practice anyway, from what I\u0027ve read, but no effect in this scenario.\n\n-CTRL\u002BA- Apply location, rotation, scale, while in object mode in the 3d view window - No effect\n\n-CTRL\u002BA- Average islands scale, while in the uv editor window - No effect\n\n-CTRL\u002BV- Minimize stretch, while in the uv editor window - No effect\n\nI\u0027m really keen on modeling new parts for this game, and I have some interesting ideas, but snags like this one can kill my enthusiasm quite quickly, so I\u0027m borderline desperate to find a solution to my problem.\n\n[.blend file](https://mega.nz/#!HUJ3wbhR!9G59m_z3UGdJ0Zib0-GmXG7IiDttfPMHbhGVXNuKmNY)\n\n![LdcGS1r1.png](http://i.imgbox.com/LdcGS1r1.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"martinezfg11","CreatedById":59995,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T05:15:28Z","Content":"I was looking at your model and it needs a bit of cleanup. You have a bunch of vertices floating around with no real purpose. The verts will create some funny effect once you take it into Unity I would imagine. Also, you scaled your side parts too much in the UV.. for the Main face, I would try projecting from view. But I\u0027m afraid you will need to take care of some topology issues first. Also your missing a face on the center area.\n\nEdit: [Try this.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/a52dw0jpln2y6ss/solar-panelR2.blend?dl=0)\n\nA quick rework and all I did on the UV side was a quick UV smart project. I\u0027m sure you could get a more efficient unwrap if you spent more time on it.\n\nEdit again: Also, your model can only have one material per mesh, you had like 3 of them. Consolidate your textures into one you should be fine.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-02T05:34:05Z\u0022 title=\u002204/02/2015 05:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by martinezfg11**\n  \nformat"},{"CreatedByName":"Enceos","CreatedById":110725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T07:41:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Edit again: Also, your model can only have one material per mesh, you had like 3 of them.
