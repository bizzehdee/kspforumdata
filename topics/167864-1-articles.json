Which I like. However, I currently have a small capsule design which features a fuel tank (oscar b) exclusively for fuel cells. Two fuel cells are directly attached to the tank and this fuel tank cannot transfer fuel to the main tanks which supply the engine.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnnoyingly, the fuel cells, DESPITE CROSSFEED BEING OFF, are somehow able to drain the main tanks and do so BEFORE emptying the tank they are actually attached to. As far as I can tell (though I will test this further) they also ignore the order in which tanks should be consumed.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhats up with this? Can anybody else replicate this behaviour of fuel cells doing whatever they please?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeiss
