Again I don\u0027t know how SMURFF works in relation to Realism Overhaul... but keep in mind that the original Saturn V \u002B Apollo was *massive*. 110m high, 10m wide, weighing 3000 tons, to get three men to the Moon. A tad more than your measly 41m x 2.5m rocket \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E While getting into low Earth orbit is \u0022easily\u0022 doable considering you need about 10 km/s of dV, getting to the Moon and back requires another 7 km/s or so... and that does not include the lander and its fuel to get to the surface and back (another 5 km/s). So in total we\u0027re talking about 22 km/s of dV, plus all the additional hardware for landing, plus of course you need to lift all that from the ground. Twice. So, yeah. A rocket getting you to the Moon and back will be *much* bigger than one that just goes into LEO. Space travel is hard, and there\u0027s a reason why Apollo was prematurely canceled and noone went back to the Moon since \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFunnily enough, getting to Mars does not require much more delta-V (although landing and take-off are more challenging).

I am getting lag in RSS games when my part count goes anywhere above 50. Horrible FPS lag - the higher it goes over 50, the worse FPS I get.

It seems only when the physics kick in are high-part count ships REALLY lagging me - and this only happens on RSS games. Any reason why this may be? Is it a Unity limitation?

In the case of Io, Jupiter\u0027s gravity is so much bigger than Io\u0027s that you have to get quite close to Io before Io\u0027s gravity is more important than Jupiter\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T21:56:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECorrect.
