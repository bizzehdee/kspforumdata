I mean Kerbals aren\u0027t known for brains but really???\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd SRB testing... Ok, in my understanding the big benefit is that SRB\u0027s help you get off the launch pad quicker and easier. Why the hell am I lifting one to 30km before igniting it? I mean it sounds like fun. Get to 30km then fire off a an SRB with 315 thrust that you can\u0027t shut down...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd Jet engine testing when I don\u0027t even have air intakes? WHUT? I stuck it on a girder upside down atop my pod then lit it off when I got to the \u0027desired\u0027 altitude. Jee whiz, it flamed out... no intake air... imagine that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry, I\u0027m going back to my sandbox. Entirely too many ill thought-out missions for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and as for the rescue... Yea, I caught the guy pretty easily but forgot to empty out my pod before I launched. I made him grab the pod\u0027s ladder and deorbited his stupid butt right into the middle of the ocean. How the hell did he get up there anyway?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOooh kay. I\u0027m learning how to deal with stoopid missions. Test a skipper engine in orbit. I don\u0027t even have a fuel tank that large much less a stack separator...

A lot of contracts should have one or the other, not both, and they should offer a much wider window. What if your contract was to test the separatron in atmosphere at 1200m/s - 2000m/s? That could be fun if not something you\u0027re bound to do without the contract. Do it at any altitude you want! And some contracts pay almost nothing at all. Their best attribute may be reputation, but they usually don\u0027t give much of that. It doesn\u0027t make much sense being paid in advance to test a part, but are only given a fraction of the funds that the part costs, and on a contract not even worth your time. And the star rating seems to have little to do with how high the contract really is. I get three star junk contracts that don\u0027t even pay for the test part let alone the fuel, and one-star contracts that unlock more science than I get during their completion with a full suite of instruments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think part test contracts should often give you free parts instead of money in advance--once you have used up the parts on failed flights, you\u0027re out of luck if the parts are experimental because there aren\u0027t any more.

Seems every game, once I demonstrate to the whole of Kerbin that attaining orbit is possible, no sooner have I returned to base than I receive a report that some Kerbal is stuck in EVA, and I don\u0027t even have EVA capability yet (0.90).

It would ease players into the game a lot better. Then they\u0027d only need to upgrade the VAB and recruitment centre to start doing mun missions, which shouldn\u0027t be too expensive on easy. Right now I agree with most people that the challenges in the early game are more difficult than in the late game. Late game the money you can earn vs. the cost of the spacecraft stops being 2/1 and starts being more like 5/1.
