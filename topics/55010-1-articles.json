The thing wants to fly backwards or upwards or downwards, but not forwards. 1/5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAAT 61B Legisy is amazingly maneuverable, especially since it was designed for stock aerodynamics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooks: Ram intake on the front looks interesting, if unusual. Engines under the wing and general body style look amazing. 4/5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeed: At 280 m/s at sea-level under jet-power, 1820 m/s At ~30 km, and 266 m/s by the time it is over water, this fighter is second to few in speed. 4.5/5 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECeiling: The vehicle suffers significantly from the problem of losing speed with altitude above ~33 km. So while it has enough wing area to easily reach much higher than that, it is energetically unfavorable to go very much higher. That being said, 33 km optimal speed, and likely 45\u002B for optimal fuel consumption, even higher for maximum cruise height, is not only respectable but amazing. 4.5/5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManeuverability: It has more maneuverability than it can handle, able to maneuver with control surfaces easily at 35 km in the air. In my tests, it can easily take off and fly straight up before reaching the control tower (or any other buildings). That is to say, it would be able to escape from a 750-meter-wide 10000-meter-deep pit. In fact, I landed at 75 m/s on the island runway, and even though I went past 75% of the runway during the landing, I was able to take-off from a dead-stop before the end of the runway. It also helps that the thing has a TWR of about 2.5. Actually, it got to over 11 G once while pulling up. Another time, it tore the back third of each wing off just pulling up into a stall. 5/5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENoob-friendliness: It is slightly unstable in Yaw, making any precision flying best done with the SAS on. It is however very intuitive to fly and doesn\u0027t even need to have action groups to get into orbit. One problem however is that it tends to stall itself if pulled upward very very hard, and requires expert maneuvering to re-orient prograde. In fact, with the SAS engaged, I cannot reliably escape a stall at several kilometers high. Low-altitude stalls are very likely to end in a low-speed crash that may or may not be fatal, but will certainly destroy the plane. If the SAS is disengaged, I could generally escape a stall, but would often be thrown off-course and off-heading. It does have good operational tolerances though. I could get it to a 75*73 km orbit with 117 units of oxidizer and enough fuel to match. Based on its weight and the Isp of Its engines, That is ~199 m/s of Delta-V to mess with after orbit. A cautionary note: Re-entry control is good, but on my first attempt to land at KSC, I pitched down a bit too far and stalled, I went within literally 1/2 meter of the tallest mountain (The giant spire) near KSC before crash-landing in the rocks below. Overall, I consider this score a 3.5/5.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pds314","CreatedById":70014,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-03T00:04:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShould I bother posting craft with B9-aerospace parts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"inigma","CreatedById":69310,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-03T00:24:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI submit the Aeon or Ion, in my sig below. ack, scratch that. just go for the Ion. the Corvette of the skies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/sCJNW\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

At Just 8.43 tonnes fully fueled and 71 parts in total, it is one of the most maneuverable fighters I have seen in FAR. In addition, and unlike many maneuverable fighters, it is totally stable without engaging the SAS, even at a 70-degree AOA. In fact, it can sustain over 40 degree AOA when facing down. This allows unprecidented agility and turning power with uncompromised controllability. Preliminary testing shows that it can get up to 40 km per unit of fuel at 35 km.

It can also roll 360 degrees in 1.36 seconds based on accelerometer measurements, stall itself at 38-degrees AOA while maintaining control, or otherwise do most-any maneuver you would want to do in a dogfight/airshow. 5/5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENoob-friendliness: High maneuverability and lack of drift allows for control over mistakes and less attention to be given to constantly correcting yaw, pitch or roll. The plane flies well even with SAS disabled. The only issue is after consuming most of its fuel, it will be slightly unstable and get into stalls with SAS disabled or at extreme angles of attack. It is also dramatically easier to un-stall and even flies well during a deliberate stall. Finally, the smaller size and enhanced durability (No wings falling to bits even at sustained 182 m/s^2 accelerations) make for a better combat aircraft and also allow for a lower target area. Finally, the close landing gear allows it to land un-powered on virtually any non-mountainous terrain, making difficult runway-landings unnecessary during emergencies: 4.5/5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETechnical specifications:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELength: 11.5 meters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWingspawn: 6.5 meters:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeight: 4 meters including rudders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWing area: 127.16 meters^2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeak thrust under Jet power: 300 kN.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrust under Rocket power: 120 kN.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWeight: 11120 kg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETWR (Jet, full): 2.73\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETWR (Rocket, full): 1.09\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETWR: (Everything, full): 3.83\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETop cruise speed: 1872.7 m/s at 28600 meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERocket fuel: 3000 kg (600 Units, 330 O, and 270 LF).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJet fuel: 1600 kg (320 units).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmpty weight: 6.52 Tonnes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake-off distance: 800 meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVertical after: 850 meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELoop-the-loop from take-off: 560 meters above sea-level (495 meter diameter).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESea-level top speed: 278 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Highlad","CreatedById":64590,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-03T09:25:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShould this not be in spacecraft exchange or general ksp?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tidus Klein","CreatedById":72277,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-03T12:16:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@ killed-jeb maybe but the perpose was to assemble the best planes in Ksp, pit them in battle, and see who comes out on top- so ya it may not be a challenge as you see it, it\u0027s is a challenge of planes!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@highlad - if you feel like it needs to be moved, I don\u0027t mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@ everyone else.

Fortunately, due to extreme SAS torque, the craft is rotatable even during a stall (much like my own VL-110, though mine uses aerodynamic surfaces to control itself.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMO:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELOOKS: Good, conventional besides the third engine, but good. 4/5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESPEED: With a TWR worthy of a bullet instead of a plane, the Arrow reaches 303 m/s by the time it get to the ocean. It can sustain a speed of 314 m/s at sea-level and can reach at least 1975 m/s at 31 km high. That is nearly machingbird territory. 5/5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECEILING: It can easily sustain level flight up to 40\u002B km. 4.5/5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMANEUVERABILITY: While it is agile enough to literally fly straight backwards and can right itself from a stall thanks to gratuitous SAS-torque, its center of mass is far enough back to stop it from being very precisely controllable. 3/5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOOB-FRIENDLINESS: It will fly straight as.... an arrow.... if you let it be, absurdly high TWR help with fixing problems as does absurdly high SAS-torque. However, that can be a problem during take-off as it wants to literally bend itself into the ground (and sometimes does). Fish-tailing ensures every takeoff is extremely dangerous, and any split-second decision made during landing could result in the plane stalling upside down at 80 m/s only 5 meters from the ground. Finally, the fuel is distributed such that the central engine burns out VERY early compared to the other two. 2/5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPROS:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esmall and maneuverable, if you don\u0027t end up flying backwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eguaranteed to escape any stall more than 50 meters from the terrain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etakes off very quickly, under 500 meters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Euber-powerful engines with high TWR and top speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECONS:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emay explode, roll, twist in half, or cause a micro-black hole to form on takeoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Estalls when maneuvered very quickly, upon stalling, orients itself perfectly retrograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Econsidering its size and lack of a lot of fuel, payload, or SSTO-capability, it weighs a lot. 11.58 tonnes for a craft 8.5 meters long and 6.5 meters wide.
