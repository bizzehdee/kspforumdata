tweakscale config that works in my games that are highly part-modded, but isn\u0027t nearly as useful (or goes too far) in overhaul packs (like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System

(mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E configs that contradict the intent of the file.So I originally created a tweakscale config that added free-tweakscale to every part in the game. It worked great and could (after a few hiccups with other tweakscale \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s superseding it and disabling them) allow me to scale everything in game:  \n\nSpoiler\n\n@PART[*]:FINAL\n    {%MODULE[TweakScale]{\t@type = free\t\t}\n    }\n\nNow I\u0027m attempting to adopt this to my 1.3.1 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E game and can get it to either tweakscale everything or just a handful of things and both of these are to the extreme. When it allows tweakscale to everything (basically with just :FINAL tagged on the part line at the top) it starts almost every part at something like 10% of their normal size, I then step the size up to 100% and it shows a 200% version of said part, then I step it down once and it shows 50% but that is the default scale of the part I\u0027m working with. This is a huge pain to deal with every single part in the game. So I\u0027ve tried alternate tags like :AFTER[zzzVENSPATHPATCH] or something to that extent as it\u0027s the last \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E config loaded on my game I believe but I might as well not have an end tag altogether at this point as now it allows me to tweak only a few items. So what I need help on is the first \u0022extreme\u0022 where it allows tweakscale to apply to everything but I need the defaultScale to be the default scale of the part it\u0027s adding the module to and that\u0027s where I could use some help. I\u0027m about to try the following script but since the default scales come in sets of 3 (x, y, z) I don\u0027t believe it will take. My next idea will be to set default scale to the rescale factor of the part, which will hopefully keep the scale to the default scale (after realism overhaul rescales the item) but to save me a few 20 minute startups just to debug this I thought I\u0027d ask if anyone has an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patch that can do this? I believe it would make my original patch more stable and versatile in that I should be able to add it to any scaled system or alternate planet pack, or add any part mod and have tweakscale\u0027s module added by default.

So fixing it should be as easy as adding in !ScaleType{} before I create the free scaletype, that way any information from other patches for scaletype variables gets pushed out and then my patch comes through, sets the scaletype to freescale and sets the defaultscale to 100 (which should be all I need)\n\nResult:\n\n    @PART[*]:HAS[!MODULE[ProceduralPart]]:AFTER[RealismOverhaul]\n    {-MODULE[TweakScale] {}%MODULE[TweakScale]{\n            %type = free%defaultScale = 100 // Actually, since this is now a blank TweakScale module, shouldn\u0027t it default to this anyway?}\n    }\n\n\\*Update:\\*\n\nNow this works exactly as intended. May be \u0022career-breaking\u0022 if you are trying for a completely realistic RP-0 career where large engines and fuel tanks shouldn\u0027t be obtainable from the start; however that is up to the user to decide how it is used (great power, great yada yada). Personally I use this because after so many parts are added in my game that I end up with parts that ALMOST align with other ones or ones that I wish had a smaller version for smaller craft (ScienceJR being one of those, as well as construction pieces like girders and the like) and tweaking the scale on a percentile basis allows me to build my ships/planes so much easier. Thanks for your help @pellinor, I hadn\u0027t even thought of the fact that I had fragments left over of non free scaletypes and that was the cause.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-04-26T02:12:36Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2018 02:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by shoe7ess**"},{"CreatedByName":"Fireheart318","CreatedById":159932,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-26T12:07:37Z","Content":"How do you tweak OPT parts?"},{"CreatedByName":"0something0","CreatedById":182790,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-03T02:14:16Z","Content":"Does anyone have any configs for tweaking parts to be EXTREMELY large?
