This is a short range target finding system. It will send out lazor beams and add anything it hits to the target list. If you just want to target vessels, it is best to use blue lazors -\u0026gt; tracking station linkup. This will show all vessels in your game on the target list. And from there you can target/track/fly and destroy them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-28T10:03:36Z\u0022 title=\u002208/28/2012 10:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 28, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Romfarer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
