Although I have the impression, the release of 1.0 was rushed somehow and they should have released another beta before, I think the main reasons of disappointment some people express are an inevitable consequence of every early access game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the beginning there will be a lot of (visible) progress when core-gameplay-mechanics are added. And a lot of hope, because the final product is still in the sphere of imagination of its (future) consumers. Basically, this is similar to the hype when expectations are raised. This gets rather obvious with \u0022hype trains\u0022 and such, pushing expectations to unreachable heights by the consumers themselves (supported by developers as well as a marketing tool).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe further the game is in development and the more time early access players already spent in the game, less and less innovations are being experienced by these players. So as 1.0 definitely honed the game mechanics successfully (blinding out aerodynamics) there are not enough new game elements and mechanics to please experienced ksp players. To be honest, I was looking forward to 1.0 a lot, but realized, that I have seen probably everything the game can offer (at least in stock, I played every version since 0.18, I think I have understood orbit mechanics and rocket physics which is great). But that is not a problem of the game, like every game it get olds after while. It is the inevitable pity of early access: to have already seen the whole potential of a game when it is released letting seem every small improvement a negligible addition. The worst consequence of this is, in my opinion, when people start blaming the developers for not working hard enough or not thinking deep enough about development decisisions, confusing felt disappointment with a problem of the game itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt think this is something one should keep in mind when taking a look at the rather negative atmosphere in the forum and on reddit the past days.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dizzle","CreatedById":31588,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T11:44:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile what you\u0027re saying isn\u0027t without truth, I think 1.0 actually lived up to the hype.

Its because players will give a lot of slack to a game that they know is in beta, and isn\u0027t finished. As soon as you slap a 1.0 on it, peoples expectations are much higher, and when they don\u0027t work, they are a lot more prone to complain.

Also it allows players to actually step outside and plant flags on foreign moons and planets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd any feature that is missing can be modded in since KSP has very good modding support. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI myself think KSP is 1.0 worthy at this moment, though i already thought it was 1.0 worthy after they introduced docking and space stations. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso i think 1.0 is not the \u0022end\u0022 of the stream of updates, atleast i hope so \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:0.0:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T12:08:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs mentioned before. I think most players are very happy with the features offered in 1.0. What players are disappointed with is the bugs and lack of balance. It\u0027s not like they didn\u0027t release previous versions to the public to try out after all. From a player perspective there\u0027s no reason why 1.0 should be such bug mess to the extend that within the first week two bug fixes had to be released. 1.0.2 is the version that should have been 1.0; 1.0 should really have been 0.95. Apparently Squad had reasons to take this road, but I think that the community is very passionate about \u0022their\u0022 game and disappointed that the 1.0 release (there\u0027s only ONE 1.0 release after all!) was such a mess.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T03:25:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile the game was unfinished, every player had his/her own idealized hope for what the final game would be. As development continues, the actual game is inevitably going to turn out to be different from what many people hoped. Those people are going to be disappointed. Some are disappointed that it didn\u0027t go one way, and others are equally disappointed that it didn\u0027t go the opposite way.
