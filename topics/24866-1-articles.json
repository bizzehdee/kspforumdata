I can get a Bunker to Mun or Minmus with nearly all of the onboard fuel still intact, and Duna or Eve takes a bit less than half.

You\u0027re better off just refining on the spot, as you drill, and hauling processed fuel directly. This is one of the things that\u0027ll change in the new resource system, since it\u0027s unlikely that any one location will have all of the necessary materials to create fuel. Instead, you\u0027ll haul raw materials to some central processing facility, like a space station, and convert to fuel there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, this means that Kethane allows for an easy \u0022Grand Tour\u0022 setup; all you have to do on each planet or moon is land your vessel on a Kethane deposit, and you can refill your fuel tanks before taking off again, so that you can have a single design that does the entire journey with minimal outside help.
