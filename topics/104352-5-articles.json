A fairing that is 10 sections high and divided into 4 sides would have 40 panels, yes. **How many objects this will produce on deployment depends on how they group together (that\u0027s next up on my to-do list actually)**.\n\u003E As for how the broken-off bits behave after deployment, they are handled as solar panel pieces or engine fairings. They aren\u0027t fully persistent (which is good if you like your framerates to be a two-digit number). That doesn\u0027t mean they aren\u0027t solid objects, however.
