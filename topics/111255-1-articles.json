I was using the family laptop and and purchased the game through steam. I figured I would give the demo a go on my laptop, just to see how things will work. I have a Thinkpad t-420 running Ubuntu MATE. I meet all of the recommended system requirements. I had no problem with the download or install. Honestly, the game seems to be running a lot smoother than the windows machine. The only problem is, there are absolutely no parts available to build anything? I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but nothing seems to work. I tried the training missions and the career available in the demo. My only thoughts are I am screwing up the install some how...?\n\nFor my personal safety, and the happiness of my home please help."},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T08:27:22Z","Content":"I have no experience with the demo on Linux. One question though, if you own KSP in steam why not just install steam and use the full version? Once you\u0027ve installed the game you won\u0027t even need steam anymore except for updates."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T10:24:57Z","Content":"Hi ScruffyWunder, if you post the contents of the KSP.log from the game folder it\u0027d help to figure this out, you can use [hastebin.com](hastebin.com) to host it."},{"CreatedByName":"Draekris","CreatedById":103172,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T20:35:42Z","Content":"Try running from the terminal with sudo. On my install, on a laptop with a 5400 rpm drive (I think the slow response had something to do with it), parts sometimes failed to load (not to mention it crashed with extreme frequency) when running from steam or nautilus."},{"CreatedByName":"jazzymg","CreatedById":145809,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T05:41:25Z","Content":"I\u0027m having the same issue on Ubuntu 14.04, and running from the terminal, with or without sudo, doesn\u0027t help.
