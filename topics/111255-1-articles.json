I was using the family laptop and and purchased the game through steam. I figured I would give the demo a go on my laptop, just to see how things will work. I have a Thinkpad t-420 running Ubuntu MATE. I meet all of the recommended system requirements. I had no problem with the download or install. Honestly, the game seems to be running a lot smoother than the windows machine. The only problem is, there are absolutely no parts available to build anything? I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but nothing seems to work. I tried the training missions and the career available in the demo. My only thoughts are I am screwing up the install some how...?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor my personal safety, and the happiness of my home please help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T08:27:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have no experience with the demo on Linux. One question though, if you own KSP in steam why not just install steam and use the full version?
