After experimenting with various designs for large, multipurpose space vessels often constructed in several parts, I\u0027ve eventually settled on this design to be the workhorse of my fleet. It is propelled by 6 fission engines and 18 ion drives (9 forward face and 9 rear facing) as well as 1 mainsail (which is used only for the initial atmospheric escape).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt features 9 docking ports, 3 of them are the mission modules at the rear of the main hull which can carry most kind of small craft and 6 are suitable for the mounting of either escape pods (in the case of the \u003Cem\u003EResolution\u003C/em\u003E or potentially weapon systems).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Cem\u003EResolution\u003C/em\u003E is outfitted for a Jool exploratory mission with two small landers, one for the crew, one for a small rover as well as a spaceplane for Laythe operations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe primary hull houses 8 Kerbals, 3 on the main armoured bridge module, 1 on the forward observation deck and 4 in the habitation centre. Additional Kerbals can also be housed in mission modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship features 37,000 units of fuel capacity, 25,200 units of Xenon and 11,710 stored electric charge.
