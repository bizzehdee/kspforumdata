They are actually pre programed to work with breaks instead.\n\nSo in other words everythime you press B for breaks they will extend. If you hold the B down they will stay deployed. If you use the icon to Deploy breaks they stay opened also until you press it again."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T00:21:33Z","Content":"Yeah, that has to be a bug.

Other air brakes where working ok and when I moved it off the cargo bay and it started working again. The Mk2 cargo bay does seem to do some odd things, trying to use the offset gizmo with certain parts inside it doesn\u0027t work right either."},{"CreatedByName":"Jarin","CreatedById":71395,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T04:24:57Z","Content":"The service modules have some issues with surface-attached items as well. Seems it\u0027s still a bit tetchy about what it considers \u0022inside\u0022.

Thus, they work independently with brakes and each brake can move individually. I\u0027ll show photos here in a bit.\n\nEDIT: I think I know why they don\u0027t work as toggles.

So it\u0027s either something wrong with airbrakes being automatically assigned to the brake action group, or something wrong with control surfaces having their toggles in custom action groups."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T13:48:46Z","Content":"You could try deleting this line in the .cfg\n\n    defaultActionGroup = Brakes"}]}
