Whether this was due to bad piloting or bad design depends on who you ask (most likely it was both) but poor Jeb was stranded on the Mun without even enough fuel to make it back into a Mun orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA rescue mission was quickly planned. At this point, while we had a successful Mun landing on the books, nobody was sure if we were capable of building a craft that could both land and come all the way home again. To avoid the risk of having another craft stranded on the Mun, an unmanned rescue ship was dispatched without the capability of actually landing. It would arrive at a low orbit around the Mun, at which point Jeb was to wait until it went overhead, fly as high as his remaining fuel would take him, jump really hard, and hope for the best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb on the Mun:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.80sgaming.org/ksp/screenshot01.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot01.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERescue ship launch:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.80sgaming.org/ksp/screenshot02.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot02.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERescue ship arriving in Mun orbit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.80sgaming.org/ksp/screenshot08.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot08.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb\u0027s ship launching and promptly running out of fuel:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.80sgaming.org/ksp/screenshot25.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot25.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb performs an EVA, and while it takes over half the fuel in his jet pack, he manages to achieve our first shipless orbital insertion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.80sgaming.org/ksp/screenshot29.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot29.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb orbits, while his ship falls back down to the surface and the rescue ship orbits behind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.80sgaming.org/ksp/screenshot33.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot33.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think he can believe he actually pulled that off...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.80sgaming.org/ksp/screenshot44.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot44.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rescue ship finally catches up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.80sgaming.org/ksp/screenshot54.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot54.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe makes it on board the rescue ship.
