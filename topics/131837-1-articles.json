Let\u0027s look at airplanes. Commercial jets used to have three or four engines by preference. This was partly due to the available amount of takeoff thrust (look at the B-52 with eight engines) and partly due to engine unreliability. If you lose an engine on takeoff you need to worry about still being able to climb. If you lose an engine away from an airport, you need to worry about getting to the nearest alternate. And any time you lose an engine you need to worry about controlling the non-symmetric thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOver time, two things happened. Engines became much more reliable, and efficiency became tied to fan size and engine thrust. So the bigger fan engines with higher thrust also were more efficient. Once reliability got to be high enough, it became safer to only have two engines than to have four. The big concern was what would happen if you lost both engines at the same time, but with reliability so good this was nearly impossible (unless you run out of fuel, but then having four engines wouldn\u0027t help either). The chances of having any engine go out were cut in half, and the chances of having more than one go out were so small they could be discounted completely.\u00A0And having two high thrust engines was more efficient than four low thrust engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, what that means for rockets is that really you have to consider what would happen if the most critical engine would fail, what the chances are that multiple engines would fail on the same flight, and what the relative efficiencies of the engines are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beowolf","CreatedById":48927,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-12T23:44:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222403439\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022131837\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221455180962\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002298962\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 2/11/2016 at 3:56 AM, Streetwind said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpaceX also requested permission from the primary customer (NASA) to relight the second stage engine once in order to raise the orbit further, so the secondary payload (an Orbcomm OG2 pilot satellite) could be deployed into its intended orbit.
