I\\\u0027ve been spending more time just floating around and working with the gyroscope/artificial horizon and have come across some pretty effective/efficient ways to manipulate my path. These might not be the best ways, but they work. I\\\u0027m no pro at the game, but I can reliably get ships to do what I want them to and have just picked the game back up yesterday afternoon after putting it down for a week or so to come back with a fresh mind, so I\\\u0027ll explain how I\\\u0027d want it explained to me. The first thing you need to know are some things about the gyroscope and what all the directions mean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe spinning blue and orange ball represents where the nose of your ship is pointed in relation to the body whose gravity you are currently affected by/which body you\\\u0027re orbiting. If you\\\u0027ve ever been affected by (\u0027encountered\u0027) the Mun and watched the ship as soon as it hits the encounter point, you will see the gyroscope snap to the new body of gravity as you get caught by the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBlue is sky/space - \u0027Out\u0027 - pointing away from the planet; this is why you are pointed directly \u0027up\u0027 at the middle of the blue on the launchpad\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrange is ground - \u0027In\u0027 - pointing directly at the bottom of the navball has your nose aimed at the ground of the body\\\u0027s gravity\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny easy way to test out the directions listed below is to take a nice and light rocket, something easy, get it about 50k up and just muck about with the ball until you\\\u0027re comfortable reading it and do not have to refer to the \u0027normal\u0027 screen (not the orbital map) to be sure you are oriented correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0 Degrees - \u0027North\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E90 Degrees - \u0027East\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E180 Degrees - \u0027South\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E270 Degrees - \u0027West\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was the weirdest bit for me to understand when I tried to figure out the gyroscope. If you want to think of the plane being a circle, then 0/360 Degree is \u0027North\u0027, and I use quotes because it\\\u0027s difficult to really call any direction North in space. Arbitrarily, though, that\\\u0027s where \u0027Up\u0027 is, whereas pointing at the center of the blue half of the ball would be \u0027Out\u0027 and the center of orange would be \u0027In\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo with that out of the way, here\\\u0027s how you\\\u0027re going to orient your ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you launch, you\\\u0027re pointing Out. Your main goal is to shoot as straight out as possible without veering, and you accomplish this with ASAS, SAS, control/stabilization fins, symmetry, struts, and other sorts of stability-increasing parts. I\\\u0027m going to assume you can get your ship to launch straight. We\\\u0027re going to ignore trying to optimize fuel with when you begin your turn and just concentrate on the kinds of turns you can make. Generally, when trying to either achieve orbit around Kerbin or another body, people point their ships East (90) or West (270), both directions have their pros and cons, but that doesn\\\u0027t matter for this. You want to generally continue flying \u0027Out\u0027 until you are happy with your Kerbin Apoapsis on the orbital map. If your orbital pattern is skewed at this point (achieving distance), it doesn\\\u0027t matter much since we\\\u0027re going to flatten our orbit a bit later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you get about halfway to the Kerbin Apoapsis (it should still be a sharp ellipse that will bring you back to Kerbin at this point), you need to figure out if you\\\u0027re going to be pointing North or South to flatten out your orbit. If your plath has you coming back in the northern hemisphere, then you need to adjust it southward; if it\\\u0027s bringing you south, then northward. You simply point in the opposite direction. Now, you\\\u0027re not going to be able to get it perfectly \u0027flat\u0027 here, but your goal is to get as flat as possible without wasting fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\\\u0027re relatively flat, continue on to the apoapsis as you normally would before making your orbital burn. If you want to orbit WITH the direction of Kerbin\\\u0027s rotation (counter-clockwise looking at Kerbin\\\u0027s north pole), you are going to burn East, or at 90 degrees; if you want to orbit against it (clockwise looking at the north pole), burn West at 270 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerform your orbital burn until your desired orbital distances are achieved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, your orbit can be off \u0027flatness\u0027 by even 45 degrees and you\\\u0027re still in decent shape, and here\\\u0027s where the fine-tuning will come into play and understanding the gyroscope.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you want to do is look at the orbital map and zoom out so you can see all of the Mun\\\u0027s orbit at once and line up both sides so they form a flat line. On the orbital map screen, this is the easiest/best/only way you can create an artificial flat plane, and is what you are going to be using to know when you make your adjustments. Your goal with the first \u0027North/South\u0027 adjustment is to get as close to flat as possible to make this easiest and less costly in fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you have the Mun\\\u0027s orbit lined up as a single line, you are looking for the point where your path crosses the artificial flat plane you created, even if you\\\u0027re not going out that far - it\\\u0027s simply a guide. The point where these two lines cross is where you\\\u0027re going to be adjusting your orbit\\\u0027s \u0027flatness\u0027, and the further from Kerbin you are, the less gravity there is, so less fuel will be consumed while adjusting. Why are you using this point? Well, when you cross that intersection you are \u0027on\u0027 the flat orbital plane, so it\\\u0027s a pretty good time to adjust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless of the direction you\\\u0027re traveling, the mechanics are the same. If your orbit is skewed and bringing you \u0027North\u0027 for this trip between your apoapsis/periapsis, then you want to aim your ship \u0027South\u0027 when you cross the horizon and burn. You will see the plane begin to flatten out if you\\\u0027re doing this on your orbital map (hence why it\\\u0027s important to be able to read the gyroscope and know what you\\\u0027re looking at). The point of intersection with the flat plane will slightly change, but you can bring it about 75% of the way to flat without wasting much fuel. Fast-forward time again and cross the plane, then continue to re-flatten. It might seem as though it\\\u0027s costing more fuel to flatten out, and at that point it might be better to wait until you\\\u0027re on the opposite side of the body you\\\u0027re orbiting to flatten the rest out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\\\u0027ll have to play with and learn for yourself the optimal points to flatten out, as this is just a general point and guide of what to do that works for me concerning both mechanics and fuel efficiency. When your orbital path has you skewed going \u0027North\u0027, you just do the opposite and burn \u0027South\u0027/180 degrees).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it comes to controlling orbital height, you\\\u0027re mostly relying on East/West directions. You want to burn with the direction you intend on traveling (we\\\u0027ll say East/90 for this) at the apoapsis to increase the orbital height/position of the periapsis, and you want to burn \u0027against\u0027 (270 in this example) it to decrease the periapsis. The easiest way to get a circular orbit is to burn from launch to the desired height and cut your engines until you get there unless you\\\u0027re fixing your \u0027flatness\u0027. Once you get to the apoapsis, burn with your direction of travel until the periapsis matches (or is close to) the apoapsis\\\u0027s altitude. Same concept applies to increasing the apoapsis: burn with your direction while at the periapsis to increase it, burn against your direction to decrease it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter half an orbit around Kerbin, you should be pretty \u0027flat\u0027, have a circular orbit (or an elliptical one if you\\\u0027re slingshotting), and be on target to your first encounter. If it takes you more than one periapsis encounter to gain the orbit you desire, then keep practicing and hammer down reading the gyroscope and how to adjust your orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for the long post, but I wanted to explain things fully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope it helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daid","CreatedById":32171,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-15T18:15:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@wildkittyv1: Awesome.
