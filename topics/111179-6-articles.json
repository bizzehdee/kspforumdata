Nice blue, icey ammonia comet thingy. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nHowever, there is a bug where the terrain is completley flat, even though the scaled mesh is not. \u003C--- fixed it ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nImages:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Also, MTM-1 Haricot was just on the edge of Mysterio\u0027s SOI, so yeah...\n\nThese orbits are included in my download. I didn\u0027t change anything else about the planets.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

The spreadsheet says that MTM-2 \u0022Tyrok\u0022 is going to be the one with lava oceans, but amarius just said that Tihoratus just got lava oceans. Do they both have lava oceans?\n\nAlso, a word of advice: If you\u0027re having trouble with the scaled map version not updating, try deleting the contents of Kopernicus/Cache. I\u0027ve found that Kopernicus will ignore any new changes that needs to made to the scaled mesh if there\u0027s already a cached one, so deleting it fixed it. Also, install HyperEdit for playing with orbits. It\u0027s great having an in-game tool for that stuff. It\u0027s also great for exploring/testing planets easily.\n\nAlso, do I say also too much?\n\nAlso, also, also, also, also, also... The word has lost meaning for me.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-02T08:08:33Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2015 08:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MrHappyFace**"},{"CreatedByName":"Hammersamatom","CreatedById":102101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T10:23:15Z","Content":"Yea, the orbits need work, I made them that way so we would have a lot of space to work with.\n\nConcerning names, Amarius, I thought Tyrok was your moon of Lava Oceans?\n\nAnd finally, Happy, do the logs mention what OPM and AKP are fighting over, because we haven\u0027t adjusted Eeloo other than adding a moon.
