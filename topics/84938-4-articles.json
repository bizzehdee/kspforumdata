But surely the load distance shouldn\u0027t be a factor since the camera isn\u0027t a vessel that despawns... Right? I can always instal BDArmory and up the distance to whatever I need, but I\u0027d like to avoid that. And can the max zoom be over ridden?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: So I played around with it last night. The maximum zoom should be sufficient. I was successfully able to track a rocket for at least 200km I\u0027d say. But at around that point things get strange.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor one thing KSP still thinks your viewing the craft so everything begins to LoD around 150. After 200 or so KM the camera will begin to either move up or sink down into the ground. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever I think it\u0027s completely efficient for watching rockets launch from the ground because your going to be zoomed in anyway and wouldn\u0027t have any idea the camera position moved unless you zoomed back out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimplifies the process greatly. Thanks for this. In the past it was a mess. You had to create a camera on a infernal robotics mount stable enough to track and you had to up the loading distance with BDArmory to like 300km which in itself is a buggy mess of floating point errors. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mod completely renders that process obsolete. So again. Thank you. Watching your rockets stage from the ground is just... Everyone should be doing this. Absolutely everyone.
