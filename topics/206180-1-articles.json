Looking at the drag for the two parts:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Nose cone: 0.10\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Shielded docking port: 0.25\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven that this is the tip of the craft, it probably makes a big difference. Why would these numbers be so different? If I look at the shape of the two they are almost interchangeable, and I doubt there is an obstacle to making the shield smooth as a surface ..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, is there a place I can edit the drag of the shielded docking port to fit my notions?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Axelord FTW","CreatedById":1896,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-30T21:50:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re on steam,\u00A0\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Kerbal Space Program\\GameData\\Squad\\Parts\\Utility\\dockingPortShielded is the filepath to\u00A0dockingPortShielded.cfg\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIndeed, the cfg file tells us:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Courier New\u0027, Courier, monospace;\u0022\u003EdragModelType = default\u003Cbr\u003E\nmaximum_drag = 0.25\u003Cbr\u003E\nminimum_drag = 0.25\u003Cbr\u003E\nangularDrag = 0.5\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can play around with those values.
