The \u0022sonic boom\u0022 is caused by a shock wave passing over observers on the ground (or elsewhere). There is no shockwave inside the aircraft, so you don\u0027t hear the boom. A common misconception is that the noise is caused by an aircraft \u0022breaking the sound barrier\u0022, and is an instantaneous noise at Mach 1. It\u0027s actually continuous for anything travelling above the speed of sound, and the reason you only hear one boom is because it only passes over you once.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
