I mean, in a landing, you\u0027re going from orbital velocity to zero and in a launch you\u0027re going from zero to orbital velocity. In my experience, the numbers on the chart reflect the amount of delta-V required for a launch; on those worlds with atmospheres, the landing delta-V is less than what\u0027s listed because you do pick up some free delta-V due to atmospheric drag. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, your main question is how much delta-V is required \u0022to get into Kerbin orbit and then de-orbit at the chosen target, the atmosphere and parachute slowing the capsule down\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe answer\u0027s going to be dependent upon the ejection angle you pick and whether or not you want to use aerobraking, which is why there isn\u0027t a hard and fast number available. Most folks just want to land so they set a maneuver node with a Kerbin periapsis around 30k; it does the trick.

Once you\u0027re in orbit, a final de-orbit burn isn\u0027t going to take much; at 2200 m/s, you\u0027ll already be in a sub-orbital path.

But that\u0027s the only number the chart has, so how do you get the 1700 to take off again? Do you have to calculate that somehow, is it from experience, or is there some rule of thumb you can apply to the landing number to take the atmosphere into account when taking off?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T13:47:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ~1700 accounts the amount of delta-V lost due to atmospheric drag. Take Kerbin for example; you know you need ~4500 delta-V to make orbit. That\u0027s going from zero to orbital velocity, of course. If Kerbin didn\u0027t have an atmosphere, by definition you should be going 4,500 m/s when you make orbit. Because there is atmosphere, though, you make it up there only going about 2,300 m/s or so. Duna also has the same atmosphere, thus more delta-V is required to compensate for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnless I\u0027m mistaken, the 1,380 is an average value for both launch and landing (i.e. it takes ~2700 delta-V total to go from orbit to the surface and then back to orbit; if ~1700 of that is needed for takeoff, about ~1000 will be needed for landing - assuming you don\u0027t use chutes).
