You only need 2. One for space near Mun and one for surface. Though the Mun has biomes, not sure if the temperature scan is different for each biome you\u0027re flying over. Another thing you can do is send your Kerbal on EVA, get near the thermometer, right click it and select \u0022take data\u0022. Thermometers are reusable unlike Goos and Science Jr\u0027s so you can take multiple measurements with only one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-09T05:31:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sdj64\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sdj64\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E ...not sure if the temperature scan is different for each biome you\u0027re flying over.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile they may not get different readings, you still collect more science for logging the temperature in different biomes, I can say for sure as I\u0027ve been Sciencing a lot on Minmus with similar results. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-09T06:32:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe temp scan works from different biomes on the surface or flying low, but not in space or flying high.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
