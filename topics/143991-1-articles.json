Assuming that black holes aren\u0027t gateways to other universes or that when a black hole is formed a white hole is formed, this is due to the first law of thermodynamics. My hypothesis is that black holes do emit \u0022hawking radiation\u0022 but not actually part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\u00A0This is because black holes emit axions, a smaller and faster particle than was previously thought of is actually faster than the speed of light. This axion would be a base sub particle that would come to form elementary particles. This would help to explain why it is still a theoretical particle and has yet to be discovered yet be fundamental to many theories about our universe. My hypothesis would put black holes being the creator of axions and this is what dark matter is. This is speculation but as time continues to move forward form our perspective as the fourth dimension, axions aren\u0027t affected by time due to their speed thus they don\u0027t decay and would eventually take up more space over time which would help explain the universes expansion rate as it is ever increasing and nearly equal across the universe. Quantum mechanics states that in space particles con \u0022pop\u0022 in and out of existence however, these base sub particles axions actually absorb radiation to form elementary particles. These are unstable particles so the existence is short lived. This hypothesis can be dangerous to test since you would need a near vacuum chamber with a substantial amount of radiation able to penetrate the chamber in a high enough quantity to be able to form some elementary particles that can be observable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-17T11:41:11Z\u0022 title=\u002207/17/2016 11:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Arian L.
