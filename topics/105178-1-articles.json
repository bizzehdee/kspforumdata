I wrote a paper on this last year and one of the main problems I found with long distance space flights was the lack of CELSS systems. Although the hypothetical systems were quite heavy, when you started to have larger crews, the need for more supplies ended up being a far bigger burden.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Newt","CreatedById":131025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T05:19:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is certainly an interesting thing to look at, but as Teamwork said, it is generally difficult on smaller missions. Especially when you are trying to launch from the ground (trying to take big tanks of algae, while logical for air production, is not so good for fuel costs).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, as we look further into the future, I agree heartily. CELSS would be vital, to a large and efficient base, wither on the Moon, Mars, Venus or orbit, or wherever else, not to mention large spacecraft on interstellar missions. Whether it should immediatley be a priority to develop, though, I am uncertain. CELSS will be vital, yes, but there are many other things that areguably are more important to do. If NASA (or whomever) is not given the support to do a large mission in which such a life support system is practical, then the need is not quite so present.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Albert VDS","CreatedById":74055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T05:42:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECELSS and a way extract water from Lunar and Martian soil and oxygen from the Martian atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
