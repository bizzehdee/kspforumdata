Apart from physical violence, which is never okay (but appears not to have happened), people making jokes sometimes cross lines. I would even argue it is part of the job. You cannot pay someone a handsome amount of money for doing what Clarkson does and then act all hurt when he crosses the line on occasion. Pilots, doctors \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E comedians make mistakes in their work. Should they? No, because people get hurt in various ways. Do they? Yes, they are human and mistakes are an occupational hazard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdded to that, in the case of doctors and pilots people have a point. When Clarkson makes a distasteful remark, do not get your panties in a bunch. Grow up and change the channel. This sounds like the Jonathan Ross thing all over again. The BBC should make up its mind - embrace the modus operandi or quit the whole thing, but stop going back and forth as is convenient.
