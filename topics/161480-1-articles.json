However, after adding deadly reentry to my modpack, whenever a kerbal goes on EVA they are instantly vaporized. I have removed deadly reentry for now, though I did so with a sadness in my heart because it seems like a really fun mod. Anyway, what I was wondering was whether or not anyone else had encountered this glitch, and whether or not anybody had an idea for a fix.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance :-)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-03T12:36:01Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2017 12:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Aerograde\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slainte Maith","CreatedById":175556,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-03T14:57:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u002B1\u00A0to this. \u00A0Surely we\u0027re not the only people with this issue? \u00A0I\u0027d even be willing to accept that I\u0027m missing something in the install/doing something wrong/experiencing bad karma so long as there\u0027s a fix somewhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSeems this is fixed by this...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/2kiug1k6opjvgqv/DeadlyReentry.dll?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/2kiug1k6opjvgqv/DeadlyReentry.dll?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-03T14:58:48Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2017 02:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Slainte Maith\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeiss Ikon","CreatedById":174016,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-03T22:53:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not a user of Deadly Reentry (not sure it\u0027s really needed with the post-1.2 stock reentry code, I find reentry plenty deadly if you don\u0027t do it right).\u00A0 However: 1.2.2 was out long enough I\u0027m sure others would have noticed if there were a big issue with Deadly Reentry in this KSP version.\u00A0 What were you doing when the kerbals went EVA and exploded?\u00A0 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, higher orbit, deep space, or suborbital?\u00A0 If you\u0027re below 70 km, I wouldn\u0027t expect a Kerbal to last long at orbital velocity with more heating than the stock game...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NSEP","CreatedById":165635,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-03T23:39:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShould this not be in the Add-On questions subforum?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-04T18:05:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThread moved to modded support.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
