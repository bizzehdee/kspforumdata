So if this pricinple is correct and satellites keep \u0027falling\u0027 around the planet. ... how does a geostationary satellite stays in orbit. I could understand it could work for low earth orbit. A geostationary satellite is much further away from earth so there is alot less gravitational pull from the earth, probably nothing anymore *\u003Cem\u003Efacepalm*\u003C/em\u003E. Those satellites need a much higher speed to keep up with the rotation of the earth, since most of them stay in the same spot above earth at all times.

I would think in geostationary orbit you need more speed since you need to do alot more distance to circle the earth. I will do some calculations today and some more research to understand this.
