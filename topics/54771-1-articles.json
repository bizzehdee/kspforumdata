There\u0027s also a monolith on the Mun that\u0027s underground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust did a quick test, it seems terrain detail does effect whether the anomalies are visible or not. Looking at the one on the Mun, with detail set to low, the monolith was floating; at default, just the top was sticking out of the ground; at high detail, it was well underground. Also found out that any flags you have planted are effected by the terrain detail setting as well. The flag I had at that monolith site was disconnected from the ground when I changed detail settings, it\u0027s now just laying there instead of \u0022planted\u0022, so be aware of that if you go changing the terrain detail, any flags you visit will be uprooted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore testing later, seems the pyramids are underground no matter what, so terrain detail isn\u0027t going to help you there. Also, not all flags are effected by terrain detail changes, so take your chances with that.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-30T15:14:36Z\u0022 title=\u002211/30/2013 03:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Dweller_Benthos\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Emore info\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-30T18:46:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think I am going to do a stock take of all the Kerbol Easter eggs.
