What you need to do is make a new sandbox game and match its time with your current career. Then, find in career persistence file your vessels and copy all of them into sandbox persistence ( I recommend creating one ship in sandbox to know where in save file to put vessels from career), same with your kerbals. This should !PROBABLY! work.
