Let\u0027s say I am trying to fine tune a transfert orbit from Kerbin to Duna, the only way to test the effect of \u0022sliding\u0022 the node is to zoom to kerbin, slide, zoom back to duna, observe the result, zoom back to kerbin again, slide, back to duna, yada yada... It gets frustrating VERY quickly. \u003Cbr\u003EFinally... while it is possible to click on AP and PE so the information stick, those are exceptions. The only way to observe the result of a modification to a maneuver node is to move the mouse from the node to the \u0022target\u0022. As example, if I am trying to fine tune a rendezvous, I have to slightly adjust the node, then pass the mouse hover my target, then adjust again, then check with the mouse... \u003Cbr\u003EHow do you guys work with the maneuver nodes?

Unfortunately, because the camera, the roll-orientation of the ship and all that, there is never a way to know which way is \u0022that way\u0022, I can never know beforehand if I need to press W, A, S or D. \u003Cbr\u003EI took the habit of putting red and green light of left and right side of my ship, it slightly help but it\u0027s not heaven yet...

Encountering \u0022from the front\u0022 slow you down and give you a clockwise (i.e. 180degrees) orbit. Problem is, while planning an encounter, I find it very difficult to tell which way I am going to \u0022get grabbed\u0022 by the gravity. No matter how I zoom or change the focus, I end up guessing wrong 50% of the time. And it is way worse for bodies that far away from the maneuver node since it\u0027s really tiresome to test various variation on the maneuver node (because of the #1).\u003Cbr\u003ETo make matter worse, high gravity (and no-so-high) bodies will \u0022curve\u0022 (i.e. incline) your trajectory when you get too close... but it\u0027s really hard to tell how much before the actual encounter, so I sometime end up in very difficult situation (e.g. unwanted polar orbit).\u003Cbr\u003EBecause all that, my encouters are always very imprecise and I end up spending way more delta-V than I would need.

I\u0027m not 100% certain what you\u0027re asking, but it sounds like you are having trouble orienting your craft with the controls. The NavBall is your answer. Just remember that the center of the Navball is where your ship is pointing, and that (a) moves the pointer left, (d) moves it right, (w) down and (s) up. Then recall that pointing to the \u0022top dot\u0022 on the navball means your ship is pointing directly away from the planet\u0027s center, aka straight up at the sky.
