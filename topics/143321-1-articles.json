Still, I sort of am looking for advice and such. Not sure if everyone is familiar with the mod,\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/141084-113-centauri-dreams-pre-alpha-2/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ECentauri Dreams\u003C/a\u003E. I figured I\u0027d give it a try. It looked like a cool mod, and it is really quite something else. Given, the terrain on Elcano is a little glitchy, but wow, it\u0027s a sight to behold! It\u0027s also much harder than I first thought it would be. Sure, I did know what I was getting myself into: we\u0027re dealing with realistically sized objects, here. But I just hadn\u0027t realized I was looking at more than 1 km/s burns just within the Elcano system itself. Even more, I decided to give this a try in career, which is probably foolish in of itself. Still, it makes things interesting, and far more challenging. However, considering the numbers involved, you would have to spend over 1.8k \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E just to reach Hawking (Elcano\u0027s nearby asteroid moon), then another 1k just to slow down to get into Hawking orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI decided to give career a small break and muck around in sandbox, and given, I am not playing full on stock rocketry in sandbox, as I am using Near Future tech. But let\u0027s say for the sake of things, I would roll full stock rocketry in Centauri Dreams (for career especially). Whether in sandbox or career, how easy do you think it would it be just to land on Hawking and then return back to Elcano? How realistic would missions beyond the Elcano system be on just stock game\u00A0rockety? Has anyone else given this mod a try, yet?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-08T00:13:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know anything about centauri dreams, but I have played with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E, and it looks like centauri dreams is more like that than the stock system. \u00A0I have never managed to get very far in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E, but there is no way stock parts could get you anywhere. \u00A0Stock mass fractions are very unrealistic, in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E you have to use reconfigured tanks or procedural tanks. \u00A0Centauri dreams may be easier than \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E, though. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Der Anfang","CreatedById":134627,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-08T00:53:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222666042\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022143321\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221467936805\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022139256\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mad Rocket Scientist\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n39 minutes ago, Mad Rocket Scientist said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know anything about centauri dreams, but I have played with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, and it looks like centauri dreams is more like that than the stock system. \u00A0I have never managed to get very far in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, but there is no way stock parts could get you anywhere. \u00A0Stock mass fractions are very unrealistic, in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E you have to use reconfigured tanks or procedural tanks. \u00A0Centauri dreams may be easier than \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, though. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs it not possible to reach orbit on Earth in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E with stock rocketry?
