I used this for, for example, rotating a massive craft to a different attitude. In real-time, depending on the mass of the vehicle and how anemic the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E was, it could take a minute to do a 180, whereas physical timewarp allows me to do it in seconds. Given that physical timewarp already exists, would it be simple to implement that same functionality and give the user the option to invoke it regardless of where they are?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, let me do \u0026gt;4x physical timewarp; my CPU can handle it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lowi_Sace","CreatedById":224820,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-05T07:56:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can not imagine that this will not get added. With colonies/interstellar big interstellar ships will be needed which will take forever to turn around.
