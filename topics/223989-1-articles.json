Some mods store extra information about vessels or Kerbals in their own parts of the save files.

(Changing the state and assignments of existing kerbals is a slightly more complicated procedure - in the roster node for the kerbal, their state should be either assigned (on a vessel) or available (at the astronaut complex). Where they are on a vessel is controlled by having their name in a crew parameter on a PART subnode of the vessel\u0027s node in FLIGHTSTATE)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake a look at how each of these nodes are structured before trying to edit and if anything is unclear I would be happy to provide further clarification\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
