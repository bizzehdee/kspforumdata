First of all there is a whole Suggestions subforum in here, that actually is filled with *gasp* threads with suggestions. More, even if it was just the two threads, the situations are far from equivalent: in one the devs of the game asked for suggestions, in the other someone made the gracious favour of pointing that the devs had gone elsewhere to ask for input ( that most likely they already had given liberally in the sugestions and development threads ).

Further, while all the good stuff is really buried in there, I think it\u0027s reasonable to expect that the developers taken note of the best ideas in there. Finally, as has been noted before, Reddit probably has a wider viewing range, and access to more new players who might be able to provide the feedback they were looking for. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I don\u0027t understand is how it is unreasonable that the developers went to a different forum for feedback when they wanted to cultivate that forum specifically for feedback, and why it\u0027s unreasonable to expect people on this forum to react to that situation...reasonably.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-12T03:12:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA rocket died while I was distracted here \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E The only other game forum I have participated in, is for EVE Online, where players make a habit of tearing the company, and each other, apart on a daily basis.
