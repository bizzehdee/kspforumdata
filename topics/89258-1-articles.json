You likely have to click on a staging element in the staging diagram at the same time you are clicking on the exit button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) You will be transported outside the VAB, but will have an odd view in which you are not directly over all the space center buildings, but can view the VAB from an angle. The only thing you can click on is the VAB. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with this bug is that until you figure it out yourself you get caught in an infinite loop. E.g. go back into VAB, exit into weird mode, go back into VAB, exit into weird mode, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem was first observed in 0.242 but still appears to occur in 0.25.
