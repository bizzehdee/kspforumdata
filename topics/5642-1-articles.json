The result looks like a figure eight orbit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EgMm3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EgMm3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut how does one achieve this orbit? You might notice that simply matching your Apoapsis with the Mun\\\u0027s orbit doesn\\\u0027t work. So how do you do it? Simple! You go farther than the Mun\\\u0027s orbit!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut why does this work? Wouldn\\\u0027t going further make you go faster, therefore flinging you into outer space? Yes, but at the same time, not at all! In this type of orbit, you still have a larger percentage of your velocity going into pushing you further away from Kerbin as you enter the Mun\\\u0027s SOI. This vertical velocity relative to Kerbin is lateral velocity relative to the Mun, allowing you to slingshot around it. You may speed up initially, but as you leave Munar orbit, the Mun slows you down, and moves along its own orbit, slowly causing you to point towards Kerbin. As you get closer to Kerbin, your top lateral speed cannot be greater than that of the Mun since you\\\u0027re escaping its orbit in a retrograde manner, plus you\\\u0027re getting closer to Kerbin, so this lateral speed is not only less than the Mun\\\u0027s, but closer in to Kerbin, so naturally your orbit is very elliptical. If you really did it right, your Periapsis will be deep enough in Kerbin\\\u0027s atmosphere to cause you to re-enter and land there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some pictures of my own FRT mission:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiftoff!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nNwFq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nNwFq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStaging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/euGSH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022euGSH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the second stage put us in orbit, we now wait for the correct burn time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mhSpl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mhSpl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMun is rising!
