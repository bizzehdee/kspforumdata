Just checking in. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve discovered something notable about the Eagle nose-dive problem. Still working with the Mk2 for now. But I have noticed that how high or low the center of gravity winds up makes a large difference in how stable the Eagle is under load. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe COG on an empty truss bar Eagle is fairly high. Just under the truss. Add a load to it and the COG lowers. The lower the COG, the more it wants to nose dive when rear engines are activated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn an unsecured payload with a single docking port attachment in the center of the truss, the lower and heavier the COG, the more the cargo swings. I suspect that if I had the ability to apply a COG marker on the ship outside of the hanger as I was testing it, I\u0027d find it swinging back and forth like a pendulum as soon as the rear engine thrust is applied, knocking the balance off farther and farther each swing until either I turn off the rear engines or crash. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe COG being lower means the rear engines are effectively pushing the Eagle\u0027s mass at an angle. That has to be compensated for somehow. (see below)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe test pods I\u0027ve been making with the LLL parts are giving me interesting results. I\u0027ve already noted above what a single docking node under the truss with a heavy load does. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe passenger pod that I created (seen in the River Valley video on Twitch) is very light. No fuel. Mostly cosmetic hull sections (there\u0027s some internal truss bars with connecting struts). It is \u0022docked\u0022 not on a single node under the truss, but via docking nodes where the hatches would be on a series Eagle on the main body, front and back. I can\u0027t undock this pod unfortunately without something exploding and tearing the ship apart. But that\u0027s okay. Looking at the COG on it in the SPH shows that it\u0027s so light that the COG isn\u0027t far off from a standard non-loaded Eagle. That\u0027s why I was able to work with it so well in the River Valley video. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have managed to construct a Pod for a Kethane mining and cracking station that CAN be dropped and re-docked using the front/back docking nodes. But it\u0027s pretty heavy. On the Mun it\u0027s manageable in the light gravity. On Kerbin in order to get it into orbit I pretty much have to use VTOL to orbit. I can use the main engines under low power for orbital maneuvering. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QXI7DrV.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022QXI7DrV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8WyCRkT.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00228WyCRkT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow is the pod in question on it\u0027s own. You could drop this thing on a Kethane node for extraction and cracking. It\u0027s got everything it needs, except for a tank for storage of refined fuels. For that you need to hook up a craft with some storage. This version would be able to use either the Merlin transfer system or the KAS. This pod uses several mod packs to build. Lackluster Labs. B9 Aerospace, the Kethane mod (naturally), Kerbal Attachment System and the Merlin Transfer system. The landing legs are off of the old Rocktco Soviet Style Munar lander (they still work just fine even though the pack hasn\u0027t been updated for .19). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/O6qyviM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022O6qyviM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it works and all. But it does take a patient and steady hand to get it up to the Mun. The advantage to a pod built this way though is that it fullfills the goal of being droppable and able to be picked back up again! AND still do something useful!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d been making the suggestion for a rear/main engine design that has two gimbal \u0022nodes\u0022 to switch between. But it may wind up being more complex than that, based on what I\u0027ve been seeing happening with the changing Center of Gravity (COG) that happens as various loads are attached. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wonder if it\u0027s possible to have an engine where you can re-position the angle of thrust along a range of vectors. With the gimbals still able to pitch and yaw like normal, but based on where the engine pitch is currently set. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I don\u0027t think it can be something as simple as the two-position change that takes place on - for example - the B9 pack VTOL or the Falcon VTOL engines. I think we need something more adjustable then that. I don\u0027t think it can be done automatically. But it might be something you could set up either via action groups or right-clicking. In my minds eye I see something like an engine that has 4-6 \u0022nodes\u0022. These would be settings for various weights or loads. For example - Setting #1 would be for an Eagle with no load attached at all. #2 would be for a light load like the passenger pod or a small probe or Rover. #3 would be for something like the Kethane cracking station above, and so on etc. #5 or #6 would be for something REALLY heavy, or for trying to use the Eagle as a Skycrane with a load dangling well below it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither that - or maybe we could do something with the resource system to move fuel around to alter the COG to compensate? Something like that is already sort of in place for the current Mk3 testing rigs. But I\u0027d want it to be a lot more intuitive and easy to operate \u0022on the fly\u0022. And I\u0027ve already made note (and videos) of the problems I was seeing with the MK3 not being as easily controllable or stable as the MK2.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-06T09:09:08Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2013 09:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Logan.Darklighter\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypos\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Devo","CreatedById":22750,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-06T15:13:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow those pods are great, I almost dont feel like finishing mine lol.. I will dont worry.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENah ive been working my ass off on the dropship.. yes its working, yes you can fly it.. but it has a few issues you will see when you test it.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not a personal fan of the B9 pack, alot of the parts give me some serious issues, and I agree, VTOL cannot be 2 stage, it needs to be totally controllable. I have that part sorted out tho, will post video shortly... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a few more tests then I can hand it to you guys, just trying to save you some headaches.
