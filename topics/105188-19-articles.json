The cause of course is that the CoM is moving backwards and maybe even behind the CoL (They really need to change that to the correct CoP) when the fuel drains and your later stages are far too light. Now, we use fins to pull the CoL down far, but instead try putting in an Upper stage to boost out of the upper atmosphere. That way when the fuel drains the top of the rocket is till heavy, basically making your payload much heavier. Does that wording make sense? Smaller first stage, augmented by an upper stage instead of one big first stage. That way the CoM will always be up front.\n\nAs the fuel drains out of a single stage rocket you are left with a heavy engine at the back, and a heavy payload at the front.

It\u0027s a simple temperature \u002B orbit science contract probe, the payload should circularize itself. My problem came as soon as the Hammer kicked in, and putting fins on it seems silly and dangerous on launch.\n\nThen I read the topic where people say they\u0027re able to go up in as little as 1800m/s in new stock aero, so after experimenting with the dV I switch the Terrier\u0027s fuel tank for a slightly larger one and drop the Hammer entirely, and still have margin for my sloppy skills. Now my second stage (which is now also the last) fires up higher, at around 25000, since I can lower the thrust on the first stage a little and let it burn longer.\n\nSome posts say air is pretty thin up there already, but I still flip a lot. This second setup does maintain control for a while (the Hammer one just went bonkers, no matter what TWR I tried), but as soon as it\u0027s 2 deg off prograde it\u0027s already a nightmare to keep it stable.\n\nBut as Alshain said, maybe flight stick? Also, need to work on my ascent profile.\n\nWith SAS on I have no trouble putting things up, although I\u0027m nowhere near 1800m/s efficiency. I just wanted to be able to launch a few hands-off rockets, on FAR I did fairly better."},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T22:44:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I don;t have a single rocket all of which worked beautifully in .9 that does not tip early immediately of as I ascend.\n\nYeah, that\u0027s what a completely wrong errordynamics model will do - you need to relearn everything about aerodynamics that stock 0.90 and before taught you. Pretty much every single craft built before 1.0 will have aerodynamic issues (unless you used FAR etc) because there simply was no reward to making it aerodynamic. Of course, I don\u0027t care if you quit the game, but if you want to learn, you just need to make your rocket look like a rocket. Streamlined, tall, thin and with no major sticky out bits, it\u0027s that simple. No university degree in aerodynamics required. \n\nAlso, if you don\u0027t understand how Scott controlled his vessel, that doesn\u0027t mean they ruined the game, it means that you don\u0027t know how to control vessels (to be blunt). I used FAR from 0.23 onwards and the new stock aero is completely intuitive and fun to fly in and I\u0027ve had zero issues that I didn\u0027t understand the cause of (I\u0027ve had a few flips, but I know that\u0027s because my AoA was too high).\n\nSquad didn\u0027t ruin the game, they fixed it.

SAS may seem to jerk you around or overcompensate b/c of increased gimbal range on rocket engines; this can be adjusted in flight when it becomes a problem, by right-clicking on the engine and decreasing the gimbal range percentage. \nFlying is harder due to drag effects pulling on you. Make gradual turns, sharp ones can get you in trouble. If you\u0027ve been flying at max thrust, try going slower.
