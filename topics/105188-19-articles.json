SAS may seem to jerk you around or overcompensate b/c of increased gimbal range on rocket engines; this can be adjusted in flight when it becomes a problem, by right-clicking on the engine and decreasing the gimbal range percentage. \u003Cp\u003EFlying is harder due to drag effects pulling on you. Make gradual turns, sharp ones can get you in trouble. If you\u0027ve been flying at max thrust, try going slower.
