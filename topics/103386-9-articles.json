It can take a few hours just to re-export a single model from Unity; far more so when animations are involved (and that is just the Unity side of things, not including the actual animating or re-texturing that would be needed); that is time that I merely do not posses at the moment.

They decouple perfectly fine for me on my current setup, both the ICPS from its lower attachment, and the SM from the ICPS (hmm...not sure if I have SAS on for these or not...). I should also ask if you are using the Bacon-Labs config/distribution, or my dev releases? (I cannot really offer support for the BL releases, as _Augustus_ has changed too much stuff in configs and otherwise that is out of my control). But..either way... I\u0027ll give this another look over tonight (and video the results if needed). Thanks for the more detailed investigation/steps for reproduction. I suppose I should download the B/L pack and test that version as well, might be some independent issues that are popping up. Hmm...could also be related to jettisoning the shrouds/side panels; I always do that in the upper atmo (\u0026gt;40k) at the same time I jettison the BPC/LAS...so I\u0027ll check on that too (the stock jettison mechanics are...weird...and those panels most certainly -do- have colliders after they are jettisoned...when they really should not).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR w/ parachute -- I do not use / support FAR. Mostly I don\u0027t support it -because- I don\u0027t use it (I love the idea, but I\u0027ve never gotten to try it out as there are always far too many incompatibilities for my highly modded games...). As far as fixing the problem goes, I would have no idea where to start; FAR -should- make itself compatible with anything that works using stock mechanics and modules (e.g. ModuleParachute and ModuleDragCubeModifier), but that is apparently not the case. If you come across any solutions for this, please let me know and I\u0027ll see about getting them integrated/releasing a patch (there is probably a special module that FAR adds to parts to manipulate the voxelization / modify drag ratios, but I have no idea what it is).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBlack command pod -- is this in 1.04? I have not yet had time to test in 1.04, and with _Augustus_ adding ablator to it, it -could- be doing some weird things with the heating/ablator shader. (You could try editing the config and removing the ablator section to see if that solves the issue -- it was NOT designed to have ablator anyways, and I will not be supporting any issues that arise from its inclusion).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESM sizing -- yep; IRL the SM is -not- the same size as the rest of the stack, you can clearly see this if you examine photos/diagrams/etc. The actual dimensions for the Orion CM are ~very close to 5m (which results in the 3.75m scaled size), and the SM is slightly wider around the decoupler area (the 4.~m section), and sightly smaller around the main body (2.8m or so). You don\u0027t -have- to use it with the ICPS, there are adapters included (or -should- be) that will allow you to mate it to a standard 3.75m stack (MSA and SCA adapters). Sorry, but that is just how it was designed in real life; it will pretty much always need adapters. If you look at any diagrams/etc of the real-life equivalent, you will notice different adapters are present depending upon exact configuration... but always present.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWRT heat from the ICPS, I was thinking the other day that I need to re-examine the heat production from that part, as I based its current/original heat stats from a full tank/maximum mass; where the heat stats should actually be based off of an empty tank/minimum mass for the part (basically just the engine) -- this should result in a much slower heating while the tank is full, and about the same heating when the tank is empty; overall result should be a fairly large reduction in heat output from that part. Still need to examine and unify this theory with the 1.04 heat mechanics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, I believe _Augustus_ is away on vaction for a few days / another week or more; I cannot fix anything in the public releases, but I can at least try and track down what the issues are and have fixes ready for when he returns.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T20:54:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUpdate from _Augustus_:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApparently he has been temp-banned from the forums for some drama with other users.

I have tried several variations (things on the pod, like rcs thrusters and extra chutes, etc.), and found that the bare pod (without anything else on it, except a docking port on top) it shows up white. If \u0027too many\u0027 items are placed on the pod exterior, or overlapping the fairing a bit, then it comes out all black.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
