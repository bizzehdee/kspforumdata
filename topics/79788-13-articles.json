These show up in the tracking station for all currently posted contracts, and in game on the map for any that you\u0027ve accepted, just like normal waypoints.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdded satellite deployment contracts. They do not show up until you have technology for probe cores, power sources, and antennae. These contracts will ask you to build a new unmanned probe with an antenna and a power source, then put it into a very specific orbit, shown on the map with the new waypoints. The mission will ask you to put it into a certain deviation of the orbit shown, and the deviation gets smaller as the difficulty goes up. You need to match everything: apoapsis, periapsis, inclination, eccentricity, the whole nine yards. The orbits also get less kosher as the difficulty goes up, more eccentric and inclined, and the burns required to hit that deviation window are very minute. It\u0027s challenging, but the pay goes up as well. This mission type prefers Kerbin, but can go to other planets as well, especially at higher difficulties. On Kerbin, the reputation and fund rewards are tripled, but the science is cut to a third. This is to emulate a commercial space program on Kerbin putting up satellites for clients. That doesn\u0027t mean it will pay as well as putting a satellite around Moho, it just means it will be comparable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdded new \u0022neutralize controls for a period of time\u0022 objective. This objective requires you to cut your throttle, and turn off any controls, such as RCS or SAS for a certain period of time. This was added to asteroid recovery missions, base building missions, station building missions, and satellite deployment missions to prevent the mission from completing before the situation has...stabilized.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdjusted the way that distance calculations to waypoints are calculated, specifically in regards to altitude. For aerial waypoints this means that you can now fly anywhere within the height envelope shown on the contract and still complete them. For rover contracts, it means that if a waypoint spawns at an odd height, it doesn\u0027t matter, as you just need to drive to the general area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDrastically reduced the distance required to trigger rover waypoints. This was made possible by the previous change, and means that you now have to actually drive around within a rover cluster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFixed the cupola objective plaguing some station missions, a big thanks to Burkitt for helping me track this issue down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m interested in feedback on the satellite deployment missions, and any bug reports.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-08T21:52:22Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2014 09:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Arsonide\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rabzoue59","CreatedById":89075,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-08T22:18:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat nice things here, maybe you can add an insteresting mission : Geostationnary orbit, for someone who want to create a relay network, your have to match the orbit period, not periapsis or apo, like that you can put one probe on 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, another at 60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 another at 120\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 etc etc\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eanyway thanks for your work\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hurry- Starfish!","CreatedById":90298,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-08T22:35:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWill this new update wipe my contracts again?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arsonide","CreatedById":32604,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-08T22:38:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hurry, Starfish!\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hurry, Starfish!\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWill this new update wipe my contracts again?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis update should not wipe your board, as no save data for existing contracts was modified.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/223168-fine-print\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAaaand we\u0027re on Curse!\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-08T23:17:28Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2014 11:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Arsonide\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vardicd","CreatedById":75832,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-09T01:03:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Arsonide\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Arsonide\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/223168-fine-print\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAaaand we\u0027re on Curse!\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough there doesn\u0027t seem to be a download on curse?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arsonide","CreatedById":32604,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-09T01:18:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vardicd\u0022 data-cite=\u0022vardicd\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlthough there doesn\u0027t seem to be a download on curse?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETook a bit of wrestling, but I fixed it.
