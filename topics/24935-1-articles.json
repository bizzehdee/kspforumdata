Nonetheless it has changed my view on space especially how trajectories and flying in general works out. It also makes me wonder how the movie spacecrafts like from starwars or startrek compare to real life space \u0022flying\u0022. I am not talking about warp drives or wormhole travel but about how they orbit and approach things. If anything in KSP is true then meeting up with a craft, approaching and docking seems like quite the ordeal IRL with lots of engine burns, aligning/maneuvering, RCS maneuvers etc, yet in movies (like the above mentioned) smaller \u0022starfighters\u0022 seem to be able to race around starbases and motherships quite easily with high speeds and agility, something that appears to be impossible to replicate in KSP without crashing into an object or getting completely off course. Is the entire movie thing with small \u0022starfighters\u0022 zooming about big spaceships in battles just a Hollywood thing or could this become reality? Maybe if we have faster and specialized engines?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe someone here has an answer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDan\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-01T06:55:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGenerally, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/misconceptions.php\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emovies tend to get things very wrong\u003C/a\u003E. \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EI seem to be linking to this site a lot lately...\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace fighters in particular get argued about a lot. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Analysis/SpaceFighter\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis page\u003C/a\u003E (warning: TV Tropes) has a fairly comprehensive discussion of the pros and cons, but I\u0027d say that the biggest blow against them is the fact that there\u0027s effectively no horizon in space.
