Note that this mod will not show except on the actions editor screen in the editor and that in both the editor and in flight, the mod is hidden by default and will not show until the ModActs button is clicked.\n\n2) Select your part to edit actions on.\n\n - Directly click the part in the 3D editor game space.\n\n Or, if you are not sure which parts can be controlled by which mod, make sure no parts are selected and select a mod to see all parts that can be edited for that mod. The selected mod\u0027s button with turn green and all parts that mod can control will be indicated by the purple circles. Click on the desired part in the 3D editor game space to select a part.\n\n3) An unassigned action will have a \u0022Click to select\u0022 button. When in this state, the action is hidden from the action group editor and if you somehow manage to activate it, it will do nothing.\n\nClick the \u0022Click to select\u0022 button to view a list of mods that can be controlled from this part and select the desired one. The \u0022Clear Action\u0022 button is always present and when selected deletes the action and returns it to the \u0022Click to select\u0022 state. When a mod is selected, the first action in that mod will be chosen to fill the fields in this action in. At this point, the action will become visible in the action selector to add it to an action group.\n\n4) Keep narrowing down your selection in the third and fourth columns (Thrust Limit and Thrust Limit#![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif). While each column only has a single selection at the moment, once larger mods are implemented they will be grouped and filtered by these columns.\n\n5) Enter the desired percentage for the thrust limiter in the right-most column. The value is in percent, so a value of 50 will set the engine thrust limiter to 50%.\n\n6) Enter an appropriate description in the left-most field. This is a free-text field that you can use as you desire to remember what the action does. The text that shows here will be the text visible as the action name when adding the action to an action group. Note that this field resets any time the fourth column changes because that means the action in this slot has changed and so your old description is no longer valid.\n\n7) Click the Mod Acts button again to hide this window and go to the action group editor to assign your Thrust Limiting actions to an action group to be usable in flight.\n\n**Note:** This mod adds new actions to a part\u0027s available actions list. You must still select the action and assign it to an action group as you do with any other action.\n\nFeedback request:\n\nThe biggest thing I need feedback on is the GUI. That is going to make or break this mod and I need to know what you players think. Notably how wide it is. I\u0027ve scrunched things up due to worries about screen size, could I go wider without any issues on your screens?\n\nAny other feedback is also appreciated, including suggestions on what other mods you want to see in this mod. \n\nD.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-29T23:32:57Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2015 11:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Diazo**"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T02:52:29Z","Content":"Working with KSP in 1280x720 and the width is fine.

Your description in your last post seems to describe two different use paths into one.\n\nThe two ways I expected the mod to be used:\n\n1) Player knows which part the action is on:\n\n-Click on the part, ModActs window will show the rows of programable actions, they will all say \u0022Click to Select\u0022.\n\n-Click on an action, it will show a list of Mods this part supports, if is an engine, clicking Stock Engines will choose that action. (The screen should now look almost identical to the picture in my first post.)\n\n-You can now tweak the action (and once more actions are added, pick them here.)\n\n2) Player does not know which parts the mod to control is on: (Vessel control mods not attached to a part most likely.)\n\n-Make sure no parts are selected, either upon first entering the editor or by clicking the \u0022Clear Selection\u0022 button.\n\n-A list of all loaded mods will appear on buttons. Clicking a mod will turn that mod\u0027s button green and all parts that support the highlighted mod will be indicated by a purple circle. (Clicking on a green button does nothing, clicking another mod\u0027s button changes the green button to that mod and shows the associated parts.)\n\n-Player clicks on the part desired and now knows the part needed, goto use case 1 above.\n\nThe way I read your previous post is that neither of these happened. Rather something like the following:\n\n-Get to the Actions Editor and open the ModActs window.\n\n-Click on the engine directly, no interactions yet with the ModActs window.\n\n-ModActs window changes to show the list of mods installed with the Stock Engines mod highlighted in green (as if no parts were selected in case 2 above) instead of the list of actions on the part that it is supposed to show (a column of Click to Select) buttons.\n\nThis should not be happening because for the list of all mods to show, no parts can be selected. As you have selected the engine part, you clearly have a part selected.\n\nI\u0027ll dig into it.\n\nD.\n\nedit: Quick youtube of how things are supposed to work. First half is how I think you are trying to use the mod by click on the engine first. Second half (after the mouse circles the clear selection button) shows the list of all mods and how you can highlight associated parts. Vertical Vel. is the second mod I\u0027m adding that uses control pods, so it\u0027s purple circle shows on the pod.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZZsPwLU37t4?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-14T14:45:08Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2015 02:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Diazo**"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T15:09:42Z","Content":"Here\u0027s a click by click - did it two different ways:\n\nBuild craft with two engines\n\nTry 1:\n\n1) Go to Action Groups editor\n\n2) Click MOD ACTS button\n\n - Mod Acts window comes up with grey \u0022Stock Engines\u0022\n\n3) Click \u0022Stock Engines\u0022 button in Mod Act window\n\n - Mod Act \u0022Stock Engines\u0022 turns green and a circle appears on both engines\n\n4) Click one of the engines\n\n - Engine gets highlight tint and stock actions appear in stock window\n\n - Mod Act window has not changed - Showing green \u0022Stock Engines\u0022 button.\n\nTry 2:\n\n1) Go to Action Groups editor\n\n2) Click one of the engines\n\n - Engine gets highlight tint and stock actions appear in stock window\n\n3) Click MOD ACTS button\n\n - Mod Acts window comes up with grey \u0022Stock Engines\u0022\n\n4) Click \u0022Stock Engines\u0022 button in Mod Act window\n\n - Mod Act \u0022Stock Engines\u0022 turns green and a circle appears on both engines\n\nAt no point did I see the list of \u0022Click to select\u0022 buttons from the video."},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T15:12:43Z","Content":"Alright, thank you for the detailed reproduction steps.\n\nI\u0027ll dig into it and try to have some answers later today.\n\nD."},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T01:47:35Z","Content":"Found something though I can\u0027t seem to get it to repeat.\n\nI started with a fresh install, built a craft and went into the action group editor and selected an action group before opening Mod Acts and I saw all the right buttons including the thrust limit input box.
