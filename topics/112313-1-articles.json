Note that this mod will not show except on the actions editor screen in the editor and that in both the editor and in flight, the mod is hidden by default and will not show until the ModActs button is clicked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Select your part to edit actions on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Directly click the part in the 3D editor game space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Or, if you are not sure which parts can be controlled by which mod, make sure no parts are selected and select a mod to see all parts that can be edited for that mod. The selected mod\u0027s button with turn green and all parts that mod can control will be indicated by the purple circles. Click on the desired part in the 3D editor game space to select a part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) An unassigned action will have a \u0022Click to select\u0022 button. When in this state, the action is hidden from the action group editor and if you somehow manage to activate it, it will do nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClick the \u0022Click to select\u0022 button to view a list of mods that can be controlled from this part and select the desired one. The \u0022Clear Action\u0022 button is always present and when selected deletes the action and returns it to the \u0022Click to select\u0022 state. When a mod is selected, the first action in that mod will be chosen to fill the fields in this action in. At this point, the action will become visible in the action selector to add it to an action group.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Keep narrowing down your selection in the third and fourth columns (Thrust Limit and Thrust Limit#\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. While each column only has a single selection at the moment, once larger mods are implemented they will be grouped and filtered by these columns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Enter the desired percentage for the thrust limiter in the right-most column. The value is in percent, so a value of 50 will set the engine thrust limiter to 50%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Enter an appropriate description in the left-most field. This is a free-text field that you can use as you desire to remember what the action does. The text that shows here will be the text visible as the action name when adding the action to an action group. Note that this field resets any time the fourth column changes because that means the action in this slot has changed and so your old description is no longer valid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Click the Mod Acts button again to hide this window and go to the action group editor to assign your Thrust Limiting actions to an action group to be usable in flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENote:\u003C/strong\u003E This mod adds new actions to a part\u0027s available actions list.
