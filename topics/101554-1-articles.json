Your challenge, should you choose to accept it: jump a rover as far as you can in Minmus\u0027s low low gravity. \n\n\u0022OPEN\u0022 CATEGORY:\n\n1. Starwhip 2.1 km, max height 562m\n\n2. Ghostbuzzer7 1.3km, max height 301m\n\n3. noorm 1068.5m\n\n4. Foxster 1003.0m\n\n5. Kuzzter 638.6m\n\n6. Tarantulae 589.8m\n\n\u0022UNLIMITED\u0022 CATEGORY:\n\n1. Juzeris ESCAPE 507 m/s\n\n2. Petronator ESCAPE, 306 m/s\n\n3. Kuzzter 18.4 km \n\n4. Starwhip 6.1km \n\n5. Tarantulae 1.9km\n\nOTHER RUNS DISQUALIFIED DUE TO SHENANIGANS:\n\n1. Foxster 557,260m -- *illegal propulsion source*\n\nTHE RULES--\u0022OPEN\u0022 CATEGORY:\n\n1. The Rover\n\n- Stock parts only.\n- Vehicle must be crewed. No capsules or cockpits: all Kerbals must ride in EAS Command Seats.\n- No sources of propulsion other than electrically driven rover wheels.\n\n2. Ramps\n\n- Ramps are inert. No engines, RCS motors, rover wheels or any other part may be used to impart kinetic energy to the rover. (But you may use any of the above to position the ramp(s))\n- All of the ramps you use must fit together in the VAB or SPH in one go. You may reconfigure at will once you get to site.\n- You may not use Minmus terrain as part of your ramp system; any contact with the surface prior to apogee will result in a disqualification.\n\n3. The Run\n\n- The jump site shall be any convenient ice lake on Minmus. All ramps must be landed completely on the ice (altitude zero).\n- You may hyperedit the rover and all ramps to the site.\n- The rover must begin the run with its brakes set, in contact with either a ramp or the ice.\n- Crew must stay in their seats for the entire jump. No ladder exploits, no pushing with EVA packs, etc.\n\n4. Judging \n\n- This is a distance competition, measured linearly from the launching point of the rover to its first impact with the surface of Minmus.\n- Post pictures (or video) showing your ramp setup and the rover at start. If your ramps are ridiculous, prove they all fit in the VAB together as well.\n- For leaderboard consideration, post a picture or video that shows the distance traveled from the ramp and/or your max altitude/velocity. Only the first impact counts: no bouncing!\n- The vehicle may lose parts on landing, however all crew and passengers must finish the jump still in their seats, with full EVA tanks. Post a picture of the rover when it comes to rest.\n- Do your best to land on the ice, but if you go out of bounds it\u0027s OK. (actually it hurts you)\n- I know what you\u0027re thinking. Is it possible for the rover to NEVER land? Well, orbital speed is 247.1 m/s according to the wiki... good luck, cowboy.\n\nTHE RULES--\u0022UNLIMITED\u0022 CATEGORY:\n\n- The goal is to launch a crewed vehicle as far as possible from the Minmus ice sheet using only renewable resouces.\n- Stock parts (and stock physics) only. No clipping or glitching.\n- Crew must remain in their seats (or capsule(s)) for the entire run.\n- You may use any combination of stationary or mobile \u0022crafts\u0022 to propel the vehicle\n- No craft may use any of the folowing:  \n\n    - Rocket or jet engine, including vernors\n    - Monopropellant engine or thruster\n    - Decouplers or separators\n\n    [\\*]The vehicle and other craft(s) may start anywhere on Minmus, but the vehicle must touch the ice or a craft on the ice at the \u0022launch point\u0022\n\n    [\\*]Distance will be measured from the launch point to point of first impact with Minmus terrain\n\n    [\\*]If anyone reaches orbit (stable or otherwise), orbital runs will be ranked by periapsis.\n\n    [\\*]If anyone reaches escape velocity, escape runs will be ranked by maximum velocity while still in Minmus SOI.\n\nI hope I\u0027ve thought of everything, and that my fellow Kerbonauts enjoy the challenge!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-24T00:09:44Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2015 12:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kuzzter**\n  \nNow with UNLIMITED!"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T22:01:25Z","Content":"It\u0027s not crewed if not in a capsule."},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T22:33:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s not crewed if not in a capsule.\n\nYou can use a capsule to spawn the crew for the rover.

Depends a bit on the gravity; you can get to 22 on Kerbin as the traction is better. If you can hit that then you are doing well and stand a good chance of a longish jump. \n\nOf course, you can make a really stable rover even in light gravity capable of 100m/s if you use landing gear for wheels and power it with an ion engine angled steeply towards the ground like this:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jc-GhwMzr5M?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-09T23:11:21Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2015 11:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Foxster**"},{"CreatedByName":"noorm","CreatedById":139301,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T04:16:20Z","Content":"I hope I\u0027m not too late for my first challenge!
