I have to say, coming from CTT, this tree feels fresh, and after a cursory examination, seems very well laid out, on a macro level (although there are two free floating nodes on the bottom that you can unlock from the start, they are Cryogenic Freezing from Deep Freeze and USI Nuclear Recycling or something, which seems a bit advanced when I can\u0027t even field a probe yet). Aside from that though, well done, seriously.\n\n(Oh, as a general aside, I should add that I have well over a hundred mods installed, so there are bound to be some holes in the tech tree, understandable, just wanted to point out some trends).\n\nSome issues, however, on the micro level, within the nodes themselves. With those 30 points I grabbed, I don\u0027t remember exactly, maybe General Construction, Landing, Rocket Stuff Something Something, Electrics, Stability, Survivability, etc. Whatever, all the the cheap as chips stuff. I had 5 points left over after taking biplane.\n\nThe good: capsules, probes, tech, and rocket engines (for the most parts), stock and modded seemed spot on. My first test flight was actually a hot air-balloon, in a ballistic capsule with a hatch that didn\u0027t open! Felt very early-space race to me, very authentic; Jeb approved.\n\nThe not as good: heat shields; decouplers, airplane engines. I never took airplane tech, aside from biplane (a 3 point tech node), yet I had at least a dozen propeller engines, including the monster $5000 three bladed stacked \u0027Bear\u0027 propeller engine, which is normally a later tech engine, unlocked at the same time as the $100 tiny propeller engine. I forget which mod these are from, but they\u0027re not from Firespitter, I know that. Heatshields: I had half a dozen modded heat shields, didn\u0027t unlock any stock ones yet. Decouplers: I had a couple of 2.5m modded decouplers, nothing stock unlocked.\n\nAnyway, just my first impression. Overall, I\u0027m impressed with the layout and looking forward to this play through. And no, I don\u0027t expect you to account for every mod in existence, obviously, I only mentioned the above since it jumped out at me.

There is a list of the ones I have done and are supported, but even those may not have the very latest parts integrated.\n\nPlease let me know what part mods you are playing with and I will see if I can get them on the short list.\n\nBalloons you say...  Very interesting.  That would fit very well in my vision for this tree.  Which mod are you using?  I\u0027m guessing you are also running Linux?\n\nI am really trying to release a new experimental version using Yonge\u0027s Tech Tree mod.  It includes several more part packs and the previously recommended node/part changes.  I\u0027ve also re-arranged the node progression for [@FreeThinker](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/117389-freethinker/) but that caused a few other nuclear part packs ([@Nertea](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/83952-nertea/)\u0027s) to be out of order, so I have to fix those.\n\nThe aircraft side of the tree is being overhauled.  [@inigma](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/69310-inigma/) is helping me with that.\n\nSo the next release will be a biggy.\n\nEDIT: Oh yeah, and the disconnected nodes you see at the bottom of the tree are the holding areas that I use when distributing parts.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-21T16:24:57Z\u0022 title=\u002202/21/2016 04:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Probus**"},{"CreatedByName":"Deimos Rast","CreatedById":157420,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-22T03:36:08Z","Content":"Balloons, from [Kerballoons](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/107432-105-kerballoons-v031-balloons-for-ksp/).

Why is it possible to unlock the standard docking port before the junior?  Shouldn\u0027t it be the other way around? Especially as this TT features unmanned before manned and I prefer rather small unmanned vehicles which are not easy to use with the standard docking port.

Sometimes the tree progresses in a small --\u003E medium/miniature --\u003E large progression with the thought of designing a mini docking port, for example, would be harder than making a regular sized port.  That is what makes it seem peculiar.  Sometimes the tech tree may take the approach of large --\u003E medium --\u003E small --\u003E micro as in the case with a lot of the unmanned cores and some nuclear reactors.\n\nTo tell the truth, I have never really liked the way docking ports are laid out.  I may just switch them up like you suggest to follow the way that FASA does it with the Gemini/Agena ports.\n\nThere was no way for me to do a tree that was just stock parts because all the mods add such a diversity of part types, the tree would seem very shrunken to anyone who played with these mods.  My goal from the inception of this tree was to make it to include as many mods as possible, that just keeps pushing the node count up and up very slowly.\n\nI really appreciate that you like it.

It is absolutely okay for me this tech tree supports lots mods. I just think the first set of nodes should also be playable with only stock parts. With playable I mean no empty nodes. For example I noticed the node Solid Rockets is empty for me. The next node, Advanced SRB, has the Hammer booster. I just wondered why this is not in Solid Rockets as Advanced Rockets also features the BACC \u0022Thumper\u0022\n\n    @PART[solidBooster]:NEEDS[zETT]:FINAL\n    {@TechRequired = AdvancedSRB\n    }\n\nThis is just an example where I think this tech tree could need some fine tuning for stock parts.
