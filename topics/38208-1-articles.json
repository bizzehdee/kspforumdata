I want this ship to be probe-powered, so the Kerbal doesn\u0027t have to control it when going IVA in the lander can (I wanted a smaller habitation module, so this is the best I got). Unfortunately by doing so, the game assumes that I want to control the ship via the lander can (as it is a command pod).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there anyway to override this, to keep the probe the one that controls the ship?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also leads to a similar question. The ship that will be orbiting that\u0027ll (hopefully) be capable of going from Laythe to Duna and back, will have a Mk3 Cockpit to control the craft. On the back, I want to have a PPD-12 Cupola Module. Both are command pods. This\u0027ll be where my Kerbal that comes from this rocket, can watch the stars as he\u0027s being, chauffeured between planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith him going IVA, will the game think again, he\u0027s the one controlling the ship, or will it see the Mk3 cockpit being the one?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-22T19:49:59Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2013 07:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Benie\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T21:19:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs soon as you\u0027ll go IVA, the craft will assume you are controlling from there, there\u0027s nothing you can do about it sadly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"corvus2606","CreatedById":57190,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T21:22:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eno matter what you do, when you IVA you will take control from that kerbal.
