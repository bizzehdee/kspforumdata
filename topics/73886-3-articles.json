Yesterday I found out about Eyes Turned Skywards and surfed through the artwork page like a maniac just before going to sleep. As to be expected, I dreamed I was piloting the Apollo Block III\u002B. I don\u0027t remember which rocket we were flying on, but I perfectly remember the moment when the orbital incersion burn was finished and we were weightless. I happened to be the Command Module Pilot, so it was my task to dock to the additional module.
