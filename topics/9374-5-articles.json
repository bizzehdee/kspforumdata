If you\\\u0027re going for a PhD though, lectures I guess would kind of be necessary - there\\\u0027s going to be a lot to do and a lot to cover. You just need to be good at soaking at all up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I strongly believe that education at the highschool level and lower would be much better if it was more interactive, more applied and more inspirational. Problem is, we\\\u0027re not doing anything REALLY interesting at the moment in the world, at least to a kid or teenager, so what can teachers relate the knowledge to? If there\\\u0027s nothing to apply it to, the students just ask: \u0027When will I ever need this?\u0027 and then stop caring about the subject. Personally I think that course of action is quite mentally unsound - you acted on a question, not an answer. Why not go get an answer, then decide what to do about the stuff you need to learn? But let\\\u0027s go back again: There\\\u0027s nothing interesting going on. There\\\u0027s nothing out there that drives students to keep learning, and when that question comes up, to find an answer. Too many think that learning is boring and that all this hard work to become a scientist or something is worthless, since it doesn\\\u0027t look to them like it makes anything come to fruition, since they haven\\\u0027t seen anything happen. And despite this obvious lack of a motivator out there, education has stayed the same. It\\\u0027s not because we need the latest technology in the classroom (though it helps) and don\\\u0027t have it. It\\\u0027s not because all students are dumber now for some reason. It\\\u0027s because when the world stopped providing talking points for teachers, they refused to make their own. Educators, at least at the lower levels, must try to say something now and then that makes a student think. Something that gives that whole lesson on, say, Trigonometric identities, a meaning beyond just \u0027If I don\\\u0027t understand it, I\\\u0027ll fail the test.\u0027 Look at what Tyson does, or what Sagan did or what Cox does. They are perfect examples of what teachers should strive to be like. 3 E\\\u0027s and an I: Energetic, Emotional, Engaged, and Inspirational. There is one very good example of this in Cosmos, it\\\u0027s even in a classroom setting.
