Because it doesn\u0027t allow you to build cheap rockets early on, making SRBs not useful. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion the only advantage of SRBs is the cost/thrust ratio giving you cheap, but uncontrolled access to space. Espacially when you are planning big and expansive missions. But exactly at that point, where you want to save as much as possible, because your mission is so close to you going bankrupt. you can\u0027t use the SRBs, because they are to heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think. I would prefer, if the launchpad would just restrict you in size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJhonny\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-24T12:58:18Z\u0022 title=\u002201/24/2015 12:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jhonny007\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-24T13:05:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EConflicting requirements are the essence of good game design.
