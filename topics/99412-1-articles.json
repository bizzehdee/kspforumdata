I thought that was pretty cool and it made me wonder: what is the highest velocity you\u0027ve had upon re-entering Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis might make for an interesting challenge for the challenge forum, kind of like the opposite of the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/109479-Stock-Kerbin-Escape-speed-record%21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EStock Kebin Escape speed record\u003C/a\u003E challenge. It\u0027s one thing to leave Kerbin\u0027s SOI at a high speed, but returning really fast would probably require the use of gravity assists. It would get even more interesting with the addition of re-entry heat changes in 1.0 as it might become possible that a high enough speed would not be able to aerobrake into orbit without disintegrating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are your top re-entry speeds?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-11T21:37:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWoah 20km/s!

Kerbin\u0027s orbital velocity is around 9.2km/s so 18.5km/s hiting the SOI and probably picking up a bit more on the way down the gravity well. I play with FAR and DRE so my returns are significantly more sedate than that. Hiting atmo at that speed is just as final as hiting the ground at that speed. Going deep enough to capture will vaporize the ship if it does not have an aerodynamic breakup first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think 4-5km/s is the fastest I\u0027ve done with the mods.
