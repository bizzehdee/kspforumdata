It is really hard to \u0022see\u0022 and edit maneuver\u00A0nodes, and you don\u0027t get many of the goodies that you can get from the stock map view (and some other mods like Trajectories!).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027ve been stratching my head to find a solution...

Another hacky solution that I thought about was to use a multiplayer mod like Luna or Dark multiplayer to have the two clients controlling the same vessel, this way it\u0027d be possible to have access to the map view and nodes editing, however it seems it can only be done in spectator mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anybody who already tried this found a solution?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-27T08:58:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany moons ago, like in the 0.20\u0027s, there was a few guys who did this between their dorm rooms.\u00A0 They had one guy, the astronaut, in one room, and the other guys in another.\u00A0 I believe they cloned the screen of the players PC into the \u0022mission control\u0022 room, and gave instructions from there.\u00A0 I don\u0027t know details, but they were able to pull it off where the MC guys had access to MC type data, and the pilot was restricted to IVA.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 So, yes it is doable, but I have no idea how.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RealKerbal3x","CreatedById":183830,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-28T11:52:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou know what, I think mission control would be the best way to do multiplayer.
