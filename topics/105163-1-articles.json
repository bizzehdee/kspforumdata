So I\u0027ll thank you all for that, teaching me how to land on the mun, jeeze that was nerve wracking. By far this is the best community I\u0027ve ever seen and and as such I\u0027m super happy to be here finally. Its been a long time since I\u0027ve posted in any forum but this one, well I don\u0027t even need to say why, its obvious. \n\nSo onwards to HYPE and 1.0!!\n\nL.G"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T15:21:08Z","Content":"Welcome aboard!
