With that, I wouldn\u0027t need to worry much about my KSP running overnight for several weeks, I could go to school and do my life, and check Telemachus for any progress, just like playing any other facebook game.

I am a software engineering major, I know quite a few computer engineers, I know basic physics and common sense, there is no way for a computer to be damaged by being left on if it is properly cooled (as any computer you didn\u0027t build yourself would be). In fact, the most common source of software-damage to a computer is using it actively for purposes of installing software from the internet. (AKA malware/viruses)\u003Cp\u003EAs for power, laptops running at full blast consume about 50 watts on average. (may be more for 15.6\u0022 and larger laptops costing at least $1100 and containing dedicated graphics, but any laptop will consume under 90-120 watts, because these are the common size adapters used to power them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, my rather beefy laptop (i7-4700MQ, 3 GB GDDR5 770M graphics, 16 GB of RAM) used only 35 watts during KSP idling with a large spinning SSTO space-plane at 4x physical time warp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, assuming my laptop is at least as much of a pig as yours, which is a near-certainty, you use 35 watts for running KSP at really high settings and some browsers and various diagnostic tools in and Win8.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you probably use less than a Kilowatt hour per day. 10 cents a day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could run KSP for a week and a half before you consumed $1 worth of electricity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETell them that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously, for that matter, show them this post.
