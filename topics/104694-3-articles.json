This will do a better job of improving NASA\u0027s budget through public support but the downside here, to me, is that NASA is slow moving due to budget concerns and bureaucracy (through no fault of their own), and human space travel is even slower (for good reason). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EARM has a good chance of jumpstarting commercial space travel in a big way. Getting an asteroid back here to be fully analyzed will show entrepreneurs and investors how well they can do in deep space. A good sized asteroid could have more precious metals in it that can be mined in a dozen strip mines on earth. In the long run, I think this is more important and do more for humanity by normalizing both robotic and human space travel faster than a moon mission would. And I would fully support the idea of just getting a boulder from the surface of a larger asteroid, because it greatly simplifies the mission, meaning it could leave sooner, meaning I could get a condo on Mars sooner.
