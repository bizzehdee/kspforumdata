The general public, or commercial interests? \n\nThe moon is, imo, a better way to reinvigorate public interest in human space exploration. This will do a better job of improving NASA\u0027s budget through public support but the downside here, to me, is that NASA is slow moving due to budget concerns and bureaucracy (through no fault of their own), and human space travel is even slower (for good reason). \n\nARM has a good chance of jumpstarting commercial space travel in a big way. Getting an asteroid back here to be fully analyzed will show entrepreneurs and investors how well they can do in deep space. A good sized asteroid could have more precious metals in it that can be mined in a dozen strip mines on earth. In the long run, I think this is more important and do more for humanity by normalizing both robotic and human space travel faster than a moon mission would. And I would fully support the idea of just getting a boulder from the surface of a larger asteroid, because it greatly simplifies the mission, meaning it could leave sooner, meaning I could get a condo on Mars sooner. The major downside of ARM is a severe lack of moonbases."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T03:09:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That would be the point of...doing science...on the moon...by landing on the moon....and doing science...\n\nThe implicit meaning of the poll is MANNED, so science is not an issue, nothing on the moon (or even the asteroid notion) requires a human being to do science. Probes are better, period. Any mass you can land on the moon and return samples with could return at least the same mass of samples as a manned mission. Probes have only delivered less because they had budgets (in treasure and mass) that disallowed more.\n\nARM? Why manned? It means more mass for the same job, and far more risk.\n\nMars orbit would be more sensible, because they could land rovers, and remote control them with no real time delay.

And the explorers of those days didn\u0027t even know where they were going. Colonisation was about building trade routes and bringing riches back to the home country.

It is warmer, wetter, you can breath the air and you can go outside without a having to wear a pressure suit. Yet even though Antarctica was discovered in 1820 (and we\u0027ve had the means to get there since well before then), the only people living there reside in scientific research stations. There aren\u0027t any colonies. \n\nTo be fair, the continent\u0027s resources have been protected from being developed by the international Antarctic Treaty, but only since 1959. And this fact actually helps me make my point. Without resource extraction, there isn\u0027t any compelling reason to colonize Antarctica. The same will be true for anywhere else in the solar system. It will be a long time, if ever, before resource extraction from Mars makes financial sense.

We should not work towards getting NASA a bigger fund through taxes, instead, we should get people to voluntarily fund space exploration, just as they do with hundreds of other things. \n\nOf course that working within current demand for goods is important, the growth must not depend now on national space programs, it must be founded on solid economic ground; but getting the average joe to voluntarily give 100$ for space exploration is also extremely important.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-24T00:36:04Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2015 12:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mardlamock**"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T01:20:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/wNxnCzz5oQE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nGood compilation.. but it seems that the things that Tyson said has not logic for some people.. \n\nAnd in fact.. space exploration is very profitable.. \n\nIntellectual commodity is the biggest assets that a country can have.. there are some places like sweden or nordics which has very few resources but with huge capital due this.\n\nHow to improve this asset? You can improve all the education system, but in some countries this is very hard to accomplish.\n\nAnother choice? Yes.. do things to inspire the world, this way many people get encourage to study, also intelligent people over all the world will feel tempted to work in that country.\n\nSo yes.. that is the best thing a country may do to win more money. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s a straw man argument... Either that or you greatly under appreciate the technological achievement of the Apollo program. There\u0027s a vast difference between building the pyramids using 2500 BC technology vs. today\u0027s technology and flying to the moon using 1960\u0027s technology vs today\u0027s technology.\n\nTechnology increase exponential, there is not much difference between the technology from -1000 and 1000, But there is a huge difference between the technology from 1970 and now.\n\n![microsd-2005-2014.jpg](http://www.globalnerdy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/microsd-2005-2014.jpg)\n\nJust compare the apollo memory was only few kbytes and weight/cost a lot, vs some penies that a 128gb super light and small sd cost now.\n\n-Right now countries manage much more money than back then \n\n![11.png](http://goldseek.com/news/2009/1-12mh/11.png)\n\n-The launch cost was much higher back then, and now may be reduce it by a lot in the next 10 years.\n\n-We have a great advance in materials, thousands to choose for different applications.\n\n-The ISS gave us a lot of experience in space living.\n\n-the technology growth a lot in all its branches, we can do almost magic compared to back then.\n\n-back then we dint have any software to help us with simulations/calculations or design.\n\nRight now we can model aerodynamics, see heat flows and all kind of hard physsics calculation. In those times we had only the pencil and some paper.\n\nIs like compare a disable man vs one completely heath, but it refuce to run or do anything.\n\nThe only thing that block us to solve problems right now is the end of dreams, where the people believe what politician told us altogether with the burocracy that agencies leaders promote. We forgot that we can do anything we want, we just need to stop to believe those lies.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The Apollo program was only funded because of the cold war. It was a matter of prestige to succeed and thereby demonstrate the superiority of the capitalist system. Nobody has gone back since because there\u0027s no justification for spending the billions of dollars that it would cost. We can do as much as we currently need to do for less money by sending robotic probes.\n\nWe dont have wars now.. so why some countries still spent so much in that?\nNo country in the world can invade other at least there is a huge excuse (which it will cost a lot extra money) and the rest of the world needs to allow it.\n\nThe ages of wars end.. now the wars are fight with economics. And all those weapons they made needs maintainence.\n\nIn the cold war time countries use army as way of pressure or to gain status.. Right now weapons is waste money.\n\nYou can not use nukes because everybody lose, neither the other weapons due public opinion. All countries makes business with other countries.\n\nYou think countries as Canada or sweden are in danger? Not, in any case the few countries who has guns are in danger.\n\nSo how do you gain status right now? the only way is with great accomplish. Also the space will be the next economic ground to win battles.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E And while there may well come a day when we step off this planet and become a true space faring civilization, it isn\u0027t going to happen in our lifetimes. Rome wasn\u0027t built in a day. All the wishful thinking in the world isn\u0027t going to change that.\n\nNever will happen if we keep that way of thinking.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Actually comparing the world of the 1960\u0027s with the world of today is pretty bad too. It was a different time, with a lot less bureaucracy, a lot less people in charge of design, and unlimited resources in order to beat the Soviets. Humanity was on the brink of self-destructing. Today is a very different world, where large projects typically take a lot longer, with more documentation, more committees, smaller budgets and higher cost, because everything is infinitely more complex.\n\nSome things that you said are true.. but I already answer this to PakledHostage. If all those procedures brake us so much, then there is something wrong with them.\n\nWe need to encourage efficiency.. not other way around.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E No, if anything, exploration might be a tool used to prepare colonization, not the other way round, but you can also have one without the other. They are two different things. NASA has a goal of exploration and scientific research. It does not have a mandate for colonization. There is no political push or towards colonization. There is no social demand for colonization.\n\nAgree with nasa, nobody is saying that nasa needs to colonize.. But they are the explorers.. they open the world to others which will come after. Colombus was not a colonizer, he was an explorer. But he open the oportunity to colonization.\n\nTravels at that time took as much as planetary travels now, with storms.\n\nThe whole history of human race is colonization, is in our ADN. After exploration, its the desicion of entrepreneurs to know if some business can be exploited or not. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Why would any organization want to spend massive amounts of money to establish colonies that would ultimately demand independence as soon as they become self-sustaining?\n\nWe discuss this in many other topics, I show tons of arguments, you did your part, not agreement there. So lets not waste time.\n\nAbout independence.. that is not a problem.. But I will need a lot of time to explain that in details, which also sound like a waste of time.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Forget colonization, it is not going to happen. Please do not use that word if you are trying to have a constructive discussion anchored in reality.\n\nAlready happen many times, all in reality.\n\n\u003E For profit. This is the same reason space will become more occupied. Profit.\n\nSuch simple true, and so hard to spread it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-24T01:44:05Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2015 01:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AngelLestat**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T01:30:24Z","Content":"Is this all you have?

The only thing humans can do better in space is to possibly at some point make more humans.
