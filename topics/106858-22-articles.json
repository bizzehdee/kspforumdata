Actualy, the only bug left is black seams on some planets, that, however, have been already fixed as Olimpyc1 is doing the science/dds conversion part. For now I\u0027ve only fixed Fonso, but now that I know where was the issue, I can easily fix the other planets and send everything to the tester. Also, I may be releasing some teasers of the new crystals on Faz tomorrow... Cheers!\n\nWith the bugfixes, we\u0027ll also add a whole lot of futures, like completely overhauled Keelon system. All of its otherwise identical moons are now more interesting:\n\nManai: ringed lava ocean moon\n\nWomp: orange-yellow moon covered in craters and interesting rare mountains\n\nClero: Brown-yellow moon that has a long deep canyon stretching along its equator\n\nArnal: Moon similar to Vall but with accentuated ridges and Huge North Pole Crater\n\nFaz: in the next version will have huge light-blue collidable crystals like Nova Silisko\u0027s one had.\n\nPergas: remade so it looks a lot more interesting\n\nSarvin: now has procedural animated gas clouds and storms\n\nKerbin: now has randomly generated small farms on its surface. Transparent clouds are visiboe from orbit (optionaly) Different types of trees also generate. \n\nMun: now has many tiny rocks covering its surface\n\nMinmus: green tiny crystals generate on surface\n\nKorolet: now has a proper more realistic comet tail with ion and dust trail visible from Kerbin.\n\nDuna: now has interesting different randomly generated rocks covering its surface.\n\nShayle: now has very rare randomly generated rock gates covering its surface (like on stock Mun).\n\nManai: has common huge randomly generated volcanoes on its surface (if I manage to give them animations that\u0027d be great!)\n\n(Maybe not in next version) Parts: new bettwe RTG. New awesome capsule. New orbiter engine. New gimballable SRBs. Procedural wings acting like struts (don\u0027t know how this will turn out but I know that you should be able to place wings between 2 parts, like you do with struts. New 0.65 fairing.\n\nSarvin: remade rings\n\nKerbin: revamped Cactus and tree models\n\nPls sned us more ideas."},{"CreatedByName":"VASMIR","CreatedById":143455,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-08T23:20:02Z","Content":"Love this pack, but can you add a Titan analogue to Sarvin, except that it is twice the radius of Kerbin.

Delete the floating selection, export, open in MSPaint, choose a color with RGB numbers easy to remember, and paint the missing white zone left by the previous zone. I generaky base biome maps on heights like this:\n\nCraters\n\nHeightlands (painted with a different color over the lighter zones on the height map)\n\nMidlands (hills that make the connection to lowlands and heightlands and are usualy colored in grey on the height map)\n\nLowlands (darkest places on the height map i.e lowest places)\n\nRidges (painted over mountains)\n\nDunes (painted over gentile sand plains)"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T19:54:16Z","Content":"Any image editor that does layers should do well for making biome maps, that way you can have stuff like terrain or texture semi-transparent to use as reference."},{"CreatedByName":"The White Guardian","CreatedById":148627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T20:57:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What do you recommend to make the biome maps?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Any image editor that does layers should do well for making biome maps, that way you can have stuff like terrain or texture semi-transparent to use as reference.\n\nTrue.
