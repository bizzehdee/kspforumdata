I can\u0027t get my kerbals inside unless I move it. If I could just select an individual part it would be a piece of cake, but the problem is that there are part groups and it would ruin my whole craft if I click on the ones I need to move. How can I select one part by itself when it has a bunch of other ones grouped together to it? And also wondering how you make parts group like that or not in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am very grateful towards anyone who helps me out!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-11T03:06:48Z\u0022 title=\u002202/11/2015 03:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Little Katie\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-10T22:45:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA picture of the craft in question would be most helpful here, but it sounds like you just want to move a ladder, which shouldn\u0027t be too difficult. You should be able to clip the camera inside your rocket and expose the part of the ladder hidden by whatever you attached it to, then just move your mouse over it and mke sure that it\u0027s highlighted, also you can use CTRL\u002BZ to undo anything that you have done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Little Katie","CreatedById":129746,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-10T23:10:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay I made an album to show.
