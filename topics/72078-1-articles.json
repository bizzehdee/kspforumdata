I not yet sure what exactly you try to accomplish. Its probably not worth the effort to re-write a lot of unity\u0027s engine just for multi threading. To parallelize stuff, organize the code into 3 parts... a first that collects all data from Unity\u0026amp;KSP, a second that does the calculation but doesn\u0027t touch KSP at all and a last that consumes the resulting data. Sure, a helper class for stuff like synchronization might be useful, but most of the work would have be done manually anyway by one of the three code parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince we are talking about FAR... what does consumes the most processing time of it in the first place?

This allows you to call a static function and pass an object instance to it. KER creates a Simulation object in the main thread that copies all of the data it requires from the core data structures into its own private structures and then passes this object to the function run in the background.

This updating of the data the background thread is reading must be made atomic and synchronised.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the case of FAR\u0027s aerodynamics calculations, the mechanism you describe will be calculating the drag for different parts of the vessel at slightly different points in time and hence with slightly different input parameters. I suspect this will introduce some odd errors into the calculations that will result in undesirable forces on the vessel (e.g. one wing producing more lift/drag than the other). Also, what will happen when a part\u0027s mesh changes (e.g. a solar panel)? You would somehow have to detect and pass the change to the thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is certainly an interesting idea but I think you will definitely have issues if the calculations take longer than a frame. If the thread simply sat in a loop and processed items from a queue and stuck them in an output dictionary then you could make each part submit its data in Update and continue. The background thread would wake up when it sees some data in the queue and start processing. This processing would go on in parallel with the core calling the Update of each part. Then in LateUpdate (I presume, I\u0027m not that hot on the KSP/Unity specifics) you would wait for the data for the part to be ready before reading it and continuing. It would also require a cache of your meshData structures that are passed into the queue every time so that they can be updated easily when the part meshes change. It would be possible to share the input queue and output dictionary between multiple background threads if they were appropriately synchronised.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt won\u0027t really help in this case but my now work-in-progress job manager allows a plugin to create a job object which includes the input and output parameters and pass this object to the job manager for running in the background. There are mechanisms to determine if a job has completed and for the job to provide progress information which the plugin can safely read (for very long jobs). It is intended that multiple plugins can share the job manager so it will require a hard dependency on the job manager plugin to use it so there will only be one copy of the code running. As soon as I\u0027m fairly sure the interface is reasonably stable I\u0027ll put it up on GitHub...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
