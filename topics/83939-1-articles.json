Both shuttle disasters were largely caused by NASA ignoring problems their engineers warned them about. They knew about the o-rings wearing down, but assumed it\u0027d be okay because they\u0027d never worn fully through.... and they knew of the dangers of foam and ice damaging the tiles, but also ignored it because damage had never caused the loss of an orbiter on previous missions.

There is no rush, and as long as you haven\u0027t launched the rocket, you can truck an engineer out to fix it. This is why there are so many delays during launch; the Mission controllers take every pre-launch computer alarm very seriously, and will often halt or abort the countdown if the computer is acting up. Best case scenario, the computer was right and you just saved a 200 million dollar rocket.
