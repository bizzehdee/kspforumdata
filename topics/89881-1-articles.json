The space program has launched a probe (bundled with two sets both made of a Mystery Goo and Science Jr.) to a hyperbolic M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn encounter with their limited technology! Sound good, right? Well, no. The probe ran out of fuel while trying to get a closer encounter, so it can\u0027t be recovered. While the first set of science was transmitted, the second is still stored on the probe. The space program was thinking about docking with it, and it got very far in development to the point where they had to use the imaginary launch escape system on the manned rocket chosen for the mission when they said no to the docking. There were two major reasons for this: 1. The probe had no docking port. 2. They weren\u0027t advanced enough to have docking ports. And, yeah.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the space center purposed they\u0027d get to the probe in some other way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Challenge: (Surprisingly not save the probe, but) Get all the science from the probe by taking it on EVA and return it to Kerbin. EVA means a manned mission, so get your kerbal(s) home safely too. Missions are graded on a scale of 1 - 10, 10 being best. Provide an imagur album with at the stats of your rocket after each critical moment in the mission. Part clipping is okay, but glitch exploits are \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E ok in flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and last but not least, to add to the pressure, you are very low on the tech tree to the point where you don\u0027t have klaws or even solar panels!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers, rainup9.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload Link: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6kMiFN2UFJobU1HTzFWTEo4cTg/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6kMiFN2UFJobU1HTzFWTEo4cTg/view?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: One of the factors in your score is how many parts you unlock before hand.

So yea, I guess this means the end for my challenge. This doesn\u0027t mean I want the mods to close the thread, but I don\u0027t think many people are going to care about this challenge with the new beta drifting about, and this challenge being in 0.25.
