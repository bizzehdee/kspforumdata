I\u0027d even created and tested a special vehicle- the Mantis Shrimp Climbing Rover- to get me down to the bottom, and out again.\n\n[![sxOPzfLl.png](http://i.imgur.com/sxOPzfLl.png)](http://imgur.com/sxOPzfL)\n\nHere it is in a munhole. Traveled up and down many times.\n\nHowever, nothing came of these plans. Until now.\n\n[![vfE7Fqjl.png](http://i.imgur.com/vfE7Fqjl.png)](http://imgur.com/vfE7Fqj)\n\nThe Mantis Shrimp- from 0.21 to you!\n\nI\u0027m going to Moho.\n\nI pulled a copy of the Mantis from old 0.21, and began testing on a convenient vertical surface, in simulated mohovian conditions. Issues new and old raised their head, and I applied new, 0.90 techniques to fixing them.\n\nBefore long, the rover was behaving itself, well, reasonably. \n\n[![EhCRGxal.png](http://i.imgur.com/EhCRGxal.png)](http://imgur.com/EhCRGxa)\n\nSwitching back to Kerbin gravity makes it not work.\n\nOnce I was happy the rover would drive and climb well on Moho, it was time to develop a lander. I followed standard lander guidelines, high rotation power, wide at the base, low CoM, that sort of thing:\n\n[![xlncm4ul.png](http://i.imgur.com/xlncm4ul.png)](http://imgur.com/xlncm4u)\n\nThe 3.75 m parts made it simpler to build a lander big enough to carry it. Kerbin testing showed the rover could re-dock to the lander if necessary. And also that the ladders worked. \n\n[![uhi6X7ul.png](http://i.imgur.com/uhi6X7ul.png)](http://imgur.com/uhi6X7u)\n\n[![0RdPvccl.png](http://i.imgur.com/0RdPvccl.png)](http://imgur.com/0RdPvcc)\n\nThe pod is mounted on a docking port so it can be removed from the rest of the vessel should rescue be necessary.\n\nAll systems go.

For the Mun mission pictured above, I solved this by having two rocket stacks, with the Lander fitted between then. But I use FAR now (FAR is cool) and want to shield this Lander with a faring. \n\nThe simplest solution was to mount the Lander upside down. \n\n[![PJK9ODVl.png](http://i.imgur.com/PJK9ODVl.png)](http://imgur.com/PJK9ODV)\n\nI built a nice big rocket to take the 100 ton Lander into orbit. \n\n[![Ga422Col.png](http://i.imgur.com/Ga422Col.png)](http://imgur.com/Ga422Co)\n\nDecoupling the first set of boosters was always dramatic.\n\n[![I2oZmRml.png](http://i.imgur.com/I2oZmRml.png)](http://imgur.com/I2oZmRm)\n\n[![Z5nPU4dl.png](http://i.imgur.com/Z5nPU4dl.png)](http://imgur.com/Z5nPU4d)\n\nI\u0027m pretty sure that was the decouplers exploding earlier. Otherwise, the rocket was unharmed. It happened every single larch attempt.\n\nHowever, as it\u0027d been a while since I last made a lifter, I\u0027d forgot FAR reduces the launch delta V, and built the rocket to stock standards. I got into orbit with two core lifter stages still there.\n\n[![xJ9HYfYl.png](http://i.imgur.com/xJ9HYfYl.png)](http://imgur.com/xJ9HYfY)\n\nThere was a central S3 KS-25x4, but that was crushed by the outer boosters as they decoupled and flipped. Opps...\n\nThis seemed a bit wasteful- the upper stage uses a KR-2L, rather than something efficient, and suited to interplanetary travel. My original plan had been to dock the lander to a fuel tanker, but with some revisions, I could send up everything in one hit.\n\nI reverted the flight. \n\nI traded the KR-2L for the big nuclear engine from KSPX. \n\n[![CMzbqKBl.png](http://i.imgur.com/CMzbqKBl.png)](http://imgur.com/CMzbqKB)\n\n[![5FjfUAZl.png](http://i.imgur.com/5FjfUAZl.png)](http://imgur.com/5FjfUAZ)\n\nHere, we have Genely kerman inspecting the discarded stage\n\n[![zDS7LRil.png](http://i.imgur.com/zDS7LRil.png)](http://imgur.com/zDS7LRi)\n\n[![2pCKcUCl.png](http://i.imgur.com/2pCKcUCl.png)](http://imgur.com/2pCKcUC)\n\nThe idea was to use perikerb kicks to break up the burn. But this would not go so smoothly.\n\n[![rfVZmerl.png](http://i.imgur.com/rfVZmerl.png)](http://imgur.com/rfVZmer)\n\nWhen the ship reached the burn point, the engines would not fire. The throttle would not budge. \n\n[![iVxhlTal.png](http://i.imgur.com/iVxhlTal.png)](http://imgur.com/iVxhlTa)\n\nI tried switching back to space centre, rebooting the game, nothing changed it. \n\nI speculated something had gone wrong with the Lv-bb. Tweakscale had changed its size, and that part had had the odd glitch in the past. Nothing like this though.\n\nIn an attempt to find a solution, I blasted of the Lv-nb with wack-a-kerbal had my engineer safely remove it.\n\n[![dQJvskxl.png](http://i.imgur.com/dQJvskxl.png)](http://imgur.com/dQJvskx)\n\nI then used KAS pipes, (originally intended to connect to a fuel tanker) to link the top tank to the lander\u0027s central tank, and activated the lander\u0027s engines. \n\n[![bWmv2Xql.png](http://i.imgur.com/bWmv2Xql.png)](http://imgur.com/bWmv2Xq)\n\nBut it was to no avail. The throttle was still stuck, the engines wouldn\u0027t fire. She was dead in space.\n\nWith reverting no longer an option, the only one thing I could do was schedule a rescue for these guys, and call the back up crew. \n\n[![z4T6z2Vl.png](http://i.imgur.com/z4T6z2Vl.png)](http://imgur.com/z4T6z2V)\n\nLaunching this third one gave meed the opportunity to make a few more final changes. I traded the Lv-nb for more fuel, and connected the upper tank to the lander with stock fuel lines. I also added parachutes to the pod, just in case.\n\n[![POUVRtPl.png](http://i.imgur.com/POUVRtPl.png)](http://imgur.com/POUVRtP)\n\n[![0huYdWkl.png](http://i.imgur.com/0huYdWkl.png)](http://imgur.com/0huYdWk)\n\nThis launch went more or less flawlessly, and the B-crew made it safely to a 200 km parking orbit,\n\n[![0Tti3fnl.png](http://i.imgur.com/0Tti3fnl.png)](http://imgur.com/0Tti3fn)\n\n[![uyJu4Gvl.png](http://i.imgur.com/uyJu4Gvl.png)](http://imgur.com/uyJu4Gv)\n\nThe B-crew: Aldner the scientist, Esden the engineer, and Samwise the hobit our pilot. \n\nI checked the throttle many, many times. All systems go. They dropped the last lifter stage, and began perikerb kicks.\n\nHere\u0027s Esden inspecting the discarded stage. \n\n[![nOCewY1l.png](http://i.imgur.com/nOCewY1l.png)](http://imgur.com/nOCewY1)\n\n[![oLZkoUkl.png](http://i.imgur.com/oLZkoUkl.png)](http://imgur.com/oLZkoUk)\n\nSo thrilled that his team was called on.\n\nNext, I\u0027ve got to get them to Moho.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Haha, awesome. Is that one grapple going to be long enough though? I thought the Mohole was pretty deep.\n\nOne grapple would be nowhere near long enough. But the grapples are only there for when the rover needs to be held in place. For the rest of the trip, the rover will be pressed to the side using force from two engines.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-10T06:19:51Z\u0022 title=\u002203/10/2015 06:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tw1**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T04:04:53Z","Content":"Interplanetary stuff\n\nMoho, as many who\u0027ve done it will tell you, is a tricky little \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* to get to.\n\nIt takes 2 metric \\*beep\\*tons of delta V to get there and back, it\u0027s got significant kerbin relative inclination to throw you of, it has a small SOI and moves fast, making getting an encounter tricky.

But this didn\u0027t stop my planned maneuvers from getting all mixed up when 4 times timewarp cased the fuel tank to break off, and I quickloaded to a point earlier in the burn.\n\n[![F59Rzt6l.png](http://i.imgur.com/F59Rzt6l.png)](http://imgur.com/F59Rzt6)\n\n[![GzcBEqJl.png](http://i.imgur.com/GzcBEqJl.png)](http://imgur.com/GzcBEqJ)\n\nFortunately, I still managed to get a reasonable encounter after cocceterng at the descending node. \n\n[![NgMiUDml.png](http://i.imgur.com/NgMiUDml.png)](http://imgur.com/NgMiUDm)\n\nUpon arriving in Moho\u0027s SOI, I made a correction burn to make sure my trajectory would pass over the pole.
