probably.\u00A0 But the drive got corrupted so I figure I\u0027d rebuild from scratch but this time leave room for Windows in case that ends up being the only way to play with mod development for KSP2 (it isn\u0027t in stone that linux will be supported by KSP2, but I\u0027m guessing it will be eventually if not right away).\u00A0 I know I could use Proton to still play it under linux/wine probably, but for mod dev I imagine it will just be easier to use Windows.\u00A0 So am going to put a bigger drive in and make it dual boot.\u00A0 Ideally I\u0027d have the game installed in both OSes for testing regardless of which one I dev in (but only running one at a time so no harm, no foul)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for help, not at the moment,

hear ya.\u00A0 Windoze drives me nutz.\u00A0\u00A0 I\u0027m really hoping that the only reason it isn\u0027t listed for the initial release is because the new dev process at Take-Two is Windows-centric so that is their initial target, but that given the roots of KSP and that Unity makes it fairly easy to put a game on console, linux, and even Mac, that it will be done shortly after initial release, if not at the initial release.\u00A0 Didn\u0027t they bring on a bunch of KSP devs that know linux inside and out?\u00A0\u00A0 They\u0027d be idiots not to leverage that\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
