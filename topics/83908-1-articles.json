Either we need to define the average density of any given Minecraft world, which would require knowledge of the mass of a given Minecraft world, or we could define the volume of \u0022air\u0022 blocks and say the ground blocks are all made of say granite. Right now with the information you\u0027ve provided it is difficult to answer the question exactly (or as exactly as one could).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did two calculations to determine surface gravity. First I simplified the task by finding the sphere of equivalent volume (assuming the given volume is in cubic meters). This provides us with:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eradius = ((2.62144e\u002B17 m^3 * (0.75))/PI)^(1/3) = 3.97e\u002B5 meters (This makes the spherical Minecraft world about 16 time smaller than Earth)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then calculated surface gravity for the case where the volume has a uniform density of 2.7 g/cm^3 (within the range of the density of granite), and 5.513 g/cm^3 (the average density of Earth).

Translating that into vector form, the gravitational field is \u003Cstrong\u003Eg\u00AE\u003C/strong\u003E= -G*M/|R^3| * \u003Cstrong\u003ER\u003C/strong\u003E.

On the other hand, in the real world \u00C3\u00C2 is of the order of thousands of kg per m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E, while \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B3 is 6.67*10\u003Csup\u003E-11\u003C/sup\u003Em\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E kg\u003Csup\u003E-1\u003C/sup\u003E s\u003Csup\u003E-2\u003C/sup\u003E.

That means, that the mass of dirt and rock above the bedrock is negligible, compared to the bedrock itself and whatever may hypothetically lie beneath it. This returns us to somewhat more realistic densities/gravitational constants. For instance, if we take a density of 4 tons per cubic meter and the real world gravitational constant, we would find the real thickness of the minecraft world (including a hypothetical magma layer beneath the bedrock) to be about 14 thousand km.
