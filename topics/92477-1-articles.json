I\u0027ve been playing just over a year now, and I can dock ships no problem. I have just begun what is, for me, and extremely large venture though, and will require extremely precise docking manoeuvres. I am building a ring station (stock parts only), and it will take 8 launches to complete the ring. The ring is made up of the new MK-II crew cabin parts, stuck together with octagonal cubic struts set at 5 degree angles. So each of the 8 launches is a \u0022ship\u0022 of 9 of the crew cabins. I have so far sent up and docked the first two segments, basically just eyeballing everything as best as I could\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is, as I approach the station and have my new segment lined up to dock, how do I know that my orientation is exactly perfect? As in, how can I prevent my ring from becoming skewed? Is there some fancy docking view I don\u0027t know about that allows you to see you current ship\u0027s orientation compared to the station you are docking to? Perhaps a mod (although I sort of want to stay away from mods for now)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some pics.

I\u0027ve done it before, but it can be really aggravating for large structures. Sometimes those lock \u0026amp; key setups need a lot of precision to get lined up which can be a pain when maneuvering large components. When I use the lock \u0026amp; key, I attach them with the structural pylons. When you detach the structural pylons, they don\u0027t leave anything behind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you didn\u0027t know, you can get the components docked together and quicksave. Then undock them, keeping the docking ports very close together, and make fine tune adjustments. Then do another quicksave (probably with ALT\u002BF5) and quickload. Doing that will reset the ports and they will snap back together without having to get too far apart. I\u0027ve managed to get 0.0 rotation in the save files using this technique.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, that looks like it will be awesome when complete.

I am exactly halfway through building the ring, and this docking technique is working beautifully. Thanks to all who responded to this post, I shall now dish out some rep for you. Below are a few relevant pics, and I reserve the right to necro this in a few days or a couple weeks when the station is complete, just in case any of you want to see the results of the precise docking technique being employed.
