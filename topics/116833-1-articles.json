I have been working on some of this since you posted this. I have made some individual panels, and heat shielded wings, but do you want a full sized part to cover other parts? I do understand how annoying the reentry heating is in 1.0.4, an I have also wanted this for a little while now, too."},{"CreatedByName":"Hoddd9000","CreatedById":142572,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T11:12:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Are you able to make any drawings/concept stuff?

I might not have this complete for a little while, as I have other things to do, but I might release it in a \u0022beta\u0022 without as many parts, and then work more into the updates. Thanks for posting the suggestion, as I probably wouldn\u0027t have picked up on the idea had I not seen it. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) Here it is: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130057-1-0-4-Radial-Heat-Shields](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130057-1-0-4-Radial-Heat-Shields) I don\u0027t know what\u0027s up with me trying to post this.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-28T22:57:05Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2015 10:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Guest**"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T21:21:34Z","Content":"Hello everybody!
