With that plugin you can bind action groups to specific angles, and keys for increasing/decreasing the angle. Once you drop the EFT the main engines have no fuel source (they run on H2/O2), so you use the pair of OMS engines (they run on LF/O). These engines need to be tilted to point through the centre of mass, so you still need to aim off-centre.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mod is still in its first phase, and will not have explicit support for MechJeb.

You do have to fight the SAS a bit, but launching should be relatively straight forward. The one thing to take care of is thrust vectoring angle.
