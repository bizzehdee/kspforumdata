I used the engine that is like the engine that looks like the whiplash. As I flew up to 10,000 or so meters, the jet plume was expanding. I believe it is using the aerospike plume, but it got me wondering: do jet exhaust plumes expand like rocket plumes?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would think yes, because the ambient pressure at that altitude would be fairly low, and the exhaust would expand.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"p1t1o","CreatedById":74091,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-01T15:24:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust look up at the contrail an airliner leaves, its often as wide or wider than the wingspan -\u00A0they expand a fair bit, yeah.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NSEP","CreatedById":165635,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-01T15:53:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, why would they not?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Steel","CreatedById":49317,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-01T20:21:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, absolutely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-02T01:37:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223162490\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022165052\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221504279493\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002274091\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022p1t1o\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, p1t1o said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust look up at the contrail an airliner leaves, its often as wide or wider than the wingspan -\u00A0they expand a fair bit, yeah.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s not necessarily meaningful.

But for a turbofan there are actually two exhaust jets, one for the core and an annular one for the fan. The core jet expansion is heavily influenced by the fact that it runs into the fan jet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-09-02T01:42:14Z\u0022 title=\u002209/02/2017 01:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 2, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by mikegarrison\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
