Slap it together and see what happens.\u0022 Great fun is always had at this point and that attitude is great for exploring the parts.

Some of the concepts are just too obscure or counter-intuitive to find out with trial and error. The basic concept of an orbit is hard to grasp the first time you ever really think about it. \u0022so if i want to go lower I have to slow down?

Catch the SOI on a burn, do a course correction to get a change in orbit, then use the gravity to pull my course in the direction I need. I\u0027ve found I need a good window to do stuff like that. Best way is how NASA did the Apollo missions to the moon, doing a \u0022Figure-8\u0022 without obviously going back and forth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, what side of the planet you catch makes a difference in speed. One way will slow you down, good for saving Delta-V if you\u0027re planning on surveying that object, and the other will speed you up which is what Scott Manley is probably doing. I\u0027m not sure which video you\u0027re referring to though, so I can\u0027t say for sure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"celem","CreatedById":91132,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T22:11:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, you need to pass behind the object as it orbits it\u0027s parent for it to accelerate you, so you would have hit it if it hadn\u0027t just moved out of the way as you approached, the boost is greater the lower you get at approach and the massier the body is. If you pass right in front of it as it orbits then it will brake you, combine with an aerobrake to dump hundreds or even thousands (eve again) of dv for free.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T09:23:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else notice that the OP hasn\u0027t been back?
