Longer burns are more inefficient when you are trying to gain altitude due to gravitational losses. However as your velocity increases drag increases as velocity squared so you begin to loosing delta v to drag losses. Terminal velocity is the optimum speed to travel whilst minimising both of these simultaneously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes you only need to throttle back if you get above the terminal velocity for that height. With a low thrust to weight ratio this doesnt always happen and 100% throttle launches are possible. You should actually try to engineer your TWR match your acent velocity profile so that 100% throttle roughly follows terminal velocity. This will minimise your ship weight (TWR too high - ship has too many engines and therefore weighs more than it needs to) and gravitational losses (TWR too low -\u0026gt; longer than optimal burn).

To minimize your total losses, where the losses are equal is where it\u0027s optimal to be flying (in vertical flight; in horizontal flight it\u0027s not so clear). That is, where gravity = drag is where you want to be -- and that\u0027s the definition of terminal velocity. It takes TWR of about 2 to maintain that in the atmosphere, because it takes TWR of 1 to defeat gravity, and we just said you\u0027re losing as much to drag, so there goes another TWR (but drag falls fast with altitude so you need a tiny bit more to stay at terminal velocity). If you have no drag, then infinite throttle is what you want.

We can get to orbit by flying at terminal velocity as long as we can, and in doing so we can reduce our losses to gravity so much that we may be able to get to orbit using 4,300 delta-v. Maybe even less. Problem here, as EtherDragon has mentioned, is that we are carrying massive amounts of thrust high into the gravity well in order to keep up with the ever-increasing speed of terminal velocity. More thrust generally comes at the expense of more dead-engine mass, lower specific impulse, or a combination of both. These require us to pack more fuel to re-achieve our delta-v goal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy using less thrust and smaller, more efficient engines we are capable of getting a given tonnage of payload to orbit using less fuel, even though we \u0022used\u0022 more delta-v. The trick is finding that middle zone that gives us enough TWR and delta-v while using the least tonnage in our lifter. Payload fraction is more important than delta-v usage. As payload mass is constant, the only way to increase payload fraction is to reduce lifter mass. The majority of lifter mass is fuel. Of course, that only matters when costs become important.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-14T23:37:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t know how MJ calculates it, I\u0027m just going by the information on the wiki.
