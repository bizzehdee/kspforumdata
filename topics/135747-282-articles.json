Genetic engineering can create fast-growing crops and trees, geoengineering can make previously inhospitable areas inhabitable, and various technologies can improve our resource extraction capabilities. In short, we can intensify the processes the we require to get resources enough so that a smaller area can feed a bigger population than it was before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, Mars doesn\u0027t have the resources we are used to collect from our surroundings. Contrary to popular belief, Mars has no arable land, nothing to plant crops on. There are no easily accessible water on the surface; one must look for water by drilling a well, which takes time and energy. And more importantly, it doesn\u0027t have a breathable atmosphere, nor does it have a planetary magnetic field to protect its inhabitants from space radiation. The atmosphere is also very thin, which means there are little protection from incoming projectiles; falling space rocks are a dime a dozen. Compared to Earth, Mars have little to no Carrying Capacity to speak of; we\u0027d have to build infrastructure to expand it ourselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd here\u0027s the kicker: anything we invent to give Mars some Carrying Capacity would be usable here. Using technology initially earmarked for colonizing Mars would make the hottest of deserts habitable. Efficient soil-less farming techniques would enable agriculture in even the harshest environments on Earth, opening more areas for settlement. Efficient water extraction, processing, and recycling technologies would help sustain cities that have limited water supplies, and so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short, whatever we do to make living on Mars possible, it would improve our own planet\u0027s Carrying Capacity further. And we don\u0027t have to haul our carcasses all the way to another planet to get these benefits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, if our goal of shipping people to Mars was to set up an outpost, say, for scientific research, then it starts to make sense. There are some knowledge that we can\u0027t acquire by any way other than spending some time living on Mars. This might be something like knowing environment characteristics, accurate data on resource location and richness, and some other things This knowledge may later help us colonize Mars, when we can\u0027t stretch Earth\u0027s Carrying Capacity any more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor this purpose, building a space-railroad to Mars is unnecessarily expensive if a simpler, cheaper vehicle can do the job. Only after significant surface presence is established can we justify spending more to develop additional infrastructure to act as space-railroads.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, yes, technology can increase Carrying Capacity up to a certain point. \u00A0That\u0027s actually one of the fundamental premises of the concept- that technology can increase it, but not raise it without limit...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thing is, I don\u0027t know about you, but I don\u0027t want to see this entire planet covered in biodomes and greenhouses (at least what\u0027s not covered in solar panels and wind turbines to power it all).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe technologies that allow us to colonize Mars would completely destroy the environment here on Earth if we applied them on a large enough scale. \u00A0On Mars, by contrast, there *is* no environment to destroy. \u00A0You can only make the planet more hospitable (by providing food and shelter in pressurized habitats), not less.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, some Mars tech is poorly suited for Earth. \u00A0Mars doesn\u0027t have weather you really need to worry about. \u00A0The harshest dust storms carry a few mm of dust and theforceof a light breeze (The Martian was stupid unrealistic). \u00A0There are no tornados, hurricanes, cyclones, tsunamis, flash floods,\u00A0earthquakes, volcanoes, or hailstorms that could wreck fragile closed habitats. \u00A0By contrast to Earth\u0027s disasters, the occasional meteorite is small potatoes to deal with...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, any new development on Earth has to replace some type of pre-existing development. \u00A0Cities replace farmland, tourist resorts replace lumber operatioms. \u00A0And we\u0027ve already mapped out most of the easily-found metals on Earth and mine the economical deposits. \u00A0By contrast, Mars is a whole planet of unused land and untapped mineral deposits...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, in order to preserve Earth\u0027s environment, and because Earth\u0027s biosphere is much more difficult to control to the same degree as Mar\u0027s (nonexistant) one, it makes much more sense to colonize Mars than it does to try and support twice as many
