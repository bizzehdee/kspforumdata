After many attempts I managed to get one on that largish island about 400km or so northeast of KSC. I\u0027d like to put one on the peninsula that resemble Korea that is on the eastern side of the large sea east of KSC. I\u0027ve put several landers with antennae up into low Kerbin orbits and have so far failed to get my landing site much closer than about 100km from the peninsula, which is actually reasonably wide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve scanned through the list of all tutorials here on the site, watched a couple Pebblegarden videos that I thought might address this, but cannot find anything that specifically addresses the basic principles for how to land in a rocket/capsule on a specific site on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAppreciate if anyone could point me in the right direction.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-04T02:26:58Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2013 02:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Diche Bach\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-04T01:03:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESearched for threads with \u0027pinpoint\u0027 in the title:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/37327-Atmospheric-Landing-Chart-Pinpoint-landings-on-Duna-Eve-Kerbin-Laythe!\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E1\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/36332-Pinpoint-reentry\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E2\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diche Bach","CreatedById":76097,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-04T01:07:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAhh!PINPOINTS!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
