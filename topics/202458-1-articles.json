For direct download from the KSP store website, I\u0027d imagine you would launch the base KSP installer, then each of the DLC installers. There may also be other distribution platforms like Grand Old Games, for which if there are any nonstandard installation procedures, you might try asking that distributor. It would help if you stated where you purchased KSP from.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-18T08:47:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe DLCs are extensions to the main game so you always need the main game installed first. (As an analogy, if the main game was a car, the DLCs would be custom wheels. So you can\u2019t fit the wheels without having the car first).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure about Mac but on PC the DLCs sit inside a folder called SquadExtension (sp?) inside GameData.\u00A0They are also very sensitive regarding moving them or renaming them and they won\u2019t work if this is the case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
