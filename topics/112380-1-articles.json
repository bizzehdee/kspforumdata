For Linux both are just block devices, and modern BIOS (but not EFI) treats them just as HDDs. So, I\u0027d take two USB drives (or one DVD and one USB drive), where one of them will be made into an installation medium, and the other will be the target of the installation. There are several things to look out for though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIf your computer is new enough to use EFI firmware, you have to be careful about which firmware mode you\u0027re using, EFI or BIOS. For a bootable USB drive I\u0027d use BIOS mode. The reason is, that for booting in BIOS mode the firmware always reads the drives boot sector and if there is bootable code there, it will allow you to boot from it, while for EFI there exists a list of bootable entries within the firmware\u0027s own storage in addition. While I don\u0027t think that an additional boot entry in EFI would really create troubles, using BIOS mode is the safer solution, as this way the computer\u0027s EFI configuration remains untouched. Otherwise a boot entry for Linux would be added to the EFI configuration, and I\u0027m not certain how well that\u0027d work if your USB drive isn\u0027t plugged. For most Linux installers it depends on the way the installation medium is booted, whether or not it\u0027ll use EFI mode. So, to be on the safe side boot the installer in BIOS/legacy/(anything that isn\u0027t EFI) mode. If your computer no longer supports BIOS mode, you might have to tell the Linux installer to use the main HDD\u0027s EFI partition, but I\u0027m honestly not sure about this. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EYou\u0027ll want full control over partitioning and bootloader installation.
