Hence why you don\u0027t even have access to decouplers at first (something that ICBMs were already using before the first rockets were going up into space), let alone probes: Jebediah basically founded the KSC by going to a junkyard and assembling the first rocket components from scrap metal, he was so determined to get into space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-14T00:18:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe developers have balanced the tech tree for gameplay, not for realism.
