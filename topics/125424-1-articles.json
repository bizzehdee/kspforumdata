I like the direction milestone contracts are moving and it seems strategies can be restarted once canceled, which I recall being a huge pain before (am I right about this?) Still I know they plan eventually to have 4 tiers and have a major overhaul of this system. Needless to say its a little clunky at the moment, so I thought we could chat about how things could be improved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA couple of sticking points people have made (that I happen to agree with) are things like maneuver nodes and action groups being hidden too deeply (or at all) behind pay-walls. I do see how the first tier is really about introducing new players and there is a genuine reason why some features could and should be withheld so as not to overwhelm them, but pretty rapidly some features are just necessary for the game to function properly. Some of this could be resolved by moving them to a second tier out of 4, and reducing the upgrade cost to make them within reach much earlier. There could also be a number of new tools that could be added to higher building tiers that would be worth striving for. I would especially like to see an alarm clock with transfers and maneuvers posted, and a genuine mission pre-planner that would supply optimum dV budgets and flight duration predictions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know others have strong feelings about this, but lets keep in mind that this system is currently unfinished and try to be constructive. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-14T15:18:16Z\u0022 title=\u002211/14/2015 03:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T15:27:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think maneuver nodes are too far in; basic upgrades to two buildings and you\u0027re there.

This could be a personal preference but it seems like its just adding grind. Some of this could be alleviated by increasing the number of tiers so things would be more incremental, but I\u0027ve suggested lower prices across the board. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Ive moved the action groups up in the building progression, and added Delta-V, TWR, and Drag Modeling to the VAB and SHP for higher tiers. Generally I\u0027ve been thinking Tier 1 is for Kerbin, Teir 2 gets you to the Mun and Minmus, Tier 3 is interplanetary and Tier 4 unlocks everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Ive tightened up the size and weight restrictions for the Launchpad and Runway so that they offer real constraints. I also think instead of the Runway becoming less bumpy on upgrade, (which seems silly since you can just drive off it), the runway grows in length instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) The Tracking station now includes an active flight number limit. This would include anything with active control and not debris. Ive also suggested that the transmission range could be limited as well before upgrade. The Tracking station would also open up an alarm clock for logging and monitoring maneuvers, transfers, and SOI changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Mission Control can be upgraded to include a mission pre-planner in which you could select your mission itinerary and be provided with delta-V and mission time projections based on ideal transfers.
