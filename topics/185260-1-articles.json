I toggled the drag overlay (with closed cargo bays)\u00A0and found this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022XAlnLjl.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/XAlnLjl.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve noticed that parts inside payloads always generate drag, regardless if they\u0027re enclosed or not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI proceeded to test a simple design, with only 5 parts\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022NnyJGDI.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022495\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/NnyJGDI.png\u0022 width=\u0022221\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd noticed the same thing happens to the cubic strut inside the fairing, it also produces drag:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00228xKjt4F.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/8xKjt4F.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI looked around a bit and found someone saying that if you enable Aero Data in Action Menus (in debug window) then you can see if a part is shielded or not.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI tried designs will all sorts of payloads and all of them gave the same results for parts inside: Shielded? False.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would like to know if this is some sort of bug?

Looking at the picture you have the command chairs far away from the inline cargo. I assume they\u0027re attached to the cargo bay floor itself?\u003Cbr\u003E\nMake sure you attach them to the inline cargo, then hold LEFT or RIGHT SHIFT \u002B LMB to drag them far away from it\u0027s grandparent part if you want the seats situated at the same spot as they\u0027re now without editing the cargo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso make sure all other parts are attached to that inline setup and not dragged from another place. I have the experience that re-installing the cargo by removing it and then reattaching it to the node again can solve the problem if this issue persists. I\u0027m not sure what leads up to it. I do sometimes take of the cargo bay in the editor with the payload attached accidentally to another node or I attach it with \u0022allow part clipping in editors\u0022 enabled (cheat menu option) which can cause a attachment to attach wrong, for instance, have the cargo attached to a inline fuel tank node or when attaching the cargo bay over the cargo instead of attaching the cargo inside the bay. These situations can cause the cargo to be calculated outside the cargo bay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kenedos","CreatedById":198026,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-09T21:00:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIndeed the \u0022Shielded: False\u0022 seems buggy and the overlay shows red lines (drag) on occluded parts but clicking on the part with the debug menu it does indeed say 0 drag!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the replies guys!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
