It works just fine for awhile, but I think right after I arrive at jool it no longer recharges, I\u0027ve tried launching this 3 times. As I mentioned above, oddly, when I undock that top section and switch back over to the main body I can right click on the reactor and see that it has recharged megajoules and electricity, and the antimatter tank is again charging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only mods I have installed are KAS, Mechjeb, and EnhancedNavBall.

Ive put a 3.5 gen, and a 3.5 AM reactor. 5 labs in total.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen i made a craft, with 2 big nukes plus generators of their own and stuff radiators etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI connect them together, and we get the 5GW needed (i only activate 1 of the labs), the AM resource shows -0.00, so technically its rising. At some point the AM reactor kicks in, we start to see the increase in power. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here is the kicker, because im bored to wait RL and see whats gonna happen, i start timewarp, the AM meter is rising and rising, if you increase warp then we get the effect of no energy production (at some point everything is gonna run out), but also if you stop timewarp the AM goes back to -0.00 (from 0.38 something), and the AM reactor stops the juice, so i cant activate the rest of the labs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo much wall of text.. well im sure im making a stupid design flaw somewhere (like why on earth i use an AM reactor instead of some nukes in the first place, since its Kerbin ground and can easelly move stuff around), or why i dont go to Jool and get tons of the stuff.. but anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead of answers (which would be just as nice), if anyone got a craft of AM production on the ground, id be happy to have a look at it.

Fractal should use modulemanager to add the waste heat stat to the game\u0027s pods, engines, and scientific instruments. If waste heat is too high, it should disable them. Furthermore, the waste heat storage number should be much much smaller. It should be about 100-\u0026gt;1000 times smaller. If you are making waste heat faster than you are dissipating it, spacecraft should overheat and shut down within hours, not days or weeks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, waste heat should not be generated if power is being produced by solar panels and is not being used by the spacecraft. (for nuclear reactors that are at idle, this is understandable). Solar panels that are not producing power do not produce waste heat in real life physics. (I mean, they do heat up, but you are basically just holding the circuit open, and there\u0027s no load that they are driving)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"forsaken1111","CreatedById":2703,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T19:30:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Thourion\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Thourion\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell i got a question that is probably asked a million times.
