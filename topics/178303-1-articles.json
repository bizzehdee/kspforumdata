STEP tries to stay as close to vanilla Skyrim as possible while improving visual quality and correcting game-play mechanics.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe goal would be to have a set of baseline mods and tweaks that everyone using the guide would be expected to use (things like bugfix and optimization/quality of life mods that don\u0027t change gameplay or increase game requirements). Additional configurations could be specified beyond the baseline, and could include things like graphical overhauls, part rebalances (with some new parts as well to fill in gaps) and even full career overhauls (kind of like what SETI was trying to accomplish). The modding community outside of the project would be encouraged to create their own configurations starting from the baseline or other official configs, and the best of these could potentially be \u0022adopted\u0022 by the project and maintained by the main project team.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy idea is to make this more of a community rather than an individual project (kind of how \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E has been done) so multiple modders can contribute and come and go from the project in response to real-life demands.
