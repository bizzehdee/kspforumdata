It\u0027s a specific orbit, at ~36000 km, over the equator, where your orbital speed matches the Earth\u0027s rotation, and therefore the satellite remains over the same spot. This orbit is very popular with telecom and TV satellite operators who want permanent coverage of a particular country. The drawback of reaching this orbit is that it is very high, and therefore requires a lot of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to get there, and it needs to be equatorial, which means that you need to launch from near the equator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KG3","CreatedById":182951,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-16T01:56:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShould be pointed out that geostationary earth orbit is different from geosynchronous earth orbit.\u00A0 I was confused by this at one time but I assume that I\u0027m still confused so please someone correct me.\u00A0 A geostationary satellite orbits prograde over the equator (or close to) every 24 hours and appears to stay (mostly) in one spot in the sky.\u00A0 A geosynchronous satellite orbits every 24 hours but can be more inclined.\u00A0 I believe a geosynchronous satellite can in a polar orbit or an elliptical orbit (such as a tundra orbit) and maybe even retrograde orbit too maybe?. \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xd the great","CreatedById":188222,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-16T02:07:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/182951-kg3/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022182951\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/182951-kg3/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@KG3\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Yes, as long as the satellite returns to the same spot after 24 hours.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-16T02:12:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223468688\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022178980\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221539654998\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022182951\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KG3\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 minute ago, KG3 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShould be pointed out that geostationary earth orbit is different from geosynchronous earth orbit.\u00A0 I was confused by this at one time but I assume that I\u0027m still confused so please someone correct me.\u00A0 A geostationary satellite orbits prograde over the equator (or close to) every 24 hours and appears to stay (mostly) in one spot in the sky.\u00A0 A geosynchronous satellite orbits every 24 hours but can be more inclined.\u00A0 I believe a geosynchronous satellite can in a polar orbit or an elliptical orbit (such as a tundra orbit) and maybe even retrograde orbit too maybe?. \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, technically.
