Symmetry within symmetry - When you place symmetric parts on a parent, then grab that parent and make symmetric parts with it onto another parent. I do this a lot and it\u0027s not a problem if you\u0027re careful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. ALT\u002BF-12 clipping in conjunction with symmetry. - This one is more dangerous. It can happen without symmetry, but it occurs much more often when symmetry on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Use of Undo (Ctrl\u002BZ). - I pretty much never use this because it\u0027s so unpredictably buggy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBased on how your craft looks, I\u0027m guessing you made use of the ALT\u002BF-12 clipping option. Debug clipping can be problematic and sometimes when clipping coupled with symmetry when you are applying things to one node. When removing parts and putting them back with these options enabled, sometimes phantom parts are created that don\u0027t appear attached to the craft (i.e. they are far away), but the are technically connected by the internal part structure. That\u0027s why you get floating engine pieces that are firing. Also, sometimes using undo while there\u0027s a part hovering off to the side can cause similar events where parts become reattached even though they are floating off to the side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, once this has happened it\u0027s a mess to clean up. And with phantom parts, you can\u0027t always be sure you got rid of them all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I usually do if I\u0027m going to make use of these kind of options is to save periodically with different craft names. Then you can use the load screen to let you know if something weird is happening. When you bring up the load screen, it tells you how many parts the thing has. If it\u0027s indicating a change of a lot more parts than what you actually added, then you might have a problem. With multiple versions, you can backtrack without losing too much ground. If I do make use of option #2, I will turn on clipping for the minimum amount of time necessary, then turn it off immediately. I\u0027ve had a lot fewer problems this way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that answers your question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerano","CreatedById":107460,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-08T00:15:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I\u0027ve just got this too.
