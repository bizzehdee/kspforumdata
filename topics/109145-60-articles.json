I kept the same vertical stabilizer/rudder design of a split V.\n\nSpoiler\n\n![ZGnO6Ph.png](https://i.imgur.com/ZGnO6Ph.png)\n\nAnd the issue persisted. I\u0027d start turning right on the runway, and if I did manage to take-off... I\u0027d begin to yaw uncontrollably. I then began to uninstall spaceplane parts mods, remove parts one by one and keep trying and trying and... nothing seemed to work.\n\nFinally, I looked at the rudder. It was attached to the fuel tank, not the tricoupler. I could remove the tricoupler and the vertical stabilizers remained. I  then deleted the stabilizers and attached them NOT to the tricoupler, but to the whiplashes directly.\n\nNow, I was able to take off!\n\nSpoiler\n\n![14WhEc0.png](https://i.imgur.com/14WhEc0.png)\n\nLong-story short:\n\nif you are running this mod and procedural wings and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and experience really weird veering to the right/left on the runway and on take off, experience unexplainable yaw instability that seems to persist even without thrust (I\u0027d have my engines off and parachuting and... I\u0027d be spinning faster and faster in place)...\n\nDo not put your procedural wing on the tricoupler. Put it on your very long whiplash engines or rapier or such. Or if you do put it on the bi/tricoupler, make SUPER CERTAIN it is attached to the coupler and not the fuel tank in front of it. I\u0027ve no idea what or why this is an issue (stock bicoupler seems fine), but... this is the fix I found. The new design flies wonderfully (altho I\u0027ll shift the rudders into a V shape again)\n\nThis causes phantom forces:\n\nSpoiler\n\n![ujyiNor.png](https://i.imgur.com/ujyiNor.png)\n\nThis doesn\u0027t cause phantom forces:\n\nSpoiler\n\n![XFLMB4p.png](https://i.imgur.com/XFLMB4p.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-05-01T10:59:17Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2024 10:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022May 1\u0022\u003EMay 1\u003C/time\u003E by RunaDacino**\n  \nFound it\u0027s not about attaching to engines, it\u0027s about proc wing hitboxes and how they attach."},{"CreatedByName":"Pauver","CreatedById":209137,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-10T09:09:51Z","Content":"I\u0027m having trouble with the Mattock engine.
