How did I forget about things like Ions and LV-N\u0027s. Whoops. Still, not a factor at low tech tree when bi-couplers would be more useful but I concede ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T20:52:34Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 08:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CorBlimey**"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T20:36:16Z","Content":"Three solid fuel boosters?"},{"CreatedByName":"CorBlimey","CreatedById":134058,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T20:41:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Three solid fuel boosters?\n\nuseful but not much different to mounting them radially. Then, in particular, you can also use the central stack for a bit of a boost / steerage off the launch-pad while the SRBs burn into higher TWR.\n\nOk I suppose a small satellite with 3 SRBs underneath to boost it to altitude works well. Again, may as well stick one on the stack and mount the other 2 radially (unlike bi- or quad- which actually change things in that respect)."},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T20:43:15Z","Content":"I use it for mounting ion engines."},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T20:43:30Z","Content":"Triple LV-Ns ?\n\nDesign freedom, to make things that look cool if you want threefold symetry for aesthetic purposes?"},{"CreatedByName":"Aerindel","CreatedById":109952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T20:51:17Z","Content":"LV-Ns"},{"CreatedByName":"CorBlimey","CreatedById":134058,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T20:52:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I use it for mounting ion engines.\n\nwhoops.
