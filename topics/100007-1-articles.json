I know how to intercept an asteroid, just match planes and rendezvous. But I\u0027m not too sure how to make an interceptor that can stop can asteroid from crashing into Kerbin.. I know engines are a big thing, but just recommend the properties of engines that make intercepting possible, because I have many mods like B9 and Near Future Technologies installed. Also, is aerobreaking with asteroids practical? ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\nAlso, I want to venture into really stupid uses for asteroids. Like putting the asteroid on my Mun base... heh. ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)\n\nOne more thing: I want to start using mods such as Advanced Mining Technologies and Asteroid Recycling Technologies to make asteroids useful. I don\u0027t have mods like Tac Life Support installed, but I do have Karbonite installed, so if you could describe uses for dem asteroids that\u0027d be great ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nCheers!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-18T16:44:12Z\u0022 title=\u002202/18/2015 04:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by polan**"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFjord","CreatedById":97341,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-18T13:39:29Z","Content":"A class C asteroid is quite massive, the wiki says 42.5 ~ 190.6 tons. Just build a rocket that can haul a comparable payload and tweak the engines / dV to your needs.\n\nIf you have lots of time, then nukes work well (but will need loooooong burns), otherwise use some poddles, skippers, maybe mainsails if time is short and the rock is about to crash \u0022soon\u0022.\n\nAerobraking is perfectly possible with an asteroid, I also have heard that a large number of chutes works fine to land them ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nMake sure to add some docking port to your grabber, in case you need to refuel it.

The mass of a Class C rock indeed ranges from between 42-190 tonnes, with ninety tonnes a good figure for planning purposes (for reference the mass formula for rocks is e^(1.5x), where x=1 on average for Class A (it ranges from 0.5 to 1.5), 2 for Class B, 3 for Class C, 4 for Class D and 5 for Class E). The dinky little probe that Claw uses in the tutorial can easily catch a Class A or B on its own; I\u0027ve delivered it to LKO before via spaceplane (it is a case where replacing the 909 with an LV-N gets you more thrust and more delta-V, incidentally). C is a little bit out of the range of that simple craft, but not much.\n\nYou could still attempt an intercept in Kerbin\u0027s SOI in the manner indicated in the tutorial I\u0027ve linked you to, though since you\u0027re closer to the body that both your craft and the rock are orbiting (i.e. Kerbin), you\u0027d have to book it and not miss on the first attempt - otherwise the rock would likely get away from you and ultimately land and tear up somebody\u0027s fender.\n\nSince you asked, aerobraking is possible with rocks - you just treat them like any other craft. Since you\u0027re using B9, and assuming you\u0027ve got the latest version, you\u0027re also using FAR, with which I\u0027m not familiar (been thinking about switching but haven\u0027t done it yet). That wide, irregular surface is going to generate a fair amount of drag, so I\u0027d recommend orienting the rock so that your capture probe can push it prograde during the aerobraking process. Just in case; like I said, I don\u0027t really know enough about FAR to give sound advice there.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-18T14:18:07Z\u0022 title=\u002202/18/2015 02:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101**"},{"CreatedByName":"polan","CreatedById":131811,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-18T14:19:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Just in case; like I said, I don\u0027t really know enough about FAR to give sound advice there.\n\nI\u0027m actually using NEAR because I think FAR is a little much for a noobzor like me, so NEAR might be more familiar to you."},{"CreatedByName":"thadisjones","CreatedById":134649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-18T15:49:19Z","Content":"A good idea for moving around the larger rocks is to anchor a separate RCS drone opposite to your main tug, so instead of trying to wrench the asteroid around, you can use thrusters to rotate it easily around a common axis.
