I also chose a sandbox game so I can advance technology at my own pace and not be restricted on craft, in order to bring the best viewer experience! I also used a number of mods:\n\nKW Rocketry (I love the new engines and fairings)\n\nB9 (Not currently covered but very useful for later craft)\n\nHull Camera VDS (For the rocket imaging)\n\nInfernal Robotics \n\nKerbal Vessel Viewer\n\nKerbal Alarm Clock\n\nEnvironmental Visual Enhancements (Only actually active in the X-2 Video)\n\nRemote Tech (For realism in long distance missions)\n\nTAC Life Support (More Realism)\n\nI would greatly appreciate any feedback, good or bad, as everything helps me get better and make it better for you guys!\n\nHere\u0027s a link to the R-1 to get you started!\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLL3V3FmMvvIi7Ubttw_8pm07nFAW16QLM\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nKeep on Kerbaling! ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"tg626","CreatedById":112361,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T21:21:46Z","Content":"This is kinda cool.\n\n(BTW, from my research based on reverse engineering the Chatterer sound files, to make your voice \u0022Kerbaled\u0022 change the pitch \u002B15% and then reverse it. From there you can then filter it to some old time radio or what have you.)"}]}
