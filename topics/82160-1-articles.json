When the apoapsis is high enough, stop burning (assuming you\u0027re above 40km or so. You may need to overdo the apoapsis by just a bit, maybe up to 5km) and just coast up to about 30 seconds before it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, point mostly prograde but just below the horizon (maybe 5 degrees) and throttle up just a bit - I generally thrust at whatever amount gets me about 1 G of acceleration. Continue burning until you start to see a periapsis (this second burn should take place mainly in Map View), and then throttle down to just a smidgen until you get the periapsis close to the height of your apoapsis. You should get a \u0022perfect\u0022 orbit every time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdvanced notes for the curious:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI say just below the horizon because when burning before the apoapsis, burning down will reduce the eccentricity and burning horizontally will cause the apoapsis to rise. Thus burning at a slight angle down will keep the apoapsis in place while accelerating the ship and lifting the periapsis. As you pass the apoapsis, your ship should slowly rotate relative to Kerbin (or you can manually rotate it) so that it goes through the horizon line and starts to point slightly up. At this point you have the opposite effect, i.e. burning up will decrease your eccentricity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027ve achieved orbit a few times, you\u0027re likely to find that burning at exactly 45 degrees at exactly 10km isn\u0027t the optimal solution. Personally, I start slowly tilting eastward at somewhere around 10km and go into Map View so as to watch what my apoapsis is doing. I like to have it reach 45km when I\u0027m tilted to about 15 degrees above horizontal, after which I throttle down so as to reduce wobble from high G-forces and precisely control my trajectory. Once the apoapsis is around 60km or so I find you can just burn straight horizontally and the orbit will start to circularize itself while the apoapsis slowly rises. With some practice, your final insertion burn shouldn\u0027t be more than 300 m/s or so (i.e. you should already be at around 1800 m/s or higher when you get to the apoapsis).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-19T21:56:58Z\u0022 title=\u002208/19/2014 09:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by parameciumkid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-19T21:50:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGetting periapsis and apoapsis exactly equal is very hard and unnecessary, if they\u0027re within 3 km from each other the orbit is circular enough.

The gravity turn may more steep with one, but better if more smooth with another. But probably the single thing you should improve is with the timing for the circularization burn. The initial burn during ascent must be enough to reach apoapsis at the set altitude (e.g., at 100 Km), but once the apoapsis is obtained, you should stop the engines (or, burn almost horizontal). Of course, to know the apoapsis, you have to look at the marker with the map view. So, stop the engines, and set a maneuver node at apoapsis for the circularization: just burn prograde until periapsis is at the same level. If you move the burn too early or too late, you see that the trajectory will turn elliptical; the only correct one is when the burn is exactly at apoapsis. With the node set, try to compute the amount of time needed to perform the burn, and begin burning about half the burn duration before reaching the node. But, keep following the blue node marker for all the burn until all the required Delta-V is done, and you should have a perfect orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Empiro","CreatedById":112072,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-20T01:45:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe trick to getting really circular orbits is monitoring your time to apoapsis rather than your periapsis.

Continue burning until both apoapsis and periapsis are where you want them, but keep an eye on the apoapsis; at high velocity, you only need to pitch a fraction too high for a short time to hugely increase the apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods that provide basic in-flight instrumentation (Mechjeb, KER etc) so that you can monitor the needed information without switching to map view make the flashy version much easier to do.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-20T03:39:45Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2014 03:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Wanderfound\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aethon","CreatedById":110755,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-20T04:02:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wanderfound\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Wanderfound\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESimple version: during ascent, monitor your apoapsis.
