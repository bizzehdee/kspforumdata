So, while I\u0027m not exactly a \u0022regular\u0022 or \u0022old-timer\u0022 with any sort of social capital on this forum, I thought it might not be a bad idea, and maybe a mod will sticky it if folks use it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI myself have like six million questions that have arisen over the summer getting back into playing KSP, and many do not deal with mods where questions specific to those would be more appropriate to their respective sub-forums.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my first three to start with:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. What is a \u0022sub-assembly?\u0022 Is this stock?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. When does the game actually load assets?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI ask because two instances struck me as \u0027peculiar.\u0027 A. When I\u0027ve tried to delete or move files in GameData while game was initialized and in play, it wouldn\u0027t let me, which I found surprising as I figured given the time it makes to load (and for ModuleManager to patch things) I figured most of the data was in data structures in the game. Just doing my first course on data structures, so my understanding of this may be out of whack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nB. This morning I launched the game as I was browsing the forums, and decided I\u0027d backup all my ship files, so I could have the liberty to delete the ones I scarcely use any more. Somehow in doing this, I managed to move the directory for my career campaign out of the saves\\career directory and into the main KSP directory. Naturally I was puzzled when I went into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E and found no craft files! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I moved the \u0022ships\u0022 directory back to where it belong and PRESTO! even without rebooting the game, there are my craft files again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. What language is the source code for this game written in? Reason I ask is, I have a years training in C\u002B\u002B, Java, tad bit of JavaScript and PHP, and of course HTML, CSS, XML, doing my first \u0022post-course work\u0022 apprenticeship with a 35-year career programmer this fall (I\u0027m 48, early retired professor, and training for second \u0022dream career\u0022) . . . Would be good to know how to write plugins for this game, and I probably have the foundation to be able to do it pretty readily at this point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-07T19:35:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.)

This effect is always the same, no matter where in your orbit you are, so the idea that a normal burn is only effective at a few points of the orbit is completely off. Instead, what you should take away is: although the effect is the same everywhere, the result that that effect gives you only matches \u003Cem\u003Ethe result you seek\u003C/em\u003E if you burn at a specific point of the orbit. Otherwise, the burn will result in the orbit changing into a shape you can\u0027t use, but it still changes all the same. It\u0027s a question of expectation vs. reality.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe individual effects of burns are:\u003Cbr\u003E\n- A prograde burn pushes the point directly opposite of you further away from the gravity well. If this point is not the apoapsis, the shape of the orbit will twist in such a way that the apoapsis travels towards that point.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- A retrograde burn pulls the point directly opposite of you deeper into the gravity well. If this point is not the periapsis, the shape of the orbit will twist in such a way that the periapsis travels towards that point.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- A normal burn will rotate the plane of the orbit counterclockwise around an axis passing through your vessel and the origin of gravity. It also adds a bit of orbital energy, resulting in a small prograde effect.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- An antinormal burn will rotate the plane of the orbit clockwise around an axis passing through your vessel and the origin of gravity. It also adds a bit of orbital energy, resulting in a small prograde effect.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- A radial-in burn will twist the orbit within its plane around an axis perpendicular to it, through your vessel, in the direction of the orbit - a bit like a hoola hoop. This twisting motion is constrained by the origin of gravity, which the orbit cannot pass. The lower the periapsis, the lesser the twisting effect you can get, and the more of the invested energy will end up raising your apoapsis instead.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- A radial-out burn will twist the orbit within its plane around an axis perpendicular to it, through your vessel, against the direction of the orbit - a bit like a hoola hoop. This twisting motion is constrained by the origin of gravity, which the orbit cannot pass. The lower the periapsis, the less of a twisting effect you can get, and the more of the invested energy will end up raising your apoapsis instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAmong these, prograde/retrograde burns are more effective the closer to the origin of gravity you are, while normal/antinormal and radial-in/radial-out burns are more effective the further away from the origin of gravity you are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding the significance of the ascending and descending nodes:\u003Cbr\u003E\nThese are not points where you somehow get a boost to the effectiveness of your normal burns at all. The burn is precisely as effective there as it is everywhere else (at the same altitude). What these nodes actually represent are \u003Cem\u003Ethe intersection points of two orbital planes\u003C/em\u003E. Nothing more, nothing less. Now, as I said above, a normal/antinormal burn rotates the orbit around an axis that passes through your vessel and the origin of gravity. That in turn means that the current position of your vessel, as well as its direct opposition point, are the only points of the orbit that \u0022stay still\u0022 and don\u0027t change at all during a normal/antinormal burn; everything else moves. If you now happen to want to change from one orbital plane to another - for example, you are coming from Kerbin and want to go to Moho - then it follows that this point that \u0022stays still\u0022, this focus point of the rotation of the orbit during the plane change, must already be located in the target orbital plane. After all, it cannot move there if it stays still. And the only two points of your current orbital plane that are \u003Cem\u003Ealso\u003C/em\u003E part of the target orbital plane are the intersection points between these two planes.

Any and all celestial bodies in the stock system have their equator perfectly aligned with their orbital plane.

If you click reset or transmit in the science dialog, this item is destroyed again, but if you click keep, or press no buttons at all, it remains where it is. This item is the thing that must be recovered in order to get recovery science. Not the experiment that generated it - just this item. Additionally, while this item remains stored in the science module, that science module cannot generate new report items without first destroying the old one. If you want to preserve the item, you must remove it from the science module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScience report items can be taken out of the science module they were created in by a Kerbal on EVA. However, the Kerbal is generally not able to put them back into a part. Only parts that implement ModuleScienceContainer can receive science report items and store them. Generally, all manned command modules, the mobile processing lab, and the Kerbals themselves implement this. Note that even on parts that have this container, experiments still generate the report item inside themselves. They don\u0027t put it inside the container automatically. This is why you must do the \u0022take crew report -\u0026gt; EVA -\u0026gt; take data -\u0026gt; board again\u0022 dance every time. (The boarding action automatically stores data inside ModuleScienceContainer.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a storage limit of one unique science report item per ModuleScienceContainer. In this context, \u0022unique report\u0022 refers to the experiment-altitude-biome combination. A ModuleScienceContainer can store an infinite number of unique crew reports, but only one single copy of \u0022crew report while flying above Kerbin\u0027s grasslands\u0022. This becomes important for goo canisters and materials bays, which by default don\u0027t yield their full payout from a single report even on recovery. You may want to recover more than one identical report in order to get as much science as you can, but you won\u0027t be able to carry two or more copies inside the same ModuleScienceContainer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222712169\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022145561\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221470851022\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002276097\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Diche Bach\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 hours ago, Diche Bach said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.

I find the way the maneuver node displays change when you start changing Spheres of Influence to be a bit strange. I did just manage to do a Minmus flyby at 24,000m periapsis above Minmus (to complete a lucrative tourist mission as well as a nice training mission that bumped my best pilot up to level 3) where I setup the A. Encounter burn from Kerbin orbit (obviously). Then after the encounter \u0022node\u0022 was established, I set up; B. the \u0022close fly-by\u0022 node, using primarily retro and either radial or anti-radial burn to go from 635km peri of Minmus down to 24km (to get below my 30km threshold to complete the tourist mission); C. I then (while still many hours away) setup a \u0022post-flyby\u0022 node to lower my Kerbin peri from 1,800km down to like 42,000m\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main part I find strange is: Once I setup A. it seemed I was unable to place any additional maneuver nodes along the teal-colored leg of the trajectory, though I _was_ able to click right at the \u0022Minmus Encounter\u0022 point to setup the \u0022B.\u0022 and also I was able to click on the teal arc between that point and the \u0022Minmus Escape\u0022 node, as well as the orange node that showed my trajectory after the flyby and back toward Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI find gravity-assists (whether braking or accelerating) aero-braking, etc. to be absolutely fascinating and I\u0027d like to really get a solid mastery of how to use the UI to setup exact things, even if it is all setup long in advance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould be very cool to be able to: Get an unmanned probe into Kerbin orbit, then setup a sequence of three or four \u0022delayed execution\u0022 manuever nodes in the RT flight computer that put it into a stable orbit of some other celestial.
