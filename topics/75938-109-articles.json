So, while KF wheels and the stock conversions will behave alongside the sound mod, the sounds will only actually react to wheels still using the stock module. Anything running the KF module would rely on the way lo-fi implemented the sounds himself and not the way the other mod handles them. So, as lo-fi said, you\u0027ll have no problems, unless you consider the wheel sound mod not actually working on the KF-configured wheels a problem... in that case you\u0027ll have tons of problems.

The ledges are enough to stop a slow moving craft, and other than a few occasions where I lost grip and screwed up a 90 degree turn, it was easy enough to make quick progress.
