Personally I haven\u0027t used them yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI usually adjust the roll angle after I dock the first time. Once they are docked, you can undock them and make the fine roll adjustments.No need to back away, in fact you want to stay very close to get lined up.

However, if there were such a need, I think it could be easily done. If the desired angle was known at design time, the docking ports could be built with channels that force alignment at the desired angle. And if the desired angle was not known at design time, the docking ports could be designed with a clamping mechanism that can be loosened enough to allow rotation of the mating part, but not escape; this would allow fine-tuning of the angle via standard attitude control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn KSP, I\u0027m trying to make a rotating space station, and I find that the angle of attachment between ports matters to my design. However, I don\u0027t see any way to influence that angle except during docking. Thank you, Taki117, for referring me to the Docking Alignment mod, but with my poor flying skills, there\u0027s no way I could obtain a \u0022precise\u0022 result even with the mod. I\u0027m hoping to find a way to dial-in the angle after docking.
