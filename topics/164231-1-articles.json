One of the aspects I really like though is the building part, It is one of, if not the best, and most flexible builders in games\u00A0I have found. This is somewhat a problem, because I have been unable to find a new game I really like similar to this. Most of them I try are either very limiting, or you can only build squarely/on snap points.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I am wondering is, what other games are out there with such a flexible building experience as KSP?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-09T16:27:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpace engineers comes to mind, though I\u0027ve never played it so I don\u0027t know much about it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-09T18:15:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpace Engineers is alright although I\u0027ve heard there are performance issues with it recently (I haven\u0027t booted it up in some time so I\u0027m not sure what\u0027s been done).

(There are monsters which are active at night and in dark places, but fighting them is not the point of the game.) But Minecraft does consist of immobile structure building.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to build things that do stuff, you might try From the Depths. I am not getting very far into it still because the tutorials are inadequate and the UI is awkward, but I am interested in using blocks not unllke Minecraft blocks to construct vessels to go out and combat each other.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NSEP","CreatedById":165635,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-10T09:56:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmm, building aspects are quite hard to find in the gaming world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe have simpleplanes, a game that allows you to build costum planes, i dont know about realistic aerodynamics in that game though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-10T14:39:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t played it, but I think Besiege has pretty open construction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"p1t1o","CreatedById":74091,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-10T15:17:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is no game like KSP, Space Engineers is the closest match, but the following are also in my \u0022builder\u0022 category in my steam library:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFactorio - resource management to the max (check out \u0022Big Pharma\u0022 for a similar experience based on the pharmaceuticals industry)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPrison Architect - this is just excellent all round (check out Rimworld if youd rather planetary survival rather than a prison)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCities: Skylines - most modern city builder around at the mo, I think.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBesiege - Medieval KSP\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKinetic Void - modularly built space battleships (an indie devs early attempt, so not 110% \u0022AAA\u0022 grade, but the ship building/combat mechanics are pretty cool)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust wondering - have you explored the weird and wonderful world of KSP mods?

I personally find it hard to plan things out without building them at least in part, and I think large scale construction would go a lot faster in a hanger view like KSP.

There is a game I used to play years ago that would likely fit the bill, but I don\u0027t know if it still exists, and for the life of me I\u0027ve not a clue what it was called. It was a 2D game where you would draw various shapes that could be joined together with welds, hinges, motors, springs, and so on. You could create vehicles to cross rough terrain, various projectile weapons (people would attach thrusters to a bunch of small blocks to simulate gun powder for example).
