I feel this is supported by ARM\u0027s lack of full number designation as .23.5 rather than .24 and that the new parts/mechanics are not contained within the SQUAD folder, but within the NASAmission folder. I have inferred that ARM was released as an \u0027update\u0027 rather than put up on Spaceport or released via the KSP store for distribution reasons. Spaceport\u0027s interface is pretty bad (weren\u0027t we going to get a new version of that?), and the KSP site has enough trouble dealing with users updating through the Squad launcher let alone those of us that get our updates via Steam and other licensed distributors. Clearly releasing it as an update was the sensible choice to make it easy on us to get the new stuff. If you don\u0027t like the NASA parts or mechanics, just delete the folder as you would with any mod you don\u0027t have an interest in using. Squad created it as an add-on, not core addition, that helps NASA promote their new manned-space initiative in the hopes of generating interest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if we aren\u0027t looking at ARM as a mod, the parts look to me as if they may be balanced with future updates in mind. The SLS S1 engine quad is well over twice the cost of the mainsail, but even according to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/74448-SLS-engines-Probe-Rockomax-buffed-ions-and-a-larger-solar-system?p=1057132#post1057132\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESilly Chris\u0027s calculations\u003C/a\u003E, does not offer twice the performance, and it\u0027s at the top of the tech tree. That means that yes, you will have a very sexy and realistic engine at your disposal near the end of the game that makes the mainsail look like a bottle rocket, but it\u0027s also going to be prohibitively expensive compared to the per-launch costs of a mainsail-based rocket. With the stated goal of adding contracts and implied budgets in .24, which was in parallel development with ARM, it seems to me that SQUAD will make you pay dearly for parts that can turn anyone into Giggleplex or Whackjob.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the non-ARM parts that have experienced change, including joint reinforcement, I feel that the changes positive. I can\u0027t think of a single person that has expressed joy at sitting in front of their computer for hours waiting for their Ion probe to complete an obnoxiously long burns at x4 time acceleration. It\u0027s not realistic, but certainly this improves gameplay the same way as unrealistically allowing us to reset experiments repeatedly until we\u0027e moved out of areas we\u0027ve already drained of science and into the area we want to get new science from. Ant engines have been practically useless for their entire existence because of their low-thrust and even lower ISP performance. It\u0027s nice to think I might actually find them the most efficient choice for the job now rather than a pity choice for something that won\u0027t see use otherwise. Floppy joint has been a constant complaint of large-scale and linear stack rocket builders since the introduction of the size 2 parts ages ago, now they don\u0027t have to add massive amounts of struts to get an otherwise reasonable rocket to fly. Squad may have gone a bit overboard, but they can always scale it back, or make parts more fragile, depending on how much it affects the size 3 part performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are already mods out there that offer seriously OP parts late in the tech tree, we don\u0027t flood the modders\u0027 threads with demands to balance their engines to Squads\u0027 performance envelope. Is Squad not allowed to similarly experiment with new ways of balancing parts beyond their raw performance specifications?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs public beta testers, we should definitely take a critical eye to every update Squad puts out to help them maintain the quality they\u0027ve established with past updates, but we also need to have a little patience when they have not one, but two updates in the oven that may offer us new challenges we haven\u0027t had to deal with. It\u0027s hard to keep a budget in check, just ask NASA after the cancellation of the Constellation program and their current issues keeping Orion and SLS on track, and I have a feeling that Squad will balance out extra-powerful engines by making it hard for us to always fit them into our career budgets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-04T20:51:32Z\u0022 title=\u002204/04/2014 08:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by csiler2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eclarity\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"soldieroffilth","CreatedById":88590,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T21:15:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am just going to start by saying that there isn\u0027t anything in the new update that you can\u0027t already get in a mod from the Spaceport.

It\u0027s about hardcore gameplay and balance, which will occasionally coincide with realism, but is not at all the same thing. Same with what you\u0027re saying above. Realism or no, what you\u0027re describing just makes for a poor game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd really, that\u0027s what I would argue about many features in this new update in having effectively removed a lot of what previously made KSP fun. IMO overpowered parts that become the only effective choice and joints that simply refuse to break under even the most extreme of circumstances (even if allowing for my new found love of extreme rocket-tricking) serve to make the game less interesting, and thus fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-04T23:26:08Z\u0022 title=\u002204/04/2014 11:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by FlowerChild\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T23:28:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the increased joint strength because I got really sick of heavy lifters randomly failing on physics load, regardless of the number of struts.

I think if you look at the new easy to assemble kit-rocket parts in combination with stuff like the excessive joint reinforcement, as well as Squad\u0027s own statements about wanting to make KSP easier for new players to wrap their head around, you\u0027ll understand why I\u0027m thinking that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, what I\u0027m worried about is not that this is simply a feature that needs more tweaking or what have you to get just right, but is basically an intentional effort to dumb the game down to make it easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that would be a shame, as IMO rocket design and the sense of accomplishment that comes along with pulling off stuff like getting crazy payloads into orbit is a fundamental aspect of what makes KSP fun. If anything, I think the game really needs more such considerations to heighten that sense of accomplishment (such as a more interesting aero model), not less, as many of the rocket design constraints previously in place were largely artificial (such as the need for crazy strutting and a computer capable of handling it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I feel we\u0027re kinda heading towards is the equivalent of Bridge Builder where there\u0027s no chance your bridges will ever collapse anyways, because that would be \u0022too hard\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course most players will love more powerful parts. Of course they will love easier to construct rockets...at least initially. However, they may also find themselves growing quickly bored of a game that provides no meaningful challenge in the long term if things go too far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, that\u0027s my 2 cents. Given that we\u0027re in alpha I think that a large part of the value Squad gets out of having so many people playing their game is that it opens up the potential that people will spot problems with it while they still have time to correct them. To me, this represents a big potential problem that I feel compelled to point out, and if it is an overall design trend as I fear it might be, I think it also stands a good chance of alienating the core audience that has made KSP such a success to begin with.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
