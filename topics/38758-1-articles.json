If most matter in galaxies is dark matter, then isn\u0027t most matter in The Solar System Dark Matter?

If it were inversely proportional to regular matter, we\u0027d see high concentrations of it in the intergalactic void rather than in galaxies themselves, and it would appear to have an antigravity-like effect.
