Outfitted with the latest in C7 prototype engines and parts, the X-23 is capable of both atmospheric and orbital flight. The X-23 only utilizes four mobile tail fins, relying almost totally on the gimballing of its engines to maneuver. This allows it to maintain almost all of its capabilities in atmosphere and in orbit; however, it also means that fuel is a strict time limit. Sub-orbital velocities can easily exceed 300m/s, when out of the atmosphere the X-23 can achieve escape velocity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to use this .craft you will need the latest C7 part pack as well as his prototype pack (first update). \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technoguy33","CreatedById":8845,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-23T18:26:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\\\u0027s insane! 8)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-23T19:53:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome, but can it land?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xeranes","CreatedById":10372,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-23T19:57:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RedDwarfIV\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RedDwarfIV\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAwesome, but can it land?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDepends on what you mean by \u0027land\u0027... =P\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am working on retro-rocket assisted parachute system to bring it down gently, but landing gear is out of the question for the wing configuration!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: uploaded a new photo of a pseudo-isometric view!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_Barrett","CreatedById":3206,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-23T21:31:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\\\u0027t want to rain on anyone\\\u0027s parade, but I find this a perfect chance to use this situation as a learning session as well as a form of constructive criticism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou see, the atmosphere drag varies so greatly from sea level to the edge of itself, and 20km is no where near the density of flying under 5km.
