WWTank is what you might expect, a special fuel tank designed to be reworked into a living area. WWRefit is a module jammed full of instruments and equipment and air fresheners which can be docked with the aforementioned tank and used to convert it into a habitable area. This would remove the ability for the tank to store fuel and oxidizer, and enable the airlock to allow your Kerbals to enter the module. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe refitter also requires at least one Kerbal to operate, to move things around and hang up the air fresheners inside the tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERefit modules would work wherever they are on the vessel - we can just assume that Gregski EVAs all the stuff over while the process is going on. Speaking of which, ideally the process isn\u0027t immediate - it would take perhaps a day of game time, and the refit module would require occupation until the process is complete, which means that, unfortunately, you can\u0027t keep working on the conversion after you bail Greg out upon the realization you\u0027re \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E actually in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the refit module can\u0027t be used if there\u0027s still fuel in the tank selected, so WWTank has a built-in valve that vents the stored propellant off into space, with accompanying unwanted thrust. A refit module can only be used once, and it\u0027s fairly heavy. You can either launch it with the first vehicle containing the refittable tank, or launch it on another vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGame-wise, it would be fairly simple - right click on the workshop tank you want to convert, hit the \u0022convert\u0022 button, and it grabs the first available refit module and begins the process, shown by a progress bar either on the staging icon or the context menu (not sure if such a thing can happen with the context menu, more research required). Due to technical limitations I don\u0027t know if it would be possible for the process to work when the vessel isn\u0027t active.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plugin work comes tomorrow, though.

So imagine the stock KSP orange tank that can be crewed after being emptied =) Another thing could be a fuel tank that converts into a cargo bay (for example for retrieving debris or satellites)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds like a great compromise for part count. The dry mass of the workshop would be higher than the standard fuel tank and also more expensive (maybe even twice), but you wouldn\u0027t need to carry another module for crewing, also you get a bigger crew space for less launch mass. The bad side is that it can be crewed only when the tank is empty (and possibly can\u0027t be reverted to tank function since it would undergo some interior decoration after being crewed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could also easily use the models you\u0027ve already made, but give them more... less sophisticated sturdier fuel-tanky texture =)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s actually strange that there is no mod that exploits this idea..\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eon how it would work to code:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nothke\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nothke\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...Yes, but an extremely simple one.. Practically,\u003Cp\u003E- when fuel is 0 and button \u0022convert to crew module\u0022 pressed, do CONVERSION, if more than 0, write \u0022unable to convert, there\u0027s still fuel inside\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- on CONVERSION, enable the hatch and crew module and disable the fuel tank module\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with the wet workshops in real life is that they are very complicated to successfully and properly convert to crew spaces, so the idea was always shelved and less risky designs prefered instead..
