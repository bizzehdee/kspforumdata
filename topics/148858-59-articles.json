tools etc, then i went underground and completely dug out the sides to make them both uniform looking and at least two blocks thick on the other side.\u00A0 As part of that project i finished all of the details that had been overlooked sich as replacing stone with stone brick at ground level outside, then dug a perimeter trench 3 blocks deep and put stone brick there to protect the lower concourse from accidental intrusion.\u00A0 Then i added all the torches (from stuff i mined etc myself) underground for uniform lighting to end the continued spawning of hostile mobs down there.\u00A0 I also put torches all over the basement around the redstone works, sealed off tunnels and caves to protect it from hostile mobs (creepers still blew up stuff at that point) and plugged all but one access point (leading to my humble foundry).\u00A0 I took hours to craft clay bricks and glass for the station, and kept pushing for the main shell to be finished.\u00A0 Then on top of that and with sparky, protected and modified the intercity trunk line to keep it safe from water, hostile mobs and careless mining.\u00A0 I am actually not done with it yet, there are some modifications that need to be done such as re-routing it through the old spawn chamber vs having it go around, dropping the whole line by one block, and filling in all the mined out areas in the walls and ceiling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFlorid, you may have indeed started this project, but once you went missing the rest of us adopted it and took it over as a community project.\u00A0 That is a GOOD thing, because if we didn\u0027t care, the station would still look like it was bomed out during a war, there would be water intrustions all over the place, and the line past jeremy\u0027s bridge would not exist.\u00A0 Instead of acting like my girlfiend\u0027s kids over the issue, you didnt even bother to take the time and step back and realize that hello the station building is complete and looks amazing.\u00A0 Hello, the line to the east desert is complete, and is in the middle of a refurbishment project to make it safe and more scenic, and has a terminal station and will have a redstone cart handler system soon.\u00A0 I even decided on having surplus cart storage in chests next to the cart storage units so any imbalance in count can be corrected easily.\u00A0 The line past jeremy\u0027s bridge is 3x3, allowing room to jump so you can travel faster on foot if need be plus it\u0027s more spacious visually.\u00A0 My plan was to make the intercity trunk line 3x3 as well, and simplifying the torch layout to the block row between the tracks so the torches can be freed up to illuminate paradise and sanctuary to keep hostile mobs away.\u00A0 I have more plans too and i can actually mostly do it all by myself thanks to the kind and generous gestures of my fellow players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rail system that you started has grown into the most complex and most amazing team built thing i have seen in minecraft, including any/all videos on youtube.\u00A0 Can\u0027t you take pride in that, vs act all resentful of your fellow players?\u00A0 C\u0027mon dude!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Andy\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am very grateful of other peoples contributions, it is what has made the system what it is today.

How about we make Florid the CEO of our railway project? It\u0027ll still be your project Florid, but a community project at the same time. Win-Win situation! Also can you please make a credit list on your railway map with the people who helped build it? That would be really awesome from you\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, i\u0027m going to be working on the main intercity line for a bit today, then off to put up the glass sides on the eastern trunk line.\u00A0 The goal is to lower the intercity line by one block\u00A0 after it exits the interchange area\u00A0 onto its own right of way all the way to the far side of the lake, as well as straighten the route through the former spawn chamber which will save time and the rails used in the \u0022bypass\u0022 area can be used elsewhere.
