I have an idea for a website, and I have the means to put it all together. It\u0027s a social repository for developers of music, games, programs, videos, literature, art, etc. where everything is free, ad-less, and the point is for people to work together to get the project done, all contribute what they can. Imagine if Kerbal Space Program was created in that way. You would have the founder, the person who came up with the idea. So some amateurs would contribute a little bit of code, make a neat little 2D game. It gets a lot of buzz and so some more experienced developers come and contribute five or six hours of their time into this game, and turn it into a Unity game with plenty of functionality. Later, a person from Sweden steps in while some others are asleep. If the game is popular enough, it would have non-stop development and different ideas being contributed at different speeds and skill levels. All of it would have been done for free, all for credit and for the joy of achieving and accomplishing a game of utter greatness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestion 1. Would you use this service, if it meant you would have to work together to get something accomplished?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestion 2. Would you help chip in your part to make the website, (if you could) even if the only compensation was complete credit? (Of course, people could give the top five contributors some prizes or something, but details, man.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re thinking about stealing this idea, talk to me first. Maybe we can pull this off together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood idea, or not? Any loop holes?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
