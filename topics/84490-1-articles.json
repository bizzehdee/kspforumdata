You\u0027ll find that due to the fact that everyone is able to give and receive reputation points, they can be given for seemingly arbitrary reasons a lot of the time, and may not measure very much of use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can check how many you have by clicking the Settings link at the top-right of the forum, which will take you to a control panel which contains (among other things) the last few reputation points other users have given you, and the last few reputation points you yourself gave to others. Note that giving others reputation points does not diminish your own reputation -- it is not any kind of currency. The amount of rep points you can give to any one user at a time changes a very little depending on how many points you have; this is your Reputation Power, displayed on the Settings page along with your own points and the points you\u0027ve previously given out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow you can get some isn\u0027t always clear. Some people get them because they\u0027re amusing, because of things they create (e.g., mod makers), because they help out other users when needed, and for any number of other reasons, really. Some people get given points partially just because they\u0027re seen as popular already, which can be a bit weird.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"brienne","CreatedById":59216,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-13T19:49:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, sounds clear now^^\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-14T11:13:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a post explaining the system a bit more in depth \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/51861-Forum-feature-highlight-the-reputation-system\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/51861-Forum-feature-highlight-the-reputation-system\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
