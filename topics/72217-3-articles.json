However, it just seems that even from the beginning the objective was always the moon. I suppose now looking back we say the moon race but it seemed pretty evident back then that the goal was the moon. For both programs each objective done in LEO orbit was to achieve the goal of going to the moon. Rendevous, Docking, eva, extended space flight, etc. Each objective accomplished by either the russians or the americans was always towards the goal of getting to the moon. Now as I said before looking back who has the most \u0022firsts\u0022 well I don\u0027t think there is any argument it is the russians. However it just seems that only looking back people are saying the Russians won the space race but at the time when people said \u0022space race\u0022 they always meant landing on the moon. I think when it comes to space flight, exploration, and science there is a huge difference between first and best. I am not saying the American space program isnt peppered with errors, failures, and flaws but it just seems, I could be wrong that NASA to a fault takes the time to test everything over and over again to mitigate the possibility of failure as much as possible. The Russian way was always test a little, launch, see what happens, fix whatever problem next time around. Which in it self, the Russians of have a proper grasp on the meaning of exploration. But half way through the \u0022space race\u0022 the americans because of test after test after test were able to efficiently (pun fully intended) launch ahead of the Russians for the rest of the space race all the way to the moon. However there is certainly something to be said about who has a sustainable program today and who doesn\u0027t, which to me is the clear indicator as to who is currently winning the space race.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-11T02:42:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOnly the Americans were going to the Moon from the start.

Not being first. So they were so interested in getting to the moon first they slammed together a beautiful and interesting looking rocket (the N-1) but in their desperation to be first destroyed 4 of them. Instead they could have took the time and might not have been first but gotten to the moon with a more impressive and efficient rocket and possibly being judged by history of getting to the moon better than the Americans. Im not saying that the American\u0027s didn\u0027t believe in being first but Im talking even after everything was said in done, NASA has always done there best to make sure things get done right the first time. I could be wrong but didn\u0027t the Soviets send 7 or 8 Venera probes only 4 of which completed their intended missions? As I said when it comes to spaceflight and exploration there is a huge difference between being first and doing it right.

Also I wasn\u0027t looking for soviet failures I was just trying to say that the difference between the space programs is that the Russians I suppose have a Kerbal idea of space flight and the Americans are uptight to a fault about getting things done right the first time. If both were to truly combine and really put aside differences and national pride to explore space we could really get stuff done. I think the ISS is a perfect example that we can do extraordinary things together. However even with the ISS there was and still is a rivalry due in large part now to political issues. But a true international space program (which is definitely a dream) could get us into deep space with regular manned trips to other planets sooner rather than later.
