Each Thud puts out 120kn thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow in situation 1 they are all mounted pointing straight back. That means all of the thrust of each engine is pushing the same direction making a total of 480kn thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSituation 2 - all 4 Thuds are angled out by 45 degrees. By basic physics each engine SHOULD be\u00A0pushing straight back with 70kn each and 70kn each pushing toward the center of the rocket. The sideways\u00A0thrust\u00A0should cancel each other out leaving 0kn lateral force and 280kn pushing forward. But when I look at the Delta-V info stack it shows 480 total thrust. Is this forward thrust or is this just the total thrust without accounting for the thrust vectors?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre the angled engines giving me Kerbal Physics 480kn forward thrust or am I getting Collage Physics of 280kn of forward thrust and 280kn of wasted acceleration?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBruce\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-20T05:49:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thrust values for the stock DeltaV panels dont care about direction. just displaying the total thrust, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E indicator doesn\u0027t seem to care about it either.\u00A0 but the DeltaV indicator does.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso 45degrees give the thud 84.9kN forward by my working out from dimly remembered high-school maths, don\u0027t know what they are teaching in college physics\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-20T06:17:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2020 06:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Rhomphaia\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jbdenney","CreatedById":201835,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-20T06:42:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI managed to answer my own question by building a small test rocket and comparing AP for different configurations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are correct with 85.9kN. I was visualizing in my head that 45 degrees was halfway between 0 and 90 so I split the force in half. I forgot that it is \u0022Force times\u00A0sin(45)\u0022 or \u0022Force times\u00A0cos(45)\u0022 depending if you are talking about the X axis or Y axis relative to the angle.
