Been lurking here for a fekkw weeks now, I must say I\u0027m spending rather a lot of time in KSP at the moment.

It seems my navigation is a tad slapdash, will have to send a few more probes yet \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Also building a space station at Minmus, might have to redesign that though due to high part count and poor computer performance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee you on the launchpad!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ettb\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-07T03:57:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep us posted on how those missions go.
