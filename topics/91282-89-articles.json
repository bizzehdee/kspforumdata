Yes, I do need very precise locations of the jammers relative to each other. That would require additional hardware on the relevant ships. I\u0027d go with VHF/UHF interferometers for that. They have wavelength comparable to acoustic, which ought to make positioning juuust right. Variations in water density will \u0022move\u0022 false targets around, but it\u0027s the same effect that it has on sub\u0027s acoustics. That is, if you have density changes in the water, the target can always appear at the slightly wrong bearing than it really is due to refraction. That effect will be unchanged.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith all of that in mind, I don\u0027t need to know where the sub is. The acoustic wave produced by the jammers is almost exactly identical to the wave produced by a single emitter\u00A0if it was at false source\u0027 location. That\u0027s how holography works. Again, I can write out the exact numerical decomposition of the target waveform into waveforms that have to be produced by individual jammers. This is just mathematics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis means that regardless of where the sub is located, the sound will appear to come from a location selected by the system. One that does not correspond to location of any ship in the group. Now, the grid is discrete, and there are only so many ships you can have the jammers running on. That does create limitations. There can be additional \u0022shadows\u0022 showing up in random spots, appearing as additional sources of interference. These are almost guaranteed not to correspond to locations of real ships either, but they are hard to minimize without having a periodic grid of ships. Second problem is that viewed from different angles, the false source location might be slightly different. If you had an entire grid of subs in communication, they would be able to use this to filter out the false locations and resolve true sources of jamming. But that\u0027s fundamentally impossible for the subs without revealing their location.

You want to jam passive and active sonar that may be employed by the sub or incoming torpedoes. The problem with jammers is that even if they can mask everything else, the source of jamming signal is too strong to hide in its own noise. You can always target source of such strong interference. The goal, therefore, is to present strong source points that don\u0027t correspond to physical locations of the ships. You get your all-masking noise, and anyone trying to target the source of the noise will hit nothing but empty space. (A dense grid can produce uniform, omnidirectional noise with nothing to target, but then your ocean surface is basically blanketed with ships, so that makes it kind of pointless.\u00A0XD With discrete points, you have to have \u0022hotspots\u0022 of noise, but they don\u0027t have to match locations of ships.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might also be able to use it for your own detection. The pattern of the jamming noise is known to the source. You can actually use it as active sonar - in theory. I\u0027d have to run numbers to see what the signal-to-noise is going to be like, and whether you can actually use it to look for subs while you\u0027re blinding them. Again, the advantage here is that you have a fleet that uses surface communication to network their jammers and sonars. But yeah, your ability to look for enemy subs is going to be greatly reduced at a minimum, and leaving you blind at the worst. Whether the advantages are worth it might depend on the situation. Can I guarantee detection within periscope range? *shrug* I\u0027ll have to run the numbers.

During cold war, when satellites had limited coverage, it was a different game. Today, any military that can hope to take on a supercarrier is going to know where every single one is at any given minute with sub-meter precision, and ELF has enough data rate to convey that for sure.\u00A0Even though the sub can\u0027t get a GPS reading while submerged, the modern INS is precise enough to keep it within the sort of drift that will still let it put torpedoes within magnetic sensor range of a carrier without needing to see it. So unless you can prevent the sub from receiving data, decoys, jammers, and anything else you might try to throw off the sub is useless. If you allow it within torpedo range, you\u0027ll get hit.

But yes, we could have ended up with a planet with inclined rings, and we didn\u0027t get any. As rare as they might be, some systems out there definitely have them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I\u0027d like to point out that the ring instability argument is absolute hogwash. Rings are very nearly circular, because anything in elliptical orbits will collide with each other. And the only effect on a circular orbit of the tidal forces from the planet is precession, which will be roughly uniform for the entire ring due to self-interaction of the objects comprising the ring (drag). So if you have multiple rings at different radii and inclinations, their relative orientation will change over time, but there is no force bringing rings to alignment with equator. Anyone who studied classical perturbation theory should know that. So again, there is absolutely nothing in orbital mechanics that would prevent stable inclined rings from remaining for a very long time once they are created. Even though initial formation of such rings is far less likely than these in equatorial plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second paper you\u0027ve linked [\u003Ca href=\u0022http://webpages.uidaho.edu/mhedman/papers_published/UNESCO_dynamics.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis one\u003C/a\u003E] covers all of that. Specifically, the only non-periodic effect on inclination is dampening with respect to the plane of prevalent motion. (eq 13) In other words, inclination of particles tends to zero with respect to plane of the ring, not equator. Meaning the rings flatten, but remain otherwise stable in terms of inclination. The orientation of that plane drifts due to planet not being spherical. (eq 19, 20) This tells you that over time, the rings will precess around the planet. Note the R/a term, which tells you that different rings will precess at different rates. However, the damping forces discussed above, will keep each ring group intact. So even if you had just one plane in which rings were originally created, if they were spread over large enough distance, eventually they\u0027ll break down into multiple rings at different orientations, but common inclination angle.

We either assume there\u0027s a reason why such communication is impossible (ECM, destruction of other assets, etc.) or we don\u0027t bother with jamming, decoys, or any other means of throwing torpedoes off course. A sub that can receive a signal from anywhere else will know exact relative location of all relevant targets in the modern world, and the torpedoes can engage on inertial alone until they are in magnetic range.

You can see that they have a special term for drag in the Z direction. The reason for this is quite obvious if you picture this from perspective of an object passing through the rings. The amount of drag will be almost zero for an object passing through along the motion of the objects within. But any object moving perpendicular to the rings will experience significantly more drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll orbital elements are taken with respect to some datum. The choice is somewhat arbitrary, but the moment you break the symmetry, some choices end up much more convenient than others. When dealing with a ring system, taking plane of the ring as part of your datum just makes sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, that particular paper doesn\u0027t really make a distinction, because they essentially restrict the discussion to equatorial rings. The math, however, is exactly the same. So long as you chose Z axis, such that drag in that direction is significantly higher, the inclination will tend to zero in that particular frame of reference. In other words, inclination tends to zero with respect to plane motion in which provides least resistance. Id est, the plane of prevalent motion in that particular band.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re still uncertain, the crucial bit here is that drag has nothing to do with orientation of the planet. We\u0027re talking about drag with respect to environment of the ring, which is governed by initial orbital plane of the debris. You can tilt planet\u0027s axis relative to that any which way, and it doesn\u0027t change the math. The only place where planet\u0027s orientation starts to play a role is in precession as per eqs 19, 20.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-15T01:06:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223467793\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002291282\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221539563787\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257710\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n20 minutes ago, K^2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthen countermeasures are \u003Cstrong\u003Euseless\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere a many things that can hide a ship or group.\u00A0 Long lasting weather for one.\u00A0\u00A0 It is possible, and likely, that a group may take advantage of covering weather that obscures it from satellite detection for some time.\u00A0\u00A0 Plus, there are more... aggressive ways to remove satellite observation from the equation. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd there\u0027s the Prairie Masker system, a sonar \u0027cloaking\u0027 device that is already in service today.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 It doesn\u0027t really jam anything, it just makes the sonar signature look like something the sub would normally ignore.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223467793\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002291282\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221539563787\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257710\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n25 minutes ago, K^2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn order to talk about jamming strategies, we have to be talking in context of the sub relying on them, which precludes communication with outside sources.
