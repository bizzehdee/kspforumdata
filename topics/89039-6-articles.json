I simply know that deaths WILL happen, no matter how careful we try to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrime example, look at what terrorism has done to security. The kind of paranoia in airports and the like is now way out of hand, and we haven\u0027t even seen what the Ebola scare will do to that yet. Shoe bomb? Now everyone has to take off their shoes.

There has never been ONE reported case of poisoning by people who give candy to Trick-or-Treaters. Every such incident involved candy that was poisoned AFTER it had been brought home. And on a similar note. Outdoor play is seen as too dangerous for children.

Now, from any soldier\u0027s perspective, that was an unbelievably successful campaign. That\u0027s a lower casualty rate than any sane General would ever expect. But many were touting those deaths as enough of a reason to call the whole thing off. Compare that to the number of deaths in World War 2, even though it had practically unanimous support in the U.S. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAmerica has been slipping into this mindset where they think that with enough security, safeguards, and rules, they can completely put a stop to accidents and danger. The goal seems to be to create a completely sterile environment where there are absolutely no risks and no surprises. A world where nothing happens that isn\u0027t supposed to. Even scraped knees are too much of a risk now, because of liability lawsuits. I think the only way you could stuff more paranoia into this country, would be by mandating that all porches have steel awnings, to deflect any meteors above that might be waiting to kill the unlucky fool who dares walk out his front door.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, yes, this disaster has tremendous potential to lead to commercial space travel being over-regulated. And not just by politicians, but by rival companies. Sensing an opportunity to prevent any new fledgling competitors from getting their projects off the ground, they aggressively lobby for regulations that make it too expensive for anyone but businesses that are already established in the industry, under the false banner of public safety.
