The two different \u0022normal\u0022 fairing bases could not be found in the tech tree. Instead I only found the old versions of this bases in the tech tree. Because of this I wasn\u0027t able to use the new fairing bases in the VHB.

Is there a convenient way to chance those craft to make them loadable again? The only solution I could think about was to edit all this crafts with the old version of the mod, delete all fairing parts and temporally stick them together without the fairings. After saving and updating the mod the fairings could be recreated by the new mod version. But I would really like to have an easier way to do this because if have some crafts that are using the fairings in a rather complicated way and my solution would be really cumbersome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
