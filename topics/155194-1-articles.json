I have added two habitats modules, along a \u0022pilot module\u0022 and a storage/life support module. I have a few solar panels, but all of them in proportion to the station itself, in other words, they aren\u0027t those huge ones. But as i expand the station, i thought it would be cool to add those really big solar panels. But how? Do i build the whole structure then simply dock it to a free node? or is it better to separate the process in sections (first the central column, with docking ports jrs. along its sides, then adding each solar panel individually by docking it to the column, etc)? What is a good way to add big solar panels and the support structure for you guys?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich bears me to my second question, last night i saw Scott Manley\u0027s solar flare challenge, on which he did a orbital rendezvouz the nasa way. He simple matched his ascent from the launch pad to the targeted vehicle, without having to orbit kerbin first, and do\u00A0hohmann transfer next. Now i\u0027m curious, what is the kerbal math behind this? Is there any good rule of thumb for it?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy third question is a quick one. I have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E mod, and in one of \u00A0my crew exchange missions to my space station, i thought of bringing on a storage compartment big solar panels to be added by the mission specialist on an EVA. Thing is, the solar panel\u0027s volume is around 350. And the maximum volume a kerbal can take is 300. Is there any way around this? Is it possible to manipulate items and structures with volume\u0027s greater than the kerbal top limit?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks !!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-18T15:13:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRe: gigantors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOption 1: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/101928-112-kerbal-inventory-system-kis-1212/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/a\u003E. Probably best. Load them up in a container, send to the station, have an engineer with a screwdriver attach them. Try not to get them floating anywhere - only use \u0022attach\u0022, not \u0022drop\u0022 because chasing them through the void is not fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOption 2: Make a minimalistic dockable module with these panels, dock it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOption 3: Make a normal station module, with whatever features it provides - lab, fuel storage, habitat, whatever - and have it bear the solar panels too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA word of advice: keep them away from docking ports actively used for arriving craft. These things are \u003Cem\u003Efragile\u003C/em\u003E and it\u0027s waaay too easy to botch docking, and break them. Also, keep them in a fairing on ascent, or at least fly in a rather steep trajectory, not too fast. They are easily broken by aero forces, even folded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRe: rendezvous. Wait until \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E is about to pass under the station\u0027s orbit, at a moment when the station is about to fly over the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. Launch into the same inclination, when you arrive into orbit you\u0027ll be really close to rendezvous. There\u0027s no good kerbal math for it (NASA math would work, but trust me, you don\u0027t want to go down that rabbit hole) and \u0022the right moment\u0022 is relatively rare unless you manage your station\u0027s orbit really carefully.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRe: storage. You can move arbitrarily sized (though mass-limited) objects directly from container to attach place - or from one attach place to another. So your engineer floats up to the container (hey, add a Pegasus Mobility Enhancer to the manifest, it\u0027s really much easier to operate from a ladder than floating around, and you can attach the ladder just the same, plus it does fit in the backpack.) Attaches the panel (H) to the container. Floats some way towards where the panel is to go, grabs it (G) and immediately attaches a little way down (H). Repeat as needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternative option: the small \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E box. It has 1000l content and can be worn as a backpack (just drop it into kerbal\u0027s inventory). You cannot access the contents when you carry it - but you can attach it to the station right where you want to work (in one move, from inventory, to surface, attach) and then access it conveniently, or reattach at a different spot if you must work elsewhere. After finished work, (G)rab, drop into inventory, and stow in the big container. Or slap it on the side of the big container and fill with more items.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, remember you can \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E-attach new docking ports \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-18T15:43:07Z\u0022 title=\u002201/18/2017 03:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 18, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-18T15:22:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222925900\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022155194\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221484746422\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022155753\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PayadorPerseguido\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, PayadorPerseguido said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is a good way to add big solar panels and the support structure for you guys?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just have the panels with a decoupler and a klaw on top of some ship that I launch for some other purpose.

I\u0027ll work around those solar panels on a new orbital station i\u0027m planning. The current one, \u0022Karl Sagan Orbital Station\u0022 is just too much of a mess.

Therefore, right before the rocket launch, i select all three of the communications satellites and i select the target at launchpad, ie the munar probe.
