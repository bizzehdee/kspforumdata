Placement of items in the tech tree is a mess, the missions don\u0027t make sense, yadda yadda.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe RO career is named \u0022Realistic Progression 0\u0022\u00A0 -- because making a RO-compatible career is such a large undertaking, RP-0 comes as a separate mod you may install on top of RO. It\u0027s currently not available for 1.1.x.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat out of the way, I\u0027m extremely fond of RP-0 and fully recommend it. It\u0027s also a pretty descent introduction into the countless engine and fuel types (something I found positively overwhelming when trying RO for the first time); if you want to use RP-0 as an RO introduction, I\u0027d suggest to remove TestFlight and Kerbal Construction Time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Norcalplanner","CreatedById":112223,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-29T20:13:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you like Science mode but also like certain aspects of career (like Kerbal experience) simply start a career game with science set to something appropriate below 100%, then set funds at 300% or higher. Science will then be the only effective constraint, but you still get some of career mode goodness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LeuZ","CreatedById":160898,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-01T19:35:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m currently playing a Realism Overhaul career with RP-0 and I highly recommend it. It\u0027s great to get started because you dont have 20 Engines to choose from at the start. Also the progression makes much more sense than in stock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut for the first time trying it I wouldn\u0027t use testflight and I disabled connection delay because I did\u00A0want to do the maneuvers manually rather than using\u00A0flight computer and such. I like to use Kerbal Construction Time because it makes it more realistic if the rockets and new science need actual time. Also the time progression makes more sense. Atherwise you probably would have 60s technologies in the early 50s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt last I recommend picking normal mode or maybe moderate but with part unlocking cost and without reverting flights. Hard mode doesn\u0027t really tolerate much failures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
