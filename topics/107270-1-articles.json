He would eventually survive a peak of more than 46 g, with more than 25 g for 1.1 seconds.[6]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHuman tolerances depend on the magnitude of the g-force, the length of time it is applied, the direction it acts, the location of application, and the posture of the body.[7][8]:350\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe human body is flexible and deformable, particularly the softer tissues. A hard slap on the face may briefly impose hundreds of g locally but not produce any real damage; a constant 16 g for a minute, however, may be deadly. When vibration is experienced, relatively low peak g levels can be severely damaging if they are at the resonance frequency of organs and connective tissues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo some degree, g-tolerance can be trainable, and there is also considerable variation in innate ability between individuals. In addition, some illnesses, particularly cardiovascular problems, reduce g-tolerance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVertical axis g-force\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAircraft pilots (in particular) sustain g-forces along the axis aligned with the spine. This causes significant variation in blood pressure along the length of the subject\u0027s body, which limits the maximum g-forces that can be tolerated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPositive, or \u0022upward\u0022 g, drives blood downward to the feet of a seated or standing person (more naturally, the feet and body may be seen as being driven by the upward force of the floor and seat, upward around the blood). Resistance to positive g varies. A typical person can handle about 5 g0 (49 m/s2) (meaning some people might pass out when riding a higher-g roller coaster, which in some cases exceeds this point) before losing consciousness, but through the combination of special g-suits and efforts to strain muscles\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACboth of which act to force blood back into the brain\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACmodern pilots can typically handle a sustained 9 g0 (88 m/s2) (see High-G training)[citation needed].\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn aircraft particularly, vertical g-forces are often positive (force blood towards the feet and away from the head); this causes problems with the eyes and brain in particular. As positive vertical g-force is progressively increased (such as in a centrifuge) the following symptoms may be experienced:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Grey-out, where the vision loses hue, easily reversible on levelling out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Tunnel vision, where peripheral vision is progressively lost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Blackout, a loss of vision while consciousness is maintained, caused by a lack of blood to the head.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E G-LOC a loss of consciousness (\u0022LOC\u0022 stands for \u0022Loss Of Consciousness\u0022).[9]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Death, if g-forces are not quickly reduced, death can occur.[10]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResistance to \u0022negative\u0022 or \u0022downward\u0022 g, which drives blood to the head, is much lower. This limit is typically in the \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u21222 to \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u21223 g0 (\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u212220 to \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u212229 m/s2) range. This condition is sometimes referred to as red out where vision is figuratively reddened[11] due to the blood laden lower eyelid being pulled into the field of vision[12] Negative g is generally unpleasant and can cause damage. Blood vessels in the eyes or brain may swell or burst under the increased blood pressure, resulting in degraded sight or even blindness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHorizontal axis g-force\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe human body is better at surviving g-forces that are perpendicular to the spine. In general when the acceleration is forwards (subject essentially lying on their back, colloquially known as \u0022eyeballs in\u0022[13]) a much higher tolerance is shown than when the acceleration is backwards (lying on their front, \u0022eyeballs out\u0022) since blood vessels in the retina appear more sensitive in the latter direction[citation needed].\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarly experiments showed that untrained humans were able to tolerate a range of accelerations depending on the time of exposure. This ranged from as much as 20 g for less than 10 seconds, to 10 g for 1 minute, and 6 g for 10 minutes for both eyeballs in and out.[14] These forces were endured with cognitive facilities intact, as subjects were able to perform simple physical and communication tasks. The tests were determined to not cause long or short term harm although tolerance was quite subjective, with only the most motivated non-pilots capable of completing tests.[15] The record for peak experimental horizontal g-force tolerance is held by acceleration pioneer John Stapp, in a series of rocket sled deceleration experiments culminating in a late 1954 test in which he was clocked in a little over a second from a land speed of Mach 0.9. He survived a peak \u0022eyeballs-out\u0022 force of 46.2 times the force of gravity, and more than 25 g for 1.1 seconds, proving that the human body is capable of this. Stapp lived another 45 years to age 89, but suffered lifelong damage to his vision from this last test.[16][not in citation given]\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think many people would be able to put kerbals through so much acceleration without first destroying the ship from reentry heat (which should be fixed so it becomes deathly again).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nothalogh","CreatedById":139345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T23:01:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBack in .90 I ran DRE and FAR, I don\u0027t remember which mod did it, but kerbals would die from G forces\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T23:11:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can put kerbals ubder massive Gs by making a fast plane and turning very sharply.
