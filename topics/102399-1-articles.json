Explore X scales itself up with distance from Kerbin I think but you can skew the generator in favour of higher level general contracts by having high rep (thats what rep is for)"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T03:13:08Z","Content":"Looking back through my saves the mission reward does vary a little from 94,500 upon completion to 124,372 but I don\u0027t think the explore missions have an acceptance deadline so they wont respawn with a different reward value like a parts test contract."},{"CreatedByName":"Telesto","CreatedById":139819,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T05:14:46Z","Content":"Thanks all - I\u0027ll mark this thread as \u0022Answered\u0022? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-22T05:45:00Z\u0022 title=\u002203/22/2015 05:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Telesto**"}]}
