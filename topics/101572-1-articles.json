But what can a given strut really take and how much mass per strut can a given type handle? I tried googling and asked in IRC. Is there any data on mass range per strut for a strut type or realistic impact numbers? I really don\u0027t think your craft would survive a 400m/s landing just because it has those struts under them. The craft would rip apart at the very least.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-09T03:13:42Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2015 03:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Vorg**"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T00:45:31Z","Content":"I don\u0027t know what they can handle but I know I have a damaged strut on a Mun lander that I\u0027ve kept in Munar orbit and that\u0027s only suffered from one slightly hard landing so the threshold for damage isn\u0027t that high."},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T13:14:47Z","Content":"A very good question.

However I think that if you have something attached to the leg and impact at 450/ms/s the connection to the other part will break. I can say from experience that either the heaviest or the second heaviest can survive a ~250m/s impact (with an impact angle of about 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0) on the mun.

Landing struts takes the first hit then sink into ground placing the engines gently onto ground. Well the ship must weight about 600 tons at the start of landing since the fuel got used and 400 when touchdown on duna. Still it just proves that those biggest struts can take quite alot of weight. There was a time where i landed the ship a bit too fast. While struts and engines survived the hit the upper parts of the ship like crew compartments and fuel tanks got separated and everything exploded falling onto ground. After all the commotion stopped the struts and engines were still on the ground as good as new.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T10:12:14Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 10:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by n0xiety**"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T11:08:21Z","Content":"A 400 ton lander?

I refuel there and go for duna land refuel takeoff go for ike for refueling then go either for another planet or return back to kerbin.
