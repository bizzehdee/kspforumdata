Pilot for the mission was Valentina.\n\nIn the first image below, after having landed on Kerbin\u0027s Tundra for the first time, I received no science for a temperature scan ... yet the thermometer registered 286.71\u0027 (?!?). Neither did I receive any science for the Mystery Goo experiment inside.\n\n![qoi4RHk.png](http://i.imgur.com/qoi4RHk.png)\n\nIn the follow images below, same mission, I wasn\u0027t awarded anything for Val\u0027s EVA report, and very little for the surface sample she took. Is that because she\u0027s not a \u0022Scientist\u0022? This is a Science game I\u0027m playing, not a Career game ... does that matter any?\n\n![8kSEH8H.png](http://i.imgur.com/8kSEH8H.png)\n\n![iHi0DlW.png](http://i.imgur.com/iHi0DlW.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"MarkusF","CreatedById":142152,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T03:42:48Z","Content":"Are you sure, you haven\u0027t taken any tundra samples yet? I think the island airfield near KSC contains at least a little tundra area, maybe you collected some samples there?

Something is very weird, as viewing the 6 surface sample reports in the Science Archive says 11.25 science value for Tundra with a remaining 0.02 ... and there\u0027s only one surface sample report logged for Tundra. If I had gathered it elsewhere, even without realizing it, she attained something - that last bit should show as a second entry. There\u0027s also just one EVA report for Tundra, show all science attained.\n\nVery weird stuff going on, especially with the temperature scans too... notice the temperature scan of the Tundra.\n\nI\u0027ve got some other tests I\u0027m going to do.
