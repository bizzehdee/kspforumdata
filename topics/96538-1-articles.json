I have a number of place anywhere RCS ports on an MK2 based plane, plenty of electric charge, and plenty of RCS fuel but RCS doesn\u0027t function. I\u0027ve had KSP to this to me a number of times un-modded, and when this happens I have hyperedit (but I shouldn\u0027t have to). Is there a way to correct this in-flight or does it need to be reverted (been there, done that or hyperedit), a known bug, etc?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT:\u003C/strong\u003E I noticed I have fine control enabled so it may have had something to do with this flight. I have had fine control off in the past, and still had this issue with unresponsive/non-existant RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShip X : Craft File \u003Ca href=\u0022http://2thextreme.org/games/ksp/X.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://2thextreme.org/forum_images/ksp/x.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022x.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMy specs \u0026amp; Mods:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://2thextreme.org/games/ksp/specs.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://2thextreme.org/games/ksp/specs.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
