I played with it a bit and didn\u0027t like it, so I deleted everything and put back my old folders. Despite this, my career save still uses the old configs that I\u0027ve deleted. My sandbox save loads everything fine. So I tried deleting all mods, then loading my save to reset everything back to stock graphics. It worked, so I saved the game, closed it, put back all the mods. After all of this, it\u0027s still using the EVE configs and the textures that I\u0027m trying to get rid of. Is there anything I can try, or is my save broken forever?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
