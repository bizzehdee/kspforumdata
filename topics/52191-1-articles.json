The only issue with the new station was that I had to send it up empty. (Thank you TAC Fuel Balancer. Each of those structural supports on each end is actually a fuel tank) Because of this the station was almost empty of fuel. (Again, thank you TAC for letting me fill all the tanks at the same time with the leftover fuel) So what to do but send a refueling vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/CXLQO\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
