Solid rockets will start the moment you stage them but liquid fuel engines have to be throttled up to produce thrust- this also has the added bonuses of being able to control exactly how much thrust you want and being able to turn it on and off at will, whereas a solid rocket will produce the same amount of thrust until it runs out of fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPress and hold shift to throttle up gradually or Z to go full power; Ctrl reduces throttle (I think that\u0027s the default?) and X sets it to zero.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
