According to the Russian manned spaceflight contractor RKK Energia, the new station must be able to perform the following tasks: large spacecraft assembly, flight tests and launches, creating, servicing and completing inter-orbital tugs, and providing medical and biological conditions required for the rehabilitation of interplanetary expedition crews after their return to Earth orbit.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EIn other words, when ISS\u0027s time will come, Russian modules will be used to assemble a new station - \u003C/span\u003EOrbital Piloted Assembly and Experiment Complex (OPSEK). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think about it?
