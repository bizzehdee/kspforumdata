I had a small spacecraft, and I was practicing touching the separated lower stage with it. Well, while I was doing this, I accidentally engaged the engine and rammed the lower stage, blowing everything to pieces. The capsule survived - but everything got blown off of it, including the parachute.\n\nBut, rather than let the crew die, I decided to mount a rescue mission. I built this rocket, with a leg claw and three parachutes\n\n![5qRfG.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/5qRfG.jpg)\n\nAnd then I made my way to the derelict capsule\n\n![WaX5G.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/WaX5G.jpg)\n\n![K3XaD.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/K3XaD.jpg)\n\n![5pbNw.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/5pbNw.jpg)\n\nOnce I got there, after a lot of failed docks, I finally grabbed the capsule\n\n![Bajsw.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Bajsw.jpg)\n\nHowever, I discovered that the claws didn\\\u0027t actually hold it very well. On my first grab, it just rolled out. So, I got in front of the capsule, and as I grabbed it, I started up the engines on low power, hoping to pin it to the spacecraft.\n\n![81kM9.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/81kM9.jpg)\n\nMiraculously, it worked!\n\n![giRSt.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/giRSt.jpg)\n\n![uWzbt.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/uWzbt.jpg)\n\nI had just enough fuel to slow it down enough to get the parachutes to open and to slow it as it approached the ocean. Most of the spacecraft was destroyed on spashdown, but both capsules survived and all crew made it home safely! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) Needless to say I couldn\\\u0027t believe my plan worked. That was one of the hardest things I\\\u0027ve ever done in a game, but it was a lot of fun."},{"CreatedByName":"Psycho Society","CreatedById":21612,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-05T06:13:36Z","Content":"Fantastic, dude!

I opted for no ASAS to keep the weight as low as possible on the spacecraft, since the whole thing had to splashdown.
