What do you want your station for ? Remember that stations contracts rarely cover the expenses. So you should use you station for a specific purpose (mostly exploration). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDepending on tech you have access, you station might vary a lot. Usually, you would want to have a lander and a return vehicle too. With higher tech you would have some kind of mining capacity. But stations are very efficient to collect science. With a 2000 m/s lander (even less, I don\u0027t recall my early landers), you can strip Minmus for science in 2 or 3 drops. And 4 to 5 for Mun. Your lander might need to be upgraded when you get new science equipment (so you\u0027ll need to send anther one). Managing crew rotation is also a good way to level up kerbals. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I would go to smallest number of tanks. As you usually have to transfer fuel, it\u0027s easier if tanks are big. Those small RCS tanks could be replaced with on bigger one. Usually, you don\u0027t need that much RCS, though. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would recommend to have an antenna, a probe core and few science light weight equipment (gravity, temp, pressure). theses are cheap and you\u0027d be able to quickly do \u0022get science from space around XXXX\u0022 in few seconds even with a uncrewed station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t hesitate to send a big tank of fuel, even if mostly empty.
