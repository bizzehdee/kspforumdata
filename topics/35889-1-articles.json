This can be tested by making a basic lander, launching it say... 50 meters into the air, and then letting it freefall back to Kerbin. If you do this with 4 of the heavy lander legs on your craft you\u0027ll notice the legs break, subsequently breaking everything else on your craft. But then if you run this same exact test with 8 of the heavy lander legs, you will see all the legs hold and cause the craft to bounce off the ground for a second and then safely land. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe exact height for 4 legs breaking and 8 legs holding may not be 50 meters, but you get the idea. This translates to helping with bumpy or hard landings on other planets and satellites.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
