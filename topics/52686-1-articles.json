Top priority is a manned module/capsule, THEN a probe body, THEN a manned chair. If there\u0027s a capsule and chair but no probe body, the empty capsule will get command authority every time. I suspect that might have something to do with why a command chair isn\u0027t considered eligible as a root part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T01:12:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, trial and error. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Eve lifter did facing the same issues as the OP suggested. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy solutionl, I just repeatedly move the command chair (At VAB), so, when a Kerbalnaunt seat on it.
