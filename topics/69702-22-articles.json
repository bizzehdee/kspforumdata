So I set about starting over. I went to a new install. I then went and installed each of the Renaissance dependencies one by one, and used their .24 versions if they were out yet. Once I had those installed I ran the game and it ran. Then I installed the Renaissance mod and the game crashes. Hard. I cannot see this as a coincidence. It is possible that it is conflicting with some of the new mods. I absolutely ADORE this mod. It made it a NEW GAME for me. I hope that a .24 version is in the works, but until then I will have to content myself with the less beautiful look. Sadly I can\u0027t attach my crash report, but I will save it.
