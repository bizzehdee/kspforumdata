Parts can also heat up from heat being conducted from other parts.. The big spaceplane parts have a huge thermal mass and while they generate a lot of heat, they also radiate it pretty well. I haven\u0027t looked at the actual numbers, but I suspect that some of those parts - particularly ones inside bays - aren\u0027t able to radiate it away quite as well, so they build up conducted heat from the attached parts but don\u0027t really get rid of it very well. I\u0027ve complained of the same thing happening to command pods and batteries in service and/or cargo bays.\n\nWith the new radiator parts and skin/core temperatures, the thermal mechanics are obviously still a work in progress. Hopefully the guys will have it sorted out shortly.. it seems better in 1.0.3 than it was previously, but still a bit of a problem. I\u0027d suggest mucking about with radiators in the meantime, and try to avoid hooking straight up to parts that generate a lot of heat, maybe put some rads there to wick away some of the heat before it gets to those critical components."},{"CreatedByName":"Empiro","CreatedById":112072,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T02:53:00Z","Content":"I think it\u0027s still likely to be an odd bug of sorts.

That should reduce (or eliminate) those stresses. Also, launch clamps to be able to fire up the rockets without moving your craft. If it still happens, that\u0027s one less possibility.

I had my payload module assembly attached via docking ports under a long aero fairing.\n\nAt some point between MECO and circulization, the docking port attached to the nose of the lifter would overheat and explode, whether or not I had ejected the aero shell. Monitoring heat in debug showed a normal amount of heat in the ports (about 210) and normal heat flow through them (-65.) However, I happened to catch it just before it exploded. The heat suddenly dropped to zero, then cycled rapidly between 0 and over 4000 for about 1 second before it blew.\n\nThe way it cycled rapidly between 0 and 4000\u002B like that has to be a bug, as it\u0027s way outside the normal range. It\u0027s not the heat creep you get when you are adding heat faster than it can escape.\n\nMy time scale was 1 at that point.\n\nI fixed the problem by removing the exploding port in the VAB, and attaching the payload port directly to the nose of my lifter. Still decouples just fine, so it was redundant anyway."}]}
