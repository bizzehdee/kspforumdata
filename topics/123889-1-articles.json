I am a bit annoyed that Kerbals usually tend to fall and die when going EVA. Because they fail to grasp the ladder. That behavior is totally random.

I\u0027ve had Kerbals just sort of pop off during EVA in orbit and I didn\u0027t know what I did. I think the grabbing issue comes into play on lower gravity bodies where they tend to hop as opposed to walk.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nothalogh","CreatedById":139345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-30T23:28:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Snark\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Snark\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve never had a problem with them \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Egrabbing\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E the ladder... though they do have the annoying tendency to \u0022creep\u0022 while they\u0027re on a ladder.
