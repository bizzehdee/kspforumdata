Want to go to orbit, just burn straight up, right!? Trying to rendezvous and dock, and need to catch up to the target vessel. Simple, open the throttle \u0027til we catch it up! I\u0027m not saying we\u0027ve all made these particular mistakes, but I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll understand the point I am making. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I was struggling at the beginning of my Kerbal adventure, I wasn\u0027t sure if my failures were down to ship design, or piloting error. I have no doubt that there were times when it was a bit of both, but it made it difficult to know what to adjust in order to improve. The scenarios that I have come up with put a number of craft in different positions that will allow the player to practise various aspects of flight in the local system, knowing that if they fail it\u0027s down to them as a pilot, rather than the craft not being up to the task.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese scenarios aren\u0027t designed to try and teach someone how to complete a particular task, there are plenty of tutorials out there for that. They are designed to give you craft set up for a particular situation, and which are capable of meeting the requirements of that situation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe scenarios\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EFlight Practise (BASIC)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncludes :-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESimple jet on runway, for anyone wanting to practise flying airplanes\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ELander orbiting Minmus, because Minmus is the easiest of the two moons to land on, and a good place to practise your first landings\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOrbiter on launch pad, for anyone struggling to make a simple craft capable of reaching orbit\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDocker in close proximity to target satellite.

If you are feeling really confident, you could try docking with the Station to refuel before returning\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMun mission. Two stages to get to orbit. Extract the LEM from the lift stage, so close docking skills required. Insert to Mun and EVA to transfer crew from CSM to LEM. Land on Mun. Time your launch to intercept and rendezvous with the CSM to get the crew home. Again, fuel is tight in most of the stages, so you can\u0027t afford to be wasteful.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft in the early scenarios are designed to have plenty of fuel for the task in hand, so as not to be difficult to fly. In fact the landers in orbit around Mun and Minmus have more than enough to return to Kerbin after landing on their respective bodies. I am hoping that by using these scenarios for practise, it will enable a player to build up the confidence in their abilites to start looking towards flights to bodies outside the Kerbin system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo use these scenarios, download them to your Kerbal/KSP_winxx/saves/scenarios folder. When you start the game, they will appear in the Scenarios option. At any time, the position of the craft can be reset by selecting the restart option. Very useful if you have been practising your Mun landings and then want to have a go at the docking option, only to find that the two docking craft have drifted apart. Restarting the scenario will put everything back to where it was.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScenario Downloads:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/3b08ddqt9vlra1i/Flight%20Practise%20%28BASIC%29.sfs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFlight Practise (BASIC)\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/s1did5l0nsj8hg5/Flight%20Practise%20%28INTER%29.sfs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFlight Practise (INTER)\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/u38f11u30bptj1r/Flight%20Practise%20%28ADVANCED%29.sfs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFlight Practise (ADVANCED)\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/4gibz6zmhupnxgm/Flight%20Practise%20%28EXPERT%29.sfs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFlight Practise (EXPERT)\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-18T23:16:09Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2014 11:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Scarecrow88\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Webferret","CreatedById":93189,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-20T00:24:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks downloaded and trying them out.
