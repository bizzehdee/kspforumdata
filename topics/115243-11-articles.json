Mechjeb. \n\nThough I still play without it. I play stock for a several months after a major update. Even long after MJ updates and a lot of mods ill play stock. Its a good practice. I find it refreshes your appreciation for all mods ten fold, especially MechJeb. Not to mention keeps your piloting skills sharp because often times mechjebs an idiot and I have to take over."},{"CreatedByName":"TKO","CreatedById":20719,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T03:59:29Z","Content":"I\u0027m pro-mechjeb. MechJeb is awesome. Most of my use of it is just information-displays. I don\u0027t rely on it, but there is many an hour I would have lost to boredom in KSP without it: I make planes and fly them around Kerbin looking for points of interest and occasionally deploying a rover. Is it cheating not to want to press up-arrow, up-arrow, up-arrow, for half an hour while it flies there? SAS doesn\u0027t take the curvature or Kerbin into account, so that you\u0027d have to monitor and adjust too. \n\nPeople who don\u0027t want to use it, that\u0027s just fine. People who don\u0027t want to use it, and want to label others that use it as cheats .. they just need to get over themselves. I\u0027ve been to the moons and back many many times over the years, manually. And now the physics model has changed, I\u0027ve done them many more times, manually again.

The only thing \u0022cheaty\u0022 about it is that I don\u0027t have to babysit every single one of my burns or constantly make manual course corrections with stock SAS. To me, MJ represents several utility mods wrapped up in one (KER, Precise Node, Trajectories) plus better stability control.
