As far as I can tell, there\u0027s two options:\n\n1. Spam screenshot button, find a program online to put it together\n\n2. Record with some video device, then find a program to convert it to a GIF\n\nMy question, really, is what is the best way to go about it? I\u0027d prefer it to be as high-quality as possible.\n\nThanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"RogueMason","CreatedById":45069,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T18:22:12Z","Content":"Give [GifCam](http://blog.bahraniapps.com/gifcam/) a shot, it\u0027s really easy to use and seems to be high quality.
