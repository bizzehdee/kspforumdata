I was thinking that the best guess as to how they will do it is you get something on the ground with a bunch of resources and a special module that allows you to go into \u0022Colony Building Mode\u0022 wherever you have landed. Then I imagine they just put a camera above that module that you can treat like a camera in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and start building your colony like you would a craft in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E except you are outside on whatever celestial body you landed on. I think this would be a good system at it\u0027s base and makes sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy concern however, is that I don\u0027t want the colony building process to feel too\u00A0 \u0022God-like\u0022 if that makes sense. It doesn\u0027t make sense for a colony to essentially spawn there instantly after I build it, especially if I built some massive colony with many different buildings ect. It wouldn\u0027t feel like the massive accomplishment that it should feel like, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E gets away with it because the building feels like it is separate from the rest of the game. once you finish your craft you get it onto the launchpad or runway and the process seems like there is an implied amount of work that the Kerbals went through to get it there. That\u0027s why in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E you can see the Kerbals on the ground doing \u0022work\u0022 and get an atmosphere that they are actually putting together your design (even if it isn\u0027t seen explicitly).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor colony building, there are a couple things that the devs could do to avoid this feeling. They could make the colony building process more of a colony designing process, that once you exit the build, you see Kerbals build what you just designed from the ground up. They could either do this in a quick animation or in a long period of time (maybe weeks/months depending on size of colony) where the player can time-warp past to see the finished result.\u00A0 This would give the opportunity to put fun little details of Kerbals working in a kerbal way to build the colony when the player is watching it in real time. There could also be a functionality that based on how many kerbals you have with you to build the colonies, the animation could be faster or slower, this would give players incentive to bring massive \u0022colony builder\u0022 ships to their build site so they can waste no time! I feel like getting to add those details will give the game a little bit more polish that the community is looking for and give the feeling of accomplishment of something big and new. This would also pay dividends once multiplayer comes out! The devs have talked about how players will not be on the same timeline unless they decide to \u0022sync-up\u0022 for in person interactions. I think it would be so cool to go to some celestial body and to see that your friend\u0027s Kerbals are in the middle of building his colony instead of it just suddenly being there from one moment to the next.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do see how some players would see this as just annoying though, they might say that it just is an extra waste of time before getting to actually use the colony. I think this is a fair assessment and I think a solution that doesn\u0027t use week-long animations could be having a quick animation every time you put down/remove a part/building/road when building colonies. It would differ from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, instead of just some sparks that imply welding and such it could be a sped up animation of Kerbals building the colonies. Having an animation for each part of the colony will still give you the feeling of it being a massive effort of the Kerbals without it taking a while for the player to enjoy their spoils.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope others can see my vision, I just dont want something so big to feel like such low effort in game. Please give your opinions and hopefully the devs have something good cooking up for us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg

This doesn\u2019t make total sense because a player could just go into sandbox mode if they want to play without worrying about resources.
