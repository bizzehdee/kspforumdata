But then the fact they got put on \u003Cem\u003EHVAC systems\u003C/em\u003E and then no one blinked or bothered to verify that they knew what they were doing and that wasnt even the point of them being there? (it would\u0027ve been a very uncomfortable plot point but it was really uncomfy to me, they could\u0027ve done like end of episode, the boss yelling at them with muted audio and music playing then had the next episode them in the bar venting about how they got found out and are now stuck with diagnostics bc of their contract keeping them on mars or something)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe backpeddling of the character progression i didn\u0027t like was mostly surrounding Ed, and Danielle.

Margo to come full circle and finding themselves in a similar position to their mentor, repeating the cycle was so beautiful too.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEd though, just blatently ignored all past development and was just painfully uncomfortable. Most of their decisions made sense if it was another clone of their personality before growth, but for them it felt like they\u0027d not want to do that anymore. but now remembering his contraband, it kinda makes sense now? but hiding their shaking for so long and that 0 people said anything the whole time was unbelievably uncomfortable\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe grabber being made of nothing but struts made me so uncomfortable though. I get why, (highly important to the plot and helped establish the atmosphere for the season of mistakes by corner cutting/oversight that comes with the numerous moving parts of m7 alliance [too many cooks and all that] ) but it should\u0027ve been like a demigorgon mouth kinda thing\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe bandwidth plot was hilarious, i laughed vry hard about it. it also kinda helped put into a decent metaphore/analogy/tip of the iceberg example of how things were happening at mars now\u003Cbr\u003E\nalso the sealed off levels that were just unused was so feature creep/overscope/solving a problem that doesnt exist, that made so much sense ahahaha i loved it so much\u003Cbr\u003E\nI feel like in that situation though, they would\u0027ve just made use of them as recreation places, or storage, rather than leaving them empty. with the bandwidth issues it kinda makes sense though? maybe their hvac/power/water distribution isnt equiped to handle those levels and that\u0027s why they\u0027re so empty?
