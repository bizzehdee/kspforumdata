I am seeing a map at least similar to your when I select Karbonite.\u003Cp\u003EThe problem it appeared was that I had the \u0022Resource\u0022 button clicked but no actual resources selected. Once I clicked the Karbonite button, I started seeing concentration maps. So I think I\u0027m good, just have to remember to go one menu deeper whenever things don\u0027t look right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you have all resource cutoffs at 0%. I can\u0027t do that. In my game, at least one value must be 1% or higher. I highlight the \u00221\u0022 in Karbonite and type \u00220\u0022 and nothing happens. If I instead type \u00222\u0022 it changes to 2% cutoff. If I change another value from 0 to 1, I can chagne that value back to 0 but the original value I cannot change back. Ever seen that one before?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd before you think I\u0027m picking apart your mod, I\u0027ll tell you I nailed a landing in a relatively abundant area on Mun with ease today, and it was quite fun to use the overlay in both the planning and execution phases of the landing.

Well, your thanks should go mostly to the awesome Cyrik, who made the mod. I\u0027m just the guy who switched to Regolith and is keeping the show running in the event Cyrik shows back up. I am tinkering with some improvements to the display options. Mostly right now the exponential and logrithmic plots aren\u0027t very useful.

I\u0027d argue we had a pretty good map of the Earth prior to our space program. For other planets, filling out the map would either require exploration/scanning or bold adventures into the unknown. Both would add challenge for hardcore player. This mod as it currently exists isn\u0027t well suited for this, but it could be adapted. This one works by putting an overlay over the surface of the planet (in some cases mountains \u0027peak\u0027 over the overlay).\u003Cp\u003E@goldenpsp is on the right track that I think enough would change to make it a new mod on its own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI too think it\u0027s intriguing, but I have the feeling nobody has much interest in it, which is odd given how much people are obsessed with realism in this game \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI posted here mainly because I thought a black overlay could have been created to obscure the surface, or something like that, I don\u0027t really know how much liberty gives KSP when comes to modding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Echanging the planet\u0027s texture seems a better way to aproach it, but I am not sure it can be updated in \u0022real-time\u0022 while the satellite is scanning\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif the OP thinks I\u0027m derailing the thread just give me a word and I\u0027ll stop bothering you \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-08T08:25:26Z\u0022 title=\u002201/08/2015 08:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sigma88\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"a__gun","CreatedById":83859,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-27T17:17:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk I\u0027m sure this will of been covered but I\u0027ve tried searching the thread and can\u0027t find it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this meant to display in the flight scene...?
