If you\u0027re interested, I have quite a bit of software project management experience, and I\u0027m absolutely willing to help out as a project manager to take some of the load off of y\u0027all\u0027s backs. I can help with things like: roadmapping what needs to be done next; assigning tasks to whoever\u0027s available; streamlining and simplifying versions and releases; keeping track of bugs; and maybe even some of the community-facing support. Overall just keeping things organized so you guys don\u0027t have to keep track of it all and can focus on doing what you love most.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003ESend me a PM if you\u0027d like to talk more, I\u0027m eager to help in any way I can!\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"}]}
