The concept of the SSTO is to use the Turbo Jet engine to get close to orbital velocity and then use the rockets to push your craft into orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Turbo Jets are very efficient compared to rocket engines so you want to use them as long as possible in the assent. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I after \u002B30 tries (probably closer to 50) I managed to gleam a few design ideas and some better practices. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to start we need to go the Space Plane Hanger. SSTO design is a series of trade-offs: takeoff, normal flying, hyper-sonic flight, orbital insertion, reentry, and successful landing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough harder to design and fly, SSTO are more efficient (fuel-wise), have no debris, and completely reusable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesign (Duct tape and Bailing wire):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s start with a simple plane.

Over many failed tries, I found that all of them need close or in a horizontal line, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewith the center of mass and lift very close. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/901005107644201578/7E920E37728F1E0E7DC0BE919E91DEE8F2830469/\u0022 alt=\u00227E920E37728F1E0E7DC0BE919E91DEE8F2830469\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlacement is key; if the COL is back of the COM the craft will be nose heavy, and if the COM is behind the COL then will be tail heavy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe difference of height between COL and the COM will show how much or little of lift your plane has. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s best to have the COL above the COM. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe COT needs to be in line with the COM.

The more wobble in your wings the harder to accelerate down the runway without the plane veering off. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse struts to stiffen your craft\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s wings. I found that it makes a big difference when taking off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou want to make sure your plane has enough thrust with the jet engines. Pinolallos suggests 1 Turbo Jet for every 10 tons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use a ratio of 1 Turbo Jet to 8 tons myself. Still you need a lot of thrust to takeoff and go hypersonic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use forward canards for pitch control and two (2) or more winglets for yaw control. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the most effect, place control surfaces away from the COM/COL. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make sure your plane has fuel lines to any engine away from the fuselage so you can control how fuel is routed to them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis can prove useful in later phases of the flight (i.e. reentry).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can modify the ram intakes to increase air flow. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/KgBes5H\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/KgBes5H\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding gear should be placed in a triangle pattern will the point at the front. There is generally less mass there so you don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t need as much support. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith heaver planes you might want to double up the back gear. When taking off the plane will pivot up on the back gear so make sure there is clearance for your engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETip#1: To enhance your takeoff, have the back landing gear shorter than your front gear. That way your wings have a small positive angle of attack making takeoff easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake Off (run run Run, Jump!!):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake off is one of the easier phases of flight because it is so simple: Activate your ASAS, (if hot keyed) activate the engines, and throttle up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might need to tap your yaw keys (\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153A\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 or \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153W\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2) to keep you straight as your craft accelerates down the runway. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you feel you are fast enough then tap to pitch key (\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153W\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2) up to gain some altitude. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETip #2: If you are having difficulty taking off for lack of lift. Toggle your rockets with a command key (say #5) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand use the toggle to give your plane a burst of rocket thrust for a few of seconds (3-10 sec) to get airborne.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlight/Hyper-Sonic/Orbital (flapping, flapping faster, Heave Ho!!):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour craft is in the air, now to get into space. After the plane clears the runway and is few hundred meters up, put your craft into a step climb around 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA. Keep that angle of attack (AOA) until you reach 20,000m. With most of the air below your plane, is now time to be fast. Your plane should be already traveling over 400m/s already now and need get close to orbital speeds. So pitch down so you AOA are around 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA and your craft is slowly ascending.
