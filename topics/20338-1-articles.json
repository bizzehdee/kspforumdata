ATM, it is tied up in keeping the craft on a straight course. Takeoff is difficult and it didn\u0027t land well, but that\u0027s all part of the learning process!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUPDATE - wow, this is easier than I thought.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe aircraft is now fairly easy to fly (wingtip rudders added), and has even landed semi-successfully (sans the outboard port wing). Work will continue after I get home from work at 000 CDT (GMT- 6). This has the possibility to be a VERY fun aircraft. It has good lift, a comfortable stall speed, and (aside from needing constant port rudder) fairly forgiving controls. During takeoff and landing the port-mounted engine is VERY noticeable, though- landing works best as an unpowered glide, but there is enough lift to manage that well. During takeoff, she will always yaw to starboard uncontrollably... but don\u0027t let that grass worry you, she\u0027s rough field capable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUPDATE 2 - Squeezed in a little more tweaking before work. I like this little ship a lot; it now flies well and predictably, but those yaw-induced starboard turns will give you fits the first few times. Turn on SAS, keep your speed low if you are near the ground, and be ready to glide in for landings!

There were also fighter.bomber and jet divebomber designs offered, but none were picked up by the Luftwaffe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote- my design suffers more from the yaw effects because of the jet engine. The BV 141 had the tail section behind the piston engine and thus had more of the control forces centered around the line of thrust of the aircraft. My design (due to the limits of KSP parts) was unable to duplicate this, so my design has to compensate for the thrust rather than simply deal with the weights being off-balance. ATM, it requires a lot of rudder involvement to do that, and the design suffers as a result. I will continue to refine the design in coming days and produce new aircraft- but I gotta get to work now. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
