Previously I had some rather strong and noisy AO bakes that added a bit of grunge to stuff, but with the new rendering the AO is much subdued;  along with a thin-layer of universal dust, a slightly stronger layer of AO-based dust/dirt also helps things look much more connected.  Might even be something resembling some scratches and dings showing up in the textures (though certainly not to the extent seen in stock textures).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 12 hours ago, vossiewulf said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Confused about the text comment though, as I remember putting arbitrary text on my SP models and I didn\u0027t bring in any special filters, there are fonts in the alphas part of the shelf. I might have had to do it letter by letter, that what you mean?\n\u003E \n\nI actually did find some text tools in one of the folders eventually (after I had made the comment / already made my multi-font-capable text setup).  I think they were under Alphas?   So yes, apparently some text-tools do exist in SP now, my original statement was in error.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 12 hours ago, vossiewulf said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Also I was wondering why I don\u0027t see more people using [GMAX](https://www.turbosquid.com/gmax), it\u0027s 10 years old now but you know how much has changed in the core modeling functions of MAX in the last 10 years?\n\u003E \n\nProbably, mostly, lack of advertisement?  The first time I had heard of it was when you mentioned it in one of our conversations.  Apparently the only way to get it anymore is from TurboSquid, and it is entirely unsupported, and undocumented.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 12 hours ago, vossiewulf said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Everything you\u0027re saying about your CM is right on track. The tape is a bit too obvious but you\u0027re correct that KSP is the actual standard and you have to work to the results you see there.\n\u003E \n\nYeah, I\u0027ve removed the normals from the tape seams entirely (they were already at the lowest difference that the height-map can support), as well as reducing the normal intensity for the warp and wrinkle.  I left in place a bit of roughness/metallic/diffuse on the tape-seams though.  As a result they are nearly invisible except for under certain lighting and view angles -- which is about right.  Regardless of angle, they disappear entirely when zoomed out past a certain point... which is exactly what I was going for.\n\nI also did adjust the coloring on the heat-shield a bit, brought it to much closer to the color swatch you had posted.  Less brown, more red, slightly less saturated. (can be seen a tiny bit in the last pic I posted).  Have one more pass to do on the SM, as the metal for the body is still not quite right (that SM is... HARD... to figure out; such complex lighting results from a seemingly simple material setup).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-11-10T15:25:37Z\u0022 title=\u002211/10/2017 03:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 10, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-10T17:34:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, Temeter said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Come on, lets not overdo it.\n\u003E \n\nMage knows to take all my rambling with a ~~grain~~ ton of salt!"},{"CreatedByName":"Julien Kerman","CreatedById":176209,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-10T18:39:53Z","Content":"Can we get a Raptor engine (cluster) ?"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-10T22:37:52Z","Content":"Hmm... thoughts on the name for the upcoming stand-alone shader utility mod?\n\n**Textures Unlimited**\n\nAs it is much more than just a shader-pack, and encompasses quite a bit of texture-related functionality.
