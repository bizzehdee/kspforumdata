Now, there is only one input mapping for pitch, yaw, roll and linear translations, and the docking mode mapping is done using the secondary key bindings and a new state toggling system which is simpler and more flexible than the old way. So much more flexible, in fact, that you can now use docking mode as an alternate control scheme in any way you want. Rather use it to swap about yaw and roll inputs for controlling rockets and spaceplanes with a joystick? Now you can. Also, Axis bindings now also have secondary mappings of their own, so you can have a second axis bound to each action, either as a redundancy or with a different set of UI mode toggles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMarco (Samssonart):\u003C/strong\u003E The final conclusion we drew from the survey is that some people think the docking UI mode is basically useless, but we still haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t decided what we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re going to do about it, other than gather more intel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe docking mode UI is confusing because it changes the behavior of keys that we are all comfortable using.

Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere begins and ends far too abruptly when reentering or launching. The same holds true for all of the planets.

Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere begins and ends far too abruptly when reentering or launching. The same holds true for all of the planets. When factoring in reentry heating especially on these tiny planets, they\u0027re probably going to have to exaggerate heating rates a bit such that heating will start as abruptly as the atmosphere\u0027s boundary is abrupt. It\u0027s better if the atmosphere doesn\u0027t cut off so abruptly and that\u0027s not something that\u0027s possible with the legacy atmosphere system.

I think there\u0027s a limit to how far Squad can reasonably go on that, in that an orbit within the atmosphere needs to decay quickly otherwise the player is left w a i t i n g for it to deorbit.\u003Cp\u003EAlso, in Deadly Re-entry I haven\u0027t noticed heating starting abruptly on entering the atmosphere, so I question if that\u0027s really a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd above all else, if Squad \u003Cem\u003Edid\u003C/em\u003E want to extend the atmospheres to lower pressures, it would be trivial to change the one number that defines surface pressure:edge of atmosphere pressure ratio. It would be a step away from trivial to throw in a basic exponential pressure decay into the pressureCurve system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m just not sure adding fine details of temperature and pressure when the basic aerodynamic model isn\u0027t even fully sorted out and there are tons of more significant things that could be worked on is the best use of Squad\u0027s development time. I don\u0027t want KSP to be wilfully unrealistic, but it really doesn\u0027t need every fine trivial detail either.
