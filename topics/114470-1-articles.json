Both are unrealistic, and realistically, the kind of exotic engine technology that might give you that kind of thrust would probably use antimatter or some really powerful fusion. By the time humanity develops such an engine, we probably won\u0027t need human bodies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, suppose you had a centrifuge wheel near the front of the spacecraft, per the Discovery 2, NASA\u0027s paper study of a fusion powered spacecraft. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20050160960.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20050160960.pdf\u003C/a\u003E On page 3. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, could you mount the decking inside the habitat floors on tracks, so you could angle the floor a little bit? The idea is, the vector sum of the centrifugal force and the thrust from the engine would sum to a vector that would be normal to the floor, so the crew could walk around on a \u0022flat\u0022 surface. The hatchways between sections would have to be circular since the whole floor rotates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, there\u0027d be a variety of wiring and plumbing problems this would cause - all the links between the decking and the underfloor wiring and plumbing network would have to be on flexible hoses. Very much doable, especially compared to the engineering challenge of a working extreme thrust fusion or nuclear salt water engine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe floor would be limited to canting just a few degrees from it\u0027s normal horizontal position - if your engine had variable thrust modes that tradeoff thrust for ISP, you\u0027d cant the floor differently depending on the burn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould this work?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T18:56:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you can deal with wiring, plumbing and other stuff you mention, then yes.
