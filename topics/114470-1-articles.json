Both are unrealistic, and realistically, the kind of exotic engine technology that might give you that kind of thrust would probably use antimatter or some really powerful fusion. By the time humanity develops such an engine, we probably won\u0027t need human bodies.\n\nAnyways, suppose you had a centrifuge wheel near the front of the spacecraft, per the Discovery 2, NASA\u0027s paper study of a fusion powered spacecraft. [http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20050160960.pdf](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20050160960.pdf) On page 3. \n\nAnyways, could you mount the decking inside the habitat floors on tracks, so you could angle the floor a little bit? The idea is, the vector sum of the centrifugal force and the thrust from the engine would sum to a vector that would be normal to the floor, so the crew could walk around on a \u0022flat\u0022 surface. The hatchways between sections would have to be circular since the whole floor rotates.\n\nOf course, there\u0027d be a variety of wiring and plumbing problems this would cause - all the links between the decking and the underfloor wiring and plumbing network would have to be on flexible hoses. Very much doable, especially compared to the engineering challenge of a working extreme thrust fusion or nuclear salt water engine. \n\nThe floor would be limited to canting just a few degrees from it\u0027s normal horizontal position - if your engine had variable thrust modes that tradeoff thrust for ISP, you\u0027d cant the floor differently depending on the burn. \n\nWould this work?"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T18:56:33Z","Content":"If you can deal with wiring, plumbing and other stuff you mention, then yes.

Though, I wonder at it\u0027s utility at that size. I\u0027m not sure how disorienting a sustained 4.2 rpm is on the average human\u0027s equilibrium. Plus, by my calculations, a person at the 1g section would experience about 1.12g\u0027s walking with the rotation, and about 0.88g\u0027s walking against it with average walking speed, more than a 25% variation. Not sure how difficult that would be to deal with.

You need enough gravity to send the fluid in your sinuses back to your heart, to make healing from wounds and surgery more like on earth, to make it possible to walk at a decent speed, to be able to take a shower normally, etc. 1/3 G might be enough for all this.\n\nThis is important because it keeps the minimum diameter of the centrifuge wheel down, so you can build a smaller ship with a lighter crew compartment. Of course, we don\u0027t know if 1/3 G is enough - a full G may be the only adequate level of gravity, even with exercise.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-01T03:30:51Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2015 03:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SomeGuy12**"},{"CreatedByName":"prophet_01","CreatedById":111502,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T13:08:03Z","Content":"Yeah.
