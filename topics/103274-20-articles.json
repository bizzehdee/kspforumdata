C#/mono is a garbage-collected language so that the developer doesn\u0027t have to manually de-allocate memory, but they still have to kill any reference to it (basically, gc is useless), or it will hang around in memory forever.\u003Cp\u003ESince the memory is listed as \u0027allocated\u0027 still, it can\u0027t be used for any other purpose. Thus, you\u0027ll eventually run out of available memory (even in 64-bit systems, it would just take longer).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy far the biggest source of crashes in current KSP (0.90) is the out-of-memory crash. Getting rid of any memory leaks would greatly reduce the occurrences of such crashes (especially in a pure-stock install), which in turn would bring the total number of crashes down enormously (for my own KSP, they account for like 85%-ish of the crashes. Maybe 90%?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, if it turns out that Unity is causing a significant percentage of the leaks, the effect of Squad\u0027s fixups will have that as a ceiling.
