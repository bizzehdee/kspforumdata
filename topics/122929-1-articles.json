Just climb at 25 - 30 degrees until you hit 10k, break mach, climb again to 20k, build speed until you top out at 1400\u002B. Once you\u0027ve reached the airbreathing limit, toggle one pair of rapiers, and fire the nuke if you want, and push to orbit. The oxidizer should be enough to kick your apoapsis up out of the atmosphere, and you can use the nuke to circularize. Once there, you should have plenty of liquid fuel left over to top off the orbital section. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a full orbital module, you have about 4,500 delta V to play with, and a lander capable of putting down on most non-atmospheric bodies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalx.com/drewscriver/Alaflux-Beta-mk1n\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDownload link\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy flying!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Drewscriver\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-22T10:26:15Z\u0022 title=\u002210/22/2015 10:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by drewscriver\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-20T20:49:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, my SSTO flying skills never existed, but that looks awesome!

You have to keep in mind that KSP\u0027s crafts are built using a tree structure - you can\u0027t just build off of multiple docking ports and strut them together. As soon as the root part disconnects, the struts to the disconnected piece will also break, the same as struts break off of sections when you stage them away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the Alaflux Beta, I sidestep this problem by making sure that each craft section has only one root node. This is why I have the awkward clampotron jr. docking port assembly on the top - I needed something centered that I could use as the root for the Aero section. Since the entire back of the craft is built off of just that single part, I can strut the child parts together and nothing breaks when I undock. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you check, you\u0027ll see that the normal size clampotrons are not actually attached in the editor. I\u0027ve just tweaked it so that they are very very closely aligned, and they automatically dock when the craft loads on the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-22T13:50:46Z\u0022 title=\u002210/22/2015 01:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by drewscriver\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr Farnsworth","CreatedById":147177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-22T18:26:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIngenious!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
