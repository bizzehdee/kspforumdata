I don\u0027t believe any research group has actually given any thought to it. Hydrolox NTR likely only exists because it\u0027s very convenient (at some cost to the life of the engine) and is absolutely necessary when a typical Hydrogen NTR needs a momentary thrust buff. A well-made methane NTR will grant both great thrust and decent Isp and have no need for Oxygen to be pumped into it. Methane by itself has decent density and isn\u0027t very fussy so tankage won\u0027t be a nightmare, and any single propellant option is easily very nice once you can get a good high core temperature and good propellant flow rate. The in-game stock NERVA, and by it, any stockalike NTR mod is balanced, are crippled, which is why you feel the need for LOX augmentation in general. IRL NTR concepts after the original NERVA do not have the cripple factor in them (mass flow is no longer a problem) and would have quite decent thrust once they emerge.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short, I\u0027d appreciate for you to reduce your mod and the contents of its GitHub repo to just your fuel config for the SSPXr cargo parts, and rename this mod to match, as the current name \u0022MethaneMaker\u0022 doesn\u0027t fit a mod that doesn\u0027t provide for methane \u003Cstrong\u003Eproduction\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-05-03T05:39:03Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2023 05:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by JadeOfMaar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dangaffa","CreatedById":207706,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-03T21:03:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224279313\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022216985\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221683091747\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022167617\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JadeOfMaar\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 hours ago, JadeOfMaar said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi there \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/207706-dangaffa/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022207706\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/207706-dangaffa/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@dangaffa\u003C/a\u003E.

Will probably still keep the specialty semi-cryo fuels as configs though, as they will likely help ship designs.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Gosh I wish that I had known your extra existed before I put in a day or so calculating all these values. Seriously, I truly don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t look it up *before* doing it, but I didn\u2019t, and clearly wasted a fair bit of time on it lol. I\u2019d love to make additions if I could to RRNF, specifically like you said for BDB components, along with any other nuclear engines kicking around my gamedata, but that\u2019ll be in the coming days.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Yeah\u2026at best I should at least add an additional disclaimer on the readme, though ideally I\u2019d remove them completely (I had to modify SSPX and cryotanks to add in the resources I wanted, ideally I\u2019d figure out how to plug into them separately, but I\u2019ll strip them down to what I need and ditch the rest)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) I may still try to add Methylox into RRNF, if you haven\u2019t already, as I feel like it\u2019d be a cool addition to ships that need to entirely make ascent themselves. Things like a nuclear Starship may benefit from the extra thrust of ascending directly, but first I should actually get it in the game before seeing if it makes balanced enough rockets\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yeah, the name was originally because this was to make methylox versions originally of the BDB J2 engines, I just reused it for this without thinking that people might believe it\u2019s more about making methane, rather than making engines methane-powered. Again, this mod hasn\u2019t been made with the smartest decision making skills. I\u2019ll rename the mod, keeping it to adding new configs to SSPX and CryoTanks, and I\u2019ll instead try to contribute to RRNF.
