It is amazing in so many ways. I can\u0027t imagine me rotating mega stations without it, little momentum in the right direction and timewarp with PR are a Godsent solution ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nCelestial body tracking makes it so much easier to keep the desired nose pitch, it is such a bliss to be able to maintain a hypersonic flight in 4x physical warp with zero vertical velocity.\n\nThere\u0027s easily fixable little issue PR has. I was inspecting my output\\_log.txt and found that PersistentRotation stores all the momentum information in its root folder. ModuleManager vacuums all these .cfg files into its config cache, which is completely unnecessary because the cache is meant for constant configs. Any change to these files forces ModuleManager to rebuild its cache on each game start. If you move the path for these momentum configs into the GameData/PersistentRotation/Plugins/PluginData folder MM will avoid caching them, this will speed up the game loading time for all the users.\n\nHere\u0027s some relevant info from the MM thread:\n\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50533-112-module-manager-2624-april-30th-where-the-singularity-started/\u0026do=embed\u0026embedComment=1983478\u0026embedDo=findComment\u0026page=106#comment-1983478\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50533-112-module-manager-2624-april-30th-where-the-singularity-started/\u0026do=embed\u0026embedComment=2450345\u0026embedDo=findComment\u0026page=138#comment-2450345\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-19T14:09:10Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2016 02:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Enceos**\n  \nThanks sarbian for correcting me"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-19T11:51:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 10 minutes ago, Enceos said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If you move the path for these momentum configs into the GameData/Plugins/PluginData folder MM will avoid caching them, this will speed up the game loading time for all the users.\n\u003E \n\nNo. It s GameData/\u003Cmodfolder\u003E/Plugins/PluginData\n\u003C/modfolder\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Enceos","CreatedById":110725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-19T14:08:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, sarbian said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E No. It s GameData/\u003Cmodfolder\u003E/Plugins/PluginData\n\u003E \u003C/modfolder\u003E\n\u003E \n\nYeah, goofed."},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-19T17:38:02Z","Content":"cool beans, just rebuilding my mods in 1.1.2, noticed a really important one was missing so I checked in here.\n\nHope your finals went well, looking forward to proper rotation again ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-22T05:34:16Z","Content":"Technically, it is literally anything under a PluginData folder.
