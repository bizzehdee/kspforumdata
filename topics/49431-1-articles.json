He told me that when he was a small kid he would remove a wheel from his bicycle, and while holding the hub with his hand he would spin the wheel to test for friction. And he found out that he could easily let the hub just rest on his hand and the wheel would remain upright. The idea seemed ludicrous to me and I refused to believe him. So I tried to search youtube for this effect and here it is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ujj2O5aLl2s?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuite ashamed that I was so uneducated I searched further and learned about a professor called Eric Laithwaite, who apparently did a lot of work on this. He also claimed that spinning objects could in fact be lifted more easily and this could be used in space propulsion. He was quite famous for his work on linear induction motors at that time (he is sometimes called \u0022the father of maglev trains\u0022), so at first his discovery created quite a sensation, but then his claims about defying newton\u0027s laws discredited him into obscurity. This is a video of him showing how spinning makes objects lighter (around the 2:38 mark):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/IaOIWXqH9Io?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat really happens is that the prof is hurrying the precession and thus the flywheel is forced upward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.
