Suffice to say, I failed... hard... ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nI was NOT using heat shields and the probably would not have helped, since one of the parts that exploded first was smack in the middle of the spacecraft - a Mk3\u003E2.5m adapter, facing the direction of flight with the Mk3 edge first (apparently that caught a lot of Jool\u0027s atmosphere - I had 2.5m parts connected directly to the Mk3 side of it - I thought it looked cool...\n\nMaybe it was the velocity or angle? Maybe the Periapsis height? \n\nI had an orbit of 900.000.000 Ap and 190.000 Pe - entered the Atmosphere at 8000m/s ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nAfter many many fails I hyperedited myself into Jool\u0027s orbit and set the orbit to an extreme eccentricity to have the maximum possible stress on the vehicle... that was the reason for this weird orbit.\n\nSo, what are your experiences with Jool\u0027s atmosphere? Have you managed to use it to shave dV off your capture burn?\n\nSuffice to say after my plight of yesterday, I do not think the current aero model is too forgiving for reentry ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T12:48:57Z","Content":"Hmm, I\u0027m wondering where you got the 8000m/s velocity if you were already in a closed orbit around Jool (as in, an Ap existed). That\u0027s considerably higher than escape velocity. I\u0027ve done several Jool transfers in 1.0.2 and have never come close to going that fast even on the initial pass into the system prior to capturing.\n\nPrior to 1.0.2, Jool aerocaptures were rather exciting due to their duration. You had to come in somewhere around 150-170km and spend a long time enveloped in harmless flames. In 1.0.2, however, I find Jool aerobraking rather boring. About 185-190km is all you need, you\u0027re barely scratching the surface, and you\u0027re not in the air long enough to get hot enough to worry about even without a heat shield.\n\nOf course, a lot depends on the cleanliness of your transfer out to Jool. If you intercept Jool at a large angle to its orbital path, then you\u0027ll have a higher velocity relative to Jool so will need to dig deeper, burning longer and hotter. OTOH, if you arrive at Jool nearly parallel to it\u0027s path, then you have low relative velocity and an inconsequential aerocapture."},{"CreatedByName":"Deadpangod3","CreatedById":58339,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T13:00:41Z","Content":"odd, i had someone tell me you dont even need a heatshield in jools atmosphere, since youd be going fast enough that youd be losing heat as fast as you gain it."},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T13:24:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hmm, I\u0027m wondering where you got the 8000m/s velocity if you were already in a closed orbit around Jool (as in, an Ap existed).

In the old aero, it seemed you had a fairly large margin of error when it came to aerobraking. With the testing I\u0027ve done in 1.0.2, it seems that the margin is much smaller, especially when dealing with Jool. I try to just barely dip into the atmosphere, somewhere between 195km and 197km seemed to be the sweet spot.\n\nEdit: This is coming in from an interplanetary transfer with a speed of ~8000 m/s."},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T14:42:51Z","Content":"I \u0022successfully\u0022 aerobroke (braked? hmmm...) in Jools atmo using a very heavy probe.

I\u0027m currently working on a large Jool operation with many ships and resupply vessels coming in every few years, and the first step is usually to either swing by Tylo for some free gravity-assisted slowdown, or a 190-195km aerobrake pass around Jool to get an apoapsis near Jool\u0027s moons.

It usually is applied to the command pod (root part, maybe?), and until you exit the game and come back in, it\u0027ll keep happening. If it\u0027s a hard enough acceleration, it may rip your vehicle apart. It usually hits when you use timewarp after exiting an atmosphere, in my experience."},{"CreatedByName":"yorshee","CreatedById":135011,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T15:18:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve had the same issue.
