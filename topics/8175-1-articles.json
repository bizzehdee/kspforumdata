The main ship launches into a low Kerbin orbit, and from there a tug boosts it to the Mun. After entering Mun SOI, the tug maneuvers both ships into a low/medium (\u0026lt;100km) orbit, burns hard retrograde to reduce the orbital velocity of the lander as much as possible, and then burns prograde again to maintain an orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESwitch now to the lander, which has a full half-tank of fuel. In my tests, I can perform the powered Mun landing and just barely launch back to a low Mun orbit (20-25km). The tug meets up with the lander and burns on a Mun escape trajectory. (If you do it right, you\\\u0027ll be on a deorbit trajectory when you re-enter Kerbin SOI.) The tug either burns to stay in orbit or lands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, for a simple Mun-Kerbin mission, this is pretty inefficient; the tug is a good bit larger than a Mun lander. But when you want to go to the Mun and back \u003Cem\u003Etwice\u003C/em\u003E, it looks a lot better. The first step is to minimize the design for the round-trip Mun mission, but my approach of late has been a little more demanding on the design. I wanted a decoupler below the capsule because otherwise the crew will die when doing a water landing, and I wanted an ASAS to make docking and landing easier. (I might drop the decoupler requirement since the tug can maneuver the ship into a KSC landing.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, step backwards. That ship, launch vehicle and all, needs to be able to land on Kerbin. That means lander legs and parachutes, and as I found out the hard way, more weight and a launch vehicle that no longer gets you into orbit. So this is where I\\\u0027m going back to the drawing board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbital rendezvous and docking has become trivial for me, so I\\\u0027ve been trying some trickier moves, like ballistic rendezvous and aligning launch windows for an \u0027instant\u0027 rendezvous. I might also try capturing a craft in Kerbin orbit and carrying it down on a landing platform.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may be possible to accomplish this without using any tug ships, but you\\\u0027d need to design a ship which can, in reverse order:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E[li]Land on Kerbin[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]Leave Mun SOI for Kerbin deorbit[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]Launch from Mun into orbit[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]Powered landing on Mun[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]Transition from lunar injection to stable Mun (de)orbit[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]Translunar injection from Kerbin orbit[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]Launch into Kerbin orbit[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...all while carrying a ship which can, in turn, do all of those things. The delta-v requirements are high, but the landing weights are enormous. You can land a Mun ship on Kerbin pretty easily, but take that, add enough fuel to launch from the Mun and get it back to Kerbin, and then give it enough fuel and thrust to deorbit and perform a powered landing on the Mun. (Remember, no aerobraking.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, I\\\u0027m going with tugs. The total launch mass may not even increase much since the tug is responsible for a significant portion of the delta-v, but its thrust requirements are low. (My light and medium tug designs use just a single landing engine; I expect the heavy tug will do the same, as long as it\\\u0027s only performing orbital operations.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gabyalufix","CreatedById":8990,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-21T00:26:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA few patches ago, I did a single-craft mission that:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(1) Launches from Kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) Lands on the mun\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(3) Launches from the mun\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(4) Lands on Kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(5) Launches from Kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(6) Lands on the Mun\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(7) Launches from the mun\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(8) Parachuted water landing, on kerbin, just off the KSP coast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsed a bunch of mods, as is my wont.
