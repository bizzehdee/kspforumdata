Im not sure what the conditions are exactly for causing it to happen, but its happened more than once at this point. I was loading saves multiple times trying to save a pair of flights, and was bouncing around in the tracking center a lot. Suddenly, the Kerbal Space Center and its huge runways spawns in above you when you load the save or when you switch to a new ship.

It doesnt have any gravity or physics attached to it, it doesnt act like a planet, but if you hit it, you will explode, even if you are millions of kilometers from anything.
