At about 20 meters above the surface, I stop the descent, and maybe climb slightly. I then deactivate the horizontal rocket(s), activate the belly rocket, and rotate to a horizontal attitude. On Minmus, a single 48-7s on the belly is plenty to land comfortably. On Mun, I usually mount two belly rockets, although you could probably get away with one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has actually become my preferred method of getting to Minmus.

Once you\u0027ve done a few runs you\u0027ve recovered the much higher initial outlay of a spaceplane vs reusable SSTO rockets, so until you\u0027re shipping so much around a local system and it\u0027s moons that transshipping it to slightly lighter vacuum-only craft is worth the cost of all the extra infrastrucure it does make some sense, especially for Kerbin or other places equally easy to get to orbit from. It\u0027s only really that ease that makes it worth it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWings aren\u0027t that heavy by themselves, add atmospheric engines \u0026amp; their infrastructure and then it can look pretty bad. I can\u0027t see running regular interplanetary spaceplane missions making much sense; I\u0027ve sent spaceplanes to Laythe ( thinking about it without even refuelling ) but only because I had nothing there at all \u0026amp; wanted to fly round Laythe. They were pretty enormous for something which could only take a few crew \u0026amp; very little cargo, and not exactly stellar aircraft. For occasionally dropping stuff off in Mun orbit though? I can just add a tank to a LKO lifter spaceplane \u0026amp; I\u0027m there, no messing with tugs, transshipment, extra hardware for docking. Not optimised for a repeat schedule, but then I haven\u0027t had to do a seperate launch for the orbital gear to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin ought to be just a bit bigger, I think.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
