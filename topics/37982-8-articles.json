Or should I just wait till I have everything done?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeeing as how it\u0027s still WIP and you\u0027ve got a bunch of folks willing to beta test (myself included) I\u0027d say release the parts piecemeal. And add the caveat like shadowsutekh mentioned, and also note that future updates may break crafts. When you get ready to release you can set up a thread in the releases section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Stevincent\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Stevincent\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd another question (LOL) anyone know any good resources on config files and unity, I cant find a lot of the definitions of the config stuff, the wiki page is terribly out of date, and information is scattered all over or is extremely vague and assumes you already know a lot about unity. Anyways thanks.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly I\u0027d say probably 90% of what I\u0027ve learned from cfg files I have learned reading through BobCat\u0027s, CORE, KW, and NovaPunch cfgs. BobCat and CORE\u0027s cfgs taught me how CoMOffset works to help balance heavy loads on top of a booster, and looking at stuff like the KW fairing bases helped me learn how the attach node coordinate system works. I also learned a lot from UbioZur\u0027s \u0027welded\u0027 parts using the MODEL nodes, that you can assemble a module that the game sees as a single \u0027part\u0027 that physics acts on as a whole (like right now I am developing the Mars Transfer Vehicle frame like the one in this video:\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/uUBhn3_P3hU?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E), but doing so using off-the-shelf parts (since I fail at Blender). Right now I think I am using stuff from NovaPunch and the RogerCorp girder pack (which I had to do the PART {} wrapper to bring into .21) Bac9\u0027s B9 pack is also a great place, because of the way he re-uses textures and models - you can basically create multiple rescales of a part just by adding multiple configs in the same folder as the model and texture. This way the game only loads the model and texture once.\n"}]}
