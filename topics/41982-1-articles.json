MJ is vertical, my craft flies well and is balanced. If I use \u0060T\u0060 then it flies straight very well. If I use mechjeb it flies straight for a while (unlike if MJ is not placed right) then tips to around 45 degrees relative to vertical and then rotates around the vertical axis (planet vertical, not rocket vertical) until it crashes. Sometimes it is as though MJ decides to just stop controlling the craft. Sometimes this does not happen. It seems as though something gets \u0060set\u0060 after a few launches and will only reset after a reboot. Just reloading the program does not change things back it seems.

It is as though MJ loses the method of controlling the craft. Both launches had MJ autopilot on, only difference was ASAS/SAS. For me also this may be a RemoteTech issue so I will investigate further. First I will copy my game folder, uninstall RT and then try to launch this craft again.
