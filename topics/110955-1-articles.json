Also a secondary question is do I need to have all the textures from this (3 in total) on one single texture sheet or can I use multiple for the textures? Thanks for the help\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T08:30:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can\u0027t do chrome textures in KSP unless you use the reflective shader plugin. In stock your only option is to use a galvanised metal texture for the colour and a modified one for the specular map. It wont look great in darkness but when highlighted it\u0027ll give the texture a nice metallic-sort-of look. I use that in my Universal Docking Ports. Have a look.
