I have been wanting to add screenshots of my KSP shenanigans to several community discussions and I have come across a problem, I don\u0027t know how to add images. Ok slight lie there I do but only via URL. I have seen on posts actual image\u0027s and also only URL\u0027s, and was wondering does using the \u0022Insert Image\u0022 button add the image or just post the URL? If it only add\u0027s the URL how do I add an actual image??\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers, Danerdygeek.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scorpi15","CreatedById":34189,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T03:53:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou need to upload the image to a image hosting website, for example Imgur.
