It doesnt show my prograde/retrograde markers relative to the asteroid until i am extremely close to it, which is had to achieve when you zoom in and your trajectory lines become straight instead of curves and your rendezvous markers start to flicker or jump. Thanks and happy asteroid hunting!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
