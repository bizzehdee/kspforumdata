Each celestial body has one. The game does not keep the terrain loaded for any celestial body except the one you are orbiting. So there is no way for the game to really tell when a non-focused craft crashes into the terrain of some CB. This autodeletion altitude is a simple replacement for checking if things crash. On the Mun, I think the autodeletion altitude is 8km. So if the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E of your station was below 8km at the Mun, then that\u0027s almost certainly what happened to it.
