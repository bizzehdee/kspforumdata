This could be useful for asteroids... A small gravity, but enough to land a small probe on.

You could apply a small additional acceleration toward nearby asteroids, for example. This might not work during time warp or for non-active vessels, but I think it would be enough to allow you to land on an asteroid.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
