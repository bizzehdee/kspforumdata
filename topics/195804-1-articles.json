One around Kerbin, another around the Mun, and a third on the surface of Minimus. All were built/expanded as part of a contract.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStations are convenient, so if someone is going to pay me to build one, why not? I actually have a Rockomax Jumbo-64 tank on the way to Minimus that will become a new station in orbit there. The contract said it had to have a probe core, generate power, and have an antenna. I think I had to add a thermometer to meet the terms of the contract. Once it\u0027s in orbit for 10 seconds and the satellite contract is complete I\u0027ll move it to the final orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDetails below\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022bKQEnOS.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/bKQEnOS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbin Station was built in tho phases. The original was mostly crew modules and then the science lab was added later. I\u0027m not using it for much ATM, but I\u0027ll probably detach the engine section and replace it with a large tank for refueling at some point. Then I can just launch to orbit and run a shuttle back and forth the the Mun/Minimus instead of going directly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022M3gqrsr.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/M3gqrsr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMun Station has gotten quite a bit of use. The science lab was the original piece and later I added the cupola section with better solar panels and fuel cells so the science lab could run 24x7. Attached to the station are the tourist shuttle (closest), current 6-kerbal lander, and the original lander. The ship at the bottom is a fuel tanker that just brought in a (mostly) full Jumbo-64 tank for future landing ops.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022sksMVR7.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/sksMVR7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, Minimus Base is a new contract I just picked up. Given how easy it is to land I decided to put the base down first and I\u0027ll swing back around to pick the two scientists up later after they\u0027ve generated a healthy dose of science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
