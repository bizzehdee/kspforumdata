The effect of CR on longevity is conserved across a diverse range of species from unicellular organisms such as yeast to nematodes, invertebrates and mammals. To date a range of factors have been associated with the beneficial effects of CR, a small subset of which are discussed in the next section. As with any pursuit in medical research, confirmation of the translatability of beneficial outcomes established in studies of short-lived rodents species to humans is the litmus test. The translational gap from lab to clinics can be bridged by studies in nonhuman primates, which share a high degree of similarity to humans. Rhesus monkeys (\u003Cem\u003EMacaca mulatta\u003C/em\u003E) share 93% identity with humans at the genetic level (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5514430/#bb0435\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 style=\u0022color:#642a8f;\u0022\u003EZimin et al., 2014\u003C/a\u003E), and are highly similar in anatomy, physiology, and endocrinology (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5514430/#bb0110\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 style=\u0022color:#642a8f;\u0022\u003EColman and Anderson, 2011\u003C/a\u003E). Average lifespan for rhesus monkeys in captivity is ~\u00A026\u00A0years of age and the maximum lifespan reported nationally is ~\u00A040\u00A0years of age. Importantly incidence and prevalence of age-related diseases and the impact of age aligns nicely for humans and rhesus monkeys. Unlike rodents, rhesus monkeys display patterns of eating and sleeping behavior that mirror those of humans, and the aging trajectory is gradual, also like that of humans, beginning in middle age. In contrast to human studies, rhesus monkey studies can be designed to facilitate comprehensive monitoring of subjects and strict adherence to the study protocol. Given the high degree of translatability and the tractability in study design, nonhuman primates are a vital link between basic research and clinical application.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#000000;font-size:15.9991px;text-align:left;\u0022\u003E\nTo investigate the translatability of CR\u0027s beneficial effects from rodents to primates, three independent rhesus monkey studies were initiated in the late 1980\u0027s. Two of these studies are ongoing: one at the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and the other at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center based at the University of Wisconsin (UW)-Madison. The third study, performed at the University of Maryland reported favorable effects of CR, although the study was focused on obesity and glucoregulation with only a small cohort designated to CR (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5514430/#bb0080\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 style=\u0022color:#642a8f;\u0022\u003EBodkin et al., 2003\u003C/a\u003E). At the UW, the 25% restriction intervention in a cohort of 76 adult monkeys was associated with significant improvements in morbidity and mortality (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5514430/#bb0115\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 style=\u0022color:#642a8f;\u0022\u003EColman et al., 2009\u003C/a\u003E). These findings contrasted with the report from the parallel NIA study, where a difference in survival was not observed between groups within the cohort of 121 monkeys, although a trend toward lower morbidity was reported for CR monkeys compared to controls (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5514430/#bb0280\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 style=\u0022color:#642a8f;\u0022\u003EMattison et al., 2012\u003C/a\u003E). A subsequent report from UW suggested the gap between control and CR was not as great at NIA as for UW (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5514430/#bb0120\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 style=\u0022color:#642a8f;\u0022\u003EColman et al., 2014\u003C/a\u003E), indicating that comparisons between studies might paint a different picture as to the efficacy of CR in primates. This turned out to be the case (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5514430/#bb0285\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 style=\u0022color:#642a8f;\u0022\u003EMattison et al., 2017\u003C/a\u003E). Two major differences in study design included the timing of onset of CR and in the implementation of the diet. At UW CR was introduced in adults whereas at NIA CR was initiated separately in juveniles and advanced-age animals. CR did not confer a survival advantage in young onset animals; however, the old-onset NIA cohort, although not different between control and CR within the study, were long-lived compared to UW control fed monkeys. This was reflected in lower bodyweight, lower adiposity, and lower food intake, that for both control and CR paralleled the food intake of UW CR animals. The voluntary lower food intake of old-onset controls resulted in little separation between control and CR monkeys and yielded exceptionally long-lived monkeys. Six of the NIA old-set cohort lived to 40\u00A0years of age and one lived to 43\u00A0years of age, a record for rhesus monkeys in captivity. A common outcome of both studies was the significant delay in the incidence of age-related morbidity among CR animals. The take home message from this joint initiative is that CR delays aging in primates, where lower food intake is associated with improvements in health and survival. The implications of this work are broader, first that aging in primates can be manipulated, supporting the concept that aging is a valuable target for intervention and eventual clinical application, and second, that the mechanisms recruited by CR to impinge on aging will likely have utility in the development of treatments to delay or abrogate age-related disease vulnerability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#000000;font-size:15.9991px;text-align:left;\u0022\u003E\nWith evidence that CR is effective in long-lived species the next question is whether its beneficial effects and mechanistic underpinnings are conserved in humans. The hallmarks of mammalian CR include lower adiposity, increased insulin sensitivity, favorable lipid profiles, and increased levels of the adipose-derived hormone adiponectin. Short-term studies of CR in humans have been conducted as part of the multicenter study (CALERIE) in 2 phases. In the first phase of CALERIE studies (CALERIE-I), the metabolic effects of 6 or 12\u00A0months of CR was evaluated in overweight individuals with a target level of restriction of 20\u201330%. Favorable changes in body weight, body composition, glucoregulatory function and serum risk factors for cardiovascular disease were reported in CR individuals (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5514430/#bb0310\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 style=\u0022color:#642a8f;\u0022\u003EMost et al., 2016\u003C/a\u003E). These outcomes were consistent with those reported for monkeys on CR (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5514430/#bb0140\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 style=\u0022color:#642a8f;\u0022\u003EEdwards et al., 1998\u003C/a\u003E,\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5514430/#bb0335\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 style=\u0022color:#642a8f;\u0022\u003ERamsey et al., 2000a\u003C/a\u003E), indicating species-conservation in the CR response. The second phase longitudinal CALERIE-II studies investigated the long-term (2\u00A0years) effects of 25% CR in healthy lean individuals. Results from CALERIE-II studies published so far indicate that the beneficial metabolic effects of CR observed in the 6-month CALERIE pilot studies are sustained with prolonged restriction in energy intake at 12 and 24\u00A0months.

Unlike rodents on CR, circulating levels of IGF-1, cortisol, sex hormones and GH secretion were not altered in humans in both CALERIE clinical trials. Insufficient reduction in calorie intake (~\u00A011% CR versus the planned 25% CR) could explain some of the discrepancies on CR-induced metabolic changes observed in CALERIE compared with rodent studies; however there is also the possibility that these are species-specific differences in the CR response. IGF-1 and growth stimulating hormones did not differ between control and CR monkeys on 25% CR at UW (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5514430/#bb0340\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 style=\u0022color:#642a8f;\u0022\u003ERamsey et al., 2000b\u003C/a\u003E), and an independent study at University of Oregon reported no difference in sex hormones with CR implemented at a similar level (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5514430/#bb0390\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 style=\u0022color:#642a8f;\u0022\u003ESitzmann et al., 2010\u003C/a\u003E).
