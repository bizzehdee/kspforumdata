Once the fuel runs out, it is going roughly horizontal at about 400 m/s, losing altitude at about -10 m/s. It quickly slows down to about 150 m/s and begins to pitch up. As it pitches up, it slows down to about 40 m/s, at which point it runs out of momentum and stalls, allowing gravity to take over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt accelerates from gravity to about -20 m/s vertical speed. Provided the fuel tank is still pointed horizontally (due to ASAS or what have you) it will start to pitch up again, slowing down to about 60 m/s and bleeding vertical speed. Rather than stalling again, it begins coasting roughly horizontally (akin to a glider), despite the fact that it doesn\u0027t have any means of generating lift. Its vertical speed is about -10 m/s, so it is going downward, but much more slowly than one would expect considering that it doesn\u0027t have any wings or propulsion. From here it handles very much like a glider -- you can roughly angle it in the direction you want to land and it\u0027ll head towards where you\u0027re pointing. You\u0027ll slowly pitch down and gain more vertical speed over time, but for the most part you can glide around until your electricity runs out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/3_oMwlTDuiA?start=472\u0026amp;feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E He had a parachute deployed while I did not, but the behavior remained the same.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-14T23:09:42Z\u0022 title=\u002211/14/2013 11:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by English Mobster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Senshi","CreatedById":57692,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T00:13:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just did recreate your described case 1:1 and launched it 5 times. No control inputs from my end. Depending on flameout altitude and speed, the resulting end orientation of the vessel differed greatly, which indeed had an important effect on the descent profile. If the vessel was near-vertical, it descended fairly quickly and after some nice mach effects during descent it impacted with around 100m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it was horizontal, it stayed horizontal and impacted with ~60m/s, but drifted much more horizontally.

I just tested it using v0.10 and while the SRB would tend to shift off prograde, and did produce quite a lot of body lift it slowed down to ~150 m/s after the booster ran out, afterwards maintaining a fifteen degree angle of attack as it gained vertical speed and plunged into the ocean. If it was behaving the same as in Scott\u0027s video, since he was using v0.9.7, and this was an issue fixed in v0.10, I have to assume that you were using v0.9.7 or that I built the craft wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of that said, don\u0027t sit there and say that an object without any wings has no means of generating lift. Even the most cylindrical of bodies will produce lift in an airflow if it\u0027s angled upwards enough; you can try this yourself if you stick your arm straight out the next time you\u0027re riding in a car. Also, if only wings made lift, the fine folks working for the USAF and Martin Marietta back in the 60\u0027s would have been incredibly foolish to build \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin-Marietta_X-24\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis beauty\u003C/a\u003E and drop it from a B-52.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Ok, I was looking at it flying forwards, which it does correctly; I never got it to flip around backwards.

You can quick-fix it by going and finding the config file and setting the last number on the nodes to \u00221\u0022 instead of \u00220\u0022, and it should work from there on.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-15T00:35:39Z\u0022 title=\u002211/15/2013 12:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by ferram4\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
