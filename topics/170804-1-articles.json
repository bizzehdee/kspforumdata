Being familiar with game development I had the small hope that the game did not actually commit these changes to the save file - and it did not. I mean, I had backups anyways (not just game generated ones but actual proper backups) but I didn\u0027t need them. So if you forget again or get lazy with the backups just remember to task-kill the game before switching scenes (quitting to the main menu or going into a building or out to a vessel - any of those actions will overwrite the save file with new data).

Hey maybe your game is still recoverable there. I\u0027m pretty sure that it\u0027s turned on by default - I can\u0027t remember if I disabled it the last time I installed but I do remember the backup generation was a bit iffy, at least it didn\u0027t seem to make a new one every time I opened my saved game like Persistent File Backup Generator does, which is why I prefer it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InterplanetJanet","CreatedById":184059,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-13T13:50:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223293818\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022170804\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221518500750\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022103177\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Drew Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, Drew Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[...] if this just happened to you recently with the latest version of KSP then additional admonishment is in order for not catching up on change notes since you last played\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdmonishment applied (*sigh* I hate those... especially when I deserve them)...\u00A0 and I started a new game in a fit of pique (and mod reloading) which is going well, probably better than the previous.
