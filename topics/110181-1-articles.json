Due to financial aid being lost after my first year (due to IRS income report error, not bad grades) I was at a local community college this year. I would have transferred to a different university but the school I attended freshman year (which is a private school at $50k\u002B/yr), notified me **July 31st** that my aid for the upcoming year had been removed entirely.\n\nNotification so late in the summer left me literally one option, which was to do community college and finish my AA. (Which I have now done). I started first semester of freshman year as a Computer Engineering major and hated it, and have been a business major since then. I have a high cumulative GPA, about 3.8. My HS GPA was 3.92, SAT scores all 700\u002B, 4 AP courses senior year alone, 5\u0027s on all of the tests, honors for most everything else in HS, at a private HS, not public.\n\nI\u0027ve been accepted to two schools in FL, UF and Rollins College (Private), thus far. Both schools accepted me as a Business major, but at this point I\u0027m concerned it might not be the best choice for me. I\u0027m considering the following possibilities:\n\nA) Business major, economics minor\n\n![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) Business major, physics minor\n\nC) Econ. major, physics minor\n\nD) Physics major, econ minor\n\nE) Physics major, business minor\n\nWhen/if I get a master\u0027s degree, I\u0027d like it to be in Physics more so than an MBA. But even there I\u0027m not really sure. I know the first question on the mind of one reading this is probably what I want to do. Ideally, power industry, not as an engineer but as a high level businessman with a grasp on the science.\n\nI\u0027m not really sure if I would be able to change majors so drastically as D and E would suggest, but I am open to any thoughts. Feedback appreciated. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"theend3r","CreatedById":97560,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T07:16:41Z","Content":"*\u0022Education is what remains after one has forgotten what one has learned in school.\u0022*\n\nPhysics would probably be better, Jack Welch also graduated in chemical engineering, not business.\n\nMy personal opinion is that ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) sounds good.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T07:22:03Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 07:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by theend3r**"}]}
