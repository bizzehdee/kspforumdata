For my ongoing project of re-scoring KSP (which got posted on the Facebook page a few months ago), I was wondering if there was a way to build a plugin for it that triggers a different song for different circumstances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea is that a particular song would play as soon as you launch (maybe it recognizes that the launch clamps have been released?) and have different songs for each sphere of influence. So when you\u0027re in Kerbin orbit, it plays a specific song but when you go heliocentric, it plays another song. Then if you get to Duna/whatever planets SoI, the song changes to a planet specific song. And once again if you land on the planet, a different song would be triggered. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI I am NOT a coder so I would need considerable help with this, but is this kind of thing even possible with the current engine? I imagine songs could be triggered by altitude, such as when you reach below 50km above Duna, the song changes to the Duna surface song. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in in advance for any tips or ideas!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T17:51:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure this is possible with the given system. IIRC (at least in previous versions) once you hit about 60km or so, the \u0022space\u0022 music would start playing in the background. This leads me to believe there have to be programmable \u0027triggers\u0027 that you can set to go off when specific circumstances are met.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for \u003Cem\u003Ehow\u003C/em\u003E to do that, well, someone will know!
