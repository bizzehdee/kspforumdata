But if you never bothered to test after that then I think you are jumping the gun on installing KJR. I\u0027m in the opposite boat to you, I never used KJR, be it before or after the change in joint stiffness. Of which I think there were two, the most recent in 1.0, though I could easily be mistaken. It was not important to be because a little teeny bend in a rocket (which is what I experienced in all but the most ridiculous rockets) was fine by me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t find the post, but I know I saw a thread made recently (unless it was a necro bump) that had a stack of little tanks with a mk1 on top, and a vector on the bottom acting like a noodle.
