My long-established playstyle involves building up a lot of reusable infrastructure. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tend to put orbital transfer/refueling stations around pretty much every body I visit, with reusable landers running back and forth from station to surface and back again, spaceplanes moving kerbals and fuel from KSC to LKO, and nuke-powered interplanetary tugs/shuttles hauling kerbals and fuel from one orbital station to another...aerobraking at any destination which allows it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConceptually, the whole thing is pretty similar to the infrastructure popularized in the 1950\u0027s by Werhner von Braun/Willey Ley/Chesley Bonestell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt occurs to me that this sort of infrastructure is going to be MUCH more difficult to pull off with the new 1.0.x re-entry heating. Seems Clamp-o-trons don\u0027t make very good heat shields, not even Clamp-o-tron Sr\u0027s. (Who\u0027d\u0027ve guessed?) And for obvious reasons, even a redesign that puts a docking port at one end and a heat shield at the other is not going to make for a permanent/long-term reusable vehicle, what with the temporary nature of anything \u0022ablative\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd for equally obvious reasons, I don\u0027t want to give up on aerobraking if I can help it--I am ... unfond ... of the idea of keeping 1000m/s dV dedicated to a powered return to LKO (on return from Mun/Minmus/Duna, and even more when coming from further away). But in the absence of ballute-type high-altitude/low-heating deployable/reusable reentry parts, I don\u0027t see an obvious way to aerobrake one vehicle many times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure some of you clever people out in Forum-land (especially the FAR/DRE users who\u0027ve been facing this for years) have already worked out suitable approaches to solving this little dilemma.

Sure you won\u0027t be able to aerobrake going in with 10km height but you can always touch the edge of the atmosphere (30 to 60km if you wanna push it 25km) and easily survive even a 4000 m/s entry.
