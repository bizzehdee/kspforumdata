In practice your load is probably going to be a fully-functional spacecraft that can just boost itself the rest of the way. =D A payload around 50 mass is going to be the limit in practice because 9 T-30 engines can\\\u0027t lift more than about 135 mass, so if you go over that the vehicle will just sit on the pad burning fuel until it gets light enough to take off... At which point you won\\\u0027t have enough fuel to achieve orbit anymore. It\\\u0027s a bit of a strange limiting condition, for sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tested it by hacking a part to have 40 mass and putting that in the \u0027payload positon.\u0027 You can see that in the first and second screenshots. I also built an amalgamation of fuel tanks that could fit around the boosters as a more \u0027real world\u0027 scenario, that\\\u0027s the third screenshot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy intention here is to make a spacecraft that other people will put their own payload on. To do this, disconnect the fuel tank on the middlemost engine from the command module, build your payload onto the command module, then move the booster onto the payload. I made sure to put the shortest stacks on the left and right so that you can build a payload with wings that stick through those slots if you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first attempt at this concept of making the boosters different lengths put the lengths of the boosters down below so that a payload up top could be any shape at all rather than having to fit around the boosters... This didn\\\u0027t work because with a very heavy payload on top (i.e. the kind of payload I was designing this rocket for), the center of gravity moved too far away from the engines and the vehicle became unstable. As it is I had to reinforce the hell out of it \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m reasonably sure that this is just about the most mass to orbit that is possible with 9 engines. Feel free to prove me wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe that this general paradigm of ship design is the strongest in the game... Every engine that\\\u0027s not firing because it\\\u0027s tied up in a stage is dead weight that\\\u0027s eating up your delta-v, so arranging things so that every engine on your vehicle is contributing to putting it into space is really nice. The fact that you have lots of engines on individual couplers gives you lots of opportunities to fine tune your staging so that you can find the best tradeoff between ditching dead weight and losing thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe downside is that setting up the crossfeeds and staging is really tedious, and center of gravity and instability issues crop up constantly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"noneyabidnis","CreatedById":20531,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-19T04:01:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love the concept, but can\\\u0027t get it balanced to save my life.

The rocket is very stable for a short payload (like my \u0027dummy weight\u0027 I tested it with), but a higher center of gravity will need bracing. Remember you\\\u0027re throwing a *lot* of mass on top of this thing, and rockets don\\\u0027t like having a high center of gravity that wobbles around. You might also need to throw some SAS and/or fins. These additions will come out of your payload to orbit, unfortunately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFly it up without a payload and you\\\u0027ll see it\\\u0027s pretty stable. It\\\u0027s putting 45 mass of payload on it that makes things difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"noneyabidnis","CreatedById":20531,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-20T04:12:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyeah, I think the issue is that my payload was too tall. However, I\\\u0027m not sure how to add more than 20 tons (ballpark) without it getting tall. If that makes sense. Of course, I like to have an initial stage that gets me near orbit, then another stage that finishes orbit and transfer, and then a final stage to get me back down (and even back from Mun, etc.) Thus I treat the craft as a wedding cake design - with this, though, I guess I don\\\u0027t need a wedding cake rocket and need to change my thinking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"noneyabidnis","CreatedById":20531,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-20T04:29:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewow - I just tried with a shorter payload and it went amazingly well.
