Would it be possible to tweak this pack a bit so that it attempts to keep objectives grouped by biome? Things get a little difficult to be cost effective when it asks for such wild parameters.

How am I supposed to make any money off of completing this contract, that will require multiple launches, when the game considers it trivial? I\u0027ve been trying to layer contracts to get an objective for multiple contracts done at once, but I only have 7 contract slots at the moment.\n\nYeah, I could just reject contracts like this, but it gets rather frustrating when most of these wind up as unrealistic as this."}]}
