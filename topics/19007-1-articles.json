If you can attach them one way, you can attach them the other.

If that is what you\u0027re talking about, they fight you a lot, but you can make them go where you want eventually. Try taking off the part you want to attach the connector to, stick it back on the plane at some angle that the tail connector doesn\u0027t complain about, attach the tail connector to it, then move the whole assembly back where you wanted it in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clouds","CreatedById":32610,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-11T03:01:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I have the problem with stubborn tail connectors, too. I assume the devs know about this, it\u0027s not only tail connectors that can refuse to connect but they have become especially stubborn in .16. Parts can sometimes be \u0022tricked\u0022 into connecting by finding somewhere else that it WILL connect, then detaching it and, without dropping it, trying to place it where you really want it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
