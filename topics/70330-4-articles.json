It\u0027s almost always good game design to give players as many options as possible so that each individual can tailor the game to their own preferences. But keeping something from players who want it will have one of three possible effects: Either the player has to download and install the desired functionality from a third party (which, granted, is both relatively safe and easy with KSP), they calculate it by hand, or they do without. None of those are qualities of good game design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs has been mentioned already, \u0022doing without\u0022 is usually no major issue for Kerbin SOI missions, but becomes a serious one when mission complexity increases. I don\u0027t do many Jool missions myself for exactly that reason. Just getting there takes a couple hours of real-life time to fly (three-and-a-half hours was my last one-way time, including trial-and-error aerobraking attempts) and I\u0027d rather not have to wait until after I\u0027ve spent those hours to discover that I hadn\u0027t packed enough fuel. I feel like I miss out on some of the game\u0027s content because of the real-life time costs involved with the trial-and-error method.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECalculating things by hand is not typically considered engaging gameplay, and those who do enjoy it for its own sake would probably do it regardless of whether the game offered them the information already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, mods are good for content that the developers either can\u0027t get to because of time constraints (or haven\u0027t gotten to yet), or that lies beyond the scope of the game itself. Critical data readouts don\u0027t really fall within either category, so there seems to be no good reason to delegate that functionality to the modding community. I don\u0027t have anything against mods (I actually installed MechJeb after that Jool mission to see if I could make it back), but every time I get MechJeb or Kerbal Engineer to allow mission planning, I wish I wouldn\u0027t have to. Plus, having one of their instruments on my craft slows the game down noticeably for me.
