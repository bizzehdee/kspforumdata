Before I realised that Space activated stages and even that staging existed, having the throttle set to 50% would\u0027ve spelt disaster for me - manually activating an engine only to have it burst into life would\u0027ve sent me on a panic-stricken button mash to stop it or at least turn it down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is of course assuming that a complete newbie either presses Space or right-clicks on the engine. And god only knows what buttons newbies press - IMHO, it\u0027s best to leave things so they don\u0027t surprise anyone. If the throttle is 0%, pressing Space makes a noise and green bars appear on the bottom right - as you said, at least they know Space worked.

It\u0027s more likely based on feedback they have received. Keep in mind that feedback could also be user generated in-game data. If they see a lot of people pressing space then looking all around with their mouse, going back and forth to VAB, and finally throttling up, this might be a stop gap measure until they add tool tips. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it\u0027s not like they wasted time \u0022developing\u0022 this feature, it probably took them 5 minutes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ObsessedWithKSP\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ObsessedWithKSP\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMy panties remain entirely unbunched\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou wear panties?! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OtherDalfite","CreatedById":8317,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-13T00:25:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo is this why they said this wasn\u0027t going to be archived?
