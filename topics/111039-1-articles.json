Of course, the biggest cause of rockets flipping now is aerodynamics when you reach a certain speed at a certain pressure that your design can\u0027t handle.\n\nExample 1) Attaching a probe core to the upper interior node of a utility bay. This looks fine on paper. 90% of the time I\u0027ve done it, it worked just fine. 10% of the time, it results in a craft that wobbles out of control for no apparent reason. KSP bug! The workaround is to tweak the design to put the probe core in a different place, even if it results in a design that is less perfect on paper. Clipping parts in utility bays will cause issues much more often and more violently. \n\nExample 2) Any seemingly normal craft...starts to wobble slightly and the wobbles increase in magnitude until the craft shakes apart. No clipping, no bays, gimbal on engines reduced to avoid notorious SAS gimbal feedback loop... it all looks perfect. However, due to some particular aspect of the design that could not be accounted for by the simplified math we use for VAB design, the craft experiences harmonically constructive vibrations. This is the result of an effective KSP physics simulation. You could do the math for it IF you had access to all the joint physics values and the unity physics code, but the math would be on the same order of complexity as the math for real world materials engineering. Similar real examples of such failures are common in history... buildings and bridges falling over in low wind, because the speed is just right to cause a harmonically constructive vibration in the structure. Real designs have to suppress these vibrations. I get this from time to time when I have a reaction wheel too high above the center of mass... which is sadly where I want my reaction when to go at launch, as I prefer not to add big reaction wheels to the lower stages. Similarly, two reactions at opposite ends of a large vessel can cause a sort of jump-rope effect... not fun... or lots of fun depending on perspective. \n\nExample 3) You aren\u0027t flying a lawn dart design. You want to have a lot more drag at the back than the front. I\u0027ve resorted to putting some pretty big wings on the first stage of some rocket designs just because they refuse to stay upright without them. Alternatively, you can throttle down a bit (ill advise) or fly straight up until you\u0027re mostly out of the soup (inefficient). The drag hurts efficiency, but markedly less so than having the engines pointed the wrong way. 1.0.2 aero seems to force me to put huge wings on the back of vessels. The designate rocket fins seem to be about useless... even slender profiles seem to need the bigger winglets at least."},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceChipmunk","CreatedById":142023,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T20:41:04Z","Content":"Yes some are cursed. Also had a rocket recently I was going to use for a rescue on a bad elliptical orbit on a severe inclination between LKO and the edge of the SOI. Thankfully using KCT so never actually built it, but had to return to redesign it about 15 times. Weight distribution was good, TWR was good, ascent was typical, not too fast, not too slow. Added fins (of ever increasing size), added the Advanced SAS module and inline reaction wheel. Tried everything and yet, it would always flip just as I was about to decouple the first stage, every single time!!! Very annoying. Abandoned it in the end, just used one of my normal rockets to do the rescue and gently bump the pod into a Kerbin impact to get rid of the evidence."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T20:49:12Z","Content":"I had a Mun space station inhabited by a poltergeist which would make the station rotate (with or without SAS).
