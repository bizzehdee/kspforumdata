You know, someone to keep track of the burns while I keep the rocket on heading, or run RCS while I do the mouse clicking stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways I fly with a 360 controller as it\u0027s the closest to a 6dof controller I have kicking around. I used to play Descent with it in 6dof using every single control on the thing simultaneously which makes it occasionally challenging to keep in your hands \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I hooked up the second one, I found that KSP cannot distinguish one controller from the other! If you bind a button on one controller, it is bound on the other one too. That makes having 2 controllers fairly useless...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T04:18:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe this limitation had something to do with Unity, but judging from the devnotes from a few weeks back, it \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9 be fixed in the next version.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rectifier","CreatedById":138727,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T04:26:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood to know, thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rectifier","CreatedById":138727,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T21:01:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFound a mod that solves this. \u0022Advanced fly by wire\u0022 recognizes multiple devices, and also lets you bind button combinations and switch between presets with a button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso you can review and change bindings INGAME!
