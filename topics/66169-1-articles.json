Instead, he was going to park his ship in orbit and do all the maneuvering with the EVA pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next day, Kirrim took a ship to Minmus, parked it in a 10km orbit and started to go down:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JMm8Mw9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022JMm8Mw9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1zzFHwM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221zzFHwM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe descent was flawless, and after a few minutes he was able to reach the surface and plant a flag:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ooDNlTL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ooDNlTL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter planting a flag and taking a picture, it was time to get back to the ship, and that\u0027s when Kirrim realized he had made a fatal mistake: his ship was not parked in an equatorial orbit, so the rendez-vous was going to be nearly impossible. He did his best, but ran out of fuel and ended up stranded in a 17km orbit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zfUr6gD.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022zfUr6gD.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA rescue ship was launched immediately. Commander Chad Kerman and his favourite pilot Pauix Kerman took a 3-seat capsule and went to Minmus as fast as they could. They managed to get near the stranded kerbonaut and, after some very delicate maneuvers, they managed to get close enough so that Kirrim could grab a ladder and board the ship:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JOrbZRe.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022JOrbZRe.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/57RqVvb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002257RqVvb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/U8k5Z3s.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022U8k5Z3s.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce he entered the capsule, Kirrim apologized for all the mess he caused. \u0022Totally worth it\u0022, said Chad, while Pauix, with a huge smile on his face, said that \u0022next time, you let me park the ship\u0022.
