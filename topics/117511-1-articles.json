This design uses thrust vectoring to make the thrust go vertically and lift the plane off the ground. In ksp, however, there is no such vectoring. You need to put jet engines facing downward around the CoM with enough TWR to lift off, and then some horizontal engines (optional) to propel your plane forward. It\u0027s not as easy as it sounds, though, since it\u0027s really touchy for balance - you\u0027ll spend a lot of time tweaking the downward jets so that the plane doesn\u0027t flip.

If you have a fuel tank 1m ahead of the CoM, you need an identical tank 1m behind it, and both must drain together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- it is not an option to offset fuel tanks relative to each other because then the weight balance shifts during flight. They must align with the CoM along one axis or another. (Tortuga demonstrates both.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- place your vertical engines in alignment with the CoM, either equally distant forward/backward, or to either side (both options shown above).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- add cockpit, engines, and wings last, since these are most configurable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- use small parts like reaction wheels and battery packs to keep the CoM stable. Be generous with reaction wheels, it will help a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- packing the verticals into an MK2 bay will save you a lot of drag during normal flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the hotkey tip is wise. With a T2 SPH, I have the lights (U) toggle both the vertical engines and cargo doors, and RCS \u00AE control the turbojet. It\u0027s vital to have them independent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- plan intakes to allow for all engines to be used at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- learning to control a VTOL isn\u0027t immediate. You\u0027ll spend a while practising before you can do gentle drifts and hovers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- mountain landings are still hard. If you have to land on a slope, your down jets will push you away from it, so try for the flattest possible corner and be prepared to walk.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T10:57:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129392-Diligent-2-Beautiful-VTOL-with-amazingly-good-flying\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s\u003C/a\u003E a VTOL that handles really well.

I am waiting on scientist and engineer return to test a Mk3 mining jet with a reuseable rover. Should be able to land at a safe site and refuel as the rover fetches the survey sites. The rover has VTOL rockets to allow it to re-dock with the jet (as an added plus, it can sip up to half its fuel with a fuel cell to save battery weight).

I recommend a STOVL (Short Takeoff Vertical Landing) or a pure STOL. If you only have the power to hover (1.1-1.2 TWR) at half fuel, you drastically reduce the VTOL engine requirements. Wings still give a surprising amount of lift at post stall speeds, they just need some help to prevent gravity from progressing the stall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also make your jet into a paraglider for much less mass.
