The Second World War had\u00A0just ended. It was the dawn of a new age on Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe victorious Allies, led by the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, France\u00A0and China, had assembled themselves in what would be known as the United Nations, so that all of the world could be at peace. People looked at the future with hope, having witnessed first hand the horrors of the War.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat, unfortunately, would prove not to be the case. The world was now split into two,\u00A0under the shadow of the USSR to the East, and the US to the West. Yet, no matter the political differences, the remaining superpowers,\u00A0the US, the UK, and the USSR in particular, symultaneously\u00A0turned their eyes skywards: the future laid not on brown soil, but in the blue skies above.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrue powered\u00A0aircrafts\u00A0had been born just forty years before, but now they bore little, if any, resemblance\u00A0to the Flyer built by the Wright brothers, and there were rumors about an American prototype which was capable of going past the Columns of Hercules of Aviation: the sound barrier. But, while aircrafts were the big thing for the general public, a small, if resolute, group of scientists and engineers had their focus on another marvel of technology: the rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe history of rocketry had started many centuries before in China, but the most important advancements had been made much more recently. It was almost universally agreed, however, that the greatest pioneer was Kostantin Tsiolkovsky, a native Russian, whose ideas on rocket propulsion and propellants, but most importantly, his equations, had laid unknown for quite some time. In the US, during the 1920s, the famous inventor Robert Goddard had developed, and launched, the first ever liquid propelled rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn Germany the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EVerein f\u00FCr Raumschiffahrt\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E(\u003Cem\u003EVfR\u003C/em\u003E, of Society for Space Travel) had had some significant developments as well, in particular regarding the use of\u00A0Liquid Oxygen and Ethanol as propellants, before dissolving in 1934. In the Soviet Union there had been numerous inventors, notably Valentin Glushko, whose team conducted hundreds of tests, but the Purges of the late \u002730s soon put an end to these experimentations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuring World War Two rockets were used by almost every party, mostly for battlefield-level weapons, such as the Rocket Anti-Aircraft Artillery of the Royal Navy, or the Katyusha rockets of the Soviets. But the most interesting, and fundamental, designs came from the United States and pedant Germany.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn Germany, the infamous V-2 rocket had been developed and fielded during the war by a team headed by Wehrner von Braun, who was later extradited to the US along with most of his team. It was a most revolutionary design, a \u0022ballistic missile\u0022, capable of a range of\u00A0300km, hitting, albeit with disputable results, the British mainland. These rockets had very advanced features such as HTP-driven turbopumps, and inertial guidance. Even further, these rockets scraped the edge of space on their way to London.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the US, while no actual full scale testing took place, there was a much more ambitious program. Developed in complete secret under the codename\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EProject Prometheus\u003C/em\u003E, the initial plans called for a two-stage rocket, large enough to throw a (theoretical, at the time) 7000kg nuclear bomb across the ocean, in the instance of British surrender and/or full Soviet control of the European mainland. While this concept never came to be, a series of scale motors were built, and this experimentation meant that an experienced team was readily available in the US for subsequent programs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn late 1947, however, the unexpected happened. This team of American engineers, now joined by the Germans under von Braun, was approached by a British organization, who wished\u00A0to join their forces in pursuit of a greater goal: exploring space. The project was left off to rust for quite some time, but, following several years of negotiations, of course keeping the public in the dark, the plans were approved and signed by future Administrators Sir Philip Perrington and General Garrett H. Woodward.\u00A0Finally, on December 19th, 1950, the \u003Cem\u003EInternational Rocket Society\u003C/em\u003E came to be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022vCMjY9M.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022100.00\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 width=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/vCMjY9M.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003ERoundel of the International Rocket Society from 1950 onwards\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-03-19T15:41:12Z\u0022 title=\u002203/19/2020 03:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 19, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Fenisse\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etitle\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fenisse","CreatedById":102671,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-20T19:54:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EChapter List:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E[It\u0027s empty.

Of course, divergences occurred even before (think of Project Prometheus), but the point at which the differences really start to matter is in 1946-1947, as I\u0027ve explained in the introduction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe story will be narrated from a Western perspective, which means little to nothing is known about the Soviet\u00A0(and later, the Chinese) Space Program.

I figured I could share with you my new RP-1 campaign, while adding a (somewhat) interesting backstory to it.

not easy at all. It was like having a giant sit on a chair made of toothpicks; the future of this undertaking was uncertain at best. The main issues were with reciprocal distrust between the British and American governments: while the scientist and engineers (and to some extent, even the chairmen) were more than happy to work together, the politicians thought of the Society as nothing more than another nuisance, and a possible source of state secrets leaks, especially now that relations with the Soviets were crumbling. Nonetheless, work proceeded as planned despite the very limited funding received, and the IRS was allowed to test its designs at the Cape Canaveral AFS in Eastern Florida.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EThe Americans and British had different areas of expertise: extensive rocket development had given the US a thorough understanding of rocketry, even more so with the addition of the Germans (who had been reluctantly \u201Cleased\u201D by the Army to the IRS), while restrictions and even bans had made life difficult for rocket engineers in Britain, however, they possessed extensive knowledge about jet engines and high-speed flight, which would certainly prove useful sometime later. The teams also agreed to use the metric system, which caused somewhat of an uproar, due to ease of conversions.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EThe first objective of the Society was finding a reliable and economically feasible way to access the secrets of space, which meant designing a new sounding rocket. Unfortunately, due to budget shortages, the IRS could not develop anything anew (although the British had been planning something for quite sometime as of now), so they had to go with existing technology for the time being.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EThe obvious choice was to keep using what the US had been using for the last five years or so: the WAC-Corporal and the A4. There were problems with the A4, however: the technology was itself very old and relatively unreliable, and there remained few rockets due to extensive testing and no production of the rocket occurring in the post war years.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EThe WAC-Corporal, on the other hand, had been refined over the course of its service life, and by the time they got into the IRS\u2019s hands, most of the problems had been solved. The Society, however, desired to achieve better results with the WAC-Corporal, therefore determining to develop their own version of the missile. It wasn\u2019t much different from the original, just stretched and with better materials that were just becoming available to support the longer burn time. The IRS designated this rocket as the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWAC M1951-A0504\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, or simply the WAC.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022l0NT87y.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 width=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/l0NT87y.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWAC Blueprint, cost is in 1951 US dollars.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe booster stage was a Tiny Tim solid rocket motor, developed as a weapon for the US Navy in WW2. It provided the rocket with enough thrust to propel it to around 500 meters altitude, which made it pick up speed while the WAC motor was still igniting. The sustainer stage ignited at liftoff and reached full thrust around 0.5 seconds later, and it separated from the Tiny Tim around one second after lift off. The boost phase lasted for 90.1 seconds, which brought the rocket to around 25km, and it then coasted to apogee. At apogee, the payload compartment (above the despin module) separates and the parachute arms. What is left of the WAC then lands safely about two minutes later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EThe burn time of the upgraded WAC-Corporal motor, still using\u00A0the same Aniline/Furfuryl/IRFNA-III mixture of the original design, was really pushing it, and many feared it would simply burn through and/or explode in the last part of the flight. The general payload carried was a high-altitude package to study the atmosphere above the mesosphere.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EThe first flight of the WAC (\u003Cstrong\u003EWAC-1\u003C/strong\u003E) took place on March 6, 1951 at Cape Canaveral. It was a disappointing failure: the Tiny Tim booster worked perfectly, but the Upgraded WAC did not ignite, leading to the rocket crashing near the launch site a few seconds later. This failure had a heavy impact on the already unpopular reputation of the IRS among the top brass, who were already planning on shutting down the project for good.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EDespite the setback, the engineers didn\u0027t let themselves get let down, instead seeing the failure as an opportunity to improve, and moreover, the knowledge gained would certainly prove useful at some point in the future. Due to the fact the motor didn\u0027t ignite at all, the WAC reached about 2km altitude or so before it started to come down, therefore the speed as it touched the ground wasn\u0027t very high, and much could be learnt by doing an autopsy of the engine assembly. The investigation revealed that\u00A0the IRFNA-III valve didn\u0027t open due to a short circuit, and of course without the oxidizer the reaction couldn\u0027t have happened.

While this deficiency would be rectified by the WAC successor, the Aerobee, the International Rocket Society needed a vehicle capable of reaching space in the interim. The only rocket available to the IRS at the time that had those specifications was a relic of the Second World War: the A4 rocket.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EThe history of the A4 began many years before, in Germany. A young Wehrner von Braun had caught the eye of the German military staff, he was appointed to a solid rocket research facility in Kummersdorf, and later the Army Research Center in Peenemunde. He and fellow engineer Walter Riedel soon started to design the Aggregat series of rockets, which was to culminate in a huge rocket with a thrust of more than 25,000kg. Early testing using scale models in 1936 would unfortunately prove unsuccesful, postponing the development of the full-scale rocket, the Aggregat 4. Therefore deals were made with universities to solve the Aggregat family issues, and by 1941 the technology to ensure the A4\u0027s success was available. The rocket\u0027s first flight took place in 1942, and in 1944 it was first deployed for combat operations. Now known as the V2, a weapon of vengeance, these rockets soared the skies, scraping the edge of space as they fell upon British and Belgian cities.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EAfter the end of the War, many A4s were recovered by the US, the UK\u00A0and the Soviets, and extensive research took place in those countries. In the US, the failure of Goddard\u0027s Project Prometheus to produce any\u00A0results meant that the A4 was to be used in high altitude tests. The presence of Wehrner von Braun further influenced American rocketry, and many future designs bore some resemblance to the old ballistic missile.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EBy the time the International Rocket Society got its hands on the A4s, in June 1951, the missiles still available for testing were really showing their age.

The A4 motor was different from the WAC, the latter was pressure fed and did not require a turbine, the former used an external HTP tank to power the turbines, which take some time to get to full speed. The rocket burned a 51/48% mixture of 75% Ethanol and Liquid Oxygen, which meant the combustion chamber reached temperatures in the degree of 2700K. To solve this issue the alcohol fuel was pumped along the double wall of the main combustion burner, heating the fuel and cooling the combustion chamber. Small holes also permitted some alcohol to escape directly into the chamber, forming a boundary layer that further protected the wall of the chamber. This layer ignited on contact with the atmosphere, explaining the rocket\u2019s diffuse exhaust plume.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EThe first launch of an IRS A4 occurred on October 21, 1951.

A series of conferences took place at the IRS Headquarters in Florida during 1952, where new building techniques were discussed.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EIn reality, the most important point to come out of the meetings was a revolutionary discovery about transonic aerodynamics. Richard T. Whitcomb, a researcher at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), had independently discovered the so called \u201Carea rule\u201D, which would revolutionize aircraft design as a whole. Whitcomb realized that the shaping of the aircraft fuselage had to keep in mind the overall surface area of the aircraft, therefore, the fuselage should actually be narrowed where wings were present.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EThe IRS soon started working on the concept, as did others, and by late 1952 they had come up with a mock-up of a test vehicle based completely around the concept of an area rule, perhaps exaggerating the required narrowing. The aircraft was powered by two J85 turbojet engines, had swept wings, and was very unique due to the extreme narrowing of the fuselage. A series of aerodynamic tests, however, found out that the aircraft would not be able of breaking the sound barrier in level flight, albeit being quite near, reaching a projected speed of Mach 0.92 at around 10000m altitude.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 style=\u0022font-size:11pt;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EA redesign was due. In place of completely modifying the fuselage structure, which would require much time and money, a more \u201Cbrute-force\u201D approach was taken.

The telemetry transponder had also been updated from the Model 3987 to the Model 4000, which was more capable and weighed less. The payload section and parachute instead were identical to those of the Aerobee I, with the only difference being that the payload section was now modular, with cylindrical modules attachable underneath the nose cone when needed.

As the rocket burnt all of its propellant, and exited the atmosphere, it then switched to an innovative attitude control system, which vented excess nitrogen through four thrust vanes, providing for pitch and yaw, but not roll, control.

By October 1953 the first prototype of a revolutionary aircraft was flying on its own power. The engine it sported wasn\u2019t powerful enough to propel it past Mach 1 yet, and the aircraft itself would end up being slightly smaller and significantly lighter than later instances of the plane. In January 1954 the second prototype of this airplane was flying. It was identical in everything but the engine to the eventual production version. Finally, in April 1954, the \u003Ci\u003EIRS-XA-3 \u201CThunder\u201D\u003C/i\u003E was ready for action.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022xyL7HLU.png%20\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022731\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/xyL7HLU.png%20\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThunder schematic.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EThe XA-3 was the product the IRS had always hoped to achieve with the appositely named Project Thunder.

These engines had two modes of operation, a \u201Cdry\u201D one and a \u201Cwet\u201D one, the latter, also known as \u201Cafterburning\u201D mode, considerably increasing thrust at the expense of fuel efficiency. This wasn\u2019t a problem however: the XA-3 wasn\u2019t meant to achieve a combat range of sorts, its only purpose being scientific. This version of the J57 was capable of outputting a maximum of 45.4 kN of thrust when in dry mode, and 75.4 kN when at full afterburner. The maximum range of the aircraft, when flying at cruise speed, was of around 2650km.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EThe Thunder also had a new cockpit design, allowing for a pilot and a scientific officer to fly together, thus maximizing scientific potential due to pilot workload being decreased. The aircraft was also equipped with two airbrakes to help slow down due to the absence of flaps (this was due to the delta wing design). The airframe followed the area rule as closely as possible and much better than the Daemon, but the high wing loading meant for high speed landing, which required a drag chute to efficiently slow down the vessel. The design was very similar to that of the Convair F-102, although they were conceived completely independently and it was a mere coincidence that they resembled each other so much.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EThe first flight of a production Thunder occurred on April 3\u003Csup\u003Erd\u003C/sup\u003E 1954, with Captain Joe Mitchell as pilot and Senior Engineer Douglas Cherry in the rear seat, monitoring the aircraft\u2019s performance.

The specifications for such vehicle were set on February 16: they called for a payload capability of around 30-100kg to low Earth orbit (LEO), and the payload itself had to carry at least a radio transmitter capable of transmitting for three months.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EThe design competition would see not only the IRS\u2019s own teams of engineers participating, but also several private and public companies, both American and British. Still, the commission preferred for an internal design to then assign to a series of companies to build. Indeed, the invention of new tank technologies at the IRS R\u0026amp;D department, in conjunction with the ABMA, would make internal designs much better suited for a launch vehicle than any external one.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EIn the end, the IRS settled for an upgraded version of the Deacon as the lower stage, a second stage that was yet to be determined, and a solid rocket motor acting as kick stage to put the satellite into orbit. A second design phase started. The teams of engineers at the IRS, after a long study phase, proposed two designs, the first with an American-made second stage, and the other with a British-made one; they were named Alcor and Gamma, respectively. They were presented to the commission on September 28 1955.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022L83dKWx.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022731\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/L83dKWx.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003EGamma launch vehicle proposal schematic.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EThe two rockets were identical in all but the second and third stages. The lower stage was a Deacon II, a larger Deacon I with an uprated NAA-75-110 A-7 as its engine, rated for 416.2kN thrust, not burning the Ethanol-LOx mixture of the earlier A-7, instead using Hydyne, a hypergolic propellant, as fuel, while retaining the Liquid Oxygen oxidizer. This meant higher thrust and specific impulse compared to the previous mixture. The stage had a burn time of 159 seconds, which was a little over the rated burn time of the A-7, but that was a matter of little concern due to the reliability of these motors, at least under the IRS.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EThe Gamma second stage made use of the Gamma-2 rocket engine (hence the name), with a thrust of 68.23kN. This engine was being developed by Bristol-Siddeley in Britain, and it was a most unusual design. Instead of the usual Kerosene-LOx (or Ethanol-LOx, for that matter) mixture used in many rocket designs, it burned Kerosene and HTP, with a catalyst to decompose the peroxide, the resulting mixture being completely hypergolic. The stage burned for 140 seconds.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EThe Alcor second stage, instead, mounted a single AJ10-37 engine produced by Aerojet, producing 33.8kN of thrust. This rocket motor was a derivative of the engines used on the Aerobee family of rockets. It used a more conventional hypergolic mixture of UDMH and IWNA, which was nonetheless extremely toxic and required special equipment to be handled. The stage burned for 115 seconds, and was narrower in diameter when compared to the Gamma stage, 0.9m versus 1.2m diameter.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EThe third stage was to be either an Aerojet X-242 solid rocket motor burning PSPC, or a cluster of three Thiokol Baby Sergeants burning a mixture named T17-E2, depending on payload weight, with the former motor being the most powerful alternative. The Gamma rocket, instead, carried no third stage.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EThe Gamma launch vehicle was the least powerful of the two, but also the cheaper alternative. It could carry around 50kg to orbit, which was within the parameters set by the IRS for its payloads. It would also be available much sooner than the Alcor, making a launch possible by mid-1956, if everything went well. The Alcor, on the other hand, was much more powerful, being capable of carrying 75kg to orbit in its Baby Sergeant version, and a whopping 150kg to orbit in its X-242 configuration. The AJ10 also had much better development perspectives compared to the Gamma. The downside to all this were however a higher development and construction cost for the vehicle, and, most importantly, it would be available for flight later compared to the Gamma, being expected for a launch to orbit by January 1957. Considering that the Soviets were planning to launch a satellite as well, every day of delay could mean that the IRS wouldn\u2019t be the first to achieve orbit around the Earth.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EIn the end, in December 1955 the IRS committee selected the Alcor as the launch vehicle that the Society would use to launch its early satellites into orbit, citing the higher payload capability and better development future among other reasons.

It contained the main circuits that operated the probe, and, obviously, the experiments. To avoid launching an overly complicated, and therefore heavy satellite, the scientific potential of Ethereal 1 was limited to just four experiments, albeit very important, and certainly interesting, ones. Apart from the standard temperature and pressure sensors suite of Aerobee descendance, it also carried a micrometeorite detector that employed a small microphone to record the impacts on the satellite body, another micrometeorite detector in the form of erosion gauges, and, most importantly, a cosmic-ray detection package based around the Anton 314 Geiger-M\u00FCller tube, devised by Dr. James Van Allen and Dr. George Ludwig at the University of Iowa.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EThe back section, painted white, contained the satellite\u2019s batteries among a series of low-power transmitters and high-power antennas, the latter being mounted on outside of the satellite.

The name came from the classical element of ancient and medieval science, the Aether or Ether, which was regarded to be the material that fills the universe above the terrestrial sphere, i.e. above the Moon in the classical geocentric universe. Although it was argued that the satellite wasn\u2019t meant to travel beyond the Moon, not even getting close to it in reality, it was still a very fitting name for a man-made moon that was supposed to circle around the Earth in the \u201Cether\u201D of space.

The IRS and western governments congratulated themselves with the USSR, but the news came as a shock to the western people and press. Indeed, they had believed the Soviet Union to be so technologically backwards that it would never have the capability to realistically launch a satellite in the foreseeable future.

Larger batteries were also outfitted, while the antennas were the exact same as Ethereal 2.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EThe launch date for Ethereal 3 was set for April 9, 1957.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EThe rocket took off at 10:23 in the morning.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00225Q9G4iI.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/5Q9G4iI.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003EImage 19570409A: The Ethereal 3 stack is go for launch.

Plans for subsequent weather satellites had to account for the eccentricity, or orbit at lower altitudes. Unfortunately, the solar cells on the probe failed after a year of operation, abruptly putting an end to its mission.

Therefore, on April 14 1957, just days after Ethereal 3 was put into orbit, the IRS was disbanded, to be reformed into the International AeroSpace Research and Development Agency, or IASRDA for short. The Agency encompassed the nations of the US, the UK, France, Italy, West Germany, Canada, the Netherlands, Spain and Norway for the moment, but in the future many more countries would join the effort.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EA true Space Agency was born on that historic day.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022s54jfE8.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022100.00\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 width=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/s54jfE8.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003ELogo of the International AeroSpace Research and Development Agency since 1957.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-09-30T23:48:30Z\u0022 title=\u002209/30/2019 11:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 30, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Fenisse\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EHad accidentally posted, images fixed.
