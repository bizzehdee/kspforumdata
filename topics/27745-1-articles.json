I say this because at full thrust (480kn), the problem was a lot worse than at 25% throttle. Also, if I have the same probe, attached to an injection stage through a normal decoupler (I use the same probe to go to the other planets, using the boosters 3rd stage as injection stage), then this does not veer off course.

Instead of having two engines and two tanks separated by a decoupler, use one LV909 engine on an FLT400 tank, and have two FLT200 tanks on radial decouplers outside of it with the fuel piped into it. This way you save the 0.5 tonnes from the extra engine, still get the same overall fuel and stage time but a more stable platform and more deltaV out of them\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
