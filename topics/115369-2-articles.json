It gets to the point with satellite contracts that it\u0027s hard to see the probe I\u0027m flying in the map view through all of the clutter. (My workaround is to rename it and change the type to a ship so it will still show up after turning off probes on the map, then changing back when the mission is complete.) However, I will go and periodically check to see if any spent boosters have a periapsis that dips below the 70 km mark and delete those because they won\u0027t deorbit on their own unless you are actively flying it when in reality the orbit should decay eventually.\n\nI also don\u0027t like wasting time. If a mission will be awhile, I\u0027ll go back to the space center and do something else. Nine days to Minmus? I can fill six contracts while it\u0027s en route. Makes me feel like I\u0027m running an efficient operation. However, I prefer to not launch at night unless there\u0027s a reason (I\u0027m trying to hit a specific launch window, for example), so I\u0027ll advance to the next morning then.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I only ever use \u0022Abort\u0022 to eject fairings, never for its stated purpose of aborting a launch.\n\nI use abort to extend antennas. Another quirk of mine is that I like to have everything deployed while in space - extended antennas, solar panels, and open service bays. But antennas will retract after transmitting data and you can\u0027t extend them again through the right-click menu. Action groups still work though, and I don\u0027t otherwise use abort for it\u0027s intended purpose."},{"CreatedByName":"annallia","CreatedById":75681,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T18:25:22Z","Content":"I just recently started forbidding myself to time warp. \n\nI have 17 days yet till the next Duna window, in 12 days I will start crewing my ship (ship is ready just needs crew and fuel) but until then I work on other projects, once it begins its journey to Duna I will also be working on other projects instead of time warping my way through. \n\nI used to just be like \u0022Oh hey 32 days till Duna no problem change orbit and timewarp, change back to a lower orbit and go\u0022 then I would time warp my entire trip there (dropping out only if course correction needed) until it was time to start my breaking burn.
