Then pitch up about 30 degrees, and throttle back as you climb. With the intakes you have, you can maintain 1/3 throttle at 30 km. Go as high as you can, until your vertical velocity starts to get low; transition to rockets then. You can run both rockets and jets at the same time for a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Close the intakes when you transition to rockets. That will reduce drag quite significantly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- On re-entry, you only need to get the periapsis down into the atmosphere, and let your orbit decay. In other words, you had extra fuel left. Pitch down as you reenter to have lift suck you further into the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConstruction tips: the lower your mass (and drag), the faster and higher you can go off the jets. Also, the lower your mass, the less rocket fuel you need. Eventually, you can get so light that you can use lighter rocket engines, and save even more mass. It all snowballs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConstruction tips about your jet stage: when you transition to rockets, your airframe is currently 3540 kg not counting the rocket engines and rocket fuel tanks, and the cross-section area is 0.271 units not counting the wings or rocket bits. You can save 890 kg of that, and reduce the area to 0.106:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Use the Mk2 cockpit rather than the Mk1 cockpit. Saves 250 kg, and has lower drag (despite the visual appearance). Unfortunately you lose the nice cockpit view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Use an Mk2 fuselage rather than the Mk1 fuselage. Your jet fuel at the transition to rockets had a mass of 350 kg dry mass \u002B 380 kg fuel = 730 kg total. The same flight with an Mk2 would have 200 dry \u002B 430 fuel = 630 total. Saves 100kg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- In fact, given how much fuel you had left, you could use a \u0022Mk2 to size 1 Adapter\u0022. You\u0027ll have 100 kg dry \u002B 30 kg fuel = 130kg. Saves another 500 kg. This part of the advice conflicts with the flatter flight profile; it might not work out unless you save enough fuel from lightening up the airframe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A pair of ram intakes rather than 6 radials will save you a bit of mass, but get you just as much air. Saves 40 kg. Intakes have very high drag at speed, so while this looks like small potatoes, it significantly improves your top speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERocket stage tips: your rocket bits currently are at 6,625 kg and provide 100 kN of thrust at Isp 390. This gives you a TWR of 1 at your 25km transition at 1 km/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Use the 48-7S rather than the LV-909. Saves 800 kg, reduces thrust to 60 kN at Isp 350. Your TWR is now 0.72, but given the other changes you\u0027ll be much higher and faster: at least 30 km if not 35 km, and 1.5 km/s. So you should be fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Bring much less fuel. Then you will get even higher and faster off the jets, and your rocket TWR will be higher.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"immelman","CreatedById":90345,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-11T07:12:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMinmus and back to the KSC, far too exciting at the landing with a couple of minutes fuel left:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETakeoff:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3vdbgw7.png\u0022 alt=\u00223vdbgw7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnwards and outwards:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FPNjzIS.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FPNjzIS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinmus:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ynr1sMx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ynr1sMx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack at the KSC (just)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lxHpomi.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lxHpomi.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-11T16:11:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your mission report immelman, glad you made it back and congratulations on your \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EAdvanced Pilot Precision Award and Astrokerbal Distinction for your Minmus landing with your twin aerojet with single aerospike design (does it have a name?)
