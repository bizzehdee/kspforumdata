Also, it only allows one direction modification. If you try to move it a different direction, it resets back to the center of the root part again.\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nExample: Fixed landing gear - when attaching fixed landing gear (the non-steerable ones) to the side of the fuselage, they will reset to the center of the fuselage if you try to move them with the offset tool. You can move it in X,Y, or Z but only once. If you attempt to move it again in any direction, it resets to the center of the fuselage.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDead stick: Multiple times I have been dead in space or flying unable to do anything though the game continues to function (ie: it didn\u0027t freeze but I can\u0027t control the craft). Exiting the game and coming back will either lose progress and start me before launch or start me where I was with fully control restored.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUnable to select parts: This was a new problem I saw yesterday and was really annoying. I was trying to perform an experiment in a limited window of opportunity and was having an extremely hard time selecting objects to interact with them. Tapped \u0027B\u0027 multiple times just to get the interaction menu to open.\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nSequence was open my storage, take a pressure measurement, and close the storage. Took multiple \u0027B\u0027 presses to open the storage, multiple \u0027B\u0027 presses to measure pressure, and some time and multiple \u0027B\u0027 presses to close storage.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDifferent than dead stick issue since this will actually select parts eventually, just significant delay sometimes.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSpeeding time up yields different results than regular speed: I tried different experiments with this and found that increasing time causes unstable flight in the atmosphere.\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nI was able to successfully get my aircraft to a happy place that will stay within a small altitude window (As speed increases, plane eventually gains altitude until speed\u00A0drops to a specific speed in which it loses altitude. Cycle repeats)\u00A0and fly that way for\u00A020-30 minutes without touching the controller (fuel loss eventually upsets the balance). Repeated the flight and observed the same behavior for 5 minutes before hitting time warp. Within a few minutes \u0022game time\u0022, the plane was nose diving towards the earth. Went to normal time and was able to successfully bring the plane back to its happy place and observed again for 5 minutes.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt is possible to get the plane in a happy place with time speed increases; however, its different than normal speed.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is all for now. So far, the game has a much different feel with a controller than with a keyboard. For the most part, I like it \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"erikinthebakery","CreatedById":166663,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-19T01:04:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can add this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLately I\u0027ve been somehow selecting parts of my spacecraft while in the Map view.
