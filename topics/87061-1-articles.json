Before .25, has been playable but with predictable crashes to desktop when switching back to the VAB or hitting the RECOVER tab. First time playing .25, it automatically shrunk the window size but worked well and seemed to have eliminated the crashes somehow! Tried playing it today, and now it crashes constantly when loading the same saved career. Can\u0027t even get the actual game to start. Older system I know, but has been working pretty well until this version. (4gigs ram, nvidia GTX550 TI video card, core2duo e6750 2.67 ghz, 32 bit OS). Does the .25 update add to the Ram use that significantly, or will this be addressed in upcoming patch(es)?
