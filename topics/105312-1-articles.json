The Pro/Retrograde vector seems to be of by a bit. When the SAS is told to hold one of this vectors it is always off. Here you have two screenshots with this behaviour:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cXqklou.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cXqklou.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QUzBnLe.png\u0022 alt=\u0022QUzBnLe.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also results in destroyed pods while deorbinting, because I\u0027am coming down siteways, when I disable SAS and let the aerodynamics do its job. While going down siteways the new reentry heating is not very friendly to my pod.
