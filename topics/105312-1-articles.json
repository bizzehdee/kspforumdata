The Pro/Retrograde vector seems to be of by a bit. When the SAS is told to hold one of this vectors it is always off. Here you have two screenshots with this behaviour:\n\n![cXqklou.png](http://i.imgur.com/cXqklou.png)![QUzBnLe.png](http://i.imgur.com/QUzBnLe.png)\n\nThis also results in destroyed pods while deorbinting, because I\u0027am coming down siteways, when I disable SAS and let the aerodynamics do its job. While going down siteways the new reentry heating is not very friendly to my pod. I also have a image showing this for you:\n\n![b1w4tFY.png](http://i.imgur.com/b1w4tFY.png)\n\nI don\u0027t know if I\u0027m the only one having this problems, but it would be nice if someone could have a look at it.\n\nGreetings,\n\nNawabu"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T20:22:44Z","Content":"SAS is not working properly, it\u0027s worst with a small light vessel especially if it has a lot of reaction wheels, I\u0027ve not seen it off as far as in your pics but it can do that from time to time.\n\nWe\u0027re hoping to bother the devs enough for this to be fixed for 1.01"},{"CreatedByName":"Nawabu","CreatedById":141883,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T20:27:00Z","Content":"Sadly it is not only the SAS system which is off. In the third image SAS is shut off and only the drag force of the aerodynamics system is causing my pod to deorbit sideways and not on the retrograde vector."}]}
