I see nowhere in your post about \u0022realistic\u0022 which is probably good because realistic KSP is not, and I\u0027m not just talking about all the complaints about the aerodynamic model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I mean is that your typical airplane doesn\u0027t fill the fuselage with fuel, it fills the wings. There may also be tanks inside the fuselage, but it depends on the plane. Also, the compressor section of intakes are always inline with the engines. The only parts of intakes that don\u0027t have to be inline would be the actual inlet and ducting. Also, most planes don\u0027t duct hot intake air through a fuel tank (i.e. putting an intake on the front of a Mk-1 with an engine on the back). I can continue on but like I said, a bit of realism needs to be suspended for KSP (or just about any game for that matter).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn either case as far as \u0022cheaty\u0022 goes, my personal opinion is that is entirely up to you. I can share my own cutoffs for you, but with an open ended game like KSP cheating is all relative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, 30:1 intake ratio seems very excessive to \u003Cem\u003Eme\u003C/em\u003E. I typically aim for about 3:1, but certainly you can even get away with 1:1. In my experimenting, I found that going past 3:1 starts to degrade things I care about (such as time). It also gets to the point where you have to start doubling the intakes to get much performance increase. So the next descent step after 3:1 is 6:1, then 12:1. So that\u0027s really what I based my 3:1 decision on (rather than arbitrarily picking a number). Either way, there is no strict definition of \u0022air hogging\u0022 and it becomes a matter of someone looking at a design and saying, \u0022Holy cow, look at all those intakes!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for clipping, I usually only do what the editor allows me to get away with. With maybe the exception that I won\u0027t try to fold tanks back in on themselves. Some fuel tanks will let you do that, even with the default editor clipping. I guess I avoid things that are physically unrealistic, but you could justify just about any design choice. Most of the other clipping I do is for cosmetics, such as using the tail boom fuselage piece to blend an engine or intake into the side of a fuselage. Again, any level of \u0022cheating\u0022 is really what limitations you care to impose upon yourself (or what the Kraken will impose on you).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Ninja\u0027d by Taki and Kasuha.
