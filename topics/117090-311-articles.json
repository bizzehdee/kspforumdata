Shouldn\u0027t be too hard to figure out if you truly need one though, or perhaps someone else might chime in who has already created one.\n\nHowever, as [@tater](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119411-tater/) states, the stand-alone \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E blocks now support fuel type switching -- you can use either MP or hypergols (and with config edits/patches, you can add whatever you want).\n\nIn the near future the station-core, modular-upper-stage, and modular-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003Esrb\u003C/abbr\u003E (upper-stage variant), will all be getting \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel-type controls as well.  This was part of the announcement earlier today (though might have taken some inference to figure out).\n\nSo, if it is something you are truly interested in, I would suggest waiting a week or two before starting to use those parts.  The current parts will likely be receiving breaking changes in the next release(s), -and- the parts you are interested in should at that time be switchable to mono-prop.\n\nAnother side-line enhancement from the upcoming plugin overhaul will be the ability to break (and repair) solar panels.  The truly neat part?  You\u0027ll be able to break individual panels on a multi-panel-equipped part, and it will track the status of each one individually.  Will also be able to specify different EC/s rates for each suncatcher in a multi-suncatcher setup -- so a single part may integrate multiple different types of solar panels and have them all simulated properly (or as close as it gets for solar panels in KSP).  This will also allow for \u0027back-facing\u0027 suncatchers on some solar panel models with reduced efficiency rates, as recent research on my part has found sources stating that the back-sides of many solar panels can put out up to 60% of the charge of the front-side (no more SC-A-SM\u0027s running out of juice...).\n\nAs far as animations go, nothing too major to report for enhancements there aside from better support for \u0027deploy limit\u0027 for anything with an animation (optional, may not be enabled everywhere).  This will be of most use on the upcoming cargo-bay parts, for both the bay-doors, as well as the nose/mount deployment options.\n\n(This is why I have kept this mod in \u0027development\u0027 status for so long -- occasionally things need to be broken and rebuilt in the name of progress)\n\nEdit:  Quick question while I\u0027m working on it -- scaling solar panels on the Service Module and Satellite Core parts?  Easier to integrate the scaling code now while I\u0027m rewriting things, and solar panel stats are relatively simple to scale up/down.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-05T02:06:04Z\u0022 title=\u002212/05/2017 02:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 5, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"TimberWolffe","CreatedById":119811,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-05T02:06:56Z","Content":"Cheers for that info guys, I missed the post about the update.
