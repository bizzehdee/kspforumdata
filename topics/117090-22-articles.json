So, single part, no joints to worry about ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAnd they work very well so far. Tested the F1 cluster/Saturn-V mount last night, and it had no problems regarding stability (needs some better effects though; not nearly impressive enough, and balance/stats are still WIP).\n\nRegaring engine balance....\n\nI\u0027m trying to come up with the initial set of functions/algorithsm/derivative for deriving KSP stats for the engines from their real world stats, at least for the basis of their stats (can always manually adjust the final stats). Seems like there are two/three things to balance: ISP, Thrust, and Mass (actually, raw TWR; mass will derive from a specific aimed TWR range).\n\nISP - Obviously I cannot use the real-world ISP values for many engines, as they fall outside of the range of stock ISP values (mostly higher). What I would propose would be to basically rescale the ISPs based on a custom-derived curve with endpoints set by the stock ISP range. For example, real-world vacuum ISP ranges from ~310 (f1, hypergolic fuels), to ~465 (rl-10b, lh2). KSP liquid fueled ISPs range from ~ 250 (puff mono engine) to 350 (poodle). Basically I would \u0027normalize\u0027 the KSP ISPs for the engine given the existing ISP range; e.g. the F1 is one of the lowest ISP real-world engines, and as such would be at the very bottom of the KSP ISP scale, @ 250 (give or take). Whereas the SSME/RS-25 is near the top of the range (455 vac), so it would be mapped to the top of the KSP-ISP range (345-350). Would do the same for the the sea-level ISP. This seems like a fairly comprehensive and decently-balanced method for \u0027balancing\u0027 the engines ISP vs. stock. Open to suggestions/improvments/tweaks though.\n\nNow, the vacuum thrust and mass are actually the tricker/touchier subject (SLT will derive from vac thrust and ISP delta). What would you feel is an acceptable scalar value to apply for the thrust from the real world values? It seems that stock is aiming for a 1/3\u0027ish ratio (based on screenshots of their RS-25, with ~700kn of thrust; about 1/3 the value of the real-world ~2200). However, I also have no idea what scale they have done their engine in. Using a 1/3 value would also result in some fairly wimpy engines. Stranger yet is their KR-2L engine with its 2000 thrust, and incredible ISP. Some \u0027strange\u0027 balance stuff going on in stock, to be sure. \n\nAlso, when I was looking over my \u0027real world engine stats\u0027 sheet, I realized that I had the SC-B-ENG clusters with really close to the real-world thrust for the RS-25 (I had 2000, vs the ~2200 of the real one) (was the only way to get it to lift the kinds of loads it needed to). So... I may leave the existing parts as-is, but the new RS-25 engine/clusters will have much lower thrust, using whatever method/function we decide upon. The lack of LH2 as a fuel further complicates this balancing; in order to be able to lift a near-proper-scaled KSP-SLS (using LFO), these engine clusters need gobs of thrust, due to the density of the fuel used (and they need gobs of fuel due to poor ISP).\n\nHmm... quite stuck on the thrust bit at the moment. Perhaps I\u0027ll scale the vac thrust as a deriviative of the raw isp-scaled ISP delta (e.g. if new isp==75% of old ISP, new thrust ==75% of old thrust?). Though, this seems a bit of a naive/heavy-handed/blunt approach. Yep, still stuck. Most of the problem is that I don\u0027t want to \u0027nerf\u0027 the SC-B lifting capacity too much with the new engine clusters. Though, I suppose it was a bit absurd lifting 300t with that design, when the real world one will struggle for ~150. So, it might be inevitable that it will have a reduced upper-range capacity; though this might even make it a more viable launcher for the CSM stack as well (currently it is OP/overkill to use just for the CSM). Some of the other new engines might also offer new opportunities to gain back some of this capacity; such as using the F1b liquid-boosters.\n\nThoughts? Ideas? Suggestions?\n\nTo even further complicate things, after I decide upon the thrust of the engine, I need to decide what TWR range that I should aim for. Real world TWRs go upwards of 150. KSP stock TWRs\u0027 max out at 27 (for the mammoth engine cluster). To come anywhere near close to this poor of a TWR ratio, every single one of these engines will end up weighing quite a bit more than the real-world engine does even though the engine is scaled down/visually smaller. Yes, those Kerbals must be building out of some sort of super-dense steel-unobtanium alloy. For example; the real SSME only weights ~2.5t, and puts out 2200kn of thrust (~88 TWR). The most powerful stock engine weighs 15t and only puts out 4000kn of thrust (~26.66 TWR); given the same amount of thrust (~2000), a KSP engine would still weigh more than 3 times the real article (7.5t for 2000kn, 26.66 TWR) .\n\nAnd... one further layer of complication on the balancing -- I need to differentiate many engines according to where they will be on the tech tree (or place them on the tree based on their stats, one way or the other). So, will need a few engines that are pretty much obsoleted by mid-game, and a few mid-game engines that get upgraded/obsoleted by end-game. Ideally I would find a good niche for each of these engines where they are not fully obsoleted (or use some sort of usage-based incremental improvements as was suggested previously).\n\nEdit:\n\nPretty much finished F1 texture:\n\n![M1hwkSe.png](http://i.imgur.com/M1hwkSe.png)\n\nI\u0027m certainly getting faster (though perhaps not any better) at doing these textures.

Have learned a few new tricks in the past week or two that is making things... so much faster and less painful - like how to auto-generate a good UV-seam-mask from the UV layout, and apply that to noise/etc textures, pretty much eliminating visible seams, all while allowing for even more crazy (or organic) unwrapping to be used which itself speeds up the unwrapping process.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-04T16:39:44Z\u0022 title=\u002211/04/2015 04:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T16:58:59Z","Content":"First of all great to hear on the engine fairings/mounts. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nSecond of all, VenomousRequiem is a GIRL!?\n\nVR: Just to let you know, I\u0027m not criticizing you or saying only guys play KSP, just a little surprised. \n\nPS: Congrats, your the second 3d modeler I know (first being my cousin\u0027s GF).\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nAlso, on the subject of Stockalike.

So the higher thrust, the more mass and then lower isp. Most of engines were quite balanced. Also you might consider adding delay to thrust change; I also liked this thing in KW rocketry - the biggest engines had helluva delay so they couldn\u0027t be used efficiently for vac operations, also the delay meant that they used a bit of fuel before getting to 100% thrust and lift off thus further reducing their effective isp.\n\nI wouldn\u0027t take KR-2L, or the biggest engine as isp point of reference; for me their isp is weird and they are too op; so I would expect that squad might nerf them sooner or later.

In this way every engine had its purpose.\n\nAnother (maybe future), more complicated approach would be to divide engines into RP-1/LOX and LH2/LOX (and CH4/LOX?). Then introduce new fuel tanks for that engines (LH2 being much bigger/heavier for the same amount mass of fuel etc), or add another fuel config (LH2/LH2\u002BOx)for your existing tanks. You can see what Nertea did in his LH2/LOX cryogenic engines mod; from what I remember at least for vacuum engines, the higher isps were offset by higher tank mass so in the end vac engines were maybe 5-7% better dV-wise than their counterparts. I think that for SL engines LH2 and LF engines have similar performance so I think personally I wouldn\u0027t bother using them since it meant higher, more unstable rockets (with bigger 1st stage) with the same performance."},{"CreatedByName":"JoseEduardo","CreatedById":127759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T18:26:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Oh lord I\u0027m so excited...

Have learned a few new tricks in the past week or two that is making things... so much faster and less painful - like how to auto-generate a good UV-seam-mask from the UV layout, and apply that to noise/etc textures, pretty much eliminating visible seams, all while allowing for even more crazy (or organic) unwrapping to be used which itself speeds up the unwrapping process.\n\n![krVuuP1.gif](http://i.imgur.com/krVuuP1.gif)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E the texturing looks amazing Shadow, I\u0027ll have to ask you for a quick tips\u0027n\u0027tricks tutorial one day ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\u003E as for ISP/thrust/mass stuff - personally I liked a kind of simple approach of KW rocketry mod. So the higher thrust, the more mass and then lower isp. Most of engines were quite balanced. Also you might consider adding delay to thrust change; I also liked this thing in KW rocketry - the biggest engines had helluva delay so they couldn\u0027t be used efficiently for vac operations, also the delay meant that they used a bit of fuel before getting to 100% thrust and lift off thus further reducing their effective isp.\n\u003E \n\u003E I wouldn\u0027t take KR-2L, or the biggest engine as isp point of reference; for me their isp is weird and they are too op; so I would expect that squad might nerf them sooner or later. You might take a look at awesome but not updated anymore rebalance of engines by stupid\\_chris:\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/75272-0-24-x-Stock-ReBalance-v1-4-11-09-14](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/75272-0-24-x-Stock-ReBalance-v1-4-11-09-14)\n\u003E \n\u003E I used this mod extensively when I used to play KSP (hehe)\n\u003E \n\u003E I think that he basically downgraded isp of largest engines and upgraded smaller engines so they all followed the rule - bigger engine - higher thrust - less isp. In this way every engine had its purpose.\n\u003E \n\u003E Another (maybe future), more complicated approach would be to divide engines into RP-1/LOX and LH2/LOX (and CH4/LOX?). Then introduce new fuel tanks for that engines (LH2 being much bigger/heavier for the same amount mass of fuel etc), or add another fuel config (LH2/LH2\u002BOx)for your existing tanks. You can see what Nertea did in his LH2/LOX cryogenic engines mod; from what I remember at least for vacuum engines, the higher isps were offset by higher tank mass so in the end vac engines were maybe 5-7% better dV-wise than their counterparts. I think that for SL engines LH2 and LF engines have similar performance so I think personally I wouldn\u0027t bother using them since it meant higher, more unstable rockets (with bigger 1st stage) with the same performance.\n\nI agree the delay would be a nice feature, but the optional config files for not having them, like KW does, would be good too\n\nabout using real fuels, what about a MM patch for using RealFuels instead? Shadowmage already made his plugin to communicate with RO/RF, so that is a thing that already works, maybe a MM patch for a stockalike RF config could be offered for those willing to use non-stock fuels but also not interested in having RO?"}]}
