But the signal takes time to reach the probe. So be careful how you approach outer planets and the timing of your instructions.\n\nTo start with, these instructions could be quite generic.\n\nI think this opens a different way of playing this game.\n\nLordCorwin"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T22:35:35Z","Content":"RemoteTech models signal delay in that fashion, and has a rudimentary flight computer to do things when out of contact with a crewed command center.
