It\u0027s carrying six \u0022Sandstone\u0022 probes - an OKTO2 core w/Z-200 batt, two RTGs, a couple of science packages, an antenna, a 48-7S engine and an FL-T400 tank, 5,697 m/s delta-V in each probe if I\u0027ve done all the math right - with the goal of putting one probe in orbit of each of Jool\u0027s moons plus Jool itself; the carrier will be taking a planetary dive when the job\u0027s done. Sounds like I\u0027m trying to do the same thing as the OP; I\u0027m also interested in \u0022how do you do it\u0022 and will be comparing notes as time passes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe carrier itself consists of a large RCU w/ Z-4 battery pack, 2 RTGs, an RCS system (due to the mass of the whole thing), 8 BZ-52s w/ 6 stack decouplers (to attach each probe radially; the other two are mountpoints for the engines), 2 LV-Ns w/ a girder setup for attachment to the booster and an orange tank. 5800 m/s of delta-V for the whole shebang. Thrust sucks of course but it did get me to Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
