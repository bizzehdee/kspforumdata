Do you see that waypoint in the Tracking Station?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you using the latest \u0022Reborn\u0022 version of the contract pack? The mod was originally developed by SeveredSolo, then adopted, then adopted again by LinuxGuruGamer. See link below for the latest version. The thread title says 1.9.x but I\u0027ve used it with 1.12.5.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main limitation with the Reborn version in my usage is that orbital stations require separate \u0022control\u0022 and \u0022habitation\u0022 modules (earlier versions only looked at crew count). The contracts recognize stock parts plus the SSPXr mod, but other mods with station parts can\u0027t satisfy the \u0022habitation\u0022 requirement. I use alt-f12 to force the contract complete for stations that satisfy the spirit of the contract. That cheat hasn\u0027t triggered any downstream problems that I\u0027ve noticed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022129964\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed4414953228\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/175822-19x-contract-pack-bases-and-stations-reborn/?do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:220px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
