Is there a way to keep it with 12-hour rotations speeds?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the orbital velocities change if you adjust the rotation speeds (such as by slowing down Kerbin\u0027s rotation) and also change the planetary gravity to match (lower rotational speed requires lower total gravity for the same surface-gravity) my orbits should be messed up if I update the RSS 64K version without keeping the speed of Kerbin\u0027s rotation the same... (if the save still loads at all)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, any reason you slowed down Kerbin\u0027s rotation? The 6.4x scale-up (technically LESS than 64% scale since stock is 1/11th of real size, not 1/10th) and 12-hour rotation matched well: with a 24-hour day Kerbin has a SLOWER rotation speed that Earth, and the resulting decrease in orbital velocities (while still requiring the same Delta-V to get to orbit) actually should make the game a little bit harder by increasing Delta-V requirements relative to the scale (thanks to reduced benefits from the Oberth Effect...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EP.S.\u003C/strong\u003E Notice I didn\u0027t say the Delta-V requirements are larger than real life: because they aren\u0027t- they\u0027re less. However with a full-sized solar system and rockets, it\u0027s easier to get a craft with more Delta-V to orbit as a rocket at 2x the scale (I\u0027ve pointed this out before, KSP rockets are only 40-50% real scale not 64%- using the relative size of Delta IV and SLS part-analogs as a reference... Delta IV is 5 meters in real life, the Jumbo-64 tank which is the analog for its main fuel tank is 2.5 meters in KSP. SLS has a 8.4 meter core stage in real life, 3.75 meters in KSP...) has 4x the cross-sectional area and 2x the height, for 8x the total mass! The crew capsules in KSP also have roughly equivalent masses to the real things, but are only 40-50% the volume, and thus are much heavier relative to the stock KSP rockets... (Realism Overhaul adjusts the crew capsule masses and volumes to match the real thing)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, when payloads are the same mass, for a rocket of as little as 8.9% the total mass as in real life (a stock SLS with RealFuels installed will only have 8.9% the total mass, as it is 44.6% the real life scale), you end up with an EQUALLY hard game even if Delta-V requirements are reduced from 10 km/s to 7.8 km/s (7.5 km/s is unrealistic to expect- I\u0027ve tried it many times and it requires a rate of pitchover during the gravity-turn that is impossible to do safely with FAR installed... In a realistic-sized Kerbin with full-scale rockets, your rockets have better ballistic coefficients due to their much larger size and a larger altitude gap from surface to the edge of the atmosphere to turn through, so the gravity-turn for an optimal ascent is *MUCH* less challenging...) The Realfuels Stockalike engines also have a MUCH inferior ratio of thrust to cross-sectional area: real rockets produce 2-3x the Thrust for the same TWR and cross-sectional area (8x or more total thrust for the direct analogs- but they have 4x the cross-sectional area), whereas the Real Engines config copies real values, so you can actually lift a 2-3x taller and 2x wider rocket with the *SAME* engines in a full-scale RSS install...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-07T00:22:07Z\u0022 title=\u002202/07/2015 12:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tellion","CreatedById":116794,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-07T12:28:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am getting a little problem with the KSC switcher: Once I switch to another launch site than the KSC, switching back to it will cause half of the terrain around it to disappear.
