not a representative (ie. random as well as large enough) sample of the player population, so that feedback can differ greatly from the whole player base in many ways (overly positive, overly negative, overly divisive, too quiet, too much interest divergence, etc.).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut if there\u0027s no effective feedback, ie. giving us a real alpha/beta release with enough time and resources to listen to any feedback and take measures considering it, it\u0027s all on them.\u00A0 The game may have a unified creative vision, which is vital, but the developer team is effectively just another non-representative sample from the player base.\u00A0 What they think of KSP 2 can be too far from what the players will think of the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way around this conundrum is to honestly and critically examine all feedback, from both the developers themselves and the player base who respond--like we are
