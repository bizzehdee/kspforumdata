The journey to each world is fun, but once you get there it\u0027s just another box checked and another bucketful of science. There\u0027s just not much to see, do, and learn from each place. I\u0027d like to see an extension to the current science reports: in the R\u0026amp;D complex there could be an in-game encyclopedia that fills in as you explore various worlds. It would basically read like wikipedia, but funnier and with a kerbal spin on things added. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would help to get over the \u0022Been there done that\u0022 feeling you get after playing for awhile. Right now there\u0027s not all that much difference between Moho and Eeloo except the route you take to get there (which, don\u0027t get me wrong, makes them both a lot of fun. A couple times.) Usually by the time you\u0027re capable of reaching either of them, you\u0027ve unlocked most of the tech tree anyway, science points don\u0027t mean a whole lot, and you have more funds than you could ever reasonably spend. If there\u0027s a story to be found on every world that can\u0027t be found anywhere else, it would give me a reason to explore more thoroughly and make the Kerbol system feel much fuller and more interesting than it currently does. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would also add some realism and believability to the science system; you\u0027ll still have the gameplay required \u0022analyze soil sample, learn to build a new rocket engine\u0022 weirdness, but you\u0027d also get some actual and relevant information that could conceivably be gained from such a soil sample. It wouldn\u0027t have to be limited just to that world\u0027s article either; for example, information gained from minmus could show up in the Kerbin article about things like tides or hypotheses about their formation. Information learned from dres could enlighten kerbal scientists about how planets form and the overall origins of the Kerbol system (can you tell I\u0027ve been reading about the Dawn mission?). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdunno, just a thought. Beyond the time required to write the lore (which would be a lot, though it could draw heavily from real world wiki pages), it doesn\u0027t seem like it would be all that hard to implement. Just a UI for reading and some checks on which experiements have been performed. Zero impact on gameplay balance, too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-04T17:29:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIsn\u0027t that what the science library supposed to do? Your research data kind of tell a story about the planet formation, and piecing together the data across multiple instrument results helps letting you see a better picture.

And then with all of the data found on every biome, the player can have more or less a larger picture about the planet\u0027s history and formation, which may lend itself to a story that is open to interpretation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinding alloys and detecting some plastics on surface may hinted at a long gone civilization unlike earth, or perhaps it is just something that just happened in nature. The players can pierces together the clues they find and interpret it in their own way, then their imagination may take the rest. The artifacts and anomalies already existing in the stock game also helps with this, kick starting a story in their mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean, instead of just simply unlock a pre-written story, I think it is more fun to put the players in the role of the researchers themselves, by interpreting the data available to them and come to a conclusion they are satisfied with. Also it takes very little words to tell a much larger story that is open ended and involve players as active participant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough that might just be my thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-04T20:38:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEither version sounds good to me!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
