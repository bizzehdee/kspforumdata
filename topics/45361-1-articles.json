Finding life that uses water as solvent tells us \u003Cem\u003Enothing\u003C/em\u003E about the rest of the universe. Finding life that uses some other solvent gives us information. Not finding life on Titan would also give us some information, something to think about in terms of reasons why it\u0027s not there, but it isn\u0027t much, I grant you. But science is all about the long shots. Looking for things that don\u0027t work the way you expect. Scientists at particle accelerators aren\u0027t looking for ways to confirm standard theory. They are looking for places where it doesn\u0027t work, fully expecting to find nothing, which is what will happen most of the time. And when you find nothing, you move on. But if you do find a contradiction, if you do find an exception to the rule, that\u0027s where all the science happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may find life on Mars, or Europa, or Enceladus. But that will tell you next to nothing. It\u0027s like finding a new way to demonstrate that gravity works. It\u0027d be really neat if you can find some novel way to do it, but we learn nothing. Nothing changes. Compared to that, looking for some way in which gravity might not work the way we all think it does is an effort better spent, even though you are most likely not to come up with anything. Just the same, search for life on Titan would be far more productive even if we were all but convinced that we would find nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking for life in unlikely places is very important. We already checked the Moon and have a pretty good idea about some other vacant rocks in space. We found nothing there. So barren rocks don\u0027t work for life. If the requirement for life is liquid water, then pretty much anything out there can be closely approximated here on Earth, and we already can look for life in unlikely places here on Earth. (And we found it almost everywhere.) But Titan provides us with a totally unique environment. It is an unlikely place for life, at least anything like Earth\u0027s life, and yet has many of the features required by some form of life in principle. That is the place to look. That is the place that has potential for most knowledge gained. It might turn out to be a wasted effort, but it is the highest possible payoff for roughly equivalent investment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbin Dallas Multipass","CreatedById":79477,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-09T04:20:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@K^2p\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHm.

Actual bacteria can survive all that. The trick is being really small, making them extremely resistant to extreme accelerations. And we do have extremophiles here on Earth that can survive the entire ride. In all likelihood, this has happened.

But that\u0027s kind of the whole question here. Panspermia aside, if we confirm life in liquid water, we are right back to our standard habitable zone definitions. Nothing new, really. If we find life that survives in liquid methane without water at all, then we are talking a whole new ball game. If water as solvent isn\u0027t critical, if all you need is some kind of solvent, we suddenly go from some systems having potentially habitable worlds to most systems having habitable worlds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIsn\u0027t that a discovery worth hunting for?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDifference between life on ice moons and earth, also diferent ice moons would show if life happen once or multiple times.
