Both of these revolve around toggling one or more of four engines utilizing the 2, 4, 6, and 8 custom control keys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first is used in my Titan-Mule craft on the Spaceport. It utilizes five engines configured with one LV-T45 engine in the center, and four LV-T30 engines next to the center engine shown as such:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zUog4Fo.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022zUog4Fo.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach of the four LV-T30 engines is put on individually so they can each be set to one of the four aforesaid action groups. The key that is associated with the engine can be found by looking at the numpad: 2 is the front engine, 4 is the left engine, 6 is the right engine, and 8 is the back engine. When any button is pressed during burning, this shifts the center of thrust, causing the rocket to pitch to the respective side. By counter toggling the opposite engine, juggling it until it is almost perfectly stable, and double tapping the ASAS toggle to reset the position, the gimbal of the center engine should be sufficient to keep the craft stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second is a sort of inverse to the first. In this system, you use four of the Rockomax 24-77 engines facing outward high up from your center of mass as shown here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OZJGzlL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022OZJGzlL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce again, each of the 24-77 engines is put on individually to allow for individual action grouping, however the keys that are bound are the inverse of the first idea: 8 is the front engine, 6 is the left engine, 4 is the right engine, and 2 is the back engine. This is because whereas the first system worked by shutting of an engine, this system works by turning on an engine. By counter toggling the opposite engine, juggling it until it is almost perfectly stable, and double tapping the ASAS toggle to reset the position, the gimbal of the center engine should be sufficient to keep the craft stable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Luis","CreatedById":55075,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-17T07:14:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis looks interesting but I\u0027ll confess I don\u0027t understand what problem you\u0027re trying to solve.

Is this just for launch?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea started out simply to make a rocket design which gives a lot of pitch control, but doesn\u0027t use RCS, or have winglets high up on the craft. The first idea is relatively simple to fly, since due to the central gimballed engine, and (I think) the drag/lift on the winglets at the very bottom, it doesn\u0027t roll. The second design I had just recently came up with, and I wanted to see if I could improve on the first, as the disadvantage of the first design is that you are shutting off one of your main boosting rockets, and therefore losing thrust. The second design keeps you from losing that thrust, and is a lot faster than the first design, at the expense of a bit more fuel lost.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Themohawkninja","CreatedById":9628,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-17T13:51:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RawChicken\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RawChicken\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI tried this, it is a good idea, but once you are out or control, dealing with witch number is which side of the vessel is a nightmare\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I must confess that I have panicked sometimes, and not pressed the right key to disable an engine (mainly with the second design), and it flipped over.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"3_bit","CreatedById":52836,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-17T14:17:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would question the ease of use.... but with a post count like yours... if only we could wire action groups for momentary-on and to WASD keys.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Themohawkninja","CreatedById":9628,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-17T14:46:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00223_bit\u0022 data-cite=\u00223_bit\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI would question the ease of use.... but with a post count like yours... if only we could wire action groups for momentary-on and to WASD keys.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second one isn\u0027t as easy as the first one, but I\u0027ve only tried it with one rocket design, so I\u0027m sure I could make a more stable version.
