I felt that learning how to soft-land is far more useful than learning the intricacies of multi-stage rockets, which is why I opted for a single-stage lunar lander using them. The latter trick you\\\u0027re going to learn pretty much as a function of just trying to get off of Kerbin using the default parts. The former you\\\u0027ll only learn by either practicing on Kerbin or successfully getting to the Mun. And trust me, it is FAR more frustrating to finally get to the Mun after hours, days, or even weeks of trying only to crash horribly because you never learned the workings of how to soft-land...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-12-07T17:34:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyup... took me 10 attempts to land on the Mun successfully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve knew the most crucial thing while landing (the navball markers) after watching a certain Munar landing vid actually \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mindvr","CreatedById":6249,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-12-12T07:53:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\\\u0027t want to make another Mun topic, so I\\\u0027ll post here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin - Mun - Kerbin with only stock parts:\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/QHxDgCuCMec?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"}]}
