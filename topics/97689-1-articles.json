But if I understand correctly, they are naming the next version 1.0 because they have met the initial criteria set out at original development (Beta was definitely short, but they obviously hammered out what they needed to. Perhaps since they were in Alpha for a fair while, Beta was in planning for awhile and therefor they don\u0027t need to spend months working on bugs and what not with beta).... Since all boxes have been ticked off, they can justify a \u00221.0\u0022 release. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy does it matter what they call the version?
