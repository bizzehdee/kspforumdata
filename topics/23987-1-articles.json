Here you see the braking stage, as you can see the rover is attached by a docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.imgnook.com/CqFZmo.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.imgnook.com/CqFZmo.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI accidentaly undocked the port AFTER throttling down the braking stage, thrust-locking it against the rover and starting an uncontrolled ascent, thanks to the rover having RCS tanks and engines, I barely managed to pull it off. The braking stage crashed really close to the landing area (where the Genesis-1 Power station and a storage module were waiting for the rover) and throwing debris and parts all over it. The rover, on the other hand, survived and I managed to land it at 400 meters from the landing area. Here you see the final maneuvering with the rover. You can even see some smoke from the exploding debris.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.imgnook.com/dRcZQo.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.imgnook.com/dRcZQo.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, it was a close call, but a successful mission overall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow it\u0027s your turn to show those close calls, planning/execution failures and anything else you didn\u0027t had in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SalmonellaDingDong","CreatedById":57168,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T05:10:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24904-You-Will-Not-Go-To-Space-Today-Post-Your-Fails-Here\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24904-You-Will-Not-Go-To-Space-Today-Post-Your-Fails-Here\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6 pages already, it would probably be better to post in there \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
