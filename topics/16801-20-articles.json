Something\u0027s wrong, either with the files themselves, or with the editor you\u0027re using. If you\u0027re in Windows, DO NOT USE WORDPAD/WORD!

Those \u0022ghost spaces\u0022 you referred to are most likely corrupted line termination characters (which can happen if you open the files in a screwy non-standardized editor like Wordpad).
