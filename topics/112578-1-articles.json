You can always transmit the first batch of data for a portion of the science gain (100% for crew and eva reports), and store the next wave in the crew cab. Afterwards, there\u0027s usually not a huge amount of science to gather, but you can, as mentioned above, keep the science equipment attached. You want to keep the experiments in for re-entry anyway, since they\u0027re kind of expensive.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T20:07:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso be aware that you\u0027re not throwing away as much as you think. The amount of science reported when you run an experiment indicates how much you will get assuming that you turned in the results right now, before you turn in a different but otherwise identical experiment. The total science you can get from a given experiment at a particular biome and altitude is capped, usually in the range of 100% to 130% of the science you\u0027d get from a single return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat this means is that if you return two goo experiments from the same location, worth 100 science each, while the first one would get you 100 science, the second would get you considerably less, not even the 30 science that would get you to the cap. Unless it\u0027s changed from the last time I looked, you\u0027d get 100*30/130 or slightly more than 23 points. The third one would get you 100*7/130, or about 5.4 science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of this, I don\u0027t worry about hitting the science cap and I don\u0027t intentionally do multiple identical experiments on the same mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"imaspacestation","CreatedById":145609,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T21:03:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I know about the diminishing returns, which is why I wanted to do several at a time to get all the science data. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not really doing it for the extra few points of science it gives me, but for the completion.
