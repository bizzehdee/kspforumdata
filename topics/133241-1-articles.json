On all my craft I actually include that in the upload template you give. I\u0027ve never had one complaint yet from anyone when it comes to that aspect of my model building...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wouldn\u0027t change how you currently can set action groups, just add in that if you put a description and used a set format then that could auto populate those fields. format would be something like\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\nsome random text about craft yada yada\nActionGroups:\n1. main engines\n2. VTOL engines\n3. don\u0027t press this\n9. emergency chutes\nabort: explodes things\n\nmore text that would be ignored.....\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027d just look for ActionGroups: or action groups: on one line (and a few variations on that) and then following that, lines starting with\u00A00-9 with a . or : after it and named groups followed by a : and read out whatever text follow until the end of the line or the next action group key word.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you didn\u0027t use that in the description then nothing would change as far as uploading and setting AG info goes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
