What am I doing wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s another problem: when I load a save game and then switch to the map view and back it seems that KSP plays all the loaded AudioSources at once (you can hear weird stock engine boost sounds sometimes when switching back to flight). And mine are played too and that\u0027s weird escpecially for the looped AudioSources and I\u0027m sure they are not triggered by my code. Other mods don\u0027t have such problem.

Set the gameObject\u0027s transform\u0027s parent to transform of the object you want to emit your sound.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInteresting thing is that I need to set this too to have sounds \u0022inside\u0022 the pilot\u0027s head.
