Use my right hand to see where I\u0027m going with the mouse. To rotate, I have to put my left hand on ASDF. To translate, I have to put my left hand on HJKL. What kind of freaking sense is that? There was nothing wrong with the old system.\n\nAnd if they can be remapped back to the old way, it\u0027s not working as expected. I set it to NOT stage when I hit the space and it did it anyway."}]}
