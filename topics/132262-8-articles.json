Three fishermen are sitting in a boat. One of them is telling a story about the huge fish he caught, the second is laughing and disputing the tale. The third asks, \u0022How big was the fish?\u0022 The other two gesture with their hands, \u0022About yay big\u0022.

But I need to write out a description.

An author can control the tone of a story by using specific types of language (\u003Cem\u003EThe Grapes of Wraith\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0is a\u00A0classic example) and in this particular case I wanted the reader to feel the dismissive shrug in the gesture. Very informal, almost flippant.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo switch directly from inches to centimeters changes the gesture a bit. A \u0022few centimeters\u0022 is about one inch, which from a hand gesture standpoint would mean \u0022really small\u0022. It is workable, but feels like the gesturing person would have to care enough to really want to \u0022stick it\u0022 to the other person. And he does not. Another option would be to say something along the lines of \u0022a dozen centimeters\u0022.

A meter feels too big. But to break it up into a smaller length requires either a fraction (or a decimal) of a meter, or an awful lot of centimeters. In either case, to me it starts to read like a math problem or a science text, which is not what I want to have happen. A fraction, or a unit value\u00A0in the hundreds, is not \u0022about yay big\u0022.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe decimeter feels too long for the inch scale, and too short for the foot scale. But more importantly, everything I\u0027ve seen indicates it is not widely used. People know what it is, and can work calculations with it, but it\u0027s not a unit that comes up in day to day life. It feels inappropriate\u00A0for informal writing. If someone is carrying a piece of furniture in such a way that they can\u0027t see around it, and they cry out, \u0022How much room do I have?\u0022, I would not expect the answer to ever be in decimeters. I\u0027m sure there are places where it would be, but to my eye, it would look weird.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor human scale distances I am used to the imperial system. Metric was used\u00A0in\u00A0school, but imperial was used at home in the garage and the kitchen, effectively making metric a second language for certain everyday activities. I know it, but I don\u0027t \u0022think\u0022 in it, if that makes sense. My brain treats \u00226 feet, 1 3/4 inches\u0022 as three discrete pieces of information, just like reading a clock. Measuring human scale distances in metric feels like trying to express time without using minutes, only hours and seconds. It feels like there\u0027s a yawning hole between meters and centimeters where the foot ought to be.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222416294\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022132262\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221455765132\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002278303\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kerbart\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 hours ago, Kerbart said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for \u0022dropping the fraction,\u0022 the scenario described is just as applicable to a scale that shows pounds and ounces, the student would be dropping the ounces in that case, making the final measurement really not\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0much more accurate.

But while that worked just fine for the heavier dogs, it seemed to be causing some issues for cats, and it was just one of those rare moments where imperial seemed to have an\u00A0edge. Our cat was furious. . .that scale was never going to give a reading accurate to two decimal places. It was lucky to have survived the process. If it had been set to pounds/ounces, I expect the technician would have rounded to the nearest pound and been done with it.
