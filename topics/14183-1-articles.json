A plane that carries a smaller spaceplane into the upper atmosphere, where it launches into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy previous attempt was fairly similar to this one, but I\\\u0027ve made improvements. The carrier is still large, but it is more streamlined, and now uses atmospheric jets to conserve fuel. The carrier jet is far more fuel efficient, and now can stay in the upper atmosphere for quite a long time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is also very stable, with no wobble due to support struts. (unless SAS is enabled- SAS causes vibration, but the craft stays together just fine, even at 2x). The launch vehicle will no longer tip backwards uncontrollably, it can fly almost vertically without tipping, or fly horizontally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe orbiter vehicle now includes RCS thrusters which push it away from the launch vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe orbiter can get to a high orbit with fuel remaining in the last tank. It is also a stable plane on it\\\u0027s own to glide to re-entry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow to fly\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiftoff is very straightforward, maximum throttle on the runway, pulling up. The plane takes off before the end of the runway. Make sure not to pull up too hard, or you can shear off the rear engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFly to 14000 feet, then level off. Cut engines, enable RCS, trigger stage decoupling. Then pull up to boost away from the launch vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrottle up rocket engine, fly to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/B75tH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022B75tH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Nlne7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Nlne7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rJgUM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rJgUM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/23zdo.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002223zdo.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/A4sS9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022A4sS9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ToadDude","CreatedById":26053,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-12T21:01:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPretty, I\\\u0027m at my Cottage so I can\\\u0027t download it, (KSP, y u no on iPhone) but I will when I\\\u0027m home.
