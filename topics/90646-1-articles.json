Accordingly, this results in increased cargo, with a maximum of approximately 75 metric tons, more than twice the mass delivered by the LOX-hydrogen chemical system. As specific impulse is raised beyond 15,000 seconds however, the power requirement grows so rapidly that the increasing mass of the array requires more propellant mass to be carried in the CDV, thus reducing the cargo delivered. With regard to cargo mass only, the optimum specific impulse is therefore 15,000 seconds. \u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, 5,000 is more reasonable for shorter trips, given it will get much better thrust, and operates at a higher efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00225.

An initial prototype with 4 grids (literally called the DS4G, dual-stage 4-grid ion thruster) entered subscale testing, and a prototype was verified to work in such a way that by extrapolation the fullscale version could be operated at 250 kW power, 2.5 N thrust, 19,300s Isp. Compare the VF-200\u0027s 200 kW power, 5 N thrust, ~5000s Isp. ESA scientists have since simplified the design to just three grids and refined everything a bit more, but no real prototypes have been built (again, nobody wants a 250 kW electric engine right now). So the performance of the refined dual-stage ion thruster can only be speculated about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile on the nuclear pulse propulsion side of things, NASA has been funding a serious fusion rocket project that will rely on the pulse propulsion principle. It will drop a deuterium/helium-3 fuel pellet out the back, then use a huge, short-duration magnetic field to collapse a set of lithium rings around the pellet, compressing it and igniting fusion. The result is expelled by a magnetic nozzle, propelling the spacecraft. Think of it as Project Orion, except with fusion bombs instead of fission bombs... and the fusion bombs are so small that no pusher plate is required. It also captures nearly all of the energy of the fusion, whereas Project Orion would only use a small part of each explosion\u0027s power. The aneutronic fusion also greatly reduces the required shielding on the spacecraft. The project started in 2011, and they\u0027re expecting to have a full-scale prototype by 2020 and fly a demonstration mission two or three years later. The development timeline is partially constrained by the technological progress in solar panels, which are required to generate power for the magnetic fields. The drive can technically work with today\u0027s solar panels - the Isp is independent, just overall thrust goes down a lot due to very long charge times between pulses and/or more mass dedicated to solar arrays - but to really exploit it to its fullest potential, at least a tripling in power output per kg is desired.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"noobsrtoast","CreatedById":65729,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-19T15:21:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei dont like being pessimistic about it, i think that one day we will have a breakthrough in be it power production or propulsion systems, or even genetics for that matter. either that or we die a slow death on this planet, someone has to make the call eventually and i have hope that someone will\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"noobsrtoast","CreatedById":65729,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-19T15:25:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou know i knew one day that someone would find a use for all that fusion technology we have been seemingly needlessly producing for the past hundred years for nothing other than building nuclear bombs, which in my opinion is just a waste, the question remains though is: can it get us to another star?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"noobsrtoast","CreatedById":65729,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-19T15:39:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethis is a fair point you make, i really hope we find some kind of breakthrough in fusion propulsion, it seems like our best bet right now seeing as we love it so much (nukes), that is if we dont end up destroying ourselves before we have a chance to try, which with current world events seems likely. i wouldnt call his point pessimistic i would call it realistic, hope is a good thing to have but you must be realistic in your hope. lets be honest here do you really think anyone is going to pay for a huge starship that will not benefit them in any way, that they will never see again? the answer is no the only reason we ever went to the moon was because the united states wanted to beat the soviets there during their 50 year dispute. whether you like it or not until we change the way we think, until we can get over the fact that not everything we do were going to get something out of, we wont be traveling the stars anytime soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebefore we even consider an interstellar vessel a few things need to happen. for one we need to get over our greed and unwillingness to share our resources, we need to get over that maybe a few of us are different, and have different opinions than one another, we need to get over our hate for each other, our desire for power over one another, only then can we begin to consider building such a vessel. were already at a disadvantage considering how sparsely populated our local stellar neighborhood is, stars in our local cluster are extremely far apart, we cant put ourselves at more of a disadvantage by being selfish. however until we evolve more i fear that it might take a while for us to get over these traits, if we have time to do so.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"noobsrtoast","CreatedById":65729,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-19T15:41:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewe will start colonizing the universe when something that threatens our existence forces us to\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
