In my early part testing I found documentation in the wiki that indicated if you model something to be a 2m diameter, it will default scale up to be 2.5m in game when setting \u0027scale = 1\u0027 in the CFG. I did that and it worked fine. I created some parts with a 2m diameter and they fit right up with the Rockomax sized parts. Happy me. Now I just had a go at creating a Rockomax-sized 4x1 coupler. I modeled all the cylinders to be 2m diameter. But when brought into the game it doesn\u0027t scale it up. The adapter plates look to be a \u0022true\u0022 2m diameter which makes them smaller than Rockomax parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there some trick I need to make sure I do to get them out of Max properly? Or is there some odd setting in Unity perhaps? I\u0027m using the latest .20 PartTools.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should point out that setting \u0027rescaleFactor = 1.25\u0027 DOES scale the part up properly. But I don\u0027t have to do it in one part, yet I do in another?
