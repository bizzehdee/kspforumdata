The applications for the LV-909 were many. The KR-2L *was* the second most powerful engine but now Squad has puzzlingly made it *weaker than the Mainsail*. Is it now astoundingly more fuel efficient than the Mainsail? It would have to be as that would be the only reason to spend fuel lofting its mass and low thrust into space.\n\nThe Poodle and LV-909 were likely overpowered in .90 and earlier, but now they\u0027re pretty much useless in atmosphere or for liftoff or landing on Kerbin or anywhere else in the higher gravity range.\n\nI\u0027m thinking a buffed Poodle (perhaps call it the Standard Poodle) should slot somewhere between the current one and the Skipper, perhaps in the third towards the current Poodle. Could stretch its length a bit in the modded CFG and up its mass just a little.\n\nWhat to do for a buffed LV-909? No solid ideas here.\n\nFor the KR-2L I\u0027m tempted to do a straight clone of it as it was in .90. It\u0027s just silly to have an engine that\u0027s much heavier and quite bit larger than the Mainsail have so much less thrust it can barely lift itself off the pad. Try launching the stock Learstar... oh wait, you can\u0027t because Squad nerfed the main engine so much. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) You have to swap it out for a Mainsail to get it to move.\n\nWith the new aero, rockets don\u0027t need as much raw power to overcome drag on their way up to orbit, so making copies of the engines (except perhaps the KR-2L) equal to their pre 1.0 versions would really be overdoing it.\n\nThey seem to have adjusted the T-30 and T-45 just right."},{"CreatedByName":"MatterBeam","CreatedById":133334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T09:57:10Z","Content":"You cannot lengthen engines without making them wider: you have to resort to a new model."},{"CreatedByName":"Galane","CreatedById":77949,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T10:13:59Z","Content":"Can\u0027t do the same thing as has been done with fuel tanks and other parts in ReStock?

I usually offset these girders into the fuel tank for aesthetic effect, have had zero overlap problems involving them so far.\n\nFor staging, add a central girder to the fuel tank\u0027s bottom attach node, a small decoupler and an aerodynamic fairing under that. Fit the fairing over the cluster and line it up with the bottom of the fuel tank.\n\nThe mainsail\u0027s nozzle is smaller than the KR-2L\u0027s. The KR-2L is more efficient in vacuum because the reaction gasses have more room to expand optimally. At sea level, however, the reaction chamber pressure to atmospheric pressure ratio is lower due to the larger nozzle surface area, so it produces less thrust."},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T00:14:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The problem with using clusters is the difficulty or impossibility of stacking below them.\n\nIt\u0027s also highly unusual to need to use them as anything other than first stage engines.

Squishing, stretching, mashing... Too bad the game engine doesn\u0027t allow for differential scaling and skewing. Could take a cylindrical fuel tank and turn it into a tapered and offset adapter.\n\nSo anyway, assume the little green rocket scientists have bent their brains to the task and improved the engines that are now weaker at sea level. What would be some reasonable plausible numbers that will still fit with the new atmosphere?\n\nNot looking for [Aerojet M-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-1_%28rocket_engine%29) performance where the *turbopump exhaust* was ducted through the edge of the nozzle skirt to contribute 120 kN of thrust to the designed 6.67 million Newton baseline thrust. \u0027Course an appropriately scaled M-1 would be excessively cool.\n\nJust need a variant of the KR-2L that can do things like lift the Learstar off the pad. Odd that Squad did all these changes then left in a stock craft that doesn\u0027t just need a few adjustments to improve it, it\u0027s completely unflyable since it can\u0027t even launch.\n\nThe original KR-2L was too powerful, with the ReStock adapter to mount four of them plus four LV diameter and one Rockomax diameter engines beneath a ThunderMaximus tank... it tended to be \\*too much\\* if those other engines were T30\u0027s and a Mainsail. Efficiency was considerably worse (with the same rocket) with all those than with only four KR-2L, even with MechJeb\u0027s terminal velocity limiter. I haven\u0027t yet fixed the CFGs for those parts for 1.0.2 but I\u0027m half expecting that the assembly would struggle to lift off now."}]}
