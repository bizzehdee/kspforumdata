I posted in the announced article on my feelings about the amount of bug-fixing and polishing we need, and how long it has been pushed back because they were still adding major systems right up until the end. As a tester we\u0027ve only been able to get bugs regarding issues outside of whatever was being actively worked on for a few updates now, unless a dev basically took his free time to do it, simply because there wasn\u0027t \u0022time\u0022 on the schedule or roadmap for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the progress has been pretty good so far, but its by no means done, and the expansive nature of this next update is going to cause some chaos. Just a a tester, I certainly don\u0027t FEEL done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut reading the other replies, I realized that perhaps the biggest issue is the 64 bit windows version. It\u0027s a complete mess. It really shouldn\u0027t be published as is. The game certainly certainly should not represent itself as \u0022done\u0022 with the 64 bit client operating as it does. At the very least wait for Unity 5. It Unity5 ends up not being good enough to make win64 stable and you\u0027re REALLY sure you\u0027re done bugfixing and polishing, then you could go to 1.0 and simply stop publishing x64 for Windows until its really ready (offer a beta version of it if you need to I guess)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut going \u0027Gold\u0027 like that and drawing new people in, 90% of who will use the broken 64bit client.
