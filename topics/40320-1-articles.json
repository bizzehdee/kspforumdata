For interplanetary travel you pretty much need nuclear engines, they are over twice as fuel-efficient as any other engines (except ions). I\u0027ve found that the best way is to have some big engines, depending on how heavy you are at that point, can be the LVT series or skipper/mainsail, to get yourself into orbit. Bring along a pair or two of nuclear engines as well. This is a case where I have found that there isn\u0027t one engine for the job and that its better to have multiple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s an example of my ship\u0027s engines:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://postimg.org/image/dqpovaz0r/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://postimg.org/image/dqpovaz0r/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt reaches Kerbin orbit with more than enough fuel to make it to Duna orbit, despite how heavy it is.
