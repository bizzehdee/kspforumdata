It seems like the right section. Sorry if this is not, in fact, the right section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I\u0027ve never really touched SSTO\u0027s, Spaceplanes, Planes, Helicopters, Giant Catapults or indeed any other form of atmospheric travel in KSP before, and I thought I\u0027d give it a shot today. I\u0027m not looking to make a spaceplane yet, just a good-old regular plane I can use for exploring Kerbin and buzzing farmers (look, I can pretend, ok?). After a bit of trial, error, and burning, I came up with this little thing, that seems to fly reasonably well. (that is, it stays in the air and doesn\u0027t evaporate when I try to turn it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/594766028441094936/E1CA9E026BCDC7E7AC547790171EE26A43147FBF/\u0022 alt=\u0022E1CA9E026BCDC7E7AC547790171EE26A43147FBF\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first issue is this: while it keeps a heading more or less perfectly on its own, the nose wants to dip down a few degrees whenever I touch the controls- even a minor roll will drop the nose down and force me to readjust it. I thought this would be a CoL/CoM problem, but the CoL IS slightly behind the CoM (that\u0027s half the reason why I have so many wings on the back. The other half is that it looks cool. Obviously.), so I don\u0027t know what\u0027s causing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, the turning is very twitchy and jerky, even with precision controls turned on (I use a 360 controller for flying; left analogue stick for pitch/yaw, shoulder buttons for roll). I tried removing the control surfaces from the upper and lower wings, which helped a tiny amount, but it\u0027s still not very smooth. This might be exacerbated by my first problem, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, any general flying tips? Specifically, turning and landing. For turning, I\u0027ve just been rolling to a ~90 degree angle, and gently pitching up, which I assumed would be the best way of doing it. And although I can land 5 times out of 10 on flattish ground, if I\u0027m lucky, I seem to take about 5x the length of the runway to do it. I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s just incompetence, lack of practice, or some vital flaw in my plane design or flight technique.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAsh.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-21T12:36:44Z\u0022 title=\u002210/21/2013 12:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Panzerbeard\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T22:49:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMay want to add a vertical stabilizer just for good measure.

It\u0027s a common problem for planes to have the CoM brought down slightly due to those gears being mounted on the belly of the plane. This puts the thrust above your CoM, making your plane want to nose down constantly. You can counter this by trying to get the gears as close to level with your CoM as possible, or putting weight on top of the plane to compensate, such as RCS pods and whatnot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor fine roll control, 1-2 sets of the small control surfaces are good and you can mess around with how far out you put them on the wings as well which will change how much of an effect they have.
