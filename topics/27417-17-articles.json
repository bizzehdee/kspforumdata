Once I have the free time to do so I\u0027ll start to investigate updating the mods for Gamedata system since thats starting to look like it could be useful finally.

The first few times I looked at Multiwheels, I was more interested in complete rovers than parts to build one with, but with all the new stuff that\u0027s been added (Girders and trusses, external seats, wheels) I\u0027ve taken to trying to build my own. And not having much success, so I\u0027m kinda praying that a mod implementation might work better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new landing gear look fantastic, but so far I\u0027ve had two main problems with the car wheels: There\u0027s no fourpack of Electric motors, and the car wheels have a LOT lower ground clearance than the stock wheels(Good for handling, I know). My first test drive took out the electric motors and the RTGs (It was a nuclear powered stock rover) on the bottom of the rover trying to go over the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA third problem I found was that the engines don\u0027t seem to list their resource consumption, other than intakeair if they use it(I presume the ones that need air are Liquidfuel powered?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Oh yeah, and the controls are reversed for some reason I\u0027ve yet to figure out...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit2: Fixed the controls(apparently it was tied to the orientation of the girder that is my root part)...and discovered a slightly exploit-y thing while I was at it. Resource consumption is DRAMATICALLY reduced in reverse, but the speed isn\u0027t particularly. I had a straight six of electric motors running off a single RTG, doing 50 m/s over the terrain (before going into a skid and ending up rolling it for massive damage).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was somewhat interested to discover that the suspension system on the car wheels at least has the exact same problem with the terrain that the stock wheels have. It\u0027ll sometimes go clear to full extension and go all unstable. Except the fact that your wheels skid seems to alleviate it somewhat, at least on a flat. I\u0027ve yet to get up into the mountains and test it, as I\u0027m still playing with things and working on trying to convert it, but so far a 3-motor setup seems to provide slightly better performance on the same power resources (without using the reverse exploit anyway).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll be interested to see what happens up in the mountains, where I\u0027ve had SO much trouble with the stock wheels it isn\u0027t funny.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I love some of the landing gear options so much I\u0027ll probably keep the multiwheels pack just for them, even if the rover wheels don\u0027t work out. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit3: Nevermind my complaining about electric motors lacking a fourpack, btw.
