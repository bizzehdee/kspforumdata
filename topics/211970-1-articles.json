I\u0027m not sure if this can be SAVED on your Xbox KSP but, then again, this is a theory. I\u0027m still in the development of testing this and am not sure if this is going to work or not but i am confident. Please try this out if you can.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kurld","CreatedById":79950,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-12T23:26:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it\u0027s like most stuff on Xbox, it won\u0027t work. The game files (everything really) about the Xbox file system is pretty much locked away and inaccessible. The fact that many of the best mods\u00A0 also include plugin code that needs to execute on the CPU would be another big hurdle, possibly insurmountable even beyond technical reasons (licensing, liability).\u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOur best hope would be that someday M$ lets us stream from our PCs to our consoles, but I bet pigs will fly before that happens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"obamaprism9623","CreatedById":225157,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-14T16:00:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nanother thing we can do is take the memory drive (or whatever the living hell is in there) and put it in adapters into our computer and access files that way. still not sure if that will work but it won\u0027t (or will) hurt to try\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kurld","CreatedById":79950,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-14T17:20:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like a lot of trouble and possibly you letting the majick smoke out of your Xbox drive.\u00A0 Why not just play the game on PC and cast it to your TV or something?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m 90% sure all the data you\u0027d be interested in is encrypted, besides.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Royalswissarmyknife","CreatedById":216092,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-14T19:31:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mean it might be possible to mod Ksp on Xbox but near impossible you would also need a mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"obamaprism9623","CreatedById":225157,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-14T20:23:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nit wouldn\u00B4t hurt to find out\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
