Is it a bug?

Then approach the docking port you want to attach by above or right...

(e.g. a tug based on LF fuselage long, engines on the far ends, docking port in the middle).\n\nIt\u0027s worse with fuel cell array: its center of mass is not in the middle.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-01T10:38:18Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2015 10:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Cakeofruit","CreatedById":73238,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T23:39:39Z","Content":"alt is your friend ! also put the thread on answered ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"}]}
