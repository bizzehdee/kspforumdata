Right now. This is one of the most amazing things I\u0027ve seen in all of 2016 so far - more amazing than rocket landings and all that jazz.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s also one of the most frightening things I\u0027ve seen in... well, my whole life, probably. Holy crap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA method has been invented that assures that a custom-written genetic trait is passed on to offspring. And I mean \u003Cem\u003Eassured\u003C/em\u003E. The success chance is 100%. It\u0027s a \u0022global search-and-replace tool for genetic information\u0022 - and the tool passes itself on along with the custom traits it is designed to pass on. This is called a \u0022gene drive\u0022. Everytime an organism so modified reproduces, it force-overwrites the genetic information of all offspring to match the gene drive\u0027s design specifications. The other partner\u0027s genetic information at this juncture is irrelevant. The new offspring, of course, now carries the gene drive too...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd it\u0027s easy to do. It only needs moderately specialized equipment, and a skilled highschooler to operate it. There\u0027s no secret, patented formula - the approach uses existing tools that everyone, worldwide, has access to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, there\u0027s caveats. It doesn\u0027t work for viruses or bacteria, among other things (thank heavens!). And while it\u0027s easy to build, the act of first designing the blueprint of the genetic change you want to make is actually a really elaborate and difficult process. And it\u0027s potentially possible to build targeted \u0022reverse drives\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut still, the mere implications of this!

At the same time: just one modified organism accidentally escaping from a research lab could potentially end up overwriting an entire species, if it finds a chance to reproduce before it dies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe presenter rightfully asks: \u0022Have we become God?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know.

Actually they are using it to edit antibody genes so that they can fight cancer and autoimmune disease, so . . . . .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut even so, this just makes it a bit easier than before, we edit genes all the time, you put His tags or antibody tags, move them from human, to bacteria, to chinese hamsters overy cells, back to human cells again if you like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe point about CRISPR is that it offers the opportunity to remove some really bad diseases from human society while still at the embryonic stage. For example suppose you knew you carried a really bad gene, but you didn\u0027t know until after the child was say in its 20s. Well to bad for him/her. Something like Huntington\u0027s disease. Now you could do genetic testing in the womb, but then the parents have to make that dreaded A decision, and be you pro-life or pro-choice, if you are the parent and you have to make that decision, there is nothing pro about it. So now you can test embryos\u0027 but aren\u0027t you playing god with your genes, cause you are selecting out eggs just because of one defect on one chromosome. So a minimalist approach is just to fix that really, really bad guy and don\u0027t fix anything else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s another situation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are a 55 year old male who spent most of his time studying science and deferring having children as you pushed forth your great new sciency stuff to change the world. But now you have decided to have children. But hold on a minute, while women are more at risk for chromosomal abnormalities after their 40s, mens proto-sperm cells are cooking with fire since the age of puberty, and by the time you are 55, those sperm are well done. So the child\u0027s risk for autism and schizophrenia go way up past the age for 40s for males. One thing we can do now at the 8 cell stage is do genome sequencing of both parents and match runs of identity. Then we can look for defects, most are harmless but some are nothing but bad news, so that these can be corrected at the 8 cell stage and then one cell can be used to develop a whole new being without the one or 2 defects. Win, win.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a third thing that can be done. In your body are plueripotent stem cells, they evolve into your immune system and blood cells. There are occasionally defects in these cells that affect the entire body, even though it only takes a few cells in the body to produce these. What we can do for affected individuals is to take the plueripotent stem cells from bone marrow and and fix the defective gene, often a premature stop codon, after expanding those cells in the lab we can put them back, walla, individual is not normal, but they can survive. Imagine giving the bubble boy (remember the boy trapped in a bubble at TCH in Texas medical center back in the 70s, John Travolta made a movie about him), a chance to leave the bubble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA forth thing that we can do. Suppose that you have been diagnosed with a lymphoma, and they have to irradiate all your immune cells to kill the cancer and give you a bone marrow graft from an unrelated individual, they have an HLA type that is close but not identical. With CRISPR we can sometimes make the HLA major antigen genes identicle. This means that we can stop the possibility of rejection. We can also remove some of your bone marrow cells, and fix the defect that causes the cancer, and put them back. In addition we can use CRISPR to specifically redesign\u00A0 a few of your natural killer cells to go after the lymphoma when a particular antibody, that we add, is present. In this way the Killer cells will identify one part of the antibody and the other part of the antibody will recognize the lymphoma and only the lymphoma. Does this sound wild, but such bivalent antibodies already exist and are being used. All we have to do is to alter the CD8\u002B cells so that they recognize the other part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost cancers will be a thing of the past in 10 years. Radiation and these harsh therapies are not going to be the first line therapy. You are already seeing major increases in the life expectancy of melanoma and lung cancer patients.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCRISPR is that which makes a hard job easier, it does not do something we could not do before, So now its possible to treat a patient who has months to live before they die instead of after they die, which is kind of useless. \u0027Hey sir, I manage to insert the right gene into your defective cells, Sir, Sir? Sir? Oh, no.\u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-02T22:16:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImagine a very long space mission. We have to carry embryos of course, but the mission is so long that humans would not be able to repeat, and at the site we can only create so many people.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time the generational voyage is over, the chromsomes have undergone fixation, you emplant embryos but this is not enough, you have at the end the genetic diversity of about 100 individuals. But the target is around 10,000. So that as your population grows you want to get this information back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGuess what, you don\u0027t need to send people, the genetic information is light speed distance to earth away, just send the information from 10,000 diverse individuals and maybe the 3 or 4th child an individual has add some genetic diversity so over time you can, with out sending a molecule, reconstitute the entire useful amount of human genetic diversity. Let recombination do the rest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s an example, you get to the planet, and you find, unbeknownst to you that a deadly virus is very popular in the environment and humans have no natural defenses to that virus, they cannot spread the disease but neither can they defend themselves (sort of like microbial neurotoxins). A molecular analysis of that virus reveals it has some similarities to a bacterial virus that infects bacteria of a certain species of Marsupials. But the marsupials are uneffected. So you examine their MHC class I antigens and you find that they have one molecule and a TLR receptor that provide the defense. Structural modeling reveals that altering the structure of these homologs in humans of two of these allows the production of an innate immune response. Synthesi of a small amount of viral antigen cause the immune system to produce alot of antibody, providing an immediate humoral defense to the environmental toxin. Problem solved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother example, the environment has a high level of a certain heavy metal that causes premature aging and senility. That metal is pervasive as a consequence of a deep space asteroid collision with a moon of the planet that continues drop sufficient amounts to produce a health hazard. Remedial measure are quite expensive. A study of benthic worms on earth finds that certain worms living around volcanic outcrops have developed a resistance to this metal by producing a variant of Cytochrome P450 that specifically binds this metal and causes the metal to be excreted. You add a liver, bile duct targeting signal and it is excreted in the waste. It does not remove the toxin from the body, there is but the rate of turnover is faster and does less damage. The sequence of the P450 of human that can be modified can be sent, and engineered into embryos of individuals who are likely to end up exposed. Eventually the gene perculates through the population.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemember the saying god does not place dice with the universe. The same can be said about DNA, your chromosome is yours to play with, for good or for bad, but those who chose to play will be at selective advantages in most cases. Its not like inserting crystaline proteins from b. thurinigenis in to maize, this technology only tweeks what you have to make it do something ever so slightly different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-02T23:36:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene drives seem to be an application\u00A0of crispr.

From reading up on this a little, it seems that a CRISPR based gene drive would basically be a construct which includes\u00A0the gene of interest plus the cas9 gene and guide RNA needed to insert it. You insert the entire package into the target genome (again using CRISPR) and end up with what\u0027s essentially a self-editing cell.
