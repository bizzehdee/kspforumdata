I\u0027m off by about 0.04 with my angle calculations (almost always) ... I don\u0027t like that and will try to find out why and improve this... (the goal is \u0026lt; 0.005 at least)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nlater I will re-implement the force-stuff (this does not work anymore, because of the shifting-correction I added... that\u0027s why I have to rebuild that feature completely... but what we have was just a first try... and shouldn\u0027t be a big deal to do that) ... but those angle-things... joints shouldn\u0027t show 0.04 without force (and in fact... it remains very stable ... it\u0027s just, that the initialization of the 0-position seems to be... wrong... somehow... maybe the joint is moved after it\u0027s creation or... I don\u0027t know...) could be a rounding problem... but I\u0027m not sure\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-29T23:28:29Z\u0022 title=\u002203/29/2018 11:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 29, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Rudolf Meier\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
