If you have something to add, please comment with it. Try to avoid giving *just* a video, post a text summary at least, since A) People on mobile devices will suck through their data if they try to watch without wifi.

Maybe for space, maybe for show, or maybe just for some in-atmospheric shenanigans. This is a tutorial on how to optimize your plane for certain traits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nManeuverability: Very important for low-altitude planes, stunt planes, and STOLs, and handy for all other planes, especially spaceplanes. So how do you get maneuverability? There are a few ways. The first is control surfaces. These include canards (on the front), Elevons/elevators (on the back of the wing), ailerons (horizontal on the tail) and rudders (vertical on the tail). You can also use tail fins or the larger \u0022canard\u0022 parts on the tail, and they will replace rudders or ailerons depending on angle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-09T01:51:01Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2016 01:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by RocketSquid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RizzoTheRat","CreatedById":123362,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-08T10:08:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan\u0027t really vote as I\u0027ve never shared any of my designs to know if anyone else is better at flying them, but I have tried downloading some other people\u0027s designs in an earlier version and had the same problems I have flying my own designs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe biggest problem I have is the digital nature of trying to fly on the WASD keys (I have a few hours solo on gliders so should have a fair idea what I\u0027m doing), hence I always use Mechjeb\u0027s Smart ASS system to hold a pitch/bearing/roll setting.\u00A0 Useless if you want a dog fighter but useful for spaceplanes and cargo aircraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"assasin172","CreatedById":115911,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-08T18:36:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell i builded few\u00A0 planes .. some of them were just complete garbadge and even fellow Jebediah Kerman was unable to take them off the ground ... then few planes / rokets which i shared with my friend .. ended up modifiing them since he could\u0027t manage them to take off \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E If only i was better at building stuff\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketSquid","CreatedById":152665,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-02T23:15:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPoll updated.
