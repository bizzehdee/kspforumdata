When I re-adjust the target angle to get them to lock back into the position I want them, the default traverse rate of 90 is used, causing my craft to tumble chaotically as the hinged arms thrash around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould a mod be resetting these parts each time the craft is loaded?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cavscout74","CreatedById":181783,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-30T01:56:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve encountered something like that in 1.8.1 on a mining base I have on Minmus and I\u0027ve seen at least one other post of a similar problem in 1.9.1.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRobotic fuel arm stowed (this is from a test on Kerbin, but it clearly shows the stowed position with everything locked)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ZceMPJY.png?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ZceMPJY.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLanding a crew at the Minmus base.\u00A0 The arm was stowed \u0026amp; locked when I landed the base, but as the crew lander comes into physics range, the arm is laying collapsed on the ground\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00226U0TNUf.png?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002280.33\u0022 height=\u0022486\u0022 width=\u0022605\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/6U0TNUf.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
