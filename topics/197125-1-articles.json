It\u0027s going well, except that my recoverable sideboosters just disappear when about 13 km above Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe craft consists of three identical boosters, two to the side of the center one. The first two are separated at about 10 km. I then quickly switch to them, activate the aerobrakes and parachutes and then switch to the actual rocket again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, while flying the rocket (without time warping), I noticed that my boosters just disappear from the map at about 13 km above the surface. I have no idea why this occurs because when I manually fly them they work just fine. Any idea why this happens and how to fix it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-09-25T22:16:25Z\u0022 title=\u002209/25/2020 10:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 25, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by ZekerMarco\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Entropian","CreatedById":205453,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-25T22:37:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a \u0022death zone\u0022 there for non-player-controlled craft.\u00A0 This is to prevent suborbital \u0022orbits.\u0022\u00A0 Mods such as FMRS let you jump back in time to recover boosters:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022129964\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed3362700325\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/157214-19x-flight-manager-for-reusable-stages-fmrs-now-with-recoverycontroller-integration/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:214px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FloppyRocket","CreatedById":173990,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-26T00:06:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour side boosters were deleted as sub-orbital debris.
