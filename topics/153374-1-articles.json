But for those of us who do mine, that\u0027s what we all do, yes. Because the travel times to the Mun are shorter, it\u0027s a bit faster to set up a refueling base at the Mun -- but you have to do a lot more upsy-downsy stuff to get the same amount of fuel into orbit. I put my \u0022base\u0022\u00A0on the surface and then shuttle the refined fuel up to orbit with a reusable lander. I do the same on Minmus too -- but it takes longer to get it all started. I play in hard mode, and for some reason I never have any ore on the flats, which is (of course) the easiest place to land.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-11T22:17:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMinmus is a popular destination for refueling stations, for all the reasons you mentioned. But at the same time, it\u0027s not something that everyone does, because there are downsides too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor starters, you save a bit less fuel than you think you do. Minmus\u0027 tiny gravity well doesn\u0027t give you much in the way of Oberth Effect. If you don\u0027t know what that is, the super-simplified explanation is: you use less fuel to gain a certain amount of energy when you do it deep inside a gravity well. KSP models this, meaning that a four digit \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E interplanetary transfer starting from Minmus is a less efficient burn than the same burn performed in low Kerbin orbit. Ultimately you still come out on top, because you save \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E for no longer having to lift your orbit to the altitude of Minmus first, but it\u0027s less than you think.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, it puts you at an inclination. Minmus is tilted six degrees with respect to Kerbin\u0027s equator, so for all flights to destinations within Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E, you have to deal with that inclination to various degrees. For all flights into interplanetary space, the effects are lessened, but also less predictable. You may luck out and reduce your required plane change, you may end up starting your burn at Minmus\u0027 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Descending Node\u0022\u003EDN\u003C/abbr\u003E and not be off-inclination at all, or you might end up in a situation where it makes your required plane change noticably worse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird - and this is the big one, much bigger than the two really minor downsides above - it restricts your departure windows. For interplanetary trips, you want to start your burn at a certain \u0022ejection angle\u0022 relative to prograde of Kerbin\u0027s orbit. That angle is different depending on which planet you want to go to, and sometimes (when inclined and eccentric orbits are involved, like with Moho and Eeloo) even on each specific transfer window. Now, in low Kerbin orbit, you loop around once per 30 minutes, so you can just go whenever you want. But Minmus takes a \u003Cem\u003Elong\u003C/em\u003E time to go around Kerbin. You might find yourself in a situation where you have your whole mission set up, the giant star cruiser all fueled up at Minmus, the departure time is two days from now and... woops, Minmus is going to take another 38 days to arrive at the spot where you need to begin your burn!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first and second downside can be somewhat mitigated by what I like to call an \u0027Oberth Dive\u0027. Instead of burning from Minmus to interplanetary space, you instead burn the other direction, towards Kerbin. Drop your periapsis nice and low, and make your maneuver node just above the atmosphere. You can then do a combined escape burn and inclination correction deep in the gravity well while your vessel is going really fast, which gives you lots of Oberth oomph, more than enough to offset the fuel you spent going back towards Kerbin. But that maneuver is more difficult to set up and execute than a normal escape burn. And it doesn\u0027t mitigate the third downside at all, because you still need to launch at the correct position. It\u0027ll just be a different position. And in fact, because of the precision required, it actually makes the departure timing problem \u003Cem\u003Eworse\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat timing problem is so big and so prohibitive that pretty much nobody ever launches missions from Minmus at all. Instead, they launch their spacecraft into low Kerbin orbit, then fly a dedicated tanker in from Minmus, which meets up with the waiting spacecraft, fuels it, and then returns to Minmus. Depending how big the tanker is, how much fuel the spacecraft needs, and how much fuel you need to spend to rendezvous with the spacecraft and return to the fuel station (you\u0027re coming in from and returning to up to six degrees of inclination, remember), you might need multiple tanker trips.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt that point, you need to ask yourself: do I want to invest the IRL playing time to fly these tanker missions for each interplanetary launch I do, or do I just want to get on with it and build a bigger lifter? Because that\u0027s what you\u0027re ultimately trading: your IRL time for ingame funds. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E And perhaps you could be doing a contract mission in the same time you\u0027d normally fly refueling trips, and earn the same or more...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-11T22:20:55Z\u0022 title=\u002212/11/2016 10:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"radonek","CreatedById":84077,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-11T22:37:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah Minmus is a good place for refueling station, but it requires some additional planning to make best use of.

Proper \u0022Oberth Dives\u0022 may be difficult to calculate, but they are trivial to set up by eye. And the 3200 m/s of Oberth from a Minmus dive is well worth the cost compared to the measley 2300 m/s you get at Kerbin. You have to plan ahead at least 30 days to set one up, and it is true that it restricts your launch window to a 20 day cycle. The window problem is indeed an issue for inner planets, because they move so fast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, for any jaunt to an outer planet, the 1km/s Oberth bonus is large enough to be very\u00A0useful.
