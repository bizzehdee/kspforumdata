I already found out that there are some parts like the grabbing units that cost many frames (1 grabbing unit costs me 3 frames. When i make a ship with 20 grabbing units i have about 5 frames). Also the game doesnt use all my ressources my cpu runs barely on 70% and my gpu on 12% and i don\u0027t want to spend so much time on solving the problem.
