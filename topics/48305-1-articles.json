At least whilst in orbit you\u0027re going round fast enough that you\u0027re going to have direct LoS with Kerbin at least once every few hours or so, whereas if you\u0027re landed you could be waiting days or weeks (particularly if you landed on a tidally locked body which had its parent in the way, for example).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, the idea itself isn\u0027t bad, and since something like this already appears with the tracking station (it apparently points at objects in space and realigns to others once it drifts out of range), sounds like it should be possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"softweir","CreatedById":2795,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-14T15:57:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ManTrelk\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ManTrelk\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBecause when you\u0027re orbiting another planet it\u0027s difficult to find Kerbin\u0027s exact position.
