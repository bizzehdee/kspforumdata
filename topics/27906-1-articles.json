Sucrose and glucose react very quickly with the KNO3 oxidiser, that\u0027s why pure sugar gives you energy for a short period of time: you are essentially using several - more controlled - sugar rockets to power your body (starchy things get oxidised at a slower rate, which is why you get energy for longer).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kodos666","CreatedById":67488,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T10:40:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, Sugar is cheap, easily obtainable and more importantly melts at fairly low temperatures, so you could \u0027dissolve\u0027 your oxidizer (KNO3, or KClO3, which is as far as I know the traditional chemical for oxidizing sugar) in the molten sugar and pour a solid booster. Plus it contains a high amount of energy as well as some amount of oxygen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
