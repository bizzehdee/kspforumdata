Somehow she knew, she \u003Cem\u003Eknew\u003C/em\u003E, that the moment it did, hers would be a fate worse than death, worse than madness, worse than any concept of mortal suffering.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then, conveniently, Igor\u0027s fist came through the wall.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFollowed shortly by the rest of Igor. The fist sought its target like a guided missile, rocketing across the room at phenomenal speed until it slammed into Arnold\u0027s jaw with all the power of a bolide. Arnold stumbled back; Valentina dropped to the desk still, caught in Edmund\u0027s thrall. The \u003Cem\u003Eother\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0surged relentlessly at her mind, with her last bit of will she kicked forward and drove her head hard into Edmund\u0027s face. It collapsed with a noise and reek like a rotted melon and he tumbled back onto the floor. Still reeling, in a state beyond dizziness, Valentina turned and beheld a clash of titans.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nArnold recovered quickly, grabbed Igor and swung him around into the other wall. Thick cement blocks shattered like glass. Igor kept the momentum, used Arnold\u0027s own grip to swing \u003Cem\u003Ehim\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0around into the same wall, crushing more blocks and smashing the huge aquarium. The ugly behemoth found a spiky fish with a flailing hand and drove it into Igor\u0027s face, then punched him hard in the stomach with the other.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nArnold lunged as Igor now stumbled, moving to drive him into the other wall, but Igor countered, pirouetting with a grace that belied his bulk. Again Arnold crashed backwards and demolished rows of blocks, sending them falling in a concrete rain. He never hesitated, but reached up for a huge loose brick and cracked it in two over Igor\u0027s head before pounding the two halves into his ears.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIgor punched, Arnold dodged and the wall behind him exploded outward. He shoved Igor back, the two giants trading furious blows back and forth. The impacts thundered like cannon fire heard at a distance, each hit sending shockwaves rippling across the room that kicked up dust and blew Valentina\u0027s hair this way and that as she stared in bewilderment.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomewhere far away, Edmund\u0027s hand pawed at the buttons on his chair, \u0022thecurity! \u003Cem\u003EThecurity!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack and forth the colossi fought, each straining for advantage. As the spectacle unfolded, Valentina was somehow reminded of an old Gytepi movie she once saw, all that was missing was the cityscape. Finally, Igor connected with an uppercut that sent Arnold into the ceiling like a rocket. Debris crashed down, some bouncing off Valentina\u0027s head while she sat mesmerized on the desk. Then Arnold came down, riding a thick wooden beam and holding a decorative copper ceiling tile.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe jammed it down over Igor\u0027s head, shoved him back against the wall, trying to suffocate him. Igor\u0027s head writhed back and forth, his face standing out through the sheet metal like cloth. The tile squealed and groaned from the strain, Arnold grinning as he pressed even harder. Beneath the copper, Igor\u0027s mouth opened and his \u003Cem\u003Etongue\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0ripped through, punching the other square in the face.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nArnold staggered back; Igor ripped the plate from his face but had to spend a moment gagging and spitting. It was all Arnold needed, he seized the heavy timber pole and swung it, sending Igor straight through the wall. What was left of it. Igor recovered, and lunged forward. The beam swung the other way, batting him across the room into the massive desk which now exploded in a hail of splinters and Valentina. \u003Cem\u003EShe\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0struck the other wall, which seemed \u003Cem\u003Equite\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0a bit more solid to her, and fell to the floor in a lump.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen she looked up, Arnold was raising the beam over a kneeling Igor, ripping again at the tiles overhead. A furious grin split his lumpy face as he brought the post down with a blast like an explosion. Slowly the dust cleared, and Valentina saw that Igor had simply caught it. With one hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nArnold\u0027s eyes widened in shock. Igor shoved the pole straight back into his face. As the he tottered, Igor burst forward. Arnold\u0027s fist caught him in the stomach. Before he could react, a salvo of jackhammer-like punches landed one after another against his face. Arm moving like a piston, Arnold pummeled him again and again and again, his head flopping back each time, and Valentina could \u003Cem\u003Efeel\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0every blow.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EBAM!\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EBAM!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EBAM!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EBAM!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EBAM!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EBAM!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EBAM!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe lumpy-faced brute paused to smile at his handiwork, Igor\u0027s head hanging lifelessly. A meaty fist came up for a death blow, but found only Igor\u0027s hand waiting again. Arnold tried to pull away as Igor\u0027s head rose, slowly, mechanically. A smirk curled his lips, a tiny smear of blood staining one corner. Grabbing his shoulder, Igor head butted his opponent with a noise like a boulder cracking.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, Arnold made a sound. A deep, resonating growl came as his lips pulled back into a snarl. For a moment, Valentina thought his teeth had been shattered; cracked, jagged points jutted from his mouth, but then she saw--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EHis eyes...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EHis EYES..!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe couldn\u0027t stare long, he doubled over as a crushing blow from Igor pounded his gut. Another followed, and another, making sounds flesh should not make. A fourth came, this time the momentum carrying Arnold up and off his feet. Igor held him up like a gloating barbarian as he struggled helplessly. Fear flashed across his twisted face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And now,\u0022 Igor bellowed, \u0022I \u003Cem\u003Ebreak\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0you!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe threw the defeated giant down at the same moment he brought his knee up, and a sickening, wet crunch washed over Valentina. Igor spun, still grasping the body, and let it fly through the far wall. She heard it crash through a half dozen \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0walls before the noise ceased.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA thick, dusty hand appeared before her, \u0022come with me if you want to live.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe blinked, but Igor didn\u0027t leave much time for deliberation, simply picking her up by the scruff of the neck. Which was awkward, as Kerbals have no scruff.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill stunned, she blathered, \u0022did... did you see..? Did you see--\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I saw,\u0022 Igor boomed. Then smashed through the last good wall, right into the waiting sights of--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Stop I\u0027ll shoot!\u0022 a wide-eyed security guard waggled a revolver at him. \u0022I mean it, don\u0027t test me!\u0022 he squealed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIgor took a step, the gun went off with a crack and his head snapped backwards. After a moment, once again, slowly, mechanically, it rose. He smiled... then spit out the bullet. It click-clacked away down the polished floor.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe guard gaped up at him, looking like he \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0wished he\u0027d called in sick this morning after all. He still held the revolver out in a trembling hand. Daintily, Igor plucked it away. The remaining rounds went off with a pop as he crushed it between his thumb and forefinger. He lowered his huge face to the guard, who had gone quite pale.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Run,\u0022 Igor suggested, adding with a thought, \u0022scream.\u0022 The hapless fellow nodded feverishly before taking Igor\u0027s advice, waving his hands in the air for good measure as he went. Igor gave a pleased smile, stuffed Valentina under one arm, and crashed through the \u003Cem\u003Enext\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0wall, again right into the waiting sights of--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hold it right there!\u0022 Several security guards blocked their way to the huge wooden doors, \u0022put your hands up!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGrunting in annoyance, Igor moved his own body between Valentina and the horde, and using one hand, picked up a convenient couch. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Here,\u0022 he drew it back, \u0022take seat,\u0022 and threw it. And so they did. He walked past the groaning mound of grunts and splintered furniture, this time simply \u003Cem\u003Eopening\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the door.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Freeze!\u0022 Now more than a dozen guards surrounded a long, black, blocky shape slathered with chrome in the driveway, \u0022you\u0027re cut off, give up!\u0022 A cascade of revolvers clicked to readiness.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIgor gave a huge sigh, rolling his massive eyes. From somewhere, he produced a tiny keyfob, and in clear violation of several laws of physics, pressed a single button.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe black shape chirped twice; a perky voice announced: \u0022carjack. Protection. Activated.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEyes barely had time to widen before thick purple and actinic blue bolts struck them, trailing off the myriad of chromed accents on the huge kar. Every hair on Valentina\u0027s body tried to point a different direction as the air was filled with blinding light and sound. Not the cartoony crackle of static, no, this was the spine-jarring subaural \u003Cem\u003EBUZZ\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of an arc welder set to \u0027vaporize.\u0027 She was positive she even saw flashes of skeletons in the glare. After a ridiculously long time, the buzz ceased, several limp, lightly smoking shapes slumping to the ground, groaning.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe kar chirped again and a door popped open, \u0022welcome. Mister. Igor.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe simply threw Valentina inside, \u0022get in.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was no sudden stop, she decelerated gradually against the softest material she had ever felt. It seemed to envelop her, to predict her motion and adjust itself so there was nothing but even, steady pressure all over. Igor eased into the seat next to her without the slightest hint of lean or protest from the suspension. Before her was a vast expanse of polished burlwood, creamy leather, and very tasteful brushed metal accents. A gold nameplate read--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u003Cem\u003EAn 8000SUX?!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 she blurted out.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Quad quad turbines, dual triple-belt double clutchless CVT\u0027s, eight-wheel-drive, 1000-series adaptive-tread Kerelli run-flats, Armor-Zap\u2122 defensive chrome package, endangered-leather comfort package, LudicrousSpeed\u00AE performance package, more cupholders than beverage factory, and trunk so big it need own zip code!\u0022 He turned to her with a manic, wide-eyed grin that was truly terrifying, \u0022I \u003Cem\u003Elike\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Kleptogarti kars!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina could only gape, speechless.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTurning back ahead, having somehow found shades that fit his massive face, he settled them into place, \u0022fasten seatbelt, it be bumpy ride.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe didn\u0027t have to, the seatbelt fastened itself. Igor button-pushed the kar into gear, and it took off with a noise that was both beautiful and terrifying. There was barely any sense of acceleration, the ride was actually quite smooth.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022W... where did you get this?!\u0022 Valentina said, as ranks of awed security guards flashed past outside.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Rich guy.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How?!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I negotiate.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But... \u003Cem\u003Ehow?!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe turned to her with that crazy look again, \u0022I make offer he cannot refuse.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey \u003Cem\u003Eshushed\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0around another corner, streaking right for the gate at the end of the long drive. The tired-looking guard from earlier was now wide awake, frantically waving his arms in front of the crossbar. Igor accelerated \u003Cem\u003Eharder\u003C/em\u003E. He jumped out of the way just before the bar became so much kindling. Inside, it made no noise whatsoever.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why you run away again?!\u0022 Igor suddenly burst out.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina put a hand to her forehead, \u0022long story.

Valentina yelped as Igor button-pushed the kar into eight-wheel, made a hard left, and tore out across the expansive dunes. She stared in amazement, wondering a little more if she had gone quite mad. The huge, heavy vehicle skated across the waves of sand like it was born to do so, throwing up a towering rooster tail behind it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022W... where are we going?\u0022 she said distantly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Home.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, no we have to--\u003Cem\u003Egaaaaaah!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 they rocketed off the crest of a dune and briefly went airborne. The landing was... well, it was just as soft as everything else. The thing seemed to disregard the very laws of physics. Ripping across the pale, undulating silicon ocean was like... being on the actual ocean. They bobbed and swayed and drifted just a bit in the turns. And occasionally flew.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You change hair?\u0022 Igor said as casually as walking down the street.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Part of that (\u003Cem\u003Eaack!\u003C/em\u003E) long story (\u003Cem\u003Eoof!\u003C/em\u003E)\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Look nice.\u0022 It was hard to gape at him as they porpoised along the dunes. She kept bracing for a hard landing that didn\u0027t come. Igor actually seemed to be \u003Cem\u003Eenjoying\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0himself! Igor never enjoyed \u003Cem\u003Eanything\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0Especially himself.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe caught a flash in the mirror, \u0022incoming!\u0022 Several VTOLS were now bearing down on them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo Valentina\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Egreat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0surprise, Igor spat a curse, and turned back in the general direction of the highway. Their mechanical beast darted out onto the road, the tires adamantly refusing to give up traction despite the dusting of sand covering the asphalt. VTOLs swarmed in on both sides with more police kars bringing up the rear, flashing lights everywhere. Ahead, two more kars blocked the way, with only the narrowest of gaps between their front bumpers.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA couple of soft beeps drew her attention back inside, \u0022hello. Igor. What. Can. I. Do. For. You?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIgor tightened his grip on the wheel, which rather incredibly didn\u0027t crush it, \u0022LudicrousSpeed\u00AE... \u003Cem\u003EGO!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina wasn\u0027t... exactly sure what actually happened next.

Not a little mad, or sort of mad, but \u003Cem\u003Equite\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0mad, with \u0027stark raving\u0027 waiting not far away in the wings. She couldn\u0027t tell if it was the vehicle or the fabric of spacetime itself that stretched out before them. The surrounding world dissolved into a blur, the kar threaded a gap it never should have been able to, and she was almost positive she could see the tell-tale ruddy glow of compression heating on the windshield.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEverything else looked sort of... plaid.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeside her, Igor looked \u003Cem\u003Equite\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0beyond \u0027stark raving,\u0027 \u0022I \u003Cem\u003Elike\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Kleptogarti kars!\u0022 he bellowed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen as quickly as it began, it was over, and they were smashing through the gates of--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E?!\u0022 Valentina said incredulously.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Have plane.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe blinked in disbelief.

Igor cranked the wheel hard and darted down a side street, followed closely by flashing lights and screaming sirens. Just ahead, Valentina saw something that, on any other day, might seem strange in a back alley at the Kerbal Space Center.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Fruit stand!\u0022 she pointed, \u0022fruit stand! \u003Cem\u003EFruit stand!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIgor did... \u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003Ething, and spun the kar sideways. The tires \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0have been screeching, but all she felt was a low, rumbling vibrato as they slid to a neat halt in front of the proprietor.

They braced for the inevitable.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina\u0027s seatbelt snapped taught with a gentle yet comforting firmness, feeling the first sensation of velocity change since this entire long, strange trip began. The kar not-screeched to a halt just in front of the glass panel, eliciting nothing else from it but a soft \u003Cem\u003Eping\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeside her, Igor beamed, \u0022airbrakes!

Valentina was starting to feel like the edges of reality itself were becoming a bit... crinkly. Oddly, she wondered if anyone else ever felt the same.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA jig here, and a jig there, and the blocky black shape shot out of the nest of alleyways... and to another not-screeching halt.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina stared.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIgor stared.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a plane, all right. A standard diplomatic transport jet decked out in official Ussari colors. Surrounded by dozens and dozens police officers. And also...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina gazed calmly. Sure, why not? On a day like today? Perfectly normal. Certainly not the strangest thing she\u0027d seen in the last 24 hours.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Is that a tank?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Is APC.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It looks like a tank.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, is APC.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How can you tell?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Has wheels.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But... it also has a cannon.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022APC have cannon.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh,\u0022 she thought for a moment, \u0022I suppose this thing is cannon-proof too, yes?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIgor made a low growl deep in his throat. His fleeting mirth seemed to have already... fleeted. He punched the kar into reverse.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey shot backwards like a huge metallic... squid, undulating through the waves of startled police kars that had built up behind them. The two glass\u2013workers had barely finished their celebrations when they heard the oncoming roar. Looking back over her shoulder, Valentina had \u003Cem\u003Ejust\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0enough time to see the dead, empty looks wash over their faces.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThrough\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the pane of glass, \u003Cem\u003Eover\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the oblivious gamer, \u003Cem\u003Einto\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the cardboard boxes, and \u003Cem\u003Eout\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of the fruit stand in a colorful explosion.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe rounded on Igor, \u0022you just hit that poor\u2014\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I \u003Cem\u003Egot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0\u0027im!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSlowly, Valentina turned back toward the rear. A hand appeared over the trunk, then another, clutching a familiar bicolored ball. Then a head, then a torso. Short several teeth, covered in pulp and wearing a box on his head, the new Mon\u00E9Poke master thrust the ball aloft in victory. And promptly lost his grip and slipped back under the kar with a \u003Cem\u003Ethump\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Pedestrian\u2013friendly bumpers,\u0022 mumbled Igor. He spun them in a tight circle so they were going forward again, jinking back and forth between buildings on the sprawling grounds. \u0022Change of plan,\u0022 he boomed, sliding out onto a concrete apron quite far from the runway. A confused-looking pilot stared at them next to his Velociteze. Igor opened the door and grabbed the melon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wait, what are you going to do?!\u0022 Valentina asked nervously.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Negotiate.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe pilot shrank back at Igor\u0027s approach, \u0022hey, who are you? I don\u0027t think you\u0027re supposed to be here.

Igor reached in, and removed a pair of sleepy-eyed, cranky kerblings. They each gave him a swift kick in the shin before scurrying off. He sighed himself, like a tropical hurricane, and pressed they keyfob again. The kar chirped twice.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Self. Destruct. Mode.

But this time, she actually knew what each one did.\u003Cem\u003E FlickFlickTurnTweakPresHooooooooooold\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0The engines rapidly spooled to life just as the first pursuing police kar flew from the alleyway.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u003Cem\u003EP\u0426TI\u0419!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 she spat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u003Cem\u003ELanguage!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe took the moment to glare at Igor before bumping the throttles forward. The plane lumbered forward slowly. A cruiser skidded to a stop in front of it. Valentina cursed again, jammed the left rudder pedal down and pegged the right throttle. Engine roaring, they narrowly evaded the blocker. As the nose swung around, more police flooded in from every direction.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EAll right, no more miss nice Kerb!\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0The way immediately ahead was clear. Mostly. She ignored the awkward platitude and simply firewalled the throttles. The humble plane was painfully slow to build speed, she zigged and zagged in a slow motion dance, dodging cops this way and that. After what felt like hours--and given today, might actually have been--they finally began to outpace their pursuers with open concrete ahead.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen the glass truck pulled out in front of them from a side street.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina planted her feet on the instrument panel and pulled back on the yoke with everything she had. The jet shuddered in protest as the nose gradually came up, but not fast enough. She squeezed her eyes shut and waited for the impact.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt never came. After a long moment she opened them again to find the Velociteze clawing skyward.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Climb. Go east,\u0022 Igor rumbled from the cockpit doorway. Only his head would fit through. She banked into a quick turn. Looking back, she saw a police kar had indeed clobbered the glass truck. Two Kerbs in coveralls seemed to be giving the officer involved an earful. Back near where they had started, now a deserted patch of concrete, a long black shape went \u0027\u003Cem\u003EFOOM!\u003C/em\u003E\u0027\u00A0and disappeared in a dark cloud. A sniffle drew her attention back to Igor. His lower lip was quivering just slightly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPretending she hadn\u0027t noticed, Valentina continued turning away, \u0022what now?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Climb,\u0022 somehow, Igor managed to squeeze an arm into the smallish cockpit, and threw some switches on the side panel. A collision avoidance radar winked on, followed by a low rumbling in his throat.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What?\u0022 Valentina frowned back at Igor, then squinted at the screen. \u003Cem\u003EThere\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0Coming out of the backscatter noise from the mountains.

That didn\u0027t matter much, as the fighters were on them in a matter of moments. On the display, she saw two of them break off and take up position a couple of kilometers back... perfect missile firing position. The leader came up close alongside.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe stared at her across the across the space, anonymous behind his visor and mask.

This was all too real. Valentina\u0027s mind raced, groping for any alternative that did not include getting blown out of the sky, but came up wanting. Nowhere to run. Nowhere to hide. No thrilling chase through downtown streets. This was a civilian craft, no warning receivers of any kind. If the jets fired, she wouldn\u0027t have any idea until the warheads ripped them apart.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EMaybe... maybe if I--\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA beep drew her eyes back to the screen.

The world seemed to hang on this moment. Reality still... crinkled.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, after an eternity, he broke off and dove away. The screen showed the other two following suit, turning back toward the coast.

But always so handsome.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nA soft knock at the window signaled it was time, yet again. She squeezed his hand once more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Um,\u0022 she said with a sniff, \u0022I might have to go away for a while. It might be a long while.

With one final squeeze, she laid his hand down, oblivious to the tears patting against it, and stepped away.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I love you, Billy.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHer heels clicked softly on the tile as she stepped towards the door, carrying the little plastic basket. Absently dabbing at her cheeks, she reached for the door when--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u0022I love you, Anastasia.\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe spun around with a gasp, a hand going to her mouth. But nothing had changed. Nothing had moved. He lay there, still as ever. An attendant opened the door, and she bolted through, afraid the last of her composure would fail before she reached the gates. She fled into the heavy evening air, where storm clouds had already begun to gather.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe sky rumbled with apprehension above a city that slept. In the dark, deserted streets, nothing moved. Nothing made a sound. Even the night creatures crouched anxiously in their hollows, the instinct to hide overpowering the need to seek food. The world itself seemed to be holding its breath.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPresently, a sound did rise, a rhythmic, staccato \u003Cem\u003Etap-tap\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0down an empty street flanked by darkened windows and unlit signs. Only meters away, people slept soundly in their beds, blissfully ignorant of what was unfolding. As distant thunder rolled, a figure appeared, running with an unsteady, half-limping gate, her shoes clicking along the pavement. She paused for a moment beneath a streetlight, doubled over, panting. Her green dress was already torn, her long golden hair pasted to her skin with sweat. Her breath came in harsh rasps through a throat raw from screaming. She had already given up calling for help; there was no one around to hear.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA noise further down the street drew a gasp, she only dared look a moment before taking flight once more. To either side was the cruel beckoning of strong doors, but none would open. She had already tried. Conscious thought having long left, she darted down an alley lined with trash cans and garbage. It didn\u0027t take long to reach the end, a lone door standing in vain hope. Nevertheless, she tried the knob, banged on the rusty metal surface. Her ragged breath turned to sobs.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe snapped her head around as lightning flashed across the angry sky, silhouetting a dark figure at the end of the alley. There were no features to be seen, no face. In the meager light of the street lamps, something metal flashed in its hand.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You... have become quite the little pest,\u0022 the figure said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first tears rolled down her cheeks as she slid back against the door.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thanks to you, Edmund nearly ruined everything. I will see that he suffers for that, it\u0027s a shame I still need him.

An old bottle. A startled rat.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Gah, that\u0027s worse than the frog!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThunder exploded from the sky with the fury of ages, dry winds arose and joined the tirade of debris pelting the foe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It... it\u0027s not possible!\u0022 the figure batted impotently as garbage assaulted it, \u0022it can\u0027t be!

You\u0027ll ruin everything!\u0022 Now as bits of junk and refuse battered it, here and there they burst into flames, casting up sparks that swirled and danced in the raging wind.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022NO!\u0022\u003C/em\u003E Clouds churned overhead. Thunder split the sky and lightning rent the air. Searing bolts struck the asphalt, leaving deep, smoldering holes in their wake. All creation seemed to erupt against this transgression. Behind the figure, even the very ground tore open, to swallow up this abomination and purge it from the world.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWherever she looked, an object shot away. The window frame. An old chair. A hubcap. With each blow, each hit, the figure stumbled backwards, inching ever close to the abyss. Teetering on the edge. Her eyes fell upon the manhole cover. Like a bidden warrior, it flew from its place and charged the monster, glowing with crimson fire. To slay it. To end it. To put right what had nearly gone wrong.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd stopped a centimeter from its face.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a moment, iron hung in the air in failed agony before clattering to the ground with a hail of sparks. In its other hand, the figure held up... \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0The light seemed to flee before it. Like a perversion of the very light itself, it gave off \u003Cem\u003Edarkness\u003C/em\u003E, and cast shadows of light. Standing in the hellish glimmer of a dozen fires, their glow strewn in negative across its face, the figure raised a hand to its brow, and eyed the blood on its fingers.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeaving, spent, the girl fell to her knees.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I don\u0027t know... how one of \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E... got \u003Cem\u003Ehere\u003C/em\u003E...\u0022 the figure huffed, \u0022but it doesn\u0027t matter...
