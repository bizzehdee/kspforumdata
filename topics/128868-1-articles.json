This meant that debugging the error became exceptionally frustrating, as every test would result in the development environment crashing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETracking down and fixing the bug took three days of constant experimenting , digging, ruling out causes, and restarting Unity. All this resulted in the suspicion that this was a Unity bug, and that we\u2019d have work around a part of the game\u2019s engine, but first the cause had to be isolated. Felipe created an isolated project to identify where the NaN errors were coming from and succeeded, though only if he included a small component of KSP\u2019s own code. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it turned out the cause of the problem was in the joints between parts, and how those interacted with a component called CollisionEnhancer which ensures parts can\u2019t punch through terrain if they collide really fast with it. Neither side was directly responsible for the bug: the joints worked as usual, and CollisionEnhancer was also producing correct and stable results. The bug happened when, after a collision CollisionEnhancer would correct the position of parts that had punched through the terrain, causing the joints to exert the maximum amount of force they could, which as we were to find, was set to infinity. That then caused the vessel to get moved to infinity (because it was moved at infinity m/s by this infinite force), causing the entire simulation to break down in a cascade of invalid values.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fix was fortunately simple: Felipe set the maximum force allowed for joints to a very high, but still finite value. This just goes to show that code which didn\u2019t cause any problems in Unity 4 (the joints setup hadn\u2019t changed) can cause unexpected bugs in Unity 5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDan (Danrosas) has created some very unique content for Kerbal Space Program: \u00A0the vines we released earlier this week feature a more \u201Ctraditional\u201D. Dan created old-school animations with paper, camera, pencils and the sort. The community feedback has been great: the gifts Vine has more than 25k loops already!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQA testing has started for the Unity 5 update, and Ted has been hard at work to prioritize the stream of issues that\u2019s pouring in. Given the scope of the update we expected this, but it\u2019s not very efficient when the developers have to go in and spend hours categorizing and prioritizing issues before they get to work, so we\u2019ve handed that task off to Ted instead. His wishes to spend Christmas with his family had to take a back seat to KSP development (not really). Dave (TriggerAu) has completed the \u201CFunctional\u201D test list which has been a great help in making sure we\u2019re taking a proper look at every part of the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of workload, Joe (Dr Turkey) has been diving into the administrative side of a console release. The certification process is a long and labour intensive one. Did you know how many certification forms are too many forms? One. Now multiply that by a million. Times three, because every console manufacturer likes their own brand of forms to be filled out. We\u2019re also trying to explain to PEGI that exploding Kerbals are not violent. As Kasper (KasperVld) put it earlier: violence comprises of an act and an intent to commit harm. Since exploding rockets (generally) aren\u2019t the result of an intent to commit harm to the poor Kerbals we disagree with the violent label.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob (Roverdudeis currently finishing up a new mod (not stock!) on KSPTV - The \u2018Malemute\u2019 Rover - and finally got to do some test spins before working on it\u2019s UV map and textures - so if you\u2019re at all interested in KSP modding and modeling, be sure to take a peek at 8PM ET on Sundays!
