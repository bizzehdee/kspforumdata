I started making a custom config for fuel tanks from a mod pack to eventually hopefully get it so they\u0027re realistic for RSS/RealismOverhaul using Real Fuels. But I\u0027m a bit confused. I\u0027ve basically set it up to where it works how I intended, with the right fuel ratio and the right fuels for the engines. But I\u0027m not sure why the dry mass values are changing after I add the liquid fuels to the tank. It\u0027s throwing off my calculations, and I mean from this perspective either it\u0027s not supposed to work that way (it doesn\u0027t seem to make sense in my head, but maybe I\u0027m unaware why it should work that way), or I just don\u0027t know how to edit the starting values of the tank. I can edit them in the tanks\u0027 main config file but when I try to work with them in the VAB, they values don\u0027t change proportionally to the changes I\u0027ve made in the default file. So I\u0027m assuming there\u0027s got to be some other place that I\u0027ve not seen where I need to edit something to fix it.
