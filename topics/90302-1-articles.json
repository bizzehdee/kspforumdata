I like the challenge presented by RemoteTech and TAC LS, to give a few examples. But FAR? it made launches frustrating, had to babysit the rocket too much, I often had seemingly inexplicable crashes or rockets randomly flipping . . . and since I don\u0027t fly planes much at all . . .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found myself missing asparagus staging and launching with contraptions shaped like a circus tent on top of the rocket (part of what, I always felt, seprates the fun of Kerbals from the seriouslness of real spaceflight). I began to dread having to completely re-engineer tried-and-true designs, and though I have long since moved past the fly-to-10Km-and-turn-right method of launching (I watched how mechjeb does it and mimicked that), I find the savings in d/V to be pretty thin with FAR, in comparison.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI remember building the base lifter from Manley\u0027s Recyclable Space Program. I couldn\u0027t believe what a pain in the ass it was to get to a stable orbit. Made me realize that, as much as I enjoy watching him play the game, I was a different kind of Kerbal player than he. FAR forced me to a similar conclusion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMostly it became \u003Cstrong\u003Ework\u003C/strong\u003E. God forbid, I am not getting a stipend from NASA to play this game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, that\u0027s my rant on FAR. It is an amazing mod, and I gave it three weeks . . . just beyond my threshold of fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESOOOOO . . . this brings me to a few questions: I understand that Kerbal is planning to eventually move to a FAR-type model in the future. Is this gonna be real, wishful thinking, an option or hardwired into the game? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I play with the latest B9, but mostly for a few parts within. I do want to build, at some point, a larger SSTO for ferrying Kerbals and fuel and whatnot to stations. without FAR, just how out-of-whack is a B9 SSTO?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Boomerang","CreatedById":92198,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-14T21:02:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEh, just do you. No one worth taking seriously is going to think less of you for playing the game the way you enjoy. It is, after all, a game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I\u0027m mostly in the same boat, if it makes you feel better. While I can appreciate the work that\u0027s gone into FAR and the issues with stock aero are terribly obvious, I\u0027d rather have to deal with cheesy physics than add even more dev time to all my crafts. And NEAR is just FAR sans aero failures and the tools required to fine-tune your crafts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the future, I very much doubt Squad would implement anything as demanding as FAR is. Aerodynamic shielding seems to be in the works, so that parts in cargo bays have their drag reduced. Hopefully we get that and some more sensible aerodynamic features that allow players to continuing building craft in mostly the same ways we can now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-14T22:11:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAmusingly I love FAR for rockets, but hate it for planes.

FAR is an incredible addition (IMO) to the game, and the creator(s) are fantastically talented to build it. It\u0027s a niche thing though. If you\u0027re interested in something...like...FAR, but not quite the dramatics of it, then give NEAR a go. Keeps some of the elements, but allows a lot more room to just have some fun too. In the end, it\u0027s a video game, and the point of it is to stay entertained. Not annoyed. Play your game the way you want to. Me personally, I am a big time Mod fan. My mods are way out of control, but I have fun.
