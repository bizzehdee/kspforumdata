I have known about KSP for quite some time now and have fiddled around with it every once and a while, but then 0.22 came out! A kind of objective to the game. Something that I can try and set an objective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recently thought that I could do a lets play on just that, But I was missing out on one aspect of the game. How to actually play it, so I\u0027m in need of some help, whilst this may be my lets play you guys can really help me out by commenting any techniques you have found or even some goals that you would like me to do in the mere future. I have already got an outstanding response from my first episode on different social media for example Twitter and Reddit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m making this thread so you can help me out and by subscribing to this tread you will always see when new videos come out or if you need any help maybe you might read some things other people might have to say.
