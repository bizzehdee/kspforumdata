That and lack of consistent will. Sigh. Well, I decided to finally give it a proper go, and I thought what better handrail than a forum challenge to guide me! This series of reports is designed to follow the Apollo Applications Project challenge by GregoxMun, and add a bit more flavour than simply posting the images.

NASA was recently formed by the UKS as a direct response to successes by the United Soviet States of Krussia (USSK) and their recent, relentless successes in the field of space: not 10 years ago, Kaputnik I became the first object to slip the surly bonds of our planet and orbit around Kerbin. This \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153satellite\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 tormented the UKS for several days, broadcasting its eerie beeping to the entire world. This was but the first in a line of firsts: subsequent flights by the Krussians have culminated in what is seen by many as the pinnacle of technological and scientic progress, namely the first manned flight in the history of kerbalkind as Yuri Kerbin became the first Kerbal to see our planet from space. In response, President JF. Kerman laid down an almighty gauntlet to the Krussians; he will put UKS boots on the surface of the moon before the decade is out. But with just 2 years to go until this monumental challenge must be completed, one has to wonder; how are NASA going to do this?*\n\n**South Kerland Spaceport \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Vehicle Assembly Building**\n\n8^th^ November 1967\n\nAbe: \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Gentlemen.
