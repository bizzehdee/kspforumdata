All forms of optical scanner science would be highly transmittable (80-100%), but would come at the cost of large amount of data needed to be transmitted to get the science. The size of the camera would determine where biome specific experiments would be available (the lowest tier would only be biome specific landed, general science above that, the mid tier (heavy but still radially mounted) would have biomes in space low, while the largest optical experiment would have biomes in space high and space low but unusable on the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat new science experiments would you like to see?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-08T13:32:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProper satellite mapping for starters.
