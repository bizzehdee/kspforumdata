What I started getting concerned about was all the leftover anchor points when a payload is connected to the final stage. Do those count as parts? Or does the strut itself count as the part and when it vanishes, the anchor points don\u0027t matter? Or does just the first anchor point count?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I setup a simple experiment with a very simple 2 stage rocket and found that when final part counts are a concern, it\u0027s important to draw the strut from the lower stage to the upper stage as the part count originates from the first anchor point. The second anchor point just sits there, not counting as a part. Which makes sense, since the first anchor point is the piece that is grabbed from the part menu.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome screenshots:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe final stage, only 7 parts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hNNSEyh.jpg?2\u0022 alt=\u0022hNNSEyh.jpg?2\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe complete rocket. 16 parts including 4 struts and 2 gantries:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nV5xrF9.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022nV5xrF9.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy drawing the struts from the de-coupler to the final stage, the part count for the final stage came to 0 struts and 7 parts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TjVPW7d.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022TjVPW7d.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy drawing the struts from the final stage to the de-coupler, the part count for the final stage came to 4 struts and 11 parts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9P3sCic.png?1\u0022 alt=\u00229P3sCic.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs aside note, after I got done, I got to wondering if the little thing could get up to a 70km orbit.

Some tweaking of the size of the first stage fuel tank would probably help in getting into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as struts, a lot depends on the part design. Examples I will post are all Nova Punch parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis ship, a stack of five 1.25 x 6 meter tanks, has no struts. One would think from past experience that it would wobble itself apart in flight if not on the launch pad. Yet, it was extremely stable from launch to Kerbal escape velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LivgZCw.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022LivgZCw.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one you would think would also be extremely stable. NOT! It wobbled like a wet noodle until I strutted the hell out of it. Even then, I had to add small cubes in order to get anchor points for struts to connect the tapered sections of that rocket. It still is not totally stable but flew straight enough to send the probe directly into Kerban.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/73cVUHe.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002273cVUHe.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"I_do_robots","CreatedById":80480,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-18T12:57:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERegarding strut work and some things I\u0027d like to offer...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my builds, if the payload is heavy enough or stands out larger than the main tube diameter, moving the CG up the main body tube, I like to get the engine / tank cluster out wider. To do that, I like to use the little black and white pylons, attached to radial mounts and girders if I need them out further. It\u0027s simplistic but leaves much to be desired when it comes to stability through the launch and ascent. To keep the part count down (And weight) and still get the job done, I like to run struts to the upper and lower ends of each tank tube and a single connector at the tops and bottoms around the cluster as well. Keeps everything reasonably light and adds some structural integrity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings I got used to in doing this often.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Regardless of whether it\u0027s a single strut or 8 at a time (Or anything in between) I always mount the first anchor on the main tube side. I don\u0027t know why, but the game physics engine seems to get confused, especially if I am doing multiple mirror attachments, and tries to only \u0022Wrap\u0022 them around the single tank I start with if I try to attach the fist strut end to the item I want mated to the main body. It will then only attach the first one and wrap that tank with as many anchors as I would\u0027ve liked to wrap the whole cluster with and the game still counts them as parts, despite that the anchor point is the only thing visible. I also usually cannot \u0022Grab\u0022 the exposed part, usually the \u0022Focus\u0022 highlight hovering the mouse, will only let me select what the anchor is attached to, so, another reason I start from the main body out and save often...Much easier to go back and reload a build then to have to tear stuff back off and replace them with identical assemblies because I lost 7 anchors in a fuel tank body. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI always anchor from the main rocket body out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes, if it\u0027s just not going to accept a multiple mirror because the cluster layout is odd or I want to only anchor every other one but the pie wheel default changes as soon as I get the anchor near a rocket body part., then I almost have no choice but to \u0022Single\u0022 select and individually place them and avoid another mess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnchors are strong, no need to \u0022bird nest\u0022 struts all over the place. As long as the top, bottom, and radial integrity has some form of balanced structural support, I can get it into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope these observations help too...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne digressing side note:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe further out from the main tube I mount engine clusters, the more of a bear the whole thing become to get to respond to turns, especially during ascent in the atmosphere stage, so, I treat it like sailing, work with the wind, not force or fight it into a turn...If I over-correct, the whole thing may keep on going on over and start right back down in an unrecoverable dive surface bound. Fins (especially with ailerons) and canards do help some, but, if you go that route, get your turns in while you\u0027re at atmospheric levels, There will be a steady (Obviously) decrease in response as the air thins. I count on well placed thrusters to manage maneuvering and attitude adjustments once in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"daffy","CreatedById":76045,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-24T13:38:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat thread.
