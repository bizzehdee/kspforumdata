I just acquired the nuke, how great, it makes things so much easier once you\u0027re \u0022up there\u0022. Really, the main issue is not having all the BIG parts (which save parts), and all the tiny parts (which make things light). Using 8 T30s is a great Mainsail substitute, except for the fact that it\u0027s 1 part vs 16 (8 for the T30s and 8 girders).
