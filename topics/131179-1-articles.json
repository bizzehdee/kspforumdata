However, I\u0027m having a problem finding some of the parts from the Kolonization mod(inflatable buildings). I\u0027m seeing all of the Kerbal Planetary Base Systems parts and some nuclear reactors and a bunch of storage Kontainers under a new tab in my construction buildings which I assume came from some USI dependency I had to download.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am using v 1.0.5 with stock tech tree.
