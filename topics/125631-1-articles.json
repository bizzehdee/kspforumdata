Its in a polar orbit, plenty of batteries and panels, it allows me to deploy and scan the planet but then nothing happens. It simply gets to 100% and thats it. I try to go to the overlay and select ore but it tells me I still have yet to complete an oribital survey? Unsure if it was a bug I launched a second probe around kerbin which met the conditions and again, the scan gets to 100% and then nothing. Am I missing something?\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe mods I am using are:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nKAS \u002B KIS\u003Cbr\u003E\nMechjeb (for oribtal data)\u003Cbr\u003E\nRemote Tech\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy best guess is maybe remote tech is causing some kind of interference as it sends the data to relay sattelites rather than to mission control directly. I have not tested it with a manned craft yet but will do so next while I hope for a reply. Thanks!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit: Manned flights were also unsuccesful. Again, full 100% scan yet it claims I have no resource data....I have also gotten a reply on the steam forums where two others are experiencing similar issues. In one instance the individual has no mods and the exact same issue as I have and in the other instance he is able to see the oribtal data from any ship but not the tracking station.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T17:37:25Z","Content":"\nHi WarShipMe, are you running into [U][URL=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/138802-Kerbal-Space-Program-1-0-5-New-Issues-Repository#trackingcenter_resource_overlay\u0022]this issue?[/URL][/U]\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WarShipMe","CreatedById":153661,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T02:07:13Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027sal_vager\u0027]Hi WarShipMe, are you running into [U][URL=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/138802-Kerbal-Space-Program-1-0-5-New-Issues-Repository#trackingcenter_resource_overlay\u0022]this issue?[/URL][/U][/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks for the reply, but sadly no, I am unable to see the resources in any capacity. Is this something that can maybe be toggled off and on and i somehow toggled it off? Even in flight, if I switch the map and select the planet, I should see the resources on the right hand side and I do but they still claim I need to perform a scan\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Treveli","CreatedById":102579,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T01:39:43Z","Content":"\nI\u0026#39;m having the same issue with the scanner. 100% data transmission, survey complete, no resource data available in any screen it should be in. Right clicking on the scanner after the survey does not bring any options other than retract scanner and doing the survey. I have the same mods as WarShipMe listed (plus several others). But, before 1.0.5, the scanner was working correctly with the same mods (minus KIS). I was having issues transmitting science from ScanSat, but have since applied the patch they released for it and the ScanSat scanners are working fine now. Just the M700 is affected now.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Treveli","CreatedById":102579,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T14:54:20Z","Content":"\nOk, I dumped everything out of GameData except for the original Squad folder, then began adding mods (about 22 total) back in to see if one of them broke the scanner using a fresh sandbox save.

I have been distracted by Battlefront the last couple days but played today and my next course of action will be to entirely uninstall the game and with a fresh install add back in the mods one at a time checking after each to see if that can fix it or narrow down the cause. I have not tested in sandbox but will do that also, hopefully its not a busted save. As far as the tracking station issue, other people with unmodded versions have mentioned this issue so its possible that might be a known bug but that is not something I have seen confirmed. At least being able to see the data in flight makes it playable!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWill update when I have tried these things.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arsonide","CreatedById":32604,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T05:58:00Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Treveli\u0027]Ok, I dumped everything out of GameData except for the original Squad folder, then began adding mods (about 22 total) back in to see if one of them broke the scanner using a fresh sandbox save.
