Normally I have just enough lights to mark the docking ports so I can line up for docking. Battery packs also make good markers if you want a part that has a double purpose. Battery packs have lights on them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo lower the part count, reduce the number of solar panels. You have those 2x3 panels all over. Unless you\u0027re using a mod that has something that requires power (Kethane refinery, Ioncross life support, etc.) then you don\u0027t need that many solar panels. Two Gigantor arrays generate about 16 power each per second around Kerbin. That\u0027s more than enough power unless you\u0027re using mods. I use Ioncross Life Support and one Gigantor array will run the station, plus the lights and the oxygen recyclers with an excess of power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe grid of connectors and docking ports on the left side looks nice, but do you really need that many docking ports?

If you don\u0027t ever intend to use the engine after docking, you might want to consider a means to decouple it. Better yet, don\u0027t give it an engine at all, since you don\u0027t want to be cannibalizing payload fuel to get it in orbit, that\u0027s defeating the purpose. Take off the engine and put another Senior there, place the payload atop an appropriate lifter, and once you get near the station, decouple the node and tug it into place.
