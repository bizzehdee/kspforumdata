For example, re-entry into Earth\u2019s larger atmosphere provides a significantly greater challenge relative to re-entry in Kerbin\u2019s smaller atmosphere, and the physics of the game are not changed to make Kerbin more like Earth. Kerbin is Kerbin. A slight diversion is while orbital mechanics for vessels and celestial bodies are based on KSP\u2019s default 2-body physics simulation, n-body physics behavior is also sometimes taken into account for story purposes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditional aspects of reality that affect the gameplay and thus the story include but are not limited to: the speed of light is properly calculated when determining signal delay between vessels; Kerbals that die stay dead, and kerbals that survive horrific crashes end up injured; Some rocket engines may only have a limited number of restarts; Cryogenic fuel boils off; Radiation is a serious concern; Life support is required for crewed missions; Rockets take time to build, roll out, launch and be recovered; Technology is gained and applied gradually over time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\nRealistic Presentation\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll the actions and events that occur throughout the KSA\u2019s history are presented to you as if they are actually happening at any given time (see the FAQ tab above for more on the use of Earth time). Largely through this website, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://twitter.com/KSA_MissionCtrl\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E@KSA_MissionCtrl\u003C/a\u003E and the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ops.kerbalspace.agency\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOperations Tracker\u003C/a\u003E, you are able to immerse yourself in the regular operations of the Agency and keep tabs on what is happening. These operations are all supported by numerous materials including vessel blueprints, surface maps, visualizations, info-graphics, telemetry data, on-board camera images, videos and more, dispersed through our various media channels (see icons at top of page on desktop browsers)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile other players prefer to use YouTube or livestreams on Twitch or convert their missions to stories or graphic novels, the KSA is presented in the style of actual space agencies like NASA, ESA, CSA, JAXA, etc. While it\u2019s possible to see much of their operations in person, the majority of people see only what is shown via the agency\u2019s various media outlets, as it is with the KSA. Such operations will be carried out following much of the same procedures and guidelines put in place by actual agencies. You may very well forget that this is all happening based on a game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLearn more about the KSA on \u003Ca href=\u0022http://bit.ly/AboutTheKSA\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eour website\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFrequently Asked Questions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E#1 Why do you use Earth time (days/months/years)?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u2019s no real point in making people have to learn a different time system when they are trying to follow along with ongoing operations. Being able to split events into days/weeks/month/years that people already comprehend just makes everything easier to follow. A lot of what we do can be followed online via our \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ops.kerbalspace.agency\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOperations Tracker\u003C/a\u003E, where you can watch launches, maneuvers and see the craft move, so it\u2019s important that people have a good understanding of when things are happening if they want to watch. There are numerous in-jokes made about the kerbals using a system of time that has no relation to their planet. Hey how do they even speak English?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E#2 How does the Ops Tracker work?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA common misconception about the Operations Tracker is that it\u2019s pulling data from an always-running copy of KSP similar to how web-based telemetry mods like Telemachus operate. The Operations Tracker however is not a real-time system, it\u2019s just simulating a real-time system. Data for vessels and bodies are stored in states that are stamped with a specific time they are valid in seconds since the start of the game. When you view the Operations Tracker it pulls up the previous state of the vessel/body nearest to the current time you are viewing and extrapolates any data it needs from that point on. This is similar to how the game actually works \u2013 if you view your SFS save file you will see the last state your vessels were in and when you load the game it uses those values to calculate where in orbit the vessel should be for the current point in time and how it should travel from there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe actual technology behind the Operations Tracker is a rather horrible mash of Javascript and ASP tied to MsAccess databases (see the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/KSAMissionCtrl/OpsTracker\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGithub repository\u003C/a\u003E for details). It\u2019s not pretty, but the author was never really a web developer, and it all seems to work okay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E#3 Is the game actually played in real time?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo. Events are fed to you, the audience, in real time but the game itself takes full advantage of time warp wherever possible. If 4 in-game days pass in the span of a real day, then it will be 4 real days before those events are made fully available to the audience. In fact a lead time of 1-3 months is generally in place so the author can take time off if needed without having to interrupt any ongoing KSA events. Usually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E#4 What type of game mode is KSP played in?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCareer mode is used, however it is modified to allow the KSA to develop in its own way rather than strictly by how the game decides career saves should progress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E#5 What mods are used by the KSA?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can find the full listing of mods in use and various notes about their use in our \u003Ca href=\u0022https://bit.ly/KSAModList\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMod Installation Log\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E#6 Why is the sun yellow in space and not white?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe see a white sun in space because of how hot it is, and a yellow sun from Earth due to scattering in the atmosphere. Kerbol (known in the game as The Sun but we prefer Kerbol) is smaller and cooler, so it appears yellow from space. It should probably appear a slightly different color when viewed from Kerbin but due to game engine limitations that\u2019s not possible for now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E#7 Is there actual weather in the game?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSadly, no. Several attempts have been made by modders to introduce weather but none have been completed. However consideration is given to what the weather could or should be like, and is simulated as best as possible with what options are available. For example rainy days don\u2019t actually cause rain to happen in the game, but anything that would be affected by the rain like aircraft simply don\u2019t fly missions. Weather is mentioned a lot in our tweets because it brings about more variation in missions, but any wind/rain/etc is not affecting anything in the game itself (although missions are still played as if they are as best as possible). Foggy or overcast days are done by changing the altitude/density of the clouds, and cloud altitudes can be changed to be low or high depending on what the plot requires to keep things interesting. There is one instance of actual game weather \u2013 the clouds do move while the game is running, so sky conditions change dynamically. This is sometimes used to determine if/when missions that rely on clear skies are launched or not. Other times it is a plot decision.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E#8 How many people work on this project?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust one. He has no life. However a lot of what is used by the KSA in all aspects are also assisted by the KSP community in general in the form of ideas, mods, code libraries, graphics, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E#9 Will the KSA ever share universe with other twitter accounts?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo. Maintaining a shared universe across more than one hobbyist project generally is not a good idea, and too much extra work would need to go into planning to keep things working together. It\u2019s been tried to various extents in the past, so this is not just a belief but a proven fact.

Real-world years. Hopefully the KSP community will still be around, but if not hopefully everyone who has stopped playing or just burned out from playing will still enjoy following along.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E#12 Why is it taking so long to get to space (kerbed missions, stations, other planets, etc)?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause space is hard? But really though, it is, and part of the aim for this project is to reflect that, and also reflect the effort that real-world space agencies put in, through the billions of hours worked by their thousands of employees. When I finally send a probe to another planet after a few actual years, I hope to feel just a small slice of what actual spacecraft mission participants have had to endure to get their missions to their destinations (and I don\u2019t just mean travel time \u2013 did you know New Horizons took over a decade of work just to get to the launch pad?). There is also the fact that KSP is still a very actively-developed game both from the actual game makers and the modding community, which means the longer it takes for KSA to do something the better it will look. Finally, taking everything slow lets me, the sole project owner, actually handle it all without getting overwhelmed as more and more operations begin to take place over time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E#13 Could you burn out?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u2019s very possible, hopefully it won\u2019t happen. But if it does, it probably won\u2019t be anyone\u2019s fault but my own for working too hard\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E#14 Will the KSA visit other star systems?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually, yes. That will take even longer \u2013 although the advent of some form of FTL technology will likely come about to help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E#15 What can I do to support the KSA?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBe active and responsive \u2013 I love \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/TtmuO#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Einteracting with people on twitter\u003C/a\u003E.

The department heads (Simon, Wernher, Cheranne and Mortimer) were all running about their respective facilities making sure everything was where it needed to be and everyone had what they needed to have to do their jobs. Drew spent most of the week off site finalizing some last-minute business deals with suppliers from the underground cities and Lanalye wasn\u2019t even around since she was attending an ASA conference to talk about new safety protocols for unkerbed spaceflight and its effect on air traffic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crew were all busy settling in to their new homes in the astronaut complex section of the administrative campus and getting into a daily workout routine, which included runs along the runways and climbs up and down the internal \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E scaffolding \u2013 Simon made sure they were all careful as there are no guardrails or safety nets up there.

Everyone\u2019s excited \u2013 it will either fly up into the sky or explode spectacularly on the ground \u2013 one way or another it\u2019ll be awesome!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFrom the Desk of Drew Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11px;\u0022\u003E(\u003Cspan title=\u0022Out of Character Behind the Scenes stuff\u0022\u003EOut of Character Behind the Scenes stuff\u003C/span\u003E)\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWritten on 8/3/16\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello! Great to be back to playing KSP at long last after calling it \u201Cquits\u201D late last year. I honestly did not think it would take me this long to recover but unsurprisingly my aspirations got the better of me \u2013 it was mostly getting all the \u201C\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/5QhNA\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecool stuff\u003C/a\u003E\u201D working with the flight tracker, which is hilarious because most of the \u201Ccool stuff\u201D I can\u2019t even use for a few months or years as I work to get the Agency back to even close to where it was when I last left off. But still \u2013 it\u2019s there, it\u2019s done, it\u2019s ready and looking forward to using it just gives me even more incentive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nComing back to this, I\u2019m excited to have a lot more of a well-considered infrastructure in place to base everything on from the very start. The backstory of Kerbin and the kerbals is fully fleshed out to fit with the current state of affairs at the the start of the program (and even a direction I want to head in story-wise in relation to The Monolith). This website, the flight tracker and the crew roster are all integrated and ready to provide a complete Agency experience, with YouTube, flickr, imgur and instagram also helping out in various aspects. Of course the main focus remains on twitter but everything is much more tightly integrated with it now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving forward I\u2019ll be using this space of the weekly ops review to take a closer look at things from the past week from an out of character (OOC) perspective and/or comment on personal issues that are related to my work with the KSA program. On that note, I\u2019m going to come out and say right now that I do plan to setup a Patreon and Paypal donations, but that won\u2019t be for a few months as I want to get things really rolling first. I\u2019m not going to stop doing this if I don\u2019t get donations, because this is something I enjoy doing, but if anything disrupts the perfect life balance I have right now (seriously, I\u2019m a lucky son of a poodle to have all the free time I have to do this) I would of course be forced to stop if I actually needed substantial alternate income that could only be provided by a \u201Creal job\u201D. So having donation avenues open and established will be a possible fallback option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd just to remind you all that I pride the authenticity of my tweets \u2013 yes, I made sure that when the tracking station bounced an echo off Mun it was above the horizon at that time \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E (although further editing weeks after I scheduled that tweet but before it was published I realized I initially used kilometers instead of meters for the travel distance.

We are still investigating the cause of the event but obviously the parachute is our prime suspect and was recovered with what remained of the payload. The booster also survived landing with a damaged-beyond-repair engine bell and all three fins reduced to splinters. Because we couldn\u2019t recover the avionics unit only basic telemetry data was collected via low-gain transmission to the tracking station to save battery power during flight.

The booster once again survived impact, but is no longer usable. Still, it and the previous one will provide useful data in impact tolerances. The recovered avionics unit will reveal much more detail about the second flight, which was launched without spin-stabilization. We can also re-use all recovered parts except the parachute, which needs to remain unpacked for analysis and will be unusable afterwards. Next week will see engineers and R\u0026amp;D focusing on this week\u2019s launch data so expect news throughout the week. While the analysis is ongoing, two Mk1-Bs will be constructed for similar flight trials the following week.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EBallooning High with KerBalloons\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe just \u003Ca href=\u0022http://bit.ly/KerBalloonPR2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ereleased a report earlier today\u003C/a\u003E that covers the mission success of the first KerBalloon test flight, which carried a payload up to a record-setting 16.5km.

Yea, it takes me a few weeks to just get the game ready to play, and then I have to work through \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E issues that only show up during play. Such is modding. The most annoying issue so far is the craft\u2019s tendency to want to \u201Cbounce\u201D when it loads, which trips the state of the vessel over from Prelaunch to Launched and starts the mission timer clock and can fire off contract stuff. Right now it seems to work when I revert the launch after the initial load from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, but if I timewarp it bounces when warp is cancelled. I tried looking into it but narrowing down the mod was inconclusive. If it continues to annoy me I\u2019ll take the time to dig into it again but the reload workaround is good enough for now, I just don\u2019t load up the craft to the launchpad until a few minutes before launch so I don\u2019t need to timewarp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn top of game issues, there are issues with getting all the support material set up. This is mainly in regards to the Flight Tracker since I\u2019m scheduling things in advance before I can reset the \u201Cin game clock\u201D that tells it what day KSA operations begin (a few weeks from now \u2013 writing this in mid-August). So technically right now I\u2019m in negative UT and the Flight Tracker can\u2019t handle that so I need to workaround that until Sept 13th when I reach positive UT. I\u2019m also really happy I took the time to document all my database fields, because remembering how to set things up would have been a nightmare otherwise. So TL;DR I\u2019m already lagging in my bid to get a month\u2019s lead time in place prior to Sept 13th.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, let\u2019s discuss image editing, because there was a lot of it this week. You already saw the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E images and I already have a good explanation for how I do those \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/63688-kerbal-space-agency-twitter-fiction-14-month-update/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=1773699\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E (scroll down the post). You can also find out info for my blueprint designs\u2026 uhm\u2026 I wrote about it \u003Cem\u003Esomewhere\u003C/em\u003E\u2026 if I can\u2019t hunt it down I\u2019ll do another quickie in a later weekly update.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, the images I want to talk about are the two eclipses linked above. The solar eclipse is a composite of three images \u2013 mainly the eclipse (which is an in-game effect from Scatterer) and an earlier dawn photo that had darker mountains on the horizon so I used those. But I also measured the rate at which the visible planets were moving and positioned them appropriately since the game didn\u2019t show them when the sky darkened. The munar eclipse was simply a bit of layering, using an additive filter and also some RGB curve tweaking to get the desired \u201Cblood mun\u201D effect, although I didn\u2019t use the word \u201Cblood\u201D because I haven\u2019t decided if kerbals have red blood or not yet. I\u2019m not really as pleased with the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.flickr.com/gp/kerbal_space_agency/akd1i0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Efull eclipse photo\u003C/a\u003E, but I think it passes pretty good. While I can see the phase of the eclipse thanks to Environmental Visual Enhancements (so the eclipse photo over \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E is where the Mun was during the total eclipse, visible because I disabled \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E body shadows for that shot), Mun does not actually turn red so I had to do that myself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh and yes, the KerBalloon path was completely made up. I will be evolving a weather model for Kerbin as things progress, but I\u2019m really hoping the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96031-Kerbal-Weather-Systems%21-Alpha-0-0-3-WIP%21-%28Oct-09%29-Add-some-weather-for-your-parades\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EKerbal Weather Systems\u003C/a\u003E mod will see the light of day at some point, although I fear their focus on such a hardcore simulation will be a bit too much to handle. Although backstory itself provides a good reason as to why meteorology is a new field of science for kerbals, the reality is I\u2019m trying to delay weather insights as much as possible to reduce any consistency issues if I ever am able to transition to using the weather mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u2019s also been really oppressively hot again this week. I\u2019m writing that in actually because I\u2019d rather not have to make up lost time to not being able to work at my PC because of the heat and just have the KSA have problems too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso Win10 anniversary update borked my PC and cost me a few hours work. I suspect it sneakily (but unsurprisingly) re-enabled my graphics card automatic driver updates without telling me, which caused the problems since rolling back to older drivers fixed things. I have a generation gap in my two AMD gfx cards so any newer drivers will kill the older card.

The larger data set from the second rocket combined with the smaller data set from the first (transmitted via lo-gain signal to the tracking station during flight) gave us the ability to compare and contrast major events from both flights, as well as look very closely at the performance of the second.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two flights only differed in the angle of the fins on the rocket \u2013 the first flight used a 1.5\u003Cspan\u003E\u00B0\u003C/span\u003E pitch on all three fins to spin up the rocket as it ascended. The spin up was successful but an unbalanced payload caused a large wobble in the spin, made worse when the payload detached from the booster. The relatively extreme G-load (\u0026gt;3Gs) remained during chute deployment and tore several of the support lines, causing the chute to not fully deploy. The second launch also had a spinning payload after booster separation (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoUxxQ8W6R4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esee launch video\u003C/a\u003E), but not enough to cause a chute deployment issue.

That Win10 glitch I thought I had solved turned out to be a more serious issue than I thought and forced me to buy a new graphics card to replace my older one that runs the two side monitors flanking my main display, which runs off a Radeon 7970. I ended up getting a cheap R7-250x that could also run the same driver version as the 7970. All this led me to delay the start of KSA operations by a week, which was a pain in itself to get everything rescheduled properly.

The location was chosen so the transit could be monitored from sun up to sun down.

Much of their early focus rested on closing out the KerBalloons project and testing the first prototype. That out of the way, while they await the next order to be fulfilled, they have returned focus to developing additional rocket payload instruments. Chief among these are pressure and temperature sensors, which are in high demand right now by kerbal meteorologists looking to get a better understanding of the atmospheric behavior since re-stabilizing after the asteroid impact. The temperature sensor is nearest to completion and will be tested on an airship excursion next week to sample areas in the region for comparison to readings taken during last month\u2019s unusual heat wave. Lead Scientist Cheranne will be accompanying the 2-day expedition. Wernher says he expects both instruments to be flight-ready by the end of the month, to be flown on Progeny rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca class=\u0022ipsAttachLink ipsAttachLink_left\u0022 href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/front_Untitled-Space-Craft_5.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 style=\u0022float:left;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022front_Untitled-Space-Craft_5.png\u0022 height=\u0022100\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/front_Untitled-Space-Craft_5.png\u0022 style=\u0022width:121px;height:auto;\u0022 width=\u0022121\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E In additional R\u0026amp;D news, further development has been made on the fuel processing that will create the juice to power liquid rockets.

These rocket motors will continue to be used in various forms as our program develops but they must also be eventually superseded by their liquid fuel variants in order for us to truly achieve control over rocket flight. The necessary oxidizer that will combine with the liquid fuel to produce the explosive thrust has already been manufactured.

It\u2019s been something I\u2019ve been thinking about doing for a while. I have a personal twitter account already but I don\u2019t really use it much anymore and I wanted to create something KSP-related so that when I responded personally to things I saw in the KSA timeline people would have a good chance of realizing who it was. I also very much enjoyed the personal approach I took to the @KSA_MissionCtrl account during the hiatus and wanted to continue to have a way of communicating directly to fans. A lot of times in the past I wanted to reply to posts on twitter but doing so as @KSA_MissionCtrl just seemed awkward. I\u2019ve tweeted as much of all this when I first started @DKerman_KSA but in case it\u2019s all been buried by now, that was the reason for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYea that second Mk1-B launch had a cool consequence of the booster bumping the payload after separation. I was afraid the game wouldn\u2019t be able to replicate it for me to go back and video, but it did after several tries and I was able to capture some good footage. However I accidentally also captured the booster flying back and impacting the ground in a wide shot \u2013 I didn\u2019t even realize it until I was pretty much done and rendered out. So rather than go through filming it all over again I just went back and changed things I had written previously about where the booster landed \u2013 because it didn\u2019t come down in the same spot it did originally. I had to guesstimate it\u2019s landing location and then composite over the damaged booster from the original landing:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ctable align=\u0022center\u0022 border=\u00220\u0022 cellpadding=\u00221\u0022 cellspacing=\u00221\u0022 style=\u0022width:500px;\u0022\u003E\u003Ctbody\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/mk1-b-booster_29511227235_o.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Original landing on the left, adjusted landing on the right\u0022 height=\u002294\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/mk1-b-booster_29511227235_o-300x94.png\u0022 srcset=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/mk1-b-booster_29511227235_o-300x94.png 300w, http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/mk1-b-booster_29511227235_o-768x240.png 768w, http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/mk1-b-booster_29511227235_o-1024x319.png 1024w\u0022 width=\u0022300\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOriginal landing on the left, adjusted landing on the right\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003C/tr\u003E\u003C/tbody\u003E\u003C/table\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI actually spent some time sourcing sound for this video, and it was as much of a pain in the ass as I thought it would be. I pulled the sound from a model rocket launch video on YouTube. The wind noise is from the Chatterer mod. Finding good sounds isn\u2019t easy, so I will not be including them in all my videos. But at least once I would like people to hear how I think the rockets should sound.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, the clouds really happened on that day for the first launch. I wanted a weather hold to happen, and was prepared to muck around with the cloud positions to make it happen, but I didn\u2019t have to. That was nice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDealing with a couple of issues that are holding things up and that\u2019s always annoying. The good news is that it\u2019s only holding up the creation and scheduling of content, not actually holding up my overall progression. It\u2019s taken me a while to get a good look to the sun while Minmus was transiting and I\u2019m still working on getting a few details right. Not sure how it will ultimately turn out but yes, I am writing this before the Minmus transit details you see posted above. I will have to come back and edit those in later. Such is the nature of having a month lead time to work things out. Another annoyance is CameraTools bouncing the camera up a few feet when a rocket is launched, which ruins the video I\u2019m trying to take. I let it go with the Progeny Mk1-A videos but I want it fixed for the Mk1-B footage and future videos, so hopefully the CameraTools maintainer can release a bug fix. For now I just use KerbCam for the initial launch footage and then switch to the zoomed-in CameraTools view (two separate videos).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u2019s another issue that I didn\u2019t notice and had to fix after the fact. Sometimes terrain textures get stretched and I failed to make note of this when taking the original image on the left so I had to go back to that day/time (yay HyperEdit) and position the camera close to the original location, take a screenshot and the composite in the booster and payload from the original image so the terrain would be proper.

Overall the higher-efficiency booster performed as designed, and all three survived impact. Examination of the spent booster cores show all solid fuel was expended and no aberrations were detected in the engine nozzles other than damage incurred from the impact upon landing. The highest apokee achieved was during the non-spinning second flight, where the payload reached an altitude of 1.549 km. Average max G-load during ascent was 13.1Gs and thrust was great enough to prevent the rocket from flipping over during its boost phase, although the nose did rise as high as 90 degrees before burnout. Velocity peaked at 236 m/s. Payload fairing separation and chute deployment went off without a hitch for two out of the three flights, but the second one experienced an anomaly when the booster collided with the payload after it was separated. The chute deployed late after the command was sent but ultimately returned the payload safely to the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe collision on the second flight was thought to have directed the booster on a trajectory that brought it curving back towards the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, where it impacted just southwest of the launchpad. However the third launch produced a similar behavior without an impact, and the booster flyback took it all the way to the tracking station, where it narrowly missed impacting one of our communication dishes. Engineers don\u2019t have enough data to form a clear picture as to what led the booster to behave in this manner without an impact when it fell down almost straight after detaching cleanly for the first flight. They suspect it had to do with the extra spin given to the booster by increased fin angle for the third launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpin stabilizing the rocket was a goal of these launches and engineers were disappointed with the performance of the first flight, which had 1.5 degrees of pitch on its fins and barely achieved any roll before burnout. However they were happy to have a direct comparison to the 1.5 degree pitch of the Mk1-A booster. The third launch pitched the fins to 5 degrees and produced a roll rate of 14 deg/s, which was very near the 15 deg/s minimum rate engineers were going for. Coupled with the Mk1-A lower stage they estimate a 2.5 deg pitch will work best for the Mk1-B when used as a second stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ccenter\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/KSP_x64.exe_DX9_20160914_040202.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg height=\u0022188\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/KSP_x64.exe_DX9_20160914_040202-300x188.png\u0022 srcset=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/KSP_x64.exe_DX9_20160914_040202-300x188.png 300w, http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/KSP_x64.exe_DX9_20160914_040202-768x480.png 768w, http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/KSP_x64.exe_DX9_20160914_040202-1024x640.png 1024w\u0022 width=\u0022300\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP_x64.exe_DX9_20160914_040202-300x188.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/KSP_x64.exe_DX9_20160914_040251.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg height=\u0022188\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/KSP_x64.exe_DX9_20160914_040251-300x188.png\u0022 srcset=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/KSP_x64.exe_DX9_20160914_040251-300x188.png 300w, http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/KSP_x64.exe_DX9_20160914_040251-768x480.png 768w, http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/KSP_x64.exe_DX9_20160914_040251-1024x640.png 1024w\u0022 width=\u0022300\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP_x64.exe_DX9_20160914_040251-300x188.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/center\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFlight profiles for all three launches show that once again the non-spinning rocket performed the best, which has led Simon to get his engineers working on a spin table in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E so that payloads can be checked for proper balance before being mounted on the booster. Although spinning rockets in general achieve a lower apokee due to energy being used to spin the rocket taking away from velocity (note the faster-spinning flight 3 went slightly lower than flight 1), the lack of payload balance also caused the payload to tumble a lot on all 3 axis after booster separation, which greatly increased drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext Monday Drew, Simon and Wernher will gather to decide on the next steps the Progenitor Program will take.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIs the Monolith Trying to Talk to Us?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTracking station staff spent the past week analyzing all the data collected from signal analysis during the various rocket launches, where they detected some interference on the frequencies being used to beam down telemetry.

It was a great first day for the Agency, lots of interaction on twitter to what was posted. Wonder what people will be thinking by the time they get to this point in the timeline, a month later. Let me know in the comments!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the hot days are finally past, for the most part anyways. Where I live doesn\u2019t cost me nearly anything in rent or utilities and I have everything I need but there is the downside of no A/C, which means once the mercury gets above 90F things start to get uncomfortable, especially when the PC is running KSP and has everything spooled up, generating a ton of extra heat. It was really frustrating to go a day without work because of the heat, but such are the trade-offs you make in life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess the most bizarre thing to happen this past week of operations was the booster flyback for the Mk1-B 2nd and 3rd flights. I mentioned last week how I had to tweak some things when the booster landed closer to the pad than it did originally. Well good thing because the third launch followed the same flyback ground track and went even further to almost impact the tracking station. It really did come close to taking out a dish. Not sure if those can be damaged individually. Glad I didn\u2019t have to find out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u2019s a better look at the editing I do for kerbolar eclipses that I talked about in an earlier desk notes where I said I changed the color of the mountains in the distance:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/KSP_x64.exe_DX9_20160911_1733141.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg height=\u0022150\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/KSP_x64.exe_DX9_20160911_1733141-1024x213.png\u0022 srcset=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/KSP_x64.exe_DX9_20160911_1733141-1024x213.png 1024w, http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/KSP_x64.exe_DX9_20160911_1733141-300x62.png 300w, http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/KSP_x64.exe_DX9_20160911_1733141-768x160.png 768w\u0022 width=\u0022720\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP_x64.exe_DX9_20160911_1733141-1024x213.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what you\u2019re seeing is the original eclipse screenshot captured from the game. Then I waited until just after the sun disappeared behind the mountains and took another screenshot. The mountains in the distance were then composited in Paint.NET and I made some hue/brightness adjustments to them in order to have them look more natural in my opinion. I also use \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71536\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EAmbient Light Adjustment\u003C/a\u003E to make the scene darker/brighter within the game to adjust for varying light levels (if there are more clouds in the image, I will make the scene darker).

The first launch, from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, was the easiest to manage and served to get the crews back to a familiar state with the process of launching a KerBalloon. Next, we coordinated with the Maritime Service to use one of their ships, the MSV Tongjess, to take a second probe out to sea for launch and recovery. If that wasn\u2019t enough, the location was just over the horizon. Sometimes comms had a good bounce off the atmosphere, but mostly they were unreliable enough that launch control simply had to wait for the probe to be launched and clear the horizon. Flight Director Lanalye was not very happy with this arrangement, but at the same time she places full trust in her launch crews. After a successful launch and recovery, the following day we got to put to use some of our off-road vehicles that were purchased with the initial founding payment of the KSA. These rovers will serve as a \u003Cem\u003Emuch\u003C/em\u003E cheaper alternative to airship charters when sites are reachable by land and time is not of the essence (some sites may still be too high/steep to permit off-road vehicle use). Despite worry by both Lanayle and Drew over a night-time traversal to the launch location, everything went as planned and the balloon payload was recovered and returned to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E intact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ctable align=\u0022center\u0022 border=\u00220\u0022 cellpadding=\u00221\u0022 cellspacing=\u00221\u0022 style=\u0022width:500px;\u0022\u003E\u003Ctbody\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Untitled2.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KerBalloon ground tracks\u0022 height=\u0022188\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Untitled2-300x188.png\u0022 srcset=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Untitled2-300x188.png 300w, http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Untitled2-768x480.png 768w, http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Untitled2.png 836w\u0022 width=\u0022300\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nKerBalloon ground tracks\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003C/tr\u003E\u003C/tbody\u003E\u003C/table\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nData analysis of the probe instruments, a temperature and barometer sensor, is still ongoing, although early results are showing a surprising uniformity to the atmospheric conditions in regions around \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E that have been sampled so far.

The fact that it is simply two Progeny Mk1 rockets joined together has made the process easier since crews are already familiar with the process of assembling these parts. Staging the two boosters together is a new step in the process, and for that an entire day and a half is being spent to ensure that it is done according to specifications. The payload has already begun to be pieced together for testing at the start of next week. After that the entire rocket will be integrated together and tested.

Simon reports several key engineers are refusing to work, believing they have been betrayed by the main C7 corporate division. To understand why, Simon was forced to make a visit to C7 HQ in Kravass City. Turns out C7 was building its own testing facility out on an island not far from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E when the decision was made to axe the project well into development as a means of cutting costs and turning to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E for lease of their facilities. Apparently along with that decision came numerous project reshuffling that left several high-ranking engineers out in the cold and re-assigned to the fixed-wing project.

They also took advantage of the MSV Tongjess to spend some time in the water learning how to stay afloat with just their pants and testing out several compact life rafts that could be deployed from a small capsule.

The most subtle thing are the headlights, which don\u2019t actually light up (the real reason that second pair of lights are there \u2013 although they also look cool IMO). I cut and pasted them into a separate layer in Paint.NET so I could apply a Glow effect. You\u2019ll also notice that I took out doors in the back. Yea, the rover is supposed to be a 4-seat vehicle but it\u2019s also supposed to be electrically driven and I don\u2019t have solar power or RTGs yet which means I needed to stick a fuel tank and electric generator in there (not a fuel cell).

You\u2019ll notice how I tried to space out tweets not only during the day but during the week as well. To me this creates a more natural flow of communication from the Agency to readers and makes sure their twitter feed is always interspersed with other accounts they may be following.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, asteroids are being discovered now, so I thought I\u2019d mention how that works. So, I used to have a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/63688-kerbal-space-agency-twitter-fiction-14-month-update/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=1150177\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Epretty involved process\u003C/a\u003E to finding new asteroids and I kept some of that but it\u2019s also a bit simpler now. I\u2019m using the same detection schedule I did for the previous KSA, so I don\u2019t need to toss coins in a box once a week to come up with new values for how many asteroids will be discovered on a given day. Although I did consider this time to only allow myself to find asteroids that were in an area facing away from the sun, it was too much of a pain to work in that consideration and decided these asteroids would be found from data that has been pooled together recently but also collected over the past few decades, so asteroids can be discovered anywhere. Each day I simply start tracking all the unknown objects in the system and adding their designations in a list in Excel. I then randomize that list and generate random numbers that tell me which asteroid(s) in that list have just been found. Simple! Of course I also check all the tracked asteroids around Kerbin to see if any are going to impact \u2013 if it is a rock that hasn\u2019t been found then it becomes a surprise event if I choose to acknowledge it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh and I found this!\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://bit.ly/BlueprintsHowTo\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://bit.ly/BlueprintsHowTo\u003C/a\u003E \u2013 but it\u2019s still buried in there somewhere.

Launch controllers followed protocol and immediately armed the recovery chute in case the payload was flung from the rocket. However the second stage ignited itself and carried the payload away from the explosion. Unfortunately something caused the chute to deploy during the second stage booster firing, which ripped the chute to shreds and made recovery of the payload impossible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter spending lots of time studying launch footage (you can see the stationary camera footage \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tg7x6ywHqBU\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E) we have determined that the second stage in fact ignited prematurely on its own, which caused the first stage to overheat and explode shortly afterwards.

However the fifth and final launch did not proceed as planned. Enroute to the launch site, the UTV carrying the KerBalloon unit rolled down a slope and caused enough damage to the unit that it was unable to be used for flight.

It\u2019s easy to make things explode in KSP, but it\u2019s harder to make things explode in a way that you can then write a story about and have the reasons fit into the larger picture of what you\u2019re trying to accomplish. So I couldn\u2019t just have the whole thing blow up. I went through several methods of explosions, including the explosive that comes with Kerbal Inventory System. The problem with that is it requires a crew member to set and arm, so I needed to build a contraption to get a kerbal up near the rocket payload while it was mounted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ctable align=\u0022center\u0022 border=\u00220\u0022 cellpadding=\u00221\u0022 cellspacing=\u00221\u0022 style=\u0022width:500px;\u0022\u003E\u003Ctbody\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/KSP_x64.exe_DX9_20160915_080326.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Val waves from atop her perch\u0022 height=\u0022325\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/KSP_x64.exe_DX9_20160915_080326-1024x640.png\u0022 srcset=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/KSP_x64.exe_DX9_20160915_080326-1024x640.png 1024w, http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/KSP_x64.exe_DX9_20160915_080326-300x188.png 300w, http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/KSP_x64.exe_DX9_20160915_080326-768x480.png 768w\u0022 width=\u0022520\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nVal waves from atop her perch\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003C/tr\u003E\u003C/tbody\u003E\u003C/table\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the end that was too hard to control since I couldn\u2019t use the staging system and had to set the timers on them. Eventually I just fell back to the simplest solution \u2013 having the lower stage blow up when the upper stage is triggered too early. That also fit perfectly with what I wanted the accident to push the Agency to do next.

The next step of course was to test this hypothesis, which was done earlier today using the last Mk1-B booster. The theory was that the booster could ignite itself if enough compression was forced upon the engine bell and supporting frame, so we dropped it from 250m after it was lofted by a KerBalloon (the balloon was expended in the operation). Sure enough, when the booster landed on the ground it took off by itself, spiraling wildly through the air thanks to a damaged and ruptured engine bell until it was destroyed by a package of K-4 that was attached to the booster and linked to launch control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ctable align=\u0022center\u0022 border=\u00220\u0022 cellpadding=\u00221\u0022 cellspacing=\u00221\u0022 style=\u0022width:500px;\u0022\u003E\u003Ctbody\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Closeup of engine staging\u0022 height=\u0022214\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Progeny-Mk2-2.png\u0022 srcset=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Progeny-Mk2-2.png 214w, http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Progeny-Mk2-2-150x150.png 150w\u0022 width=\u0022214\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nCloseup of engine staging gap\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003C/tr\u003E\u003C/tbody\u003E\u003C/table\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what happened? Turns out the ignition wire that runs up the inside of the booster to the solid fuel doubles back on itself enough that, if the lower section of the booster is crumpled slightly by a hard enough impact, the wire will pinch and short itself out, firing off the engine. How did this happen in the Mk2? A structural failure of the engine shroud. Looking at the image to the left, you can see the gap between the first and second stage boosters. The engine shroud connects the two, the boosters themselves are not connected. The build-up of pressure at launch eventually caused the shroud to fail and the upper stage to fall back and impact the lower stage. Ignition of the upper stage may not have been immediate (we can\u2019t tell via video when the shroud failed) but if not then eventually it was compressed enough too after being weakened by the initial impact to short the wire and ignite.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe team still has more research and testing to do next week with the structural materials in question, but since today\u2019s test went as expected they feel confident in their theory.

As reported last week, the overwing design was chosen and implemented this week. The entire airframe, including the engine, has now been completed and for at least the next week engineers will be crawling all over and through it to make sure everything turned out according to specifications. Once this checkout is complete, the finishing touches will be added including cockpit instrumentation (the design of which test pilots Val and Jeb signed off on this week), navigation lighting, landing gear and a recovery parachute to be used in the event that landing is impossible or the aircraft suffers a malfunction/failure while in flight. C7 expects it to begin ground trials before the end of the month, hopefully flight trials as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAsteroid Tracking Network \u0026amp; KSA Finance Reports Released for October\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can have a look at how the KSA spent its money this past month in our monthly \u003Ca href=\u0022http://bit.ly/KSA_FinanceReport\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Efinance report\u003C/a\u003E compiled by Mortimer.

The ground trials ensured that avionics, control cables, power, control surfaces, lights, engine, etc all functioned as designed while under operation. Engine run-ups were also performed \u2013 while the engine itself is not new technology it has never been integrated with a vessel in this way so assurances were needed that it was functioning properly. Take off roll testing was undertaken after careful review of the taxi data. The take off roll test ensured that the undercarriage was clear of any issues and the engine could power the craft up to take off speed. One of the concerns was the aircraft may have been built too heavy, since it was designed to withstand horrible crash tolerances to help ensure the safety of the test pilots. It successfully reached take off speed by the end of the runway on only half power though, which was a great sign.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal was very excited to be piloting, even if it was only on the ground for the initial trials. She likened the experience to \u201Cdriving a car with a horrible suspension\u201D. The taxi tests were also meant to see how the aircraft performed on different surfaces \u2013 dirt, tarmac and turf. Val reported that she liked the firmness of the turf and would recommend take offs be done to the side of the runway. However the dirt offered up more friction, and she says she would prefer to land the plane on the runway rather than the turf. This will be taken into consideration for the flight trials, which have been approved for next Monday after second sunrise. Captain Jebediah Kerman is still recovering from an injury and will not be able to pilot the aircraft until the end of next week at the earliest assuming he receives his medical clearance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first flight trial will be to simply leave the ground and return in one piece. Val will take off, climb to around 1km and then turn about and deploy the recovery chute to assist in bringing the aircraft in for a landing on the runway. If all goes well, the chute will be repacked and Val will take to the skies again the same day to begin more and more rigorous flight tests to see how the aircraft performs under various conditions and how well it matches simulations. Flight trials are expected to last at least all week.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EProgeny Mk2.1 Assembly Begins\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E work crews today began to assemble the three Progeny Mk2.1 rockets that will be launched in December.

I poked him twice since then but never got a response. Then the site went down in late September and since it had happened earlier this year I waited to see if it would come back. It didn\u2019t, so I tried another email. Nothing. I then did a whois lookup for the domain and found a phone number registered to it. Called that and left a message on a generic voicemail so no idea if I actually reached the author. I know his full name and location but couldn\u2019t dig up any news articles about him.

Before we get to details involving the crash we should look at how the Civvie performed in flight, because fly it did despite worries that it might be too heavy as the airframe was built very strong to handle any problems during flight or landing that involved the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe takeoff roll was performed at full throttle, taking 43 seconds and just under 2km to achieve a rate of positive climb @ 58m/s, although a small 3s hop just prior to takeoff did occur due to a bump in the turf. Flaps were set at 2 notches for takeoff and raised after positive climb was confirmed. Still at full throttle, Commander Val was able to establish and maintain a climb rate of 5m/s all the way up to 1km ASL with speeds ranging from 60-65m/s. During the climb she attempted to maintain a heading of 270 but even slightly adjusting the roll of the aircraft produced a great deal of sideslip, as much as \u002B/- 5\u00B0, that slewed the aircraft slightly off course. Overall control in a westerly direction was maintained. Upon reaching 1km ASL she leveled off and conducted a gradual left turn of 15-20\u00B0 back towards \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, attempting to maintain attitude. Upon initial roll to the left a large slideslip was recorded of \u002B/- 15\u00B0 but Val was quickly able to properly coordinate the turn with her rudder and came about facing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E still at 1km ASL, when she cut throttle completely to prepare for landing. Descending at 5m/s speed increased to over 70m/s and 1 notch of flaps were deployed. Falling below 700m ASL descent rate was increased to 10m/s and flaps notched to 3 (maximum). At around 300m ASL Val realized she was not well-aligned with the runway and attempted to correct her course with some large banking maneuvers over 20\u00B0, which also introduced a large amount of sideslip that was not properly corrected. Eventually these maneuvers oscillated into a sideslip so great it yawed the aircraft almost completely around at about 4m AGL, which caused airflow under the tail to flip the Civvie over and land upside down on the ground just south of the runway edge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/civvie-prototype-flight-path_30168396496_o.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg height=\u0022150\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/civvie-prototype-flight-path_30168396496_o-150x150.png\u0022 width=\u0022150\u0022 alt=\u0022civvie-prototype-flight-path_30168396496_o-150x150.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/civvie-prototype-flight-path_30168396296_o.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg height=\u0022150\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/civvie-prototype-flight-path_30168396296_o-150x150.png\u0022 width=\u0022150\u0022 alt=\u0022civvie-prototype-flight-path_30168396296_o-150x150.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/civvie-prototype-flight-path_30168396376_o.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg height=\u0022150\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/civvie-prototype-flight-path_30168396376_o-150x150.png\u0022 width=\u0022150\u0022 alt=\u0022civvie-prototype-flight-path_30168396376_o-150x150.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nVarious views of the Civvie\u2019s 28km flight path\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:left;\u0022\u003E\nPost-analysis of the crash so far shows that although the Civvie\u2019s extra-tough construction did its job in keeping the airframe intact and preventing Val from being crushed upon impact, she was still very lucky in that the large slew and flip-over dropped her speed from a bone-crushing 70m/s to a still bruising but survivable 44m/s. The impact force was just over 4Gs. The tail of the Civvie was bent upon impact and the right wing was also deformed as the aircraft slid along the ground and it dug into the incline of the runway, spinning the craft roughly 90\u00B0 to its final resting position. The engine was almost completely destroyed as the nose was the first to impact the ground, which also crumpled and absorbed most of the shock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:left;\u0022\u003E\nThe final decision as to whether this event was a cause of pilot error, design error or both is still under review. Crash investigators have yet to interview Commander Val, who was just today put back on active duty after spending the week recovering from her injuries, which only involved heavy bruising from her straps and a slight knock to the head. A complete check on the Civvie\u2019s airframe and systems is also still underway in the HAB. We expect to hear more, if not a final verdict, sometime next week.

At the beginning of the month we received 10 additional units, our largest order to date, and so far we have used all but 3 for various clients to gather pressure and temperature data in the region around \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.

KerBalloon took note of this design oversight and now has given us the option to attach parachutes directly to the balloon casing itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother launch worthy of note was a recent deployment at sea which sank upon landing. The KerBalloon unit cases are designed to be buoyant, so no additional flotation devices are needed. We are still unsure of exactly what happened to cause the payload to sink as the recovery vessel did not witness the splashdown, it only arrived at the last transmitted location to find nothing. While partially equipped for salvage operations, scans of the sea floor did not turn up anything conclusive, as it is very rocky down there and scan resolution was not great enough to pick out the probe from the scatter. We examined the remaining units for any flaws that might have contributed to the sinking but did not uncover any. Unfortunately this mystery may never be solved, although we\u2019ve mandated stricter recovery operations for water landings in the hopes of catching one sinking in action if it does occur again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, we got tired of not having photos of these balloon flights and while we still don\u2019t have great camera technology we managed to strap on two basic cameras with only 30\u00B0 field of view and send them up in lieu of science instruments.

This setup matched the same angle of the aircraft at rest on the ground that the trike fixed gear setup achieved. I eventually realized it was just the tail wheel that was causing the trouble, and could have ditched the medium gears for the fixed gears but I chose not to, because having the medium gears on the wings made the aircraft more unstable but still controllable, which ultimately led to Val\u2019s crash. I didn\u2019t want to crash, I really did want to land the aircraft, but the likelyhood of a crash happening without me intentionally crashing increased thanks to the gear on the wings.

The battery issue that caused the initial launch hold which led to the scrub is still under investigation and Simon is very concerned that a bad battery made it through the integration testing. On the weather front we can\u2019t say much other than at the time of this writing it\u2019s still raining, and still raining hard. Generally the type of storms that come through and dump a large amount of water don\u2019t last very long, but this one has been rather persistent and we\u2019ve already got large streams of water flowing down from the Grasslands and under our causeway bridges to the ocean.

We did suffer a small parts shortage thanks to that recent KerBalloon payload loss, which carried with it to the bottom of the sea a TDU, payload truss and parachute, all of which are parts we regularly re-use. We had to order new parts to replace these as otherwise there wouldn\u2019t have been enough for a third Mk2.1 as well as being able to continue balloon launches.

This was a deliberate action by the launch controllers and was done to test whether the lower stage would explode. It did not, which only further reinforces the theory that the rapid collapse of the engine shroud and the slamming together of the two booster stages is what caused the Progeny Mk2 lower booster to explode shortly after launch, not just the ignition of the second stage booster by the impact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can also see the payload tumbling in the launch footage after separation. We suspect this is due more to the close passing of the booster rather than an actual strike of the payload. Interestingly, after separation the loss of weight on the booster turns the fins into a propeller that carries it up and away at a faster rate than the payload itself. We\u2019ve already made note of this for future Progeny designs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next two launches for the Mk2.1 will occur on 12/13 @ 16:50 UTC and 12/15 @ 17:00 UTC.

The Mk2.1 launch footage was captured with the help of a simple kOS script in order to get the timing of events just right since I couldn\u2019t see the interface to time it manually (launches are still all done manually by me). The worst was the asteroid re-entry image, which took a lot of time because if I didn\u2019t get the shot setup right before the asteroid burned up and was destroyed CameraTools would cause the game to throw an NRE when I tried to revert back to an older save and I had to restart it.

After encounter 4 it will re-encounter Mun before it even completes one orbit, which will ultimately send it off on the highly elliptical trajectories you see via the dashed plots.

Even if it does strike the surface, the impact effects of what little of its mass survives the re-entry would be local to only a few hundred meters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ECelestial Snapshot of the Week\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal has actually been away from her \u2018scope all week \u2013 it was a busy one for all our staff at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.

Still, everything went along pretty smoothly when it came to actually launching the rocket, taking the still photos, and taking the launch video. All three of these have to be done separately. The actual rocket launch is what collects the telemetry data that is shown, and is done without any visual enhancements to save performance. Then I reload the game with visuals and walk the time up to and through the launch to capture still photos, using data from the actual launch (I either import the landed payload to my alternate save game or use the Persistent Trails track to place it in the right spot with Vessel Mover). Then I program a simple kOS script based on what I did manually in the actual launch to create a very close repeat to film from various angles for the launch video that gets posted to YouTube.

I originally wasn\u2019t going to include the final shots of the payload spinning and just fade out while under chute as normal but then I admitted to myself that someone \u003Cem\u003Emight\u003C/em\u003E ask \u2013 \u201Cwell if the footage from the fall was so crazy, why not wait until after the chute deploys so it\u2019s slower?\u201D \u2013 because there are a lot of smart people in my audience. So I was like \u003Cem\u003Efine\u003C/em\u003E and went back for another shoot. Now I don\u2019t know the exact reason why this doesn\u2019t actually work in KSP, but when the chute deploys the payload does not slow its spin like it should thanks to the larger diameter chute being directly connected to it. Rather than cheap out with a reason like \u201Cthe payload is hooked to the chute cords with a free-rotating swivel\u201D or something like that I simply attached a single booster to the payload and fired it straight up from the landing location, which only had enough flight time to give it a much slower spin rate. I then decoupled everything, deployed the chute at the same altitude as the actual flight and filmed the slower spin footage as it came down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMeeny Plots\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you also use Mission Architect and wonder how I did the Meeny plot figure, it\u2019s pretty simple.

The biggest problem the prototype has was its sideslip issues causing a large amount of yaw during level flight and turns, which was corrected by attaching a taller vertical stabilizer. Even during Jeb\u2019s first flight the sideslip very rarely surpassed 5\u00B0 in either direction and did not exceed 10\u00B0. The production model of the Civvie will have a longer tail boom, which will give the rudder a greater amount of torque effect for better control authority in this region. The production model will also have better handling and flight performance since it will be built much, much lighter than the prototype. This means it will not withstand crashes nearly as well, but flight data have shown that under the right operating conditions the Civvie is a real joy to fly and handles great in stalls, dives, steep turns and apparently can even pull off a vertical loop (not to be recommended in the Pilot\u2019s Operating Handbook). Landing posed various issues for both pilots but the lighter weight of the production version will take a lot of load off the undercarriage suspension, which will help greatly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe production model will begin construction in the HAB when we return to operations in January.

Various contracts were satisfied, although we are still not sure what happened to the one unit that sank at sea after splashdown. The MSV did not reach it for some time so it could have just been in the water too long and a small crack in its casing that wasn\u2019t noticed during final integration could have taken on enough water for it to sink. KerBalloon assures us they are doing their own tests to ensure a properly-built unit can stay afloat for several hours after landing. Overall though the KerBalloons performed with great quality and consistent results.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext year we will be receiving a shipment of our regular standard KerBalloon units but also taking delivery of a smaller sample of high-altitude balloon units for testing. These new balloons are made of a lighter, more flexible material that can expand further without ripping or tearing, which is the fate of the current balloons and the reason they are unable to make it out of the lower atmosphere. Scientists are hoping these new balloons can open up the upper atmosphere (\u0026gt;18km) to researchers.

A lot of it was spent on real-life stuff like Thanksgiving and insulating my office against the cold weather that is now encroaching. But I\u2019m nice and toasty warm now so it was worth it \u2013 trust me typing with cold, cramped fingers sucks. You\u2019ll note that I\u2019m writing this in Decemeber and the KSA is still in December \u2013 not good. But I\u2019ve had to get through a bunch of new experiences in flying aircraft in KSP and had to develop several new techniques for doing things.

I have a decent computer but still, running high-res graphics with all the mods I have installed takes a toll, and I\u2019m generally getting 17-20 FPS with a constant yellow time, which means physics ticks are being dropped and I don\u2019t like that. Plus reducing the graphics and upping the framerate makes for a more enjoyable and responsive flying experience (I\u2019m still on v1.1.3 so the garbage collection snags remain an annoyance though).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the technique combines several mods: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37756-0-23-HyperEdit-Teleporter-Orbit-Planet-Editor-More\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EHyperEdit\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/144421-vesselmover-continued/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EVesselMover\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/49216\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EPersistent Trails\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/18230-0-23-Kerbal-Engineer-Redux-v0-6-2-3\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EKerbal Engineer Redux (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E)\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/137461-1-0-4-AirPark\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EAirPark\u003C/a\u003E.

So it was too heavy for them. Adjusting the springs to their max made things much better, but still a bit difficult. Really, I should have tweaked down the wing strength and lightened the Civvie to the point where the wheels functioned well under their max spring settings. For some reason I thought the wheels auto adjusted to the weight that they were bearing when the craft was launched \u2013 pretty sure I read something to that extent in the dev notes prior to v1.0 but I guess something changed, or I didn\u2019t interpret it properly. Anyways, lesson learned!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis also means pretty much all the landings I showed on the runway were \u201Cfaked\u201D to some extent. I mean yes I did actually come in at the speeds that were posted on twitter but the wheels on the runway were rather temperamental and, well\u2026 there was flipping. Nothing major that broke the aircraft but still a few tumbles that I didn\u2019t feel were proper given the approaches I made. So they didn\u2019t happen. I can\u2019t and won\u2019t let everything that goes on in the game dictate how the story plays out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EYay Flying Again!\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was a lot of fun to break out the Saitek X52 and fly around.

Well funny story is that this month I almost screwed up when I wrote that science instruments were being installed on the Civvie. Thankfully I didn\u2019t note specifically which ones but I had planned to do temperature and barometer. However the KSA only ever had two and one of each was lost when the KerBalloon sank and the other ones were being used the same day for a KerBalloon probe. Rather than switch over to using the Aeronomy and Meteorological packages from the rockets, I just decided to include an order for replacement instruments earlier in the month on the finance sheet so I could use them in the Civvie. Yea, stuff like that happens and I need to retcon a little \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u201CSame Yet Different\u201D Challenge\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe one thing that is challenging about repetitive events (this applied to the Progeny Mk2.1 launches as well) is making them interesting each time. I mean sure the Civvie was doing different things in the air but when it came to landing and taking off a lot of that is pretty routine. So finding ways to shake things up (like forcing the Rwy27 water approach and bringing in the MSV) and even finding new angles to capture images, is a constant challenge. The main objective is to never quite cover how things are happening more than 2-3 times the exact same way \u2013 hopefully never the exact same way. And it\u2019s not just the images but the way things are tweeted, finding new ways to describe similar events. I enjoy that challenge from a writing perspective, and the 140 character limit and my personal limit of 2-3 tweets about the same event increase the challenge. Very enjoyable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EVacation Time!

I still need to timewarp through all the days so asteroids are generated, and the ATN isn\u2019t on break so I will need to collect any new asteroid data that comes up for each day during the break, and maybe make note of significant celestial events or asteroid events that occur during that time. Meeny orbital data needs to be updated and new system charts published as well.

This year should be very exciting as we plan to reach space with our Progeny Mk4 or Mk5 rocket and move onwards and upwards with our to-be-announced orbital program, which will begin its development phase this month. Unfortunately the week got off to a slower start than anticipated thanks to a delay of parts shipment from Kravass City, which suffered a major storm and grounded all airships on the day our delivery was due to depart. Although the storm passed by the end of the day, it hit us next so airship arrivals were cancelled. We hope to receive the parts by Monday to get started on the Progeny Mk3, Civvie Production Model and testing the new high-altitude KerBalloons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EGenesis Program Sees Income Growth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow that the Civvie Prototype has been certified fully flight-capable we can start accepting contracts, and now that a physical observer (the pilot) is along for the ride we can do more than simple scientific readings. Several companies have already signed with us or expressed interest in receiving science data and/or dictated aerial reports of the areas sent to be investigated. Unfortunately do to the Civvie being a single-seat plane the crew reports are not very detailed or thorough, but they are at least acceptable. While the Genesis Program is still quite a ways from turning a profit, it\u2019s starting to work more towards that direction at least. The one flight we got off the ground before weather closed in saw Valentina nail the first observation contract, and two more already await Jeb next week.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMore Facility Work Suspends Operations\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeems a bit silly to come back for a few days and then go away again, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to have to do next week while additional work is done around campus to fix more building issues we\u2019ve identified in the weeks since the last \u201Cpatch job\u201D.

That\u2019s\u2026 not good. But there is some hope because a lot of the time was spent doing stuff I should have done before restarting the KSA and now that it\u2019s finished I don\u2019t have to spend time on it anymore. I also had to deal with patching up my new living space to deal with the cold of winter moving in. Another thing I don\u2019t have to spend time on once its done, which I think it pretty much is. I\u2019m toasty right now writing this. Still, I\u2019m way behind in lead time and that\u2019s why the KSA is forced to take an ops break this month, especially given that I\u2019ll be out of the country and away from KSP access for the better part of a week or so after xmas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EProgram pages\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/?page_id=1824\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPrograms pages\u003C/a\u003E was the huge project that took me like 3-4 days to nail down design and implementation and then an additional 2-3 days to get the hang of using properly and getting everything filled in.

There\u2019s also now even tighter integration between the site and the Flight Tracker/Crew Roster since I link to astronauts assigned to the program on their pages and the Flight Tracker sports Program/Vessel/Mission patches for vehicles that link back to their respective program pages. Even the finances sheet got an improvement \u2013 I moved the totals up to the header for each column, which now that I think about it makes a lot more sense. It\u2019ll debut in the Jan finance report, I won\u2019t go back and change the earlier reports because they\u2019ll all be included in the Jan report anyways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe downside is of course maintaining these pages has increased my daily workload depending on what events transpired that day.

I don\u2019t really need 30FPS when I\u2019m looking back for specific points in the flight, so instead I\u2019m doing 1s image captures of the screen. The Civvie flight this week came out to 5,061 PNG images (8.85GB) which I then used a program to stitch together in batches of 1500 to create 4 mpeg videos (1.94GB) which were then combined and converted into a single DivX movie file of 2.01GB. That was for a movie 1h24m long. By comparison a regular capture 1h7m long would make a DivX file 2.12GB in size. So the end gains are minimal, but the size on disk during recording is much smaller, which is what I\u2019m really after.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EHow non-rechargable batteries work\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll batteries in the game are rechargeable, but I don\u2019t have the KSA in possession of that technology yet, all our batteries are used once and then tossed. Now, for a solid fuel rocket and KerBalloon this isn\u2019t a problem because they have no generators or alternators aboard to supply power, so they just run out of juice and stay out of juice. The Civvie however is a different issue due to its engine alternator supplying power. So to work around this I installed 20 of the 21 battery parts as normal using symmetry and then drained all their EC in the editor and shut off control to them so they wouldn\u2019t receive any power. Then I used Module Manager to create a copy of that battery, same weight and cost, but able to contain the EC of all the batteries, then added one of those to the aircraft and disabled its electrical use. Now inflight I pin open the Part Access Window for the battery and whenever I need to send science data I begin the transmission and then enable the battery\u2019s electric charge use, then cut it off immediately after the transmission clears, so the battery is drained but no alternator charge is applied, however it still takes advantage of the alternator while it is being drained.

Although a great achievement, it\u2019s important to note that this is still not even halfway to space. Still, we are happy that the balloon performed as designed and KerBalloon will be providing us with additional units once we test the remaining two to ensure there are no serious problems they need to address. The next two high-altitude launches will take place at sea next week, and the recovery of the probe out of the water will be an important final test after we lost a low-altitude balloon unit last year under unknown circumstances.

Of course once this operation wraps up another expedition is planned to the interior of the Lower Continent to where yet another, larger asteroid was to have fallen. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://bit.ly/MHG-908_D\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMHG-908(D)\u003C/a\u003E most likely survived more intact, and if so would have had a decent effect on the local flora and fauna in the area when it struck the ground. Scientists are expecting a crater, and hope to get out there sometime next month to investigate. Three more asteroids are currently buzzing past us at various distances, including \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.flickr.com/gp/kerbal_space_agency/55etwL\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKYM-011(C)\u003C/a\u003E at the closest recorded distance to date of only 103.890km!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAstronomers are not sure what is behind the uptick in asteroid events but they suspect it to be one of two reasons. The first guess is that this is how things are pretty much all of the time but we\u2019re just now starting to get an idea of the frequency of impacts and near-misses due to the greater diligence of the Asteroid Tracking Network in hunting down these rocks. The other possibility is that we are currently passing through a denser field of asteroids at this time. Even though Kerbin\u2019s orbit is circular, the thousands of rocks that orbit Kerbol with us could clump up into uneven groups that travel on more elliptical paths together. With more time monitoring asteroids, we should be able to eventually figure out which theory is correct.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EHigh-Altitude KerBalloons Mostly Successful\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe ran a most ambitious launch campaign for our KerBalloon Program this week when we dispatched the MSV Tongjess to sail to three separate locations over the span of a day in the south Kerblantic to launch two high-altitude balloon payloads and one low-altitude payload. Despite some weather troubles we eventually managed to launch and recover all three balloons, however one of the high-altitude units suffered a malfunction that caused the payload to return to the surface before reaching maximum altitude. The contracted agency for that mission understandably withheld full payment as a result. Upon review of the unit in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E engineers have come up with a theory as to what happened and we have passed the information on to KerBalloon to see what they think. Until this issue is resolved, our next high-altitude KerBalloon order is on hold.

The Civvie crash was a completely unintentional outcome of the last mission \u2013 that approach was reaaally feeling good! Damn that hill! But on the flipside it gives me an excuse not to fly for a while, which is one of the most time-consuming things to do since I can\u2019t timewarp since the plane has no autopilot or even trim tabs \u2013 and I\u2019m not going to wave my hands for the sake of saving a few minutes. Besides, I \u003Cem\u003Elike\u003C/em\u003E actually flying.

I probably should have done it from the beginning but it involved slightly more math and since I hate math I shied away from it. Luckily it didn\u2019t hurt much in the long-run as the changeover was still relatively simple, but not without issues. Everything seems to be purring along fine again tho and it will also make things easier when entering new orbital data from KSP into the database.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpeaking of the database, a recent event has caused me to reconsider taking the time to implement a web interface for modifying my database tables. I currently use Microsoft Access but for a recent update on Meeny, the craft page was failing to show recent data. I had to re-export the database through MSAccess to get the fields to show up for the SQL fetch, even though they appeared to be there just fine in the MSAccess application. I have no idea how to tell if MSAccess saves things properly or why records show up in MSAccess but not when fetched by SQL for the page. So I\u2019m going to just dump MSAccess \u0026amp; do a direct edit through a web interface, once I have the time to implement it after I catch up to my month lead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that, the next major public-facing feature will be the ability to track aircraft flights in real-time via the surface map in the Flight Tracker and also see the paths of previous flights, for which I did indeed record lat/lng data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E Drop Shadows\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCame up with a new technique for shadowing objects placed on tables in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.

Those not feeling sick enough to check themselves in were still complaining of being short of breath or having a bad cough. Some of the earlier patients were on respirators by the time the Disease Management Organization was called in to take control of the situation. Given the size of the apparent outbreak, their first major action was to quarantine the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E to ensure that nobody took this infection to nearby Umbarg City (many patients were transferred to medical centers in Umbarg but under quarantine protocols). Then they had to take blood samples from all remaining employees to see if they could identify any foreign agents that could be lying dormant in someone who has been unknowingly spreading the infection. However some of the DMO agents working in their own section of R\u0026amp;D came down sick without any prior exposure to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E staff, which caused them to go to full HAZMAT protocol and only interact with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E employees behind the yellow environment suits that would protect them from exposure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far the DMO has not made any formal announcement while it still works through all the blood samples collected from employees, including those that are in the hospitals. The quarantine/HAZMAT protocol has prevented kerbs from walking around outside without environment suits and while everyone has been staying indoors reports of respiratory problems have markedly decreased. The filters used in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E building\u2019s environmental system cannot remove viruses from the air, so something larger like moss spores or tree pollen could be a cause.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe hope to have some news from the DMO next week.

Two of these asteroids cruised by this past week and astronomers were able to train the largest telescopes on them to get optical images. The resolution of these images was only a few dozen meters per pixel but still they were able to see greenish hues in one asteroid and magenta hues in another.

The event took place around mid-day after second sunrise on Jan 31st, during the final approach to Runway 09. The approach was too low, causing the Civvie to impact with the ground short of the runway thanks to a rise in terrain just before reaching the flat plain surrounding the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E property. Because it was already in a landing configuration, the sudden and unexpected impact was taken up on all three wheels at a speed of around 56m/s, well within tolerances. However this speed is too fast for a landing and so the Civvie bounced back into the air. Jeb\u2019s attempts to hold the nose up resulted in a stall, which dropped the Civvie like a rock from as high as 5m to land on just its main gear, which pitched it forward so its prop dug into the ground. The remaining momentum flipped the aircraft over onto its back, with torque from the propeller rotating it over 90 degrees to rest facing south. Investigators estimate the initial landing produced a force of 3.5Gs with the final crash producing a force upwards of 6Gs. These momentary moments of high stress had no detrimental effect on the pilot other than to whip his head forward into the dash, the second time producing a moderate wound.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nC7 will continue now with the next phase of its investigation, interviewing the pilot and support staff and analyzing various alternate outcomes based on the data collected.

I\u2019m happy to be this caught up on things. Very nice to just bang out one day of KSA ops and spend the rest of my time contemplating future events, reviewing \u0026amp; editing what I\u2019ve already written, working on complex new Flight Tracker features, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpeaking of Flight Tracker features, I got the surface tracks up and running in just two days of coding. I had to copy and paste a lot of code because what I wanted to do I was doing elsewhere and forgot how I was doing it \u2013 just goes to show how messed up the Flight Tracker code base is. But I got it all sorted with no major issues \u2013 nothing happened that forced me to take a break because I couldn\u2019t figure out the problem. The surface track system is pretty powerful beyond what is used so far. In addition to being able to load multiple tracks I have a parser that reads the description text and pulls any HTML links out to create dynamic links in the info box that can add pin markers to the map when they are clicked. And not just one pin marker, but a single link can add multiple pin markers, and there can be multiple links in the description. All this means that in order to create a database of the flight track I literally copy/paste elements from the mission post prior to the tweet stream and then import data from the CSV exported by the game and \u2013 well long story short after a flight is over I can have the surface track online in less than 5 minutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile the surface track feature is not real-time, the support for that feature is already baked into the existing implementation. I should only just have to look at the UT time for the events when the path is loaded and realize \u201Chey, this thing is happening \u003Cem\u003Enow\u003C/em\u003E\u201D and then switch over to plotting the path using the 1sec update tick function that controls all the other real-time elements on the map rather than just displaying the entire plot. This isn\u2019t a feature coming soon however since it doesn\u2019t make sense to have a real-time tracking system when communications range is only within the area of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.

However in addition to carrying out contracts, the missions also simulated the recovery of rocket payloads out at sea with the help of a Maritime Service Vessel (in this case, the MSV Tongjess, with a crew that is experienced in operating with us at sea). While rocket recoveries at sea are great because it allows us to launch east away from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and with the spin of Kerbin, there is the issue of the rocket payload not being buoyant enough to float after splashdown. KerBalloon probes use the empty balloon casing to stay afloat, but without that the payload truss will sink straight to the bottom of the ocean after it lands in the water. Before we tried to complicate the rocket by adding some sort of floating airbag to deploy after splashdown, we instead decided to try complicating our recovery procedures first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the first KerBalloon mission, as the probe descended under its parachute the launch craft from the Tongjess maneuvered itself underneath it so it landed on the deck of the ship. This would be the optimal recovery method for rocket payloads. In the event that they do end up in the water however, the second KerBalloon was launched with a rocket parachute rather than the KerBalloon chute units and allowed to splashdown next to the launch craft so the crew could observe how well the parachute floated in the water. It did stay on the surface for almost a minute, however there was also no pull from a sinking payload and sea conditions were a bit choppy. Should the launch craft miss the payload, Bob reports that they will still be close enough to snag the parachute to drag the payload out of the water before the whole thing sinks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe recovery tests going well has been a huge relief for the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/?page_id=1839\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EProgenitor Program\u003C/a\u003E.

Right now that would mean getting my KSP v1.2.2 installation setup. This is not a simple process. After renaming my KSP directory I redownloaded everything for the v1.2.2 patch and then saved it all into a ZIP archive so I have a clean copy whenever I need it. Then it was time to diffcheck the settings and physics config files so I could re-apply any changes I made and see what was added/changed by Squad that I would have to setup or account for. Then it was time to create a new save file and run another diffcheck against my current v1.1.3 save to see where I needed to make edits so they would match up \u2013 this was made very easy considering I have no active vessels!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll that out of the way, I\u2019m now in the process of installing mods one at a time. This is to ensure that when a problem or incompatibility pops up, I know exactly what mod caused it. Then I look into it and determine if it\u2019s actually a problem or a benign error/exception. Right now I\u2019m focusing only on the DLL-heavy mods that will exist in my GameData under any play situation. Once I get all those \u201Cbasics\u201D installed I will move on to the part-heavy mods, again going one by one and then removing them from GameData once I\u2019ve confirmed there are no major issues and storing them in a Build folder. Eventually I will throw them all in together but for now the procedure is to check them out individually. Then I\u2019ll have two main folders, a GameData \u2013 Build and GameData. When I want all my parts available to look at constructing a new vessel, I will just rename GameData \u2013 Build to GameData and GameData to GameData \u2013 Normal. I create batch files that let me copy parts from the Build folder into the regular GameData and also to delete those parts from GameData. End result is I always have only the parts I need installed and always have all the parts available to me when I need them. This is mainly to reduce load times, as under v1.1.3 with all parts installed it can take upwards of 30 minutes to load the game, but in my slimmed-down version with just the parts I need it\u2019s about 3 minutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI expect this process to take another week, hopefully by then \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E will finally be updated but if not I will grab the developer build and that will allow me to work completely on v1.2.2. Well, almost. Until Custom Asteroids is updated I will need to go back to my v1.1.3 install just to take care of ATN-related tasks. That will be slightly annoying but not a huge deal.

At close range this third view is tricky to get, but for objects in the distance changing the zoom doesn\u2019t really affect their position on the screen. Stacking these atop each other I then use the Magic Wand tool in Paint.NET to select the foreground windows, still need to do a bit of manual selection to clean things up but then extract them into their own layer. I do the same with the background windows exposed via the internal view. Then I apply a Glow blending mode for the foreground windows and adjust the layer transparency.

This was also our 10th rocket launch, bringing our launch count up into the double digits. While ultimately successful in that the rocket did not explode and the payload was recovered intact, the flight profile did not perform as expected, with the rocket failing to travel downrange over the water. Instead, a low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of 8 allowed lift at the nose to push the rocket from its 3\u00B0 launch pitch to completely vertical before enough acceleration was achieved and the rocket spun up to allow it to continue on a straight trajectory. While previous Progeny launches had similar \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E at takeoff, the longer length of this rocket greatly increased the amount of torque the lift at the nose could apply. This lead to a potentially \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kU0xHSz.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edangerous situation\u003C/a\u003E as the spent stages fell close to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E facilities and the crowds of onlookers. The first stage managed to land nose-first while spinning and drilled itself halfway into the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther than the failure to travel downrange, the flight went off as planned with each booster hot staging at the tail-end of the previous booster\u2019s run. In the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWAzxPn7rA8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Evideo of the launch\u003C/a\u003E (with sound!) you can see that the booster still appears to be running when the next stage is triggered. This is not the case and is just the booster expending its remaining exhaust after burning through all its solid fuel. The puff of smoke seen during each staging are the stack decouplers being obliterated by the heat of each engine\u2019s exhaust. A quick chute deployment after apokee was to allow the boat in the water, deployed from a Maritime Service Vessel stationed offshore, time to get underneath and secure the payload before it splashed down, as it does not float and would immediately sink, shortly dragging the parachute under as well. Instead it landed just 356m north of the launch pad. The rocket\u2019s official apokee was recorded by the Telemetry Data Unit as 7,546.63km ASL, you can see the full plot \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tc4X5zM.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E. Altitude however was not the purpose of this flight, instead we were subjecting the rocket to the highest-possible amounts of dynamic pressure to ensure it would remain intact, which it did under a load of 190.237kPa.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn order to help ensure future Mk3 flights travel downrange, the launch base will be modified to tilt the rocket 6\u00B0 at launch, slightly more than the 5\u00B0 pitch of the Progeny Mk2.1 rockets. This will lower our apokee but ultimately we have to think about the safety of our facilities and staff. In addition, the fins for the next Mk3 launch will be re-aligned to a smaller degree of pitch for each stage, as Lead Engineer Simon called the rotational speed of the first launch \u201Cludicrous\u201D. It was spinning so fast our tracking camera couldn\u2019t even resolve the marker pattern, and the vertical pitch gave us no roll data in the TDU, so \u201Cludicrous\u201D is the most accurate spin rate we have. The wider base was thought to need more fin angle to spin up, but apparently we overcompensated. A bit. The launch base will also receive some modifications to the lower rail to allow for a more secure mounting of the first stage booster, which nearly set back the schedule of this first flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll these changes will take time, which means we\u2019ve pushed back the launch of the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://bit.ly/ProgenyMk3_2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esecond MK3\u003C/a\u003E to the original launch date of the third, which is now TBD pending the results of the second flight next week. Even though the water landing did not occur, we were pleased to work flawlessly with the MSV Lymun to monitor the eastern range and get it set up for recovery. We look forward to continued joint operations with the Maritime Service for future launches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne more piece of Progenitor news this week comes from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u2019s HQ in Sheltered Rock, where they had a first successful 5s test fire of their Liquid Fuel/Oxidizer (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E/O) engine that will power the Progeny Mk4 closer, if not all the way, to space later this year.

Even better news for the Genesis Program, which has been without an air-worthy aircraft since the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/?p=2738\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eaccident in January\u003C/a\u003E, is that the ground trials for the new Civvie were completed without serious issue earlier today, meaning the aircraft is ready for flight trials next week, maybe as soon as Monday. Commander Val put the Civvie through its paces, first helping the engineers to tune the suspension on the landing gear, then performing various engine runups and takeoff runups. The lighter weight of the new Civvie means much better performance, and it managed to achieve near-takeoff speed in only 624m at 50% thrust, whereas the older Civvie required nearly a kilometer of runway to takeoff at full thrust. Val says she can\u2019t wait to see how it handles in the air, although Capt Jeb will be the first to try it out, as the C7 crash team completed its investigation this week and did not recommend suspension for Jebediah. They did, however, recommend that Rwy09 approaches be avoided until their full report is released, which we are expecting next week.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe plan for the older Civvie, which should be receiving its repair parts at the start of next week, is still to patch it up and fly it up to the Air History Museum in Kravass City, where it will be retired. Assuming no major flaws are found in the new Civvie design, several more will be ordered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAsteroid Tracking Network Update\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe latest release of the ATN catalog can be found \u003Ca href=\u0022http://bit.ly/ATN-DB_3-13-17\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E, containing 390 asteroids.

I realized earlier in the week that with my entire upcoming weekend packed with Real Work, I needed to jump ahead to at least next Monday, since I would want a day to recover afterwards, so I haven\u2019t made any more significant progress towards my v1.2.2 upgrade as I\u2019ve just been working to advance my lead during a very busy week, what with a new rocket launching and aircraft getting ready for flight. But it\u2019s all going well so far \u2013 I hope to bang out the weekend and Monday tomorrow so I can relax these next three days while taking care of Real World stuff. I have a lot of notes to expand upon this week, so let\u2019s get to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EProgeny Mk3 Launch\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was exciting, as it really has been over three months in real time since I last got to launch a rocket in KSP. Well, okay I will admit I threw the Mk3 up into the sky just messing around when I first built it, but this was the first launch where I had to follow an actual flight profile \u2013 and I flubbed it twice \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E First time I totally forgot to remember where to look for a readout of the booster fuel and my eyes darted from the staging column to the resource panel to the PAW I had pinned open for the engine. I couldn\u2019t focus on one and missed the hot stage. Then the second time I staged once too many times because I forgot the final booster auto-decouples from the payload once it is spent. I finally got a good launch on the third try. Here\u2019s what my screen looks like during a launch:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/KSP_x64.exe_DX9_20170215_020311.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg height=\u0022325\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/KSP_x64.exe_DX9_20170215_020311-1024x640.png\u0022 srcset=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/KSP_x64.exe_DX9_20170215_020311-1024x640.png 1024w, http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/KSP_x64.exe_DX9_20170215_020311-300x188.png 300w, http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/KSP_x64.exe_DX9_20170215_020311-768x480.png 768w\u0022 style=\u0022border-width:0px;\u0022 width=\u0022520\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP_x64.exe_DX9_20170215_020311-1024x640.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nToo much info? Well that\u2019s why it\u2019s all video recorded so I can go back later and look at each data point individually if I want to. The Hyperedit window is how I snap the EC back to full charge 2min before takeoff to simulate coming off ground power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWait I kind of got off track here, I was saying how exciting it was to launch the rocket for real, which is kind of one of the reasons I like playing the way that I do, it really makes each launch feel like an accomplishment. It\u2019s like \u2013 yea I worked real hard over all this time getting everything setup and BAM! Off it goes! Whooo! It\u2019s a bit hard to describe but I really think it\u2019s a bit of a minuscule amount of what real rocket engineers feel when they spend months/years on a mission prior to its launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo another thing I sort of tried to do for this launch was to setup as many ways as possible for it to appear like it was going to fail. I had ominous weather, an unplanned recovery ship, a hacked-together mounting job, a thrown-off launch schedule\u2026 I really hope people following along were getting a bit of dread in the proceedings, given that KSA launches have failed in the past.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPhotos of the event were tricky a little bit, since I had specified publicly where all the kerbs would be spectating from so I had to make sure I didn\u2019t show any of those areas because I couldn\u2019t really fill them with spectators. The \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.flickr.com/gp/kerbal_space_agency/ePHu1L\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eastronaut bunker photo\u003C/a\u003E was also a lot trickier than I expected it would be, because the kerbals in v1.1.3 still suffer from that ground friction bug that lets them shift slightly over time along the ground, which meant that successive photos, even using a KerbCam position key to reset the camera, were not exactly aligned. So although you hopefully can\u2019t tell, Bill on the left had his lower body replaced, as did Jeb, and Bob had his entire body replaced from another image that had to be resized to match. Bleh. Came out good in the end though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also discovered in my setup of v1.2.2 that I never had a RealChute patch installed for Sounding Rockets in v1.1.3. There \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E a patch created, but although it was sent as a pull request to RealChute it never got accepted, and Sounding Rockets never distributed it. So I tried to install the patch and got NRE spam under v1.1.3 so nevermind about that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis launch video had sound, because it was a new rocket engine, a bigger rocket engine and I really really wanted to have sound. Still, it took me a few hours trying to source some sounds from YouTube, which I still think is the best resource although to be honest I didn\u2019t spend time looking for a better place to get sounds. I should do that next time. YouTube videos are great, but the audio inevitably either has cheering over the launch soundtrack, no sound at all, or music instead of rocket sounds. Still, I managed to find \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9GAWIujoms\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis clip\u003C/a\u003E to use for the first stage booster, and then some other clips for the 2nd \u0026amp; 3rd stages. There was a bit of mixing involved to get the sound the way I wanted, with a gradual fade of the rumble before cheering entered the soundtrack. I think it turned out really good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne annoying fact though is that the video doesn\u2019t exactly match the events if you calculate the times using the telemetry data image posted. The payload chute deployment, for example, is way off. This is because despite my best efforts the rocket does not always fly the exact same way twice. I can usually get closer to the proper times, but I forgot to really try and the first capture turned out so well, zooming in just as you can see the payload fairings deploy, that I didn\u2019t want to take the time to do it again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EInventory Rework\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI realized belatedly that I really didn\u2019t have the spare nose cone chute to have performed that recovery test of the low-altitude KerBalloon, as all three were already integrated for use in Progeny Mk3 rockets. So, in this case I simply forgot to even look at whether I had a spare part available to use, but it still made me realize that my inventory spreadsheets were not adequate for items that can be reused across various vessels, because while it was easy to see how many I had available to use, it was difficult to check where the ones that were in use were being used. So now I have a new format:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Untitled.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg height=\u0022112\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Untitled-300x112.png\u0022 srcset=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Untitled-300x112.png 300w, http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Untitled.png 614w\u0022 style=\u0022border-width:0px;\u0022 width=\u0022300\u0022 alt=\u0022Untitled-300x112.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo on the left are parts that are reusable and I can see how many I have to assign and exactly what they are being used for at the moment, and how many are available (blank cells). On the right is the original check-in/check-out system that automatically calculates how many parts remain of a non-reusable part. Once these parts are taken out, I don\u2019t really care where they went (even though I do make note of it with a comment) because once they\u2019re gone they won\u2019t be coming back. We\u2019ll see how this goes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAsteroid Tracking Rework\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother deficiency made itself known this past week, which was in how I was handling asteroids. Every single day new asteroids are generated by the game and I track them all. Each day the ATN pulls a certain number (sometimes none) from this collection of tracked asteroids and officially \u201Cdiscovers\u201D them. So there are significantly more undiscovered asteroids than there are ones that have been listed in the ATN database so far. I won\u2019t say how many but my old pre-v1.0 saves only handled about 500 at a time and I have way more than that. The game actually handles it great as long as I don\u2019t try to show them all at once in the tracking station (I zoom in on Kerbin so only the ones in its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E are shown before I make them visible). But switching from the tracking station to the asteroids to get their orbital data and makeup has started to take over a minute and process so much that my music even skips while the scene is loaded, which makes me want to put my fist through my monitor. So to circumvent having to load into the flight scene in a game with 500\u002B asteroids after I \u201Cdiscover\u201D the ones for the day I copy them from the ATN save file to one of my sandbox test files with no other craft. There I can load in and out of the flight scene in a jiffy and it\u2019s overall much faster and more efficient now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u2019t know if any of that even made sense to someone reading this, but delving into how the ATN functions would take an entire Desk Notes entry on its own. I\u2019ll keep that in my back pocket for when I have nothing else to write about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-16T04:56:52Z\u0022 title=\u002204/16/2017 04:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 16, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Drew Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
