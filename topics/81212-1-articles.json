Draining power from it\u0027s own velocity arounf jupiter, it generates free power, as Io\u0027s own gravity accelerates the probe back up to Jovian orbital velocity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe the power comes from Io\u0027s momentum (which is slowed by a mass hovering behind it in orbit) but the ratio is so huge that it might as well be neligable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Z-Man","CreatedById":96549,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-09T06:39:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s not impossible in principle. However, the other ingredient you need to extract energy via a tether is an ionosphere that is stationary more relative to the magnetic field than to your craft. I don\u0027t know whether there is enough of an ionosphere where you want to place the probe, but if there is, it will also be moving along with Io.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
