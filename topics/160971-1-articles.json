I know that this visor comes from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022KSP Renaissance Compilation (mod)\u0022\u003EKSPRC\u003C/abbr\u003E, but the mod is outdated, and when I look in the texture replacer, the part where the visor should be, I don\u0027t see it. I\u0027ve tried picking out each part of the texture replacer that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022KSP Renaissance Compilation (mod)\u0022\u003EKSPRC\u003C/abbr\u003E has, (which is 1.1.2 by the way), but nothing helps.
