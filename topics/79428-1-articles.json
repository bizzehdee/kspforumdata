A logical step considering a transfer window was only a couple weeks away. I had no problem doing a complex double probe deployment on my Duna mission but decided to keep it simple as I had never been to Gilly. I began my launch and waited until I got to my ejection angle then burnt for roughly 1km/s until my orbit was dipping through Eve\u0027s. That\u0027s funny I thought, I had Eve selected as a target and didn\u0027t even get a closest encounter marker. I played around with some maneuver nodes until I got an encounter. I had a 350km encounter, perfect for aerobraking and I would need to as my orbit had me nearly hit the sun after the Eve encounter. This happens nearly every time I try to get to Eve, I either have to sundive or just wait until I get captured. I have no problem getting to Jool or Duna or even any other inclined bodies like Minmus. Does anyone else always have trouble with Eve? Does anyone else seem to always have to sundive to get to the inner solar system?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"95tiger59","CreatedById":92346,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-25T03:14:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou must be doing a killer gravity assist to do that, any chance you could post a picture of the encounter/sundive?
