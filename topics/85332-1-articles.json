I thought I might as well write up some of my more interesting learning experiences.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was pleasantly surprised that Bob Kerman survived the one launch of the MK 0 prototype rocket (with no control systems save the cockpit\u0027s reaction wheel); he remembered to shut off the engine when up and down switched places and deployed the chute before the rocket ploughed into the ground. He was clearly quite disoriented on landing, though, judging from the way he scooped up some soil from outside the Space Centre and proclaimed it vital for scientific purposes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebadiah Kerman enjoyed an illustrious, but sadly, short career flying the Mk I, II, and III models, making the first flights any distance from the Space Centre. As a running joke with the science staff and with Bob, he would always scoop up some dirt and bring it back when recovered. However, the Mk IV would be his undoing; on a higher suborbital flight, the first test of the EVA RCS thrusters was not entirely successful. (The EVA controls are a bit of a mystery until you realise they\u0027re only relative to the camera about one axis, with \u0022up\u0022 and \u0022down\u0022 and the plane the others operate in fixed, unless I\u0027m missing something, in which case please tell me about it. Vexingly, by the time I figured it out, although I\u0027d got over 1km from the rocket, I had enough propellant left to get within a few metres of it with low relative velocity... but not actually to get poor Jeb back on board).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA later sub-model of the Mk IV also had tragic consequences for Bob. The Kerbal responsible for the incident has been severely disciplined; all Kerbals are to remember that, when rearranging the external fittings on a craft, the parachute is to be above the top stack decoupler, no matter if some other arrangement looks tidier. (This one was particularly annoying because if I\u0027d only realised before popping the top decoupler, I\u0027d have made it back, the rocket being small enough for the chute to handle - and not yet using Deadly Re-entry).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill Kerman was initially a successful pilot of the Mk V and VI, but the invention of the Stayputnik led me to start instead launching unkerballed SpanSAT probes; the Mk VI, festooned with batteries, could easily... occasionally attain a stable orbit within the sensor\u0027s desired altitudes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, however, I went a bit mod-crazy. RemoteTech meant I had to give up those spy sats, with no way short of a later manned rendezvous to turn their antennas on. Deadly Re-entry seemed like it might make getting the rockets down a bit more interesting, but what I didn\u0027t realise was that NEAR would make getting them up into the first hurdle. The faithful old Mk VI not only had a regrettable tendency to vibrate itself to pieces on the way up, but any attempt by MechJeb to stabilise the craft resulted in a faster and faster roll; any attempt to actually pitch it over - at all - tended to result in the ends swapping places rapidly and increasingly comedically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnter the Mk VII, with a higher centre of gravity, more control surfaces, and more reaction wheels. Exit the Mk VII, with the observation that reaction wheels between two stacked boosters which are only really held on to the main body of the rocket in their middles tend to wiggle those boosters about with amusing consequences; but Bill survived, having the presence of mind to blow everything and let the solid fuel boosters go and have adventures somewhere else. Enter the Mk VII-a, stuck together somewhat more enthusiastically. (Not having invented struts yet, it\u0027s all decouplers...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETragically, exit Bill; the important lesson being that sometimes when the liquid fuel stage isn\u0027t burning, it\u0027s because the throttle is closed, not because it hasn\u0027t been lit yet. Bill instead decoupled the last rocket stage, leaving his capsule heading more or less straight up, then straight down; the heatshield functioned perfectly, scant comfort for poor Bill as 48 gravities smeared him across the interior.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo heap farce on tragedy, the resulting confusion in the VAB meant that on the next Mk VII sub-model, the heatshield release was further down the stack than the final decoupler; Tom Kerman discovered this, correctly diagnosing the cause of Bill\u0027s death, when he released the final stage at just the right moment, only to watch his heatshield also drift off into the void. He attempted a belly-down landing on the capsule\u0027s build-in heatshielding, allowing the components on the base of the capsule to be incinerated; had he remembered that one of those components was MechJeb and been ready to take manual control, the results might have been more satisfactory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnter Malcolm Kerman, who seems entirely undeterred by the fate of his predecessors. (I suspect he\u0027s a Badass, given that he grins widely in all situations). Malcolm executed a near-perfect launch for a series of ScanSAT observation orbits, but then decided his re-entry was coming too soon, readjusting his orbit again... leaving the periapsis some 68,000m off Kerbin as the fuel ran dry, with apoapsis at 190km. He\u0027s now on a very long series of aerobraking orbits and hopes to return to Kerbin some time this month...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EETA: I\u0027m pleased to report that Malcolm made it back to the surface without further incidents.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-25T16:59:34Z\u0022 title=\u002209/25/2014 04:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by damerell\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZodiaK","CreatedById":80590,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-28T07:23:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Espiffing!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewelcome to the forums, Sciencegoer!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vermil","CreatedById":122726,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-28T09:04:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi.
