That being said - Hold the brake and do not release unless your engines have hit 100% thrust as shown in the video - only then, do you want to begin accelerating the aircraft. You will only generate the lift you need right when hitting the edge of the end of the runway. At this time you need to be lifting and right as your nose picks up, stabilize the aircraft or it will go out of control. When turning, do it in small amounts, giving the craft time to stabilize on each degree you turn. Too much turning at once or too fast will send you out of control. \u003Cstrong\u003EIf there are any problems or improvements that could be made, please feel free to let me know or do them yourself, it\\\u0027s a community plane :]\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ChronicSilence","CreatedById":19852,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T18:52:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBeautiful replica.

As soon as it loads, hold B down so it doesn\\\u0027t start to roll. You want to have your engines at max before taking off so you get the speed you need to lift at the end of the runway, and every bit of the runway counts.
