I designed it and everything seemed to be normal - it has enough fuel for orbit and return, FAR doesn\u0027t object to this design, but... there is a problem - the runway is just too short. I tried adding more engine nacelles (making the total of 8) but it didn\u0027t really help. This monster is accelerating very slowly making only 100 m/s at the end of the runway.\n\nAnd if I use the rocket engine for acceleration I don\u0027t have enough fuel to get to the orbit.\n\nSo, any idea about how do I accelerate it more?

If it drops off then flies, you\u0027ve built a plane that can\u0027t rotate for takeoff. Move the elevators further back and/or the main gear closer to the CoM so that it can lift the nose. Alternatively, build it so the wings are angled when it\u0027s sitting on the runway. And if you\u0027re worried about tailstrikes add a safety wheel or skid under the tail.\n\nIf it can\u0027t fly at 100 m/s, well that\u0027s already a very fast speed for takeoff.

A 211 tonne craft would need 15 Turbojets at a minimum (and that\u0027s pre-nerfing, unless it\u0027s specifically B9 where Turbojets become largely worthless and not specifically FAR in and of itself; I get the mods I don\u0027t use mixed up occasionally). You\u0027re using FAR, so I don\u0027t know all the rules, but that is something worth considering.\n\nThe big thing I\u0027m seeing is the position of the CoL relative to the CoM. It\u0027s behind, which is good, but it\u0027s also above the CoM. Both positions in and of themselves add to the craft\u0027s stability - which means the tendency of the craft to pitch downward. Your craft is quite stable, so I\u0027d wager it\u0027s quite controllable once you can get it in the air, but one of the side-effects of a stable craft is a high takeoff speed. You might try reducing the upward sweep on the wings. \n\nMyself, I think the MOAR ENGINES solution is sound; folks with more FAR experience (read: *any* FAR experience) might tell you different."},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T02:57:17Z","Content":"I\u0027ve got a few hundred tons into orbit with a twr of 0.24 under FAR ( not recommended! it took two complete circumnavigations to get to altitude to flip to rockets ) - a lot will depend on the cD of the aircraft, and that is quite dependent on what AoA it can hold as well as it\u0027s shape; all this is stuff current stock users will probably have to worry about come 1.0.\n\nFAR nerfs stock turbojets very hard.

Did you get an aerodynamic failure message, or did you experience unwanted pitching that then broke your plane? If so, you probably want to sweep the wings more to reduce drag at trans- and supersonic speeds."}]}
