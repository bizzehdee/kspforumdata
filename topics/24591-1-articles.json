All the information you need should be right there when you hover your mouse over the part. Mass is calculated in Tons, i believe. A part weighing .2 would be 20% of a ton ect.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AceGamer","CreatedById":61925,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T06:42:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb is your best bet it is also handy for loads more in flight things!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T09:03:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually if you don\u0027t want the automation of MechJeb, and just want craft data.
