Looking at the pics you put up, it definitely looks like something is confusing KSP\u0027s shader plugin. Have you tested these panels with other mods that mess with shaders?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you using my addon? If you are the metal panels still worked last time I checked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for fixing it, we first have to figure out if this is a Kerbpaint specific problem, or if it is an issue that occurs with any mod that messes with shaders.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"praise the suuun","CreatedById":69912,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-12T21:19:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy mistake my friend I was trying to say that I am not using kerbpaint; I manually replaced the texture in the game directory.

All my part cfg files are written so none conflict or use from another metal part but I have made a lot of them so it might be cfg error. Clearly the texture is working fine as I\u0027m getting my desired colour on 75% est of the craft. I thought it was a vanilla ksp problem but when I put the stock panels in the same configuration as my test pictures, it seemed ok with no saturation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-12T21:39:46Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2014 09:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by praise the suuun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
