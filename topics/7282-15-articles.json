I came here from Orbiter. which was my personal favorite for years until KSP came along.. You guys have done an outstanding job. I\u0027ve seen good persona from the Dev team just in your \u0022Daily Kerbal\u0022 posts. Excellent responses within a reasonable time concerning all requests or suggestions, whether they were implemented or refused, at-least there was an answer. You\u0027ve never disappeared behind the game and made it a smokescreen between you and your community. It\u0027s very rare that I sing praises about a game developing company... actually, I don\u0027t think I ever have. So you can consider yourselves exceptional as far as I\u0027m concerned. lol..
