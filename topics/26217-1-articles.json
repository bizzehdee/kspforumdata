What I did was use the mechJeb Smart A.S.S. to orient my ship to either normal or anti-normal. This works because the probe is on the end and it can rotate on it own. and the solar panels (the stock 1x6 ones) rotate to face the sun when not blocked by the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 4 solar panels are radially mounted 90 degrees apart.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
