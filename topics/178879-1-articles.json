Or sometimes you are taking off from some uneven ground and need to make adjustments. At speed, the steering can be too abrupt.\u00A0 Changing the friction control can help with this, but that is a mixed bag since it also affects your braking ability.\u00A0 Perhaps there is a way to do this I don\u0027t know about?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, it would be nice to have some taller steerable gear that would match up better size-wise with the larger fixed gear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-10-10T18:33:00Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2018 06:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Klapaucius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-10T21:22:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReally, what we need is differential braking; which is what real airplanes use to steer when taxiing.

There are many aircraft that have steerable main gear. Main gear is often the bigger gear so it makes no sense why there isn\u0027t a steering option on the heavy landing gears in this game. Since it\u0027s a modular game one would expect such a option should be available. For now I have to use structural elements to raise the medium landing gear to use it for steering larger aircraft. It can be done but I shouldn\u0027t have to workaround to do so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223465613\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022178879\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221539206549\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154640\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rocket In My Pocket\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n20 hours ago, Rocket In My Pocket said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReally, what we need is differential braking; which is what real airplanes use to steer when taxiing.
