So far I\u2019ve only done the Mun and Minmus missions but I think I see what\u2019s going on here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst off, I think it\u2019s a great idea to have story missions that encourage you to explore. A lot of KSP players never went interplanetary and this is a great way to get them to do that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I think there is a missed opportunity there, and I hope they\u2019ll flesh it out as more systems come online. As it is they just tell you where to go, give you a waypoint, you to go there, and you see something cool and get science points. I\u2019m being led by the nose a bit too transparently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019d really like to discover those anomalies myself. I think the missions need a discovery mechanic. Maybe it\u2019s a scanning system that you\u2019ll also use to find resources. The first missions could introduce us to the mechanic and walk us through how it works; subsequent missions could just point us in a general direction and leave the rest to us: \u201CWe\u2019ve determined that the garbled signal from the Jool system originates from at least five distinct sources, and we\u2019d like you to find them.\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope the current missions are that way just because there aren\u2019t any scanning mechanics in place yet and this will become more sophisticated in future updates.

Absolutely agree there should be a set of intermediary missions to help bridge those gaps, and that the actual monuments should be reordered: Minmus \u0026gt; Mun \u0026gt; Ike \u0026gt; Duna \u0026gt; Dres \u0026gt; Gilly \u0026gt; Moho \u0026gt; Vall \u0026gt; Laythe \u0026gt;Tylo \u0026gt; Eve. They should definitely also be considering what the launch window sequence is and time between launches, in transit etc. Some players are going to do one mission at a time sequentially but I think especially as colonies and resources get started and we have an alarm clock players are going to get used to multiple things happening at once, and those launch and transit times are going to become more and more important.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn the broader point about scanning--\u003Cem\u003Eabsolutely.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EThis goes to something Nate said early on about intrinsic vs extrinsic goals. There\u0027s value to both, but often just giving players some tools and a broad array of options creates the most dynamic kind of gameplay. If for instance they gave players an orbital scanner that could detect the non-monument, more geological discoverables they could play around with exploring and landing more accurately on Minmus before being asked to land in a specific location on the Mun.

The old science log in the R\u002BD building in KSP1 was okay but pretty unwieldy.
