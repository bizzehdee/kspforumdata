I want to get four nuclear engines on the tank and use the quadcoupler. I cant put the decoupler directly on the 4 engines (for staging). So i use another quadcoupler at the end of the four engines and attach the decoupler to that quadcoupler. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esee image:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jzbhtx6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jzbhtx6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it looks weird cause only one engine seems to be attached to the 2nd quadcoupler.

You then need to add a clamp-o-tron to the bottom of the decouplers, and then pick up construction with four more clamp-o-trons below those (so that the top of the rocket is \u0022docked\u0022 to the bottom part).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Why would I do that, capi?\u0022, says you. Well, it has to do with the branching nature of .craft files. Long and the short of it is that you can\u0027t form loops and expect your rocket to behave the way you want - you can\u0027t branch off into four separate stacks (which is what the quad-adapter does) and then later rejoin those stacks. What winds up happening is that the .craft file will ignore three of the reconnects, you wind up with a wobbly rocket (think insufficient strutting) and you can look forward to seeing a nice big explosion when you finally decouple. Like this one:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VEe9HPh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VEe9HPh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo actual damage to the craft in this case, but seeing this will still make you jump a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe clamp-o-tron trick is the only way I know to get around this; basically, the game treats the lower half of the rocket as a separate craft. When the whole thing is loaded on the pad and the physics engine releases, the docking ports automatically clamp together with a rock-solid connection, just as they would with a multi-port docking setup. When you\u0027re ready to utilize the stage, you just hit the decouplers like normal; the docked docking ports slough off with the rest of the lower stage and you can go on your merry way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProvided you aim those sheaths the right way, of course......\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, I\u0027ve pretty much given up on the notion of using quad-adapters in my designs (they\u0027d be a lot more useful if you could form loops with them).
