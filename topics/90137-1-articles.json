I want to use a stock IVA for my command pod, even though they won\u0027t match exactly. The problem I\u0027m having is that in the exterior model, bits of the window frame turn inward enough that they\u0027re visible as polygons floating in mid air in front of the IVA, at least from certain positions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that when and if I get around to doing my own IVA this won\u0027t matter... as I\u0027ll model the insides of the frames... and it won\u0027t matter which side you\u0027re seeing. But I\u0027m not sure when that\u0027s going to happen... so... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a tag or trick of some other kind that will let me hide some or all of my exterior pod model when I go to IVA? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe windows are a sort of intricate bit of geometry, so trying to edit them to make sure that you\u0027re only seeing the backsides of every polygon from every seat in the model would be really unpleasant. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArt\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-14T20:53:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethere\u0027s nothing to turn off the outside far as I know.
