There are very few research stations, but the few people that stay there over winter are hand selected and stay there over winter.

The point is, we do not know the exact conditions that led to the emergence life on earth. We have a picture, the elements, a range of probable conditions and locations, reasonable suggestions of possible ways, but no hard measurements because the stuff is gone. That is as sorry as i am about it, not precise, at least not precise enough to define what is necessary elsewhere for a similar thing to happen. We simply have to wait until we find some.
