That\u0027s not a bad thing though, the store can get overloaded when a new update hits, steam never has that problem (so far anyway!) Steam can also patch properly, last time I heard the Store patcher was still broken and you had to redownload the whole game every time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you have it though, you need never open steam again if you don\u0027t want to. I believe the steam version has steam controller support (not 100% sure on that), but other than that there is no difference. You can just run it directly from KSP.exe (or KSP_x64.exe) and not worry about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs others have said - I highly recommend keeping your steam copy \u0022clean\u0022 - that is no mods. Copy it to another directory and play from there, so steam can auto-update and you have a clean backup for updating/in case something goes wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-31T12:47:35Z\u0022 title=\u002201/31/2017 12:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 31, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by severedsolo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
