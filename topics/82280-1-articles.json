Selling them as Windows devices, when they certainly were not, was voluntarily misleading and should have got them charged for fraud.

Uses for a Surface RT... Tough question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, lets see. If I\u0027m not mistaken, the casing on the Surface RT is plastic, and therefore flammable, yes? If so, I\u0027d suggest keeping it around on the off chance that you ever get stuck in a blizzard. You should be able to puncture it\u0027s lithium ion battery which will, hopefully, catch the battery and the casing on fire, providing some small measure of warmth. Possibly keeping you alive until help can arrive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, there just aren\u0027t many apps available for Windows RT, and I seriously doubt that is going to change anytime soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gamowin","CreatedById":47184,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-22T04:57:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell thank for the replies, I actually didn\u0027t purchase the RT myself, it was handed down from family as they got upgraded tech, so I\u0027m stuck with this thing for a while unfortunately.
