Aim for a TWR of 1.2 to 1.5. That seems to be the sweet spot for whatever reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Make sure you toggle flap controls appropriately! Tailfins should only control yaw, outer elevons should only adjust pitch, and inner control surfaces can handle both pitch and roll (though you may want to disable roll and just use reaction wheels/capsule torque for that).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Set up your landing gear appropriately: rear wheels should be behind CoM and about 50 to 75% of the way between wingtips and center of plane, front wheel(s) should be fairly far forward and as near to the center as possible (for single-front-wheel configuration) or also 50 to 75% from the center vs. wingtips (for double-front-wheel configuration). If your rear gear is too close in relative to the size of your spaceplane, it will induce a pendulum effect (ie. your plane will rock back and forth as it goes down the runway and flip itself over).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.
