In the same way that the docks aren\u0027t exactly meant for this purpose, I doubt the small gear bays were meant for crane purposes ether. Is the physics resulting from the idea slightly broken? sure but a lot of the physics in KSP are broken (flying box planes anyone?), and the limited part options kind of force us to get creative when looking for ways to solve problems. Ideally we would all have very realistic 6 story tower cranes next to our assembly area\u0027s, but we don\u0027t have the kind of parts we need to make that work so these tricks are what evolve as a result. Each just as interesting as the next.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP is about solving problems and finding creative solutions that shouldn\u0027t work but do... and in the process blowing up a ton of rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI applaud this gentleman\u0027s efforts and the resulting slingshot builds that could also result from this.. should be fun to watch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CavemanNinja","CreatedById":98480,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-10T22:27:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Keldaria\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery, very nice answer.
