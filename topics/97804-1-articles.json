I seem to have had success with changing when modded parts are unlocked, however I cannot seem to change the level at which the stock Mk-1 Lander is unlocked. I wish to have it unlocked with Landing, here is the .cfg that I tried changing to do this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E// --- editor parameters ---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETechRequired = landing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EentryCost = 6800\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecost = 1500\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecategory = Pods\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esubcategory = 0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etitle = Mk1 Lander Can\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emanufacturer = Jebediah Kerman\u0027s Junkyard and Spacecraft Parts Co\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edescription = This capsule was designed for lightweight non-atmospheric landers, and seats a single occupant.

Turns out the KSPI tree was forcing a different tech level. I enabled it and changed the .cfg and now it works!
