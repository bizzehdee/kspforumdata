You often want to arrange your program so that you can expect most refs to be non-null, and if one happens to be null, then the error is often someplace else. However, as you say, sometimes you discover that a ref might be null by design, which is when you add a null-check.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-11T17:24:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2015 05:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LostOblivion**"},{"CreatedByName":"jd284","CreatedById":139444,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T18:08:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The mod is de-referencing a null pointer, pointers should \\*always\\* be checked before first access, which is not being done in this code. ;-)\n\nIt\u0027s not a pointer... but anyway, what would you do when you find a null reference? You throw an exception. But there\u0027s no point manually checking and then manually throwing an exception, the CLR does all that on its own anyway. So unless you want to specifically handle cases of null references differently, there\u0027s no point in a duplicate check.\n\nDon\u0027t try to apply design rules of your favorite language to another runtime environment without learning more about it first."},{"CreatedByName":"SMILIE","CreatedById":72171,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T10:34:01Z","Content":"I really love KIS.
