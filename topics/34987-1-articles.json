Why do you think NASA isn\u0027t just restarting saturn production?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERussians can sell Space Travel to richest tourists !! (sad joke ^^)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yes, they have the plans so the Russians can do it again, but what interest except the glory ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd please, 30 years ago... Buran spaceflight in 1988, Zarya in 1998 (1st ISS module) was built by Russians (USA just financed it). The many success of their Protons and Soyouz. Their new launcher (Angara). Do not be contemptuous, they have evolved since 80\u0027s. They work(ed) on Kliper, Phobos-Grunt, Venera-D, Louna-Glob.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd for your NASA question, I\u0027m a Saturn V fan...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m one of the people who think stopping the Saturn program is the worst bull**** NASA has done. Why they don\u0027t improved the Saturn like the Semiorka (Semiorka -\u0026gt; Vostok -\u0026gt; Soyouz) ???\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know, probably a stupid decision because of morons politicians who saw in the Shuttle program a lower cost (hindsight, what a mistake...).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust think of the ISS, 30 launches just for the assembly : 400 tons in LEO; Skylab it\u0027s 90 tons in LEO; so we can easily imagine only five Saturn V were needed to build the ISS !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the Saturn V was not perfect (despite its failure rate of 0 it has a lot of problem : pogo oscillation, engines problems) and it costed a lot (less than the Shuttle Program; I know but... yeah, easy with hindsight).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Cold War justified that take foolish risks and huge budgets, it is no longer the case now (which did not prevent accidents).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know NASA want to build Ares V/SLS; a Saturn V clone... I know that. But will they get the money ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChinese go into Space primarily to demonstrate their power. But what China does now (at the moment), the Russians and the Americans can do it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-27T21:04:07Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2013 09:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Frogbull\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
