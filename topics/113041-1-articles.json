Its just plain painful -- obviously not because its hard, but its just silly clicking and repetition. Doesn\u0027t even need a clever ship design, just repetition. I also don\u0027t want to just full-on cheat the science into my save; I want to know that I have actually collected each piece of silly biome science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would love to have something to automate this. I\u0027m not familiar enough with the API to know the possible/best ways to accomplish it... maybe just add \u0022player has collected and returned 6 surface samples from KSC runway\u0022 to the current game, maybe add a part that will collect a sample of each applicable experiment (trivial biome, unlocked, not maxed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, its still cheating, but it would be great for just the really trivial science -- only biomes that can be walked to (without climbing! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E), only experiments that have been unlocked.
