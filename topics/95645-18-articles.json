Before reentry, decouple upper probe and lock it to retrograde (heatshield included). Once in atmo, activate parachutes. If performed right, does not require any comm sats (although one or two would make things easier).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yemo","CreatedById":114412,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T21:36:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe direct approach is a great idea to avoid the remote tech restrictions!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI noticed some other stuff I was not aware of, eg\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- New science experiments (from DMagic)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - We now have 2 nearly identical chutes (RealChute Cone Chute and Mk16XL Parachute), but none for light probes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I ll rebalance that and probably do something about the parachutes in general.
