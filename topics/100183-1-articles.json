Boone II would have to make two trips, and would require refueling at the second landing.

The second landing took place on the verge of darkness, and the resulting Iota rendezvous was also in the dark. The final two crew members transferred to Boone I. Due to the potential difficulty involved in the upcoming procedure, the operation waited until Iota station was exposed to the sun once more. First, all remaining fuel in the lander module was transferred to Iota station. The lander module was then decoupled from the capsule. Following this Iota released it\u0027s docking clamps with Boone II\u0027s main engine, setting it adrift.

Though it may have been unlikely that an engine would get dropped on the VAB or Pad, it was better to remove the possibility.

While we have a significant amount of data about other planets, we really have next to nothing on Kerbin possessing only a few EVA reports, surface samples, and a low-resolution map. To rectify this situation, a satellite equipped with Biome scanning and high resolution mapping capability was launched on a modified Santa Maria rocket into polar orbit. Once this data was obtained, missions would be undertaken to explore anomalies revealed by the scan. Initially the plan was to send Kestrel to the polar anomaly, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111270-X-Files\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ebut this guy beat me to it\u003C/a\u003E, so we would instead be focusing on less distant targets. \u003Cp\u003EThis allowed for the usage of the programs very old \u0022Icarus\u0022 jet design, along with two new vehicles built specifically for expeditions. Our satellite revealed a number of anomalies in the immediate vicinity of KSC, so the Icarus was fitted with a BTDT scanner (From \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96859\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESCANsat\u003C/a\u003E, along with the Biome scanner and Radar scanners) and battery packs to power it. Naturally, Jeb would pilot the Icarus. Though I was fairly certain what two of the anomalies were (KSC, old airfield), the BTDT scanner would be used at these locations first. To my surprise, the scanner actually located an anomalous object very close by the airstrip. Icarus made visual contact with the object, but was not equipped with space-age ladders to permit the pilot to exit. Jeb returned to KSC and taxied off the runway to await pickup by Boxcar (Expedition Science Rover).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoxcar drove to the SPH to retrieve Jeb from Icarus. Not having a ladder is no issue for Boxcar, with it\u0027s super-space-utility ramp. With Jeb on board, Boxcar drove to the launchpad to retrieve Bob and Bill. With everybody loaded up, it was off to the anomaly site. The object appeared to be a partially buried monolith. Jeb tried pushing all the \u003Cem\u003EScience!\u003C/em\u003E buttons, but no special data could be gathered aside from photographs. With this location surveyed and marked, the crew loaded back into Boxcar and returned to KSC. Jeb was delivered to Icarus, Bob and Bill were delivered to the cafeteria. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIcarus took off once again and headed toward the old airfield. No strange objects were discovered here, but Jeb landed and photos were taken anyway. It was now time to survey an anomaly located in the mountains just west of KSC. Arriving over the target area, the BTDT scan was initiated and indicated the presence of another monolith. Icarus was unable to locate the object visually, and doing low\u0027n\u0027slow turns in the vicinity of mountain peaks proved to be exceedingly hazardous. Another method would be required to locate this object. Icarus returned to KSC. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Helikopter Mk I was constructed to perform the mountain survey. Unfortunately, it was too heavy and failed to lift off. It was redesigned into the Helikopter Mk II. This model proved capable of flight, rather easy and stable flight at that. It was however only a test vehicle and was not equipped with appropriate scanners. Returning to KSC, I discovered that landing is much more difficult than flying. Various parts of Helikopter Mk II were used to construct Helikopter Mk III, a fully equipped (if not very aesthetic) vehicle. Some time was spent practicing landings, and then it was back to the mountain site. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPiloting the Helikopter Mk III around the mountain proved to be no less dangerous than piloting Icarus. This may have been due to my lack of experience with helicopters. Through lots of luck and perhaps a tiny bit of pilots intuition, I did (barely, had to extend the gear a few times) manage to avoid slamming into the rock face.

If all goes well, they will rendezvous again in LLO. Recovery of the Cortez II engine is not a priority for this mission as there will be no further use for it, with the Cortez I lander being specially built for Tylo and Laythe landings. It will still be recovered at Ike if possible for potential return to Laythe in the future. If necessary, it\u0027s fuel can be transferred to Cortez I for the crews safe return, abandoning the main engine over Laythe. If this comes to pass, Cortez II will retain only enough fuel to de-orbit into Laythe, and be destroyed on impact. \u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFive vessels were launched back to back, \u0022Mason Construction Vehicle\u0022 (MCV), \u0022Mason Construction Yard\u0022 (MCY), \u0022Mason cargo stack 1\u0022 (MCS1), \u0022Cortez I\u0022, and the cleverly named \u0022Bop Mapping Satellite\u0022 (BMS, poorly documented, wasn\u0027t intended to be a part of this mission package but it would have missed the Jool window otherwise). MCV and Cortez would make their transfer burn for Duna in 5 days, 3 hours apart. MCY would follow 4 days later, with MCS1 following 1 day after MCY. BMS would not have a Jool window for another 40 days. In the interim, Mule launched from El Dorado to deliver enough fuel for Cortez II to rendezvous with Iota and receive a proper refueling from SSHFT. Cortez II possesses no RCS blocks making it necessary for Iota station to perform the docking procedure. SSHFT docked axially with Iota prior to the Cortez docking maneuver. Even with it\u0027s 80 ton weight SSHFT is remarkably nimble due to packing 24 RCS blocks and two large reaction wheels and would assist with moving the station. After successfully docking, SSHFT transferred it\u0027s first load of fuel to Cortez. Two more trips would have to be made from the surface, with a second load for Cortez II and a third to be standing by in orbit for the incoming vessels. With everything prepared at Ike, all vessels in Kerbin orbit departed. Wanting to bring as much fuel along as possible, any final orbital stages that had fuel left were not staged prior to the burn. The second Duna flotilla was underway. BMS left on schedule for Jool 40\u002B days later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMCV would be the first to arrive at Duna, with Cortez arriving a day after. Both vessels performed a retroburn at Duna periapsis direcly into Ike encounters. Cortez would reach Ike first, making it\u0027s circularization burn a mere 29 minutes before MCV. After establishing orbit, the operation went on standby to await the arrival of MCY in two days. Once MCY arrived, Cortez I would rendezvous first and refuel from MCY\u0027s transfer stage before discarding it. MCV would then rendezvous, further refueling the Cortez I. Ideally, this completely topped off the Cortez and had fuel left over for MCY\u0027s storage tank. MCV\u0027s transfer engine was discarded at this point, and MCV released it\u0027s grabbing unit clamp from MCY to prevent any Kraken drive incidents. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECortez II, fully refueled, departed from Iota. It would not dock with MCY, instead stopping nearby. Cortez I undocked from MCY and docked with Cortez II on RCS thrusters. Bill performed a spacewalk to link the strut points, and Cortez was once again whole. The vessel transferred to a high Duna orbit to await the Jool departure window. Finally, eight days after the first arrival at Duna, MCS1 arrived. After transferring to Ike and performing a rendezvous with MCY, it\u0027s remaining fuel was distributed to the two landing modules and the transfer engine discarded. One member of the MCY crew would EVA over to the individual units and dock them with the construction yard, where both modules filled their tanks. Eventually, MCV will remove the landing engine units and dock them with MCY, but this will likely be after the Dres and Eeloo missions since doing it now would simply add a step to the process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESkip a bit, brother.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the Jool transfer window being far in the future, BMS had enough time to arrive at Jool. Desiring a very high apoapsis to reduce the cost of changing planes to match Bop, an Aerobraking node was created at 145 Km. It would be more accurate to call it a vacu-braking node as it had virtually no effect on the satellite, and BMS had to fire it\u0027s engine. This may prove not to be an issue, as BMS was carrying enough fuel to complete the Bop contract, map Bop, then transfer to Pol and map it as well. As the plane change was very cheap, it is likely it will still be able to perform these tasks. After matching planes with Bop, an actual aerobraking node was placed at 122 Km and the resulting orbit circularized. During this time frame, Cortez made it\u0027s transfer burn to Jool (entirely in the dark, picture taken afterwards). Bop transfer and orbit was easily achieved, first completing the contract, then changing into polar orbit to begin mapping. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this underway and Cortez en route to Jool, the first stage of both operations comes to a close.

Having had sufficient time and fuel to map both Bop and Pol in Low and High resolution and a multispectral scan, the satellite was sent to Laythe to help locate a suitable equatorial landing zone.

With so many recent near-failures in the forefront of my mind, it was time for Vanguard Astrodynamics to live up to it\u0027s name and start exploiting some orbital mechanics to save on fuel. Instead of aerobraking once low over Jool and then burning for a proper laythe encounter, the plan was to utilize three braking nodes to minimize the necessary fuel for both plane change and transfer to Laythe. Further aerobraking would be performed at Laythe to save even more fuel. There was one complication to the plan as Tylo was in position to block ingress to the first braking node over Jool, requiring a burn to avoid it. Several attempts at plotting a course within the Tylo encounter for an acceptable resulting orbit were made, but ultimately less fuel was required to simply avoid it. The first node was completed successfully, followed by a matching planes with Laythe at a cost of only 189.1 m/s. The second and third nodes were also completed without incident. Transfer to Laythe would occur in 10 days at a cost of 16.8 m/s. At Laythe, aerobraking was performed in two shallow nodes. The first established an elliptical orbit from which an inclination of zero degrees was set, which required little over 1 m/s due to the previous plane matching. Periapsis was lowered slightly and the second node resulted in an apoapsis of just over 100km. The periapsis was then established at 58km and the orbit circularized. The entire encounter, including corrections of inital Jool encounter and dodging Tylo (at a cost of 140 m/s), cost a grand total of 452 m/s calculated from the total remaining after the initial transfer burn (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ufn7V0h.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E3853 m/s\u003C/a\u003E) against the total remaining in final low Laythe orbit (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kUn0ThC.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E3401 m/s\u003C/a\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kUn0ThCh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kUn0ThCh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving achieved low orbit, a crew report was taken and transmitted to complete the second of three (the first being the probe at Bop) contracts which would cover the expense of the mission. The final contract was to place a flag on Laythe. The Cortez lander undocked from the main engine and the map from BMS was examined to locate a suitable landing site which would not require any change in inclination. Options were very slim as there is little enough land on Laythe as it is, even less flat land, and even less on the equator. The lander had an extremely narrow margin for error as it had only 3491 m/s, and orbit to 65km from sea level on Laythe requires a minimum of 3200. The plan was to land on a suitably flat stretch of terrain that was elevated relatively high to minimize the launch costs, but this proved not to be an option. A landing site at ~1300 meters was the highest safe area available. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/s43N9Mgh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022s43N9Mgh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/i93e7cch.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022i93e7cch.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a landing zone outside of desired parameters and an already very slim margin for error, I once again threw out lessons learned and turned on Mechjeb\u0027s landing guidance. While it did place the Cortez on a suborbital path to land in the desired area, it was also indicating an expenditure of 200 m/s to achieve this landing, beyond the ~150 m/s required to enter the atmosphere. At the last few moments I decided the autopilot was being overly conservative with safety concerns, hence the large braking burn it was indicating, and turned it off. The Cortez had nine chutes, and though it weighed ~30 tons I felt I could land safely with a far smaller burn. This hunch fortunately proved to be correct, with the chutes slowing the craft down to a very manageable 12 m/s once fully deployed. It took only a short burst before touching down to reduce landing speed to safe levels. After all was said and done, the Cortez was on the surface with 3317 m/s Delta V, slightly more than enough to return to orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/x4OftT0h.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022x4OftT0h.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the Cortez lander safely on the surface, the ladder was extended and the crew was prepared for EVA on the surface to complete the final contract and take glamor shots.

I had many words to express my displeasure. I can provide no reasonable explanation for how this happened. This Cortez module was simply loaded from the saved plans from the previous one, on which the command pod was aligned properly. The only modification made was the addition of the extra parachutes. Regardless of how it happened, there was no circumventing the problem as EVA thrusters are not sufficiently powerful to function on Laythe. The idea of letting a Kerbal fall from the pod and then attempt to remove and reattach the ladders was deemed to be too risky as failure would mean having one of the big three stranded on Laythe, or possibly even dying from the fall. No flag would be planted. Considering the necessary time and cost of sending yet another mission against the payout, the contract was simply dropped and penalties paid. With nothing left to do but leave, the Cortez returned to orbit. With such a tiny fraction of it\u0027s fuel remaining, the Cortez lander would wait in orbit for Cortez II to perform the rendezvous. While it waited, Bill went on EVA to repack the main chutes in preparation for the return to Kerbin. The two vessels docked successfully and Bob was sent to place the struts. With everything in place the Cortez transferred to a 30,000km parking orbit over Jool, safely between Laythe and Vall. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EHhRx48h.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022EHhRx48h.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lS3yhrIh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lS3yhrIh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/elNF4IGh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022elNF4IGh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E With the Cortez having sufficient fuel to be recovered intact, a course was plotted for Duna. Upon arriving, aerobraking at 10km followed by a short retroburn was necessary to achieve orbit. The Cortez then transferred to Ike orbit, transferred all remaining fuel into the lander module, and the main engine was left in orbit for potential recovery and re-use. Cortez lander docked with Iota station to take on sufficient fuel to return to Kerbin. After transferring back to Duna orbit, course was set to finally return home. No aerobraking was necessary at Kerbin, but the landing was unfortunately inaccurate due to my neglecting to set the parachutes to an action group and forgetting they cannot be deployed by staging when repacked. This meant I had to manually right click and deploy each chute. The engine was discarded just prior, and splashed down hard in the water just beyond KSC and was destroyed (or would have, it got too far away and vanished). The command module landed safely and all crew were recovered. Despite the failure to plant a flag, significant data was gathered and funds from the two successful contracts had nearly offset the cost of the mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gOoK4Gah.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022gOoK4Gah.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/itiJQnLh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022itiJQnLh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETesting also progressed on the Interplanetary missile, finally scoring it\u0027s first hit. The missile itself was completely redesigned with a mechjeb unit for Smart A.S.S. guidance as standard SAS proved to be more of a nuisance than help and a proper target (an Icarus model Jet) was deployed at the Old Airfield for testing purposes.

IMS I and Vanguard II would launch one week prior to the Dres window, with Boone IV and Mason Engine Module I following 170 days later for the Duna window. All launches and transfer burns were executed sucessfully. The Duna vehicles would arrive almost 2 years before the Dres vehicles, making their management much easier. In preparation for the arrival of Boone and MEM, SSHFT (still in orbit with a full load of fuel left over from the recent Cortez Operation) docked with MCY to provide fuel for the expeditionary vehicles. MEM arrived first, docked, and was refueled. Upon Boones arrival, the MEM would be required to undock to free the port for Boone. The crew transferred from Boone into the smaller of two Mason Lander Modules, MLM I, and docked with MEM to form the completed Mason Exploration Vehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221mqESsth.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1mqESsth.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Jh6247Uh.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Jh6247Uh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00229tBnTH1h.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9tBnTH1h.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:left;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMCV was required to perform some minor assembly duties, such as placing strut points on the engine module of the Mason vehicle. In addition, a spotlight was added to the lander to make night landing possible. After MCV had completed it\u0027s function and backed away, it was realized that the lander had three radial parachutes still attached. Originally intended to be removed by the MCV crew and stowed in one of it\u0027s many KAS containers, Malbrett took matters into his own hands and went on EVA, hurling the parachutes into space.

While in transit, IMS and Vanguard II arrived at Dres. IMS commenced mapping operations while Vanguard went into standby on a near-equatorial orbit. Distressingly, both vehicles required 2200\u002B m/s burns to circularize. If the Mason vehicle required such an immense burn, it would complicate the mission. Research prior to the mission indicated a transfer from Duna would require less than 2000 m/s total for both the ejection and insertion burns. Fortunately it turned out not to be an issue, as upon arrival the required insertion burn was indeed within expected margins at slightly over 900m/s. Utilizing the maps from IMS, what appeared to be a plateau in the northern polar region was chosen as the LZ for it\u0027s relatively close location to several other biomes. The Mason vehicle changed into a 90 degree polar orbit, and the Lander module separated and prepared for descent. Having prepared for a night landing, there was no delay to wait for the LZ to be exposed to sunlight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022I7rdqOFh.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/I7rdqOFh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022HoE8X0Bh.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HoE8X0Bh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile the spotlight did allow me to prevent the Mason lander from slamming into the surface, as you can see, it did nothing to expose the nearby terrain. Daylight would be needed to discern if the vehicle was close to the desired LZ. When the sun finally came up, there was no plateau in sight. We had at least not landed directly on a sheer cliff, and so the expedition proceeded. A flag was placed on a reasonably flat area nearby for Vanguard to aim at on descent. Once the Vanguard rover was on the surface, the crew would drive ~30km to five different biomes to run sensor analysis, collect samples, and take reports. Vanguard touched down successfully, and the expedition set out towards the first waypoint. The terrain was rather treacherous with more time spent floating off the surface than with wheels on the ground. The Vanguard rover proved to be entirely capable of performing in this profile at relatively high speeds of 25m/s with no difficulty. The longest jump I bothered to count was 17 seconds off the surface at a speed of 23.4 m/s. Equipped with two small reactions wheels, the rover could easily change it\u0027s attitude and always land on all four wheels at once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022VmAIDIQh.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VmAIDIQh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022JQEH2HNh.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JQEH2HNh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00220qRBFMFh.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0qRBFMFh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter collecting the final samples at what was intended to be the final site, I decided it would be a pity to leave without collecting data from the final biome of \u0022Impact Crater\u0022 (I didn\u0027t know about \u0022Canyons\u0022 until after I left \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022\u003E ). Given that the closest crater site was about 180km away, a radical plan was implemented. Considering that the Vanguard had been designed to land on the Mun and return it\u0027s crew to orbit under it\u0027s own power, it would have ample fuel to do the same here. In fact, it would have more than enough since it wouldn\u0027t be required to attain full orbit. The mother of all reckless moves was initiated, and Vanguard lifted high off the surface heading towards the crater. This hop actually went very smoothly (Yes I used mechjeb to land safely in the crater, it\u0027s one thing to land from a controlled orbit. This was something else.) and a full survey was done from the Crater.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ZjBX0zHh.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZjBX0zHh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022hIQYuDVh.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hIQYuDVh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022RRB6t89h.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RRB6t89h.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith that remarkable feat accomplished, it was time to return to the lander. Unfortunately, there was only enough fuel to jump about halfway back. In reality, there wasn\u0027t even enough for that. I ran out on descent and fell the last few meters and busted a tire. With an experienced engineer onboard, this was quickly rectified and the Vanguard was underway again. There was one near disaster, while driving through a very very dark valley the ground suddenly dropped out from under the rover and it plunged quite far and fast. I couldn\u0027t see the surface to orient the vehicle for impact, and Vanguard blew out a tire on hitting the ground while tilted awkwardly and nearly flipped over. The only thing that saved the crew was the grappling hook on the front. As the vehicle pitched over hard, it clamped on to the ground and prevented the flip. After this incident, I took a longer route that kept the Vanguard on well lit hills and avoided the black pits. The drive was just over 90km and took about an hour and a half, but the crew finally made it back. A mission portrait was taken, and the Mason lander ascended to dock with the engine module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022cIcLhQvh.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cIcLhQvh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022eUF66aah.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eUF66aah.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022UCfYYbeh.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UCfYYbeh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022AEENQCih.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AEENQCih.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce assembled again in orbit, Mason set course back to Duna. The recovery portion of the mission was entirely without event. Mason arrived at Ike, delivered the crew back to the Boone, and all vessels were refueled. Boone returned to Kerbin and the crew were safely recovered. The mission was considered to be a complete success until I discovered the Canyons biome (which is a tiny friggin strip on the map), and even without it all biomes known to the program at the time of the operation were fully surveyed. This mission will be chalked down as another success, and now the program prepares to visit Moho. On a side note, for anyone who\u0027s followed, the Interplanetary missile project has been cancelled. While it had success at hitting targets from a suborbital trajectory on Kerbin, a full scale missile was deployed to Duna and missed. The difficulty of hitting a relatively tiny target from orbit while under full acceleration is simply too much to overcome. I do not possess the piloting ability to hold the missile on target, nor does SAS, nor Mechjeb, nor any combination of these three. The cost of the full scale missiles is simply too high for repeated attempts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022t11lLP9h.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/t11lLP9h.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022dE5GfBTh.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dE5GfBTh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221WpcyVZh.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1WpcyVZh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/X5hg8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EComplete Album\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-12T18:59:51Z\u0022 title=\u002201/12/2016 06:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 12, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
