I seem to of ran into a problem though when ever i put some parts together and run a quick test to see how it looks all the parts twist and in some cases it brakes other parts of structure. So i am just wonderin if this is a mod problem or if i am just putting wrong parts together. I am running version 1.2.1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
