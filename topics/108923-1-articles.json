In my experience, I haven\u0027t found anything that I can\u0027t change in persistent.txt, but I remember trying it long ago before 1.0 and I don\u0027t think it worked, just that in my current career mode, science mutliplier is set to 160% and now I\u0027m doing interplanetary science I\u0027m finding the rewards are too big, but I do wan\u0027t to keep this save, as it\u0027s my most complex space program so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt works! The reason I thought it didn\u0027t was because last I tried, I looked at contract science rewards, which wouldn\u0027t change despite what I\u0027d done in persistent. This time I lowered it, and before changing SciMultiplier, I used a science instrument, reverted flight \u0026amp; quit to main menu, changed multiplier, then wen\u0027t to the same place and used the instrument, and it was 60% lower, so it worked perfectly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daid","CreatedById":32171,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T20:35:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt works, but rewards for contracts won\u0027t change that instance, they will only change for new contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
