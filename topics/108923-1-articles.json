In my experience, I haven\u0027t found anything that I can\u0027t change in persistent.txt, but I remember trying it long ago before 1.0 and I don\u0027t think it worked, just that in my current career mode, science mutliplier is set to 160% and now I\u0027m doing interplanetary science I\u0027m finding the rewards are too big, but I do wan\u0027t to keep this save, as it\u0027s my most complex space program so far.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nIt works! The reason I thought it didn\u0027t was because last I tried, I looked at contract science rewards, which wouldn\u0027t change despite what I\u0027d done in persistent. This time I lowered it, and before changing SciMultiplier, I used a science instrument, reverted flight \u0026 quit to main menu, changed multiplier, then wen\u0027t to the same place and used the instrument, and it was 60% lower, so it worked perfectly."},{"CreatedByName":"Daid","CreatedById":32171,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T20:35:35Z","Content":"It works, but rewards for contracts won\u0027t change that instance, they will only change for new contracts."}]}
