Grab all the experimental science you can, and as you pass over each biome leave the ship and do an EVA report. You can get full science from each one and transmit them home with no losses. This should give you enough to unlock mobile labs, which will generate all the science you need to get through the 300 and into the 550 science level. At that point you will be sending your first crewed missions to Duna or Eve orbit, where EVA reports and mobile labs should be enough to finish the tree.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T12:36:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn my experience, Reputation is the first currency you fill up on, because it naturally comes with diminishing returns. You get all of the stated reputation payout only at 0 reputation (neutral) and from then on it decreases. You get 50% of the payout at 500 reputation, 25% of the payout at 750 reputation, and so on... Plus, above maybe 500 to 600 points the contracts don\u0027t really get noticably better anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I usually grab a reputation converting strategy once I am somewhere above 700 rep, with a committment level chosen so the one-time investment cost doesn\u0027t drop me below 500. I generally convert it to cash because science is so excessively overabundant, and finishing the stock tree without even visiting Minmus (much less another planet) is so effortless, that it just doesn\u0027t make sense to convert anything into science. Funds never become useless, especially not later in the game when even the most basic throwaway cash-generating contracts ask multi-year interplanetary missions of you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pax Kerbana","CreatedById":129558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T12:50:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlt\u002BF12\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was hoping the tech tree would be a little better for 1.0.x but it is not...

Visit each building and do a crew report, an EVA report, science and goo study. Each building should net you around 15-20 science IIRC. You can create a cheap vehicle to do this with at the space-plane hangar with a jet engine and a tiny fuel tank. Just keep the speed low. I recently tapped one of the street lights outside of mission control at around 8 m/s, and to my surprise the entire building exploded - only an unharmed plane and a startled scientist left in the wreckage. Later on you can slap some decent thrust on and do a quick survey of the biomes nearby. Highlands, Grasslands, Oceans, Shores, and Mountains will all yield fresh science. Unlock the thermometer and barometer at the first available opportunity. Also, surface samples yield a ton of data, so upgrading science center should be a priority.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfterwards, you can build some very cheap probes. All it takes is a cheap auto-pilot with a small fuel tank and efficient engine, attached to a decent sized booster. Slap on a couple solar panels, some batteries, the thermometer and barometer, some goo, a science lab, and a radio. You can do the science lab once per flight - but thermometer and barometer can be done over and over. Probing Duna wasn\u0027t too hard early in the tech tree, and yielded good results. It\u0027s also not difficult to probe both Mun and Minmus on a single flight, and sending it off into solar orbit (which yields good science results).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise, taking a lander to Minmus can be done fairly early, and provides a ton of research. You can even visit multiple biomes per visit, as gravity is so low.
