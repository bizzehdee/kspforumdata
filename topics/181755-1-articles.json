Let\u0027s say you are playing with a friend, and you are going to go to duna and you time warp, this will place you in something called a subspace a moment in time different to the other player\u0027s time. Every other player will dissapear from the map, its like if you were on another different empty world, to find players, they will have to click on a button that will let you syncronize subspaces, lets say you are 1, and you have friend 2 and 3\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2 decides to time warp 10 mins into the future, he now dissapears from the map, you, get into a stable orbit or stop moving and syncronize subspaces and now you can interact with 2, but since 3 did not syncronize, now he is not able to interact with you in any way unless he also syncronizes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe can also add a friends system, a username system, a little list that shows you available servers and a downloadable file to make your server ,customize it and run it, you can add a password to make it private, add a feature to spectate other players and a live chat window. Change your server gamemode, select which mods are allowed in your server or disable them entirely, add a moderator system that lets you ban players or kick them,\u00A0prevent trolls by making your vessel private,\u00A0you cant switch to it unless you have a password, select how many players can join your server, also prevent any problems, you cant change into a subspace that is in the past. Theres a ton of possibilities for this game to have a multiplayer, it will definetly make alot of people happy and should be taken care of by patching any bugs that are found.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut i dont know if this is just another idea that will be forgotten, but honestly though, it would be amazing to have a stock multiplayer with servers will 10 or more people at a time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ozymandias_the_Goat","CreatedById":159377,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-28T13:08:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223530127\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022181755\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221548651880\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022195085\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sol469\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, Sol469 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, to fix this, I took the solution that luna multiplayer used and modified it a bit.

Have a set of multiple scenarios, from building and launching a craft, to making it reach a transfer sol orbit, to the injection burn\u2014just hop from scenario to scenario, instead of timeshifting.
