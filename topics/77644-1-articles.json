Many add-ons have up to this point used placeholder values for the price of their parts. These will need to be updated. But how do you determine an appropriate price for your parts? That\u0027s what I started this thread to discuss.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere should be some relationship between the attributes of a part and its price. A fuel tank, for example, one can calculate its weight and size based on its capacity. Another fuel tank of the same capacity but of greater strength and/or lighter weight must be using more advanced materials, therefore the second tank would have a higher price, and also appear at a later node on the technology tree. A lighter tank would have the benefit of reduced deltaV consumption to move it, so that might be a worthwhile cost offset, especially if fuel expense is ever added to the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s just one example.

In our world, the cost of a spacecraft component is primarily composed of these components:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDevelopment costs. I.e. the cost of designing it. Most of these things are unhealthily complicated, not to mention that it involves numerous prototypes, most of which are not reusable.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EManufacturing labor costs. Since most of these things are not mass produced, it typically involves exotic manufacturing techniques, stuff that needs to be done manually because there\u0027s no machine for it and making one would drive the development costs up even further, or alternatively, it can\u0027t be done manually so special machines do have to be built. \u003Cem\u003E(Things that are actually mass-produced, like Proton rockets, tend to go down in cost a lot, as most of the development costs are already invested, and purpose-built machines accumulate to manufacture them cheaper.)\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMaterials costs.

I.e the cost of a procedural part is either scaled linearly from a base value, or follows a curve, and the component that changes with size is relatively small, up until it bumps into a structural strength limit and requires a redesign. In theory, costs should depend on your tech level and change with it, or even go down the more times you used a particular part, but I\u0027m betting nothing of the sort was coded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose we\u0027ll have to use stock prices as a baseline again, and I also suspect many of them will be ridiculous, but we\u0027ll be obliged to follow them anyway. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greys","CreatedById":57109,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-15T00:17:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere was a tool developed for use with Mission Controller, which procedurally reset part costs based on the part\u0027s properties.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow much it weighed, what type of thing it was, what resources it contains and how much, and what partmodules it contained and their configuration.
