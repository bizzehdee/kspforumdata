I like Legos, I appreciate the design challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAaaand I\u0027m not liking the multi-segmented fairings in the screenshots, if only for the parts count. I know, its probably not that many parts for a given payload (unless we\u0027re talking about a large payload here?), and it doesn\u0027t count towards final in-orbit parts count (unless they\u0027re made a non-thermal part of the aeroshell?). Maybe the approach does lend itself to different load sizes (heights per given diameter), without having to go procedural (again, going Lego). That said, I kind of prefer the approach used in the SpaceY payload fairings parts (haven\u0027t played with it so much since ProcFairings, but I think it\u0027s baseplate \u002B nosecap, and the fairings get plugged in between automatically, so it can accommodate a range of payload heights?). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, hai 6S! (I never did get a hang of using the mod back in 23.5, though the widgets should make interior placements easier now.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve loved EPL either with Kethane or Karbonite/Regolith integration, but hopefully the base ore in 1.0 will be the base ISRU for EPL and *some others. At the least, I can worry about one less mod to plug in (though I will miss those propfan engines in Karb...). I tend to prefer my resources abstracted... and few to manage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*EDIT: Some. People do prefer a more diverse ISRU management game, and that\u0027s okay. Thematically, I\u0027m the opposite. Hey, RoverDude did say that his MKS/OKS is highly abstracted, and I still feel it\u0027s a lot of management work (so sticking to Karb for the moment). And I like Snacks as a life support mod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see the old Mk2/Mk 1 inline there. I wonder if there will be a proper IVA in the 1.0 release... (Was there a proper IVA in the 0.90 release? I haven\u0027t touch the pod yet). And--considering the mod IVA for it showed that there\u0027s way too much room in there for one Kerbal... I wonder if, if the inline stays in 1.0, it could b made a 2-place inline?
