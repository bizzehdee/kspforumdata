Ive removed all my thermo hinges and swapped them out for servos and have even built some custom controllable landing legs for the horizontal landers. Ive massively reduced the part count by auto strutting and I am close to finishing the landers. I am thinking I might setup a scenario using the mission builder with a few variants so folks wont have to fly the whole mission profile.\n\nI might even post some pictures soon. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)\n\nAnyone else still working on theirs?"},{"CreatedByName":"Frank_G","CreatedById":100000,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-07T20:19:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 59 minutes ago, Majorjim! said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ....\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I might even post some pictures soon. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Anyone else still working on theirs?\n\u003E \n\nReally looking forward to possible pictures ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)\n\nAnd yes, with the DLC i have begun to rebuild my Rhino constellation lander as well.
