I\u0027m new to the forums, and I assume it would be appropriate to ask my question here. So I was thinking for quite a while now to make some new planets using Krags Planet Factory mod. I already have some textures ready and all but I don\u0027t know where to go from there. Is there some kind of tool/mod that will help me make the new planets, or a video that will help me guide through the process?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMike.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tygoo7","CreatedById":57345,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-19T05:18:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/ldQfpCwq88U?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"}]}
