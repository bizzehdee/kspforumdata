With any ship of significant parts count (let\u0027s say 50\u002B) to give you a time warp of 2-4x the game has to reduce the accuracy of its physics calculations to keep up. When you\u0027re under acceleration this gets quite dangerous and can lead to unplanned disassemblies of craft. Not always obvious with rockets since they won\u0027t let you, but planes are allowed to timewarp while flying and what seems stable at 1x may shake and shudder and flap at 2-3x and fall apart at 4x. The problem is vastly worse in low atmosphere, and I \u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E I remember the legendary Scott Manly mentioning that the inverse square law applies to gravity. This would mean that gravity is stronger the nearer the surface of the planet you are, meaning inaccurate physics is increasingly dangerous as you get lower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever in reality on a decent PC...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MartGonzo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MartGonzo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis mod allows you to set Time controls for altitude\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/69363-0-25-Time-Control-9-23-14-v13-2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/69363-0-25-Time-Control-9-23-14-v13-2\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...is a good shout. On a world without atmosphere, I have no problems dropping at 10x down to 1-2km. This mod also features \u0027hyper warp\u0027 where you can allow the game to run as fast as it can, without sacrificing physics accuracy - if your PC can keep up. If it can\u0027t, it\u0027ll slow down time until it can safely handle the physics. This is really nice for getting your re-entry pod back home, without having the chute decide to tear off and disappear at the moment of deployment because you got impatient and warped \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
