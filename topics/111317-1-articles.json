On the missing kerbals page I clicked the x by their names, not knowing what that would do. I didn\u0027t click it for the other kerbals that were lost, and eventually they came back, but Jeb and Val have been missing for a very long time and I think I basically said that I don\u0027t want those Kerbals to come back.
