How to edit persistance file?","CreatedByName":"airelibre","CreatedById":107713,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T23:11:32Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"airelibre","CreatedById":107713,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T23:11:32Z","Content":"I think I killed Jeb and Val for good. On the missing kerbals page I clicked the x by their names, not knowing what that would do. I didn\u0027t click it for the other kerbals that were lost, and eventually they came back, but Jeb and Val have been missing for a very long time and I think I basically said that I don\u0027t want those Kerbals to come back. Although, I would have thought that the main 4 kerbals would always come back sooner or later on normal difficulty mode in career...\n\nAnyway, I looked at the persistance file, but it doesn\u0027t seem as simple as changing \u0022Dead\u0022 to \u0022available\u0022, because they also have flight records and their last flight obviously says killed. I don\u0027t want to change anything unless I can be sure that I\u0027m changing everything I need to and won\u0027t be damaging the save file.\n\nThanks!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-01T18:47:02Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2015 06:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by airelibre**"},{"CreatedByName":"TheMoonRover","CreatedById":136199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T23:15:34Z","Content":"If you wait long enough, they will respawn without you having to do anything, assuming you have the \u0022Missing Kerbals Respawn\u0022 (or something like that) option checked in difficulty settings.

You need to add 2 lines to your last flight. Delete the line that says \u0022died\u0022 then look at a previous flight. The last two lines should say something like \u0022landed Kerbin\u0022 and \u0022recovered Kerbin\u0022.
