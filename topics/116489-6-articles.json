Ended up landing on the desert on the continent before KSA. Good craft has no need for airbrakes at all. I should have used a normal decent this craft was very draggy after it was emptied. It doesn\u0027t need air brakes you are correct. Lack of solar panels does make it challenging. I turned off reaction wheels until I got to space and even then it was a challenge to dock before running out of electric. I docked with 7.5 electric left.
