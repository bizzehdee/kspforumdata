I have only played the \u0022career\u0022 path, and never seem to get very far. Then a new update is introduced, and I start to play again. I\u0027m simply loving the 1.0.4 version. To be honest I was getting a little ticked at first with how much more difficult getting a craft into orbit was, but after reading a few posts, watching a YouTube vid, I quickly realized that VS. 1.0 introduced/implemented the new aerodynamics/drag/thermo physics,(which is cool as heck!). However, I\u0027m simply wondering why the LV-N has become so, well, useless as far as I can tell? I\u0027m at the point in my \u0022career\u0022 that my next step is to get to Duna, but the LV-N is no longer the go-to engine for inter-planetary jumps, what is going to be the best engine to get me there?"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T19:48:54Z","Content":"Welcome to the KSP forums Mango2015 ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThe LV-N is still the workhorse of choice for large craft and orbital operations, it\u0027s just no real use as a lander engine anywhere there\u0027s an atmosphere now, also as it runs on straight liquid fuel you can ditch that oxidizer or use the aircraft LF tanks, that will give you the long legs you\u0027re used to from the nuclear engine.\n\nIt\u0027s definitely a good choice for the trip to Duna ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mango2015","CreatedById":147922,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T19:53:15Z","Content":"Ty for the welcome, and the response.

KSP 1.0 definitely changed the way things get launched, but a lot of those videos are still good for concepts.
