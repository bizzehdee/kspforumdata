The old water was, as has been mentioned, kind of weird looking and also SOLID, but it had a kind of nice textured shininess to it whereas the current water is completely flat, with no sense of depth or wave action, let alone any kind of reflection.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScatterer I think goes too far in the other direction: it\u0027s super-realistic looking and looks great in screenshots, but comes with a substantial performance hit that not all of us have hardware to handle. (Personally I can run the game with Scatterer water but the FPS hit isn\u0027t worth it.) What I\u0027d like to see in vanilla KSP is a middle ground--something with a little more depth, nicer animated wave action, and especially some reflectivity, but not so detailed as to be a huge FPS hog.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-25T14:01:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am all for better water textures, but what was in 0.7 isnt exactly what id call high qualtity either.\u00A0 What is implemented needs to have some reasonable levels of reflection and it CANNOT under any circumstances have major tiling issues like the current water (and over half the planet textures) have where you can see repeating textures everywhere.\u00A0 The easiest fix for the latter is to stretch the texture out, yeah itll make it look a bit uglier up close, but until the textures are higher res, id rather have slightly lower visual quality up close then have to see that bleh tiled crap that is all over the place, and especially prevalent in the water (laythe;s ocean is byfar the worst offender that ive been to recently).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, i think im not the only one saying this, but KSP despretely needs a visual overhaul.\u00A0 Unity is not an excuse to have terribad textures and planet surfaces as there are plenty of other unity games that look stellar and no worse then other game engines can do.\u00A0 Im not saying every single aspect of KSP needs retexturing, but planets, oceans, the skybox, and some of the uglier leftover parts from early game versions (the parts im actually going to retex myself and make a mod if \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/66485-squad/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002266485\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/66485-squad/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@SQUAD\u003C/a\u003E doesnt do anything about it in the next few releases as im just fed up with the utter lack of consistency between different rocket parts and to an extent the newer porkjet parts and the older rocket/misc parts).\u00A0 Frankly the best thing that can be done right now is to pull the planet texture assets out of those sharedassets.assets files (cant exactly edit them since no assets editor is compatible with current version of unity, used to be able though back in 1.0.5 and earlier) and let us alter/use whatever textures we desire for anything in the game without using mods like kopernicus which creates major lag problems and id rather not run just to replace a few stock textures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll things said, i doubt that anything is going to happen, as they had years to improve the visuals in the game and nothing whatsover was done in this regard.\u00A0 We still have broken planets (seams that cause your crafts to explode if you drive over/into them) with subpar textures, a very large subset of the stock parts are still using textures/models from like 5 years back, and nothing has been done in terms of atmospheric effects liek clouds/decent scattering.\u00A0 Now the last point isnt that big a deal, but we could at least get a texture overhaul of the game with a few touchups to the particle system and i dont think it would be that insanely difficult to do nor excessively time consuming, and the end result will be a game that is great looking and not reliant upon extremely laggy or glitchy mods.\u00A0 All i can do is hope, because running all the mods to replace planet textures (alongside eve for atmo effects) adds too much lag for me to have 1000 part count warship battles without tearing my skin off in frustration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
