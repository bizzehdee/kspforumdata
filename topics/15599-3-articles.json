But basically you want to keep some things in mind. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. For the \u003Cstrong\u003Esimplest\u003C/strong\u003E landing possible, cancel all of your horizontal velocity while still in orbit. You want to retroburn until your retrograde marker is centered in the blue half of the Attitude indicator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Once you\u0027re falling straight down, orient your ship vertically. Lower your gear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The slower you\u0027re moving vertically, the more apparent will be any horizontal velocity you\u0027ve acquired. 5 m/sec of horizontal velocity scarcely shows when you\u0027re falling at 50 m/sec (it\u0027s 1/10th as much), but is quite evident when you\u0027re trying to hover. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Deal with the horizontal velocity you can see, periodically, as you slow down. This way you don\u0027t have to cancel the leftovers all at once, during the tricky part at touchdown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. To move the marker back to vertical, tilt your ship in the direction of the marker. That is, move the --V-- on the Attitude Indicator along the line from the blue vertical dot on the ball, to the marker position. Doesn\u0027t have to be all the way, even a few degrees is fine, as this thrust vector will slowly counter your horizontal velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. If you\u0027ve got ASAS turned on with your ship perfectly vertical, you can still pitch and bank the craft a couple of degrees, and it\u0027ll snap back when you release the keys. This can be very useful when making slow or minor adjustments. Tilt in the direction of the displaced marker and it\u0027ll slowly come back to center. Release when done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope that helps somewhat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS a more Apollo-style arcing descent works the same way, only you are slowly reducing your horizontal velocity along with the vertical, until a point a couple of kilometers before touchdown where you go purely vertical.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-10-01T14:38:06Z\u0022 title=\u002210/01/2012 02:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 1, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by pebble_garden\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pebble_garden","CreatedById":30150,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-02T03:29:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, I\u0027d like your feedback on this proof-of-concept video.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve made a minute\u0027s worth of a voiced tutorial video concerning the Attitude Indicator.

I know the sim is still alpha, so I\u0027m being patient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was able, last night, to relocate a single detachment ring to the stage above it. So I\u0027d fire the detachment ring and the next engine was ready for throttle up. I tried to make it so I had three SRBs, three detachment pylons, and then a large gimballed thruster all in the same trigger stage. I wasn\u0027t able to do this. With all three pylons selected, I couldn\u0027t drag them to the stage above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe I\u0027ll shoot some \u0022let\u0027s play\u0022 vids this weekend and try to upload them so others can see what I\u0027m trying to do and explain why it doesn\u0027t work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, thanks for the awesome videos for getting started. I was able to get my munitar in orbit last night. Unfortunately, I was orbiting Kerbal north/south.

So if you have three SRBs, you have an icon with an SRB and the number \u00273\u0027. When you click that, it expands. Grab the top SRB icon of the three, move it into the right stage, and the other two should follow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, Pebble already explained that...
