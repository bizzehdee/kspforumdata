It would work very similarly to the \u0022Fairing Staged\u0022\u00A0\u0022Decoupler: Enable Staging\u0022 and \u0022HS Jettison Staged\u0022 toggles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would allow for much more nuanced launch sequences. For example, an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E with a KAL module on it. When the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E runs dry, staging decouples the booster and activates the KAL. After the booster is clear of the main rocket, KAL deploys its parachutes to bring it down safely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr\u00A0a capsule could have a KAL module on it which deploys drogue chutes, waits 5 seconds, deploys main chutes, waits 2 seconds, then cuts the drogue chutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe possibilities here are pretty much limitless. And it\u0027s such a simple addition that I was actually surprised that it wasn\u0027t already in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, why doesn\u0027t every part have the ability to enable and disable staging?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-05T17:39:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like a sort of kOS-lite?
