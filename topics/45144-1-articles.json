If I understand the physics of it right, atmosphere size is proportional to the celestial\u0027s mass. Kerbin\u0027s mass is just a bit smaller than that of the Earth, so the atmosphere have to be similar, hasn\u0027t it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m looking forward for your opinions on the subject.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Demobot","CreatedById":77729,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-06T21:32:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s my understanding that Kerbin has substantially less mass than Earth. If the KSP Wiki is accurate, Kerbin has a mass of ~5.3*10^22 kg, whereas Earth has a mass of ~6*10^24 kg. This would mean Kerbin\u0027s mass is less than 1% of Earth\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chaos_forge","CreatedById":64960,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-06T21:42:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKerbin has the same surface gravity, but NOT the same mass. It weighs substantially (at least a few orders of magnitude) less than the Earth, but is either made of much denser materials or exists in a universe where the gravitational constant is stronger. Take your pick. Anyways the bottom line is that surface gravity is not a perfect indicator of mass. Jool and Laythe both have the same surface gravity (0.8g).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-06T22:02:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKerbin\u0027s atmosphere is not small at all. It\u0027s actually extremely thick. Kerbin\u0027s radius is 600 km, whereas Earth\u0027s is 6378.1 km. Kerbin is 10.63 times smaller.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP does not model termosphere and ionosphere.
