I\u0027ve sent up two NERVA-powered tugs (with NovaPunch\u0027s 2.5m NERVA), but I\u0027ve only made minor changes to the orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI need about 2 km/s of \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv only to change its inclination, and... a lot of \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv to put it into a circular orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStructural integrity is also a problem. Even with KJR and a lot of KAS struts, the tug wobbles too much to be controlled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been thinking about using three radial engines, each attached with a pair of claws, but I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s worth the trouble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat tug configuration do you recommend for those big rocks?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Random Tank","CreatedById":104325,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-26T10:39:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPull the roid, rather than push it; its much more stable. Also, bringing some claw probes that you can put on the roid that have Reaction wheels or RCS is a good idea, it makes it much easier to turn the big ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, sometimes having SAS on doesn\u0027t help; try to get the rocket lined up with the centre of the roids mass as close as you can, then try pulling it with SAS off, it may stop shake\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-26T10:57:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can pull - have not done that myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me I just de-claw then re-claw in the place i need to push.

Eventually they will feel intuitive. Much less costly to change your apoapsis/periapsis to cross the Mun\u0027s orbit, then wait for an intercept and use a sling-shot to change your inclination. I got a class D from highly inclined into nearly equatorial orbit using only 50 m/s or so delta-V.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
