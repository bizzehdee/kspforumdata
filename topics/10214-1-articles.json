This makes you angry, that makes you happy. As a teenager, all that goes out the window.

That makes you sad, except when it also makes you angry, or sometimes happy. The predictability is gone, and your right, they don\\\u0027t understand you anymore.

The causes of your anger will not stop fluctuating until your well past being in school. your parents are fairly simple to come to understand well, you aren\\\u0027t, this is MUCH easier for you than it is for them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ein a nutshell, thats growing up. most teenagers, myself included, do that the dumb way. \u003Cem\u003Ewhy am i in trouble ....... im right, your wrong ......why am I in more trouble now!?

Diplomacy seemed to have failed, and violence appeared to be setting the better success rate in getting me left in peace.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve been shipped off to live with my dad for a few years cause I angered my mother enough that everything was taken much too far. They divorced when i was three, when I was eleven she married again. So I\\\u0027ve got four sisters, all younger, 3 from a different father than mine, 1 from a different mother.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve dealt with favoritism. younger siblings often get more attention/perks/gifts, etc. And biological siblings are often viewed a bit differently as well, generally in their favor. Its still noticeable in our family to some extent. Its not fair, it does suck, and they are quite honestly somewhat blind to the fact they are even guilty of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei lost count when growing up of how many times I got my oldest sister into trouble for things I did. They knew it was me that did it, but had nothing to support it. they tried forcing me to cave by sitting us both down at the table with a time limit, and a more severe punishment if we exhausted the time. I saw an opportunity. I made it clear to my sister that i was not going to cave. if I had to get in trouble, I could take solace in knowing i wasn\\\u0027t alone. She believed she faced a no-win situation. i made it painfully clear that either way, she was going to be punished, but the more severe punishment came if we reached the end of the timelimit. if she caved, she got a lesser punishment. She caved, more than once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETeenagers can be surprisingly evil. Teens are basically adult minds, without the tempering of patience and society. Unbridled ambitions and passions without the restraint of experience. An opportunity to use someone for their own ends will often be taken without even thinking about it. I never did, and i took advantage whenever I found such opportunities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI battled often, especially once I was larger than my stepdad. I was emboldened by knowing I could take him physically if it ever got that far. Intimidation was no longer a factor in angering my father, i wasn\\\u0027t intimidated anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI entrap people in words, to twist and double back, to imply but not state. It was great fun to confound my siblings, never giving straight answers, often implying something completely different. Almost always misleading yet rarely lying outright. Many a time I implied they could do something they actually couldn\\\u0027t. I never took it so far as to put them in danger, but often far enough to get them into trouble. I was somewhat evil as a teen, took much of my amusement, and comfort in growing up from ensuring i wasn\\\u0027t alone in getting into trouble often.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt made it very difficult for me to be caught out in the wrong for something I said, but it also is a source of anger for many. They understood me to have said this, then I seem to double back on the meaning of the same wording and they think I was lying. Yet the words never changed. They misunderstood, that much seemed obvious to me. Their view is that I have misstated, or failed to clarify, I said one thing and meant another, I lied.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn using an ambiguous statement, its true, I had failed to clarify my statement and be clear about my meaning. its also true that they have misunderstood my intent, and that I was not lying nor changing my story.

If this seems harsh, think - have you ever been stuck in a car for an hour with a girl who eats an easter egg from her bare hands, gets her hands covered in melted chocolate, licks her hands all over, and tries to rub her hands all over everything including your own laptop? She has done this both subconsciously and deliberately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArguments with my sister either end with me hitting her hard enough, her finally seeing reason, or my parents breaking it up. In the case of the last one, it usually doesn\\\u0027t stop her for more than five minutes. The second one happens only rarely. The first one ends with my parents asking me why I hurt her.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the important part. I then explain to my parents calmly exactly what my sister was doing at the time, why violence was justified [AKA \\\u0027I did warn her repeatedly\\\u0027], and then mention that she wouldn\\\u0027t listen when my parents told her to stop whatever she was doing. This immediately brings my parents onto my side against my sister. Threats of \\\u0027you\\\u0027ll go to bed early\\\u0027 from my parents \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E usually resolve the situation, if I remind my sister of that every so often.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m not saying any of this will work for you. But shouting won\\\u0027t help, turning music on will annoy them. Listen to music through headphones if you feel like it, but a lot of parents will resent noise pollution after an argument. If you give them a headache, there will be no middle ground for you to stand on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour example reminds me of the arguments my sister and I have over ice creams. I choose Rolo cornettos, my sister chooses Nobbly Bobbly lollies. My sister proceeds to eat three of the four Rolo cornettos, leaving all the Nobbly Bobblys. The argument I would present to my parents is that if my sister wanted Rolo cornettos, then that is what she should have chosen. \u003Cem\u003EMake it your rival\\\u0027s fault.\u003C/em\u003E I don\\\u0027t want to be left with the Nobbly Bobblys, so I have to make a point.

Problem solved, no need to shout.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn summary - Stay calm, resort to violence only to bring an end to an argument, ensure you have just cause for said violence [drink theft is annoying but not in this case valid - however, my sister\\\u0027s personal hygiene failure \u003Cem\u003Ewould be\u003C/em\u003E], and if it was your sister\\\u0027s fault, make sure you have something to say that will persuade your parents of that fact.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ydoow","CreatedById":10165,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-07T01:46:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sordid\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sordid\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have that the wrong way around, I\\\u0027m afraid.
