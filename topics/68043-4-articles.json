Mesh is much easier to calculate by the engine than rendering its surface with multiple layered maps. Remember the old VAB? And how fast the game was back then? It had (probably) hundreds of thousands of polygons due to boolean modelling and other methods not ideal for poly efficiency.

There are 2 parts that I know of that bring my machine (iMac 2.8GHz i7, 4GB RAM, 512MB ATI Radeon, OpenGL 2): 1) the IACBMs from FusTek Expansion, and 2) the super-ultra-large solar panel in Near Future. I think the Balka solar panels from KOSMOS are bad for me as well, but it\u0027s been a while since I\u0027ve used those so I don\u0027t remember. I think those examples are just extremely detailed models and/or textures. Other than that, the only limitation I have is pure part count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can do about 200-250 parts on launch and still be ok. Might be able to push higher since I\u0027ve made some tweaks. My stations I try and keep below 150 to avoid lag. But, in interplanetary space (or high enough orbit) I probably could do 300\u002B parts quite readily. Processor speed is the bottleneck, as that does all the physics calcs. 64-bit would help that (would help RAM usage more, until Unity can actually dump textures when it doesn\u0027t need them), but it still would probably be the bottleneck. Graphics in KSP is something you can actually \u0022waste\u0022 cycles on generally anyway, so a few polys aren\u0027t going to hurt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only downside to these parts is the fact that you\u0027ll have 9 minimum for the octo. Not great, but if you want to swap any out then you need it. And that\u0027s the best thing about these parts. Strap some octos on a station, and you\u0027ll just need to replace the wedges when the O2 runs out.
