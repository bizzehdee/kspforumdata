In there, set the texture delta to the deformity of your heightmap. After that, go back out into the planet\u0027s ScaledVersion node, and click Rebuild ScaledSpace Textures. The game will update the planet automatically, but the normal map/height/color maps are saved in the Kittopia Folder in your GameData.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-10-28T13:16:05Z\u0022 title=\u002210/28/2020 01:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 28, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by DunaManiac\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jeb_da_kerbal","CreatedById":207811,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-28T13:57:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
