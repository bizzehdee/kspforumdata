The last time I was able to grab a nearby connector which was attached to a stored magnet on the side of the ship just above the ground. My kerbal recovered and stood up while the magnet fell underground and exploded. Thus, it would appear that all of these issues are related to things falling underground to some extent.

During testing my kerbal again fell down. This seems to happen when brushing against another object, each time for me it was a KAS object. The last time I was able to grab a nearby connector which was attached to a stored magnet on the side of the ship just above the ground. My kerbal recovered and stood up while the magnet fell underground and exploded. Thus, it would appear that all of these issues are related to things falling underground to some extent. This has only been an issue since installing KAS4.
