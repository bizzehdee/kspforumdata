My general sense is that by doing a few gravity assist maneuvers near the inner moons it should be possible to perform a Jool system capture relatively cheaply ... but I don\u0027t know the specifics, or how this would look in practice. What\u0027s a reasonable delta V to budget for arrival in the Jool system anyway? 2000 m/s? 500? I honestly have no idea.\n\nI\u0027m currently working on my first attempt at the Jool 5 challenge and I\u0027m pretty happy with the hardware I\u0027ve designed, but the weak link is my own piloting and navigation skill (or lack thereof). Any information about how to efficiently enter the Jool system, as well as how to efficiently transfer between moons, would be very much appreciated. I\u0027ve seen people mention moon-to-moon transfers for like 50 m/s dV, and I don\u0027t really understand how that\u0027s possible when you\u0027re going all the way to the surface of each moon and back. Basically I\u0027d hate to fail at the Jool 5 challenge just because I don\u0027t know how to steer my own damn ship, and I\u0027m looking for anything which will help me navigate the Jool system intelligently."},{"CreatedByName":"Jakalth","CreatedById":136495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-07T04:41:32Z","Content":"Tylo, Lathe, Vall. Any of those three moons can give your ship nice gravity break to slow you down just enough to be captured, if you pass by them in just the right way. This all depends on your speed and how you enter the system. I basically just guessed at my entry and then burned for the rest, but I had the delta-V to throw around. And a craft that handled like a bus, with a broken steering wheel and three flat tires.(too many parts, too big, too impatient).\n\nUsing one of the moons, if you can find the right fly by, can get you captured into the system for only the cost of altering your initial encounter with the Jool system. After that, you\u0027ll still need to fiddle your way into a tighter orbit and/or get yourself captured with the Moon of your choice. Your initial orbit will most likely be a large one unless you can find the right spot to get multiple gravity breaks from more then one moon.\n\nOtherwise, aerobreaking on Lathe is a good option. Jool can slow you down faster but is a much less forgiving aerobreak partner. Or even doing a combo of aerobreaking on Lathe and then a gravity capture off a second moon."},{"CreatedByName":"kamekolossus","CreatedById":140914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-07T05:18:13Z","Content":"Is Near Future Spacecraft permitted?

This will make the capture burn cheaper due to the [oberth effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect)\n\nA general tip is to not drag your entire mother ship down to low orbits of the big moons leave the big ship in high eliptic orbit and let your lander go to low orbit by itself, or use a tug. On Tylo it cost ~800 dv to get from high to low orbit, and as mush again to get back.\n\nYou should take a look at the mission reports linked in the first post of this thread. Most of them are full of examples of how to do this.\n\nAnd get [Precise Node](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/47863-1-0-2-Precise-Node-1-1-3-Precisely-edit-your-maneuver-nodes).
