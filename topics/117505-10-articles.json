I have all the craft built, the co-ordinates for everything, a route mapped out and an estimated completion time. But it all needs testing and polishing. The worst things are the Duna Ascent Vehicle and the Duna Descent vehicle. The best things are the Kerbin Launch Vehicles, the Rover, the base and the Hermes. I need to finish the trailer and a \u0027How to play/Plot\u0027 document.\n\nReally if you want to help, pick something that interests you, download what is there, read through the forum (and the book if you have it) test it, and make it better.\n\nCheers, SM."}]}
