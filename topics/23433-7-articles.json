And no Kerbin. And we walked 10 miles uphill in the snow bare foot to launch our half a rocket, and we were damn proud when all it did was flop to the side because it was made of noodles and old twizzlers.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHalf an engine? Why, you were lucky to have half an engine! Back in my days in -53.18, we didn\u0027t even have that. Every time we wanted to launch a rocket, we\u0027d all have to walk 15 miles through volcanic ashes to get out on the launch pad and push! And of course the rocket disintegrated at once, because our rockets were made of damp newspapers and pine needles. But we were happy then. It was a simpler time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
