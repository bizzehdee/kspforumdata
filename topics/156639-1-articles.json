This\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Ewouldn\u0027t\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Einclude things like hyperdrives, etc. It\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Ewould\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Ehowever include things such as the EM drive, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe futuristic technology would be included on 2 nodes at the very end of the tech true. There would be an \u0027Advanced Propulsion\u0027 and an \u0027Advanced Science\u0027\u00A0node. Bother would cost twice as much as the current farthest research nodes in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAdvanced Propulsion\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe advanced propulsion node (or AP for short) would include an EM Drive, Solar sail,\u00A0and a Water-based Engine. As a sidenote, water would be abundantly available from mining on planets and moons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEM Drive: This would work similarly to an ion engine like the ones currently ingame. However, it would take up far more energy, take up no other resources besides ElectricCharge, and would have very low thrust, though still more than ion engines. It\u0027s cost and effect would be intended for late game missions, such as very long term bases, or even just a new challenge for end-game players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSolar Sail: The solar sail would travel\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eextremely\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eslow, take up a huge amount of space, but would require no propellants as long as it is exposed to sunlight and not being blocked by anything. An added bonus of them is that they would double as efficient\u00A0solar panels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWater-based engine: This would use water as a fuel, however, it would be much less effective, though slightly cheaper than regular LiquidFuel. The upside, though is that this would be very abundant in space, so while being a bad option for short-term missions, it would be great for long term missions where you have a limited amount of liquidfuel to use. The ice drill to mine for water is available in the advanced science node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAdvanced Science\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe advanced science node (or AS for short) would include a Supercapacitor, An ice drill, Cosmic Ray Sensor, and an infrared telescope.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSupercapacitor: The supercapacitor would be a relatively small but extremely effective electricity storage made with graphene. It could be used to store lots of electriccharge in a smaller area, and be especially useful when paired with the EM Drive. The price however would be quite repetitive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIce Drill: The ice drill would specifically mine for water on planets or moons. Asteroids would have a varying amount, but generally would be quite rich in water. Different planets would have different amounts. Kerbin would have a lot, but with little purpose to mine it there, and Mun would have relatively little. Minmus would be extremely rich in water, Eve would have hardly any, Moho would only have traces at the poles, and Gilly would have a little bit, but not anything too noteworthy. Duna would have very little, Dres would be quite abundant in water, Jool would have none (obviously), and Eeloo would be extremely rich in ice, richer than any other body in the game. Back to Jool\u0027s moons, Laythe would have about as much as Kerbin for you to mine, although there still would not be much purpose due to the atmosphere. Vall would have a lot too, Tylo would be pretty scarce in ice, and finally, Bop and Pol would have relatively low amounts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCosmic Ray Sensor: This would simply be another science instrument. It would only be usable when far above a planet or moon or near Kerbol, but be most effective when you are either far above Kerbol, or far above a planet or moon. Regardless though, the science messages that they give would imply that they ignore the body they are around and just look. They would either be considered \u0022High above a planet\u0022 or \u0022High above the Sun\u0022, meaning that the science value would not really change from planet to planet. Therefore, it would be a very effective instrument, but only useable a few times before becoming obsolete.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInfrared Telescope: This would have similar required conditions as the Cosmic Ray Sensor, and also look only into deep space. The big difference however, is that this would only be usable from around the Sun and no where else. If placed near the sun, the science logs would hint that the telescope generates an infrared image of the sun, or if far away from the sun, uses infrared light to map the universe. Both would deliver lots of science, but have a limited number of uses. These telescope would be large and very heavy, but each one you put into space would be able to collect it\u0027s own science, although the science value from these would slowly decrease after every telescope that you use. I.e the first telescope you put in would collect 500 science, the next one would collect 90% of that, and the one after that would collect 90% of the second telescope, and so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-18T16:58:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEM Drive?

inside the magnetic field of a planet (which we can say \u0022blocks\u0022 most of those particles).\u00A0 This would require giving planets a single new value for \u0022magnetic field radius\u0022 if

on\u0022 a fusion reactor should require a fairly large amount of power over a few seconds, before it starts producing energy.\u00A0 So, any spacecraft that uses them needs to start them at launch and

reason they DO make sense.\u00A0 As a means of heat dissipation.\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003EHeat Radiation Wings\u003C/strong\u003E are a very reasonable thing to have in a vacuum where you need to get rid of excess heat produced by pretty much ANY futuristic or sci-fi power source, including fusion reactors.\u00A0 You can\u0027t just dissipate it into air via some vents or something because, yeah, no air.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt even makes sense for these radiator wings to retain wing-like functions too, on any vessel that is expected to ever enter an atmosphere.\u00A0 You already have a wing, may as well make some effort to have it function like one if need be.\u00A0 Even in sci-fi settings where energy sources and propulsion of various types (even without worrying about FTL stuff like warp or hyperspace) result in ridiculously potential high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E values, wings could be useful when in atmosphere if something went wrong.\u00A0 Instead of falling to the ground, you would glide/fall with style, and could potentially survive the crash or have more time to get your power/propulsion back online.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWings provide a large surface area to radiate heat from.\u00A0 They also satisfy our desire for symmetry, and can perform other functions (such as acting
