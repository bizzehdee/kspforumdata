There should be enough rocket parts left over to convert the empty boxes into batteries, but it says I need more even though I clearly have enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo worries, I\u0027m putting a spreadsheet together so I can play with the different templates, masses, and RocketPart costs with 0 to 5 star discount. Thanks for the bug report too. The actual cost is 50 RocketParts for the Buckboard, looks like there\u0027s an error in the message.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Der Kosmos","CreatedById":7632,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T23:18:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESometimes it says 11 other times it says 15 broken either way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, will the inflatable science lab count as a research lab when it comes to filling contracts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T23:51:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Der Kosmos\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Der Kosmos\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESometimes it says 11 other times it says 15 broken either way.\u003Cp\u003EAlso, will the inflatable science lab count as a research lab when it comes to filling contracts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot no more it ain\u0027t, fixed that issue. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E For the science lab, I don\u0027t know.

This mod gives you the buildings you need in order to do that without having to carry a massive amount of parts...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 2) If you have issues with weights of any of the structures, again, why not build them on site? Using the Workshop from the Ponderosa or the Clockworks from the Hacienda, you can build out your entire base by simply harvesting the materials you need and building everything there without having to carry very much at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe costs to convert the buildings are fairly reasonable, especially as you start gaining experience with your engineers/scientists and the ability to switch functionality of any part you want is a HUGE advantage to have in the field and reasonably should cost a fair amount in order to utilize. I\u0027ve been playing with this mod since before Angel added in the costs to swap the buildings and not once have I encountered an issue where I was looking at the costs and wondering why they were so high. This also applies to the weights of the structures since I no longer carry them with me and instead build on site.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
