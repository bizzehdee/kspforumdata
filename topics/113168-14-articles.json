Yes, PS4 is a hugely important thing for KSP, whether or not it is of interest to any of us individually, it\u0027s not to me, I don\u0027t have, and will very likely never have a console, but I understand the significance of it.\n\nI felt let down by there being no actual Dev notes of any sort. I knew there likely wouldn\u0027t be much news on 1.0.3, but a few words along the lines of \u0022Only back in the office yesterday so nothing much to report, 1.0.3 progressing well please bear with us while we get it as good as we can\u0022 would have been nice, and may well have avoided a lot of the anger.\n\nWill PS4 have an impact on normal development? It must have some impact, yes of course some Dev time will be needed to communicate, check and approve etc, but it may also help in other areas and speed some things up as they find solutions to some problems. So I don\u0027t think it will be a major issue overall.\n\nI really don\u0027t get all the outright hostility towards squad on this thread, in particular in regard to how much money they have made and how they should spend it. It\u0027s their business and they should run it as they see fit. \n\nWhilst adding more devs sounds like a good plan it may not be the best way for them to work (too many cooks spoil the broth, and all that), they know their business better than any of us, it\u0027s their choice.\n\nI do not agree with how they do things all the time, but being hostile is counter productive."},{"CreatedByName":"Accelerando","CreatedById":543,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T18:37:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s sheer speculation, we have no idea what money Squad has not spent or on what. Perhaps we are starting to see the benefits of more development money right now, with the collaboration (hiring?) of FT for the PS4 port. Which, Maxmaps has said has already paid off with their Unity 5 help.\n\u003E Most of the two years for resources was spent working on other features... and [deciding what the resource system *should be*](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/61712-How-important-is-a-resource-system-to-you?p=843999#post843999). Actual implementation was handled in much less time, by RoverDude, who crafted a variation of Karbonite. Career mode got most of the focus in recent updates, with the addition (v.90) and then expansion (v1.0) of Arsonide\u0027s Fine Print contract extensions.\n\nKarbonite being essentially a variation of Kethane, and Resources being Karbonite stripped down to the bare minimum. This is exactly what I mean; this very model was present and popular two years ago. So it took two years to come to the conclusion that what the community wanted was stripped down Kethane, one way or another? I am somehow skeptical.\n\nAs for Flying Tiger, I will once again question the \u0022help\u0022-fulness of a company that makes such gems as [Hookups Wallpaper](http://www.ftmobile.com/Products/Hookups-Wallpaper.aspx). (And yes, I will always harp on this. I will never not harp on this. For this is a Bad Thing.)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The Aero overhaul is part of the simulation. It could have been released without new spaceplane parts. I think its awesome that we *did* get the new parts, and the bigger wings and landing gears. (Only Squad could say if one was waiting on the other.) Squad has always straddled a line between simulation and gameplay; FAR in my view, was always going to be \u0022*too FAR*\u0022 for Squad\u0027s taste.\n\nI completely agree that it could have been released without the new spaceplane parts, but that\u0027s not what I mean. From my memory, it was SQUAD themselves who said that because of spaceplane parts that the aero overhaul was being held up, at least back when Chad was a part of the team. I\u0027ll have to dig that up, sorry. However, to address your other point: NEAR was launched nearly a year ago. Ferram has consistently shown that he is a capable coder who is well up to the task of making aerodynamics simulations for KSP. My point being that KSP could have had better aero two years ago - which would already have been months after the initial release of FAR.\n\nThere\u0027s no need for \u0022lines\u0022 between simulation and gameplay, but that\u0027s a whole other topic and I\u0027ve said what I\u0027ll say with regards to that here. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E let go? More speculation. We only know what some have chosen to share. The last two to announce that they are leaving Squad did so in the Devnotes, suggesting they left on good terms.\n\nGood terms or otherwise, the point is that they left, and during their time the game didn\u0027t garner much benefit to its gameplay from most of them. (Which is not to say that they are not good modders, nor developers.) I appreciate that the work was done, and I applaud the modders who signed on to take their time, but when all\u0027s said and done the end result has mostly been fetch quests, which is really an extension of \u0022make rocket go place, come back\u0022. That\u0027s not interesting to me and, judging from that thread about resources you linked, not to a lot of other players either.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E While it\u0027s true that the community is full of talent, Squad has in fact tapped that talent from time to time. Witness RoverDude\u0027s work on the resource system, Arsonide\u0027s contracts, and Porkjet\u0027s spaceplane parts.\n\nI have witnessed all of these things and I am left spectacularly underwhelmed, as you see me now.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-17T18:54:06Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2015 06:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Accelerando**"},{"CreatedByName":"TheRag","CreatedById":144674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T18:37:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yeah, it\u0027d be a shame to see the forum riddled with immature, hysterical posts or anything like that. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nSimple enough, let them build their own forum if the integration proves terrible for the forums.

Looks like we may be missing a couple of buttons. Without a doubt, action groups would be ruined. I also think building in the VAB would be quite awkward. Controls-wise, KSPS4 will be lacking.\n\nMods. Mods turn this game from great to amazing. Like another game with a large modding community that was ported to console following an official release... [*cough* *cough*](http://gamunation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/minecraftXCMqB.png) I\u0027ve played Minecraft on Xbox 360.

Porting it over to ps4 in hope of creating buzz is not going to get their attention.\n\nKSP should address the longstanding issues that, today, now, right now, are limiting KSP. Just look at youtube.
