No, but neither is Orbiter KSP. Orbiter doesn\u0027t simulate the design of spacecraft at all, for example. What is simulated, and the quality of that simulation is the trick to balance. The KSP treatment of the business/operations end doesn\u0027t even imitate the appearance of same, IMO.

The current career/tech system is a very poor simulation, and is also\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 very poor gameplay. Making the career more realistic, contrary to people chucking straw men around, would not consist if Squad forcing the players to make spreadsheets, endure boring meetings, and all the work-a-day stuff that happens in any real administrative office. No, realism in simulation would be if the type of missions presented, budgets allowed, etc \u0022made sense\u0022 in the verbal world. The outcome is what matters, not the black box. The orbital mechanics, launch, landing, even craft design remain fundamentally unchanged, regardless of the aero model.

For the game to be fun it doesn\u0027t have to be easy, but it does have to work in a way that the player can understand (consider, for example, the arguments that have been made regarding random part failures). For those things that are intuitive, like bigger engine = more thrust but higher fuel consumption, this is simple. For those things that are not intuitive, like orbital mechanics, the game provides clear and intuitive feedback to the player. Burn the engine in a particular direction and watch the orbit change in the map mode. Adjust the orbit, and watch the encounter markers move around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with aerodynamics is that, for realistic aerodynamics, the behaviour is not intuitive and it is difficult to provide clear feedback. How do you indicate to a player that this loss of control was caused by burning fuel from the front tanks before the rear tanks, that loss of control was caused by the transition from subsonic (CoL forward) to supersonic (CoL further back) and the other one because the higher aspect ratio wings having a lower stall angle of attack than lower aspect ratio wings?

People have an expectation of what a plane should look like based on real world aircraft they have seen. On the whole these expectations are incomplete or down right wrong. In producing an improved stock aerodynamics model, the developers therefore face a choice. They can either make an aerodynamics model that matches players false expectations, so that players can build intuitively and iteratively, or they can make a realistic aerodynamics model that requires the players to un-learn their false expectations and come to terms with the reality. The problem with the second approach is one of how to guide players through this process in a way that is actually fun or at least intuitive.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-15T18:56:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Parkaboy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Parkaboy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHowever, since you are the only judge in the debate of what is opinion and what is fact, things get a little skewed.

Many of each group have likely considered each option and chosen the one they most prefer, making all universal plans inconvenience some players. The question therefore is utilitarian: \u0022What stock aerodynamic system would create the greatest good for the greatest many?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom a recent forum poll we can infer that almost all players would prefer such a realistic aerodynamic system as FAR--even if it broke backward compatibility. I argue that we should do their will for not only their sake but that of future KSP players, who would know only realistic aerodynamics. These aerodynamics and their implications would need only such brief explanation as in KSP\u0027s v0.13 tutorial; e.g., \u0022Turning a swiftly-climbing rocket will expose to the air its side, which will turn the rocket like a rudder turns a boat.\u0022 when the player first achieves high dynamic pressure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlayers wanting simple, intuitive aerodynamics should consider that realistic ones usually are simple and intuitive. Sleek things slip through the air whereas fat things drag like boulders; payload fairings and heat shields protect delicate payloads; cargo bays and inline parts let air smoothly pass. The only complex or counterintuitive mechanics I have observed involved exotic flight regimes, which should be strange, or became intuitive once experienced; e.g., in flight, the center of lift tries to follow the center of mass. Realistic aerodynamics, I therefore further argue, are simple and intuitive during normal flight and offer whoever ventures beyond it fascinating challenges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDynamic instability would be among these challenges. It involves putting the center of lift before the center of mass, which the center of lift will try to follow whenever the craft turns, making tiny control inputs very powerful. The challenge is controlling the instability lest the craft should turn uncontrollably--and the challenge is optional! Putting the center of mass before the center of lift tames maneuvering enough for peaceful, steady flight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Duxwing\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-15T21:09:59Z\u0022 title=\u002201/15/2015 09:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Duxwing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-15T19:34:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SAI Peregrinus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SAI Peregrinus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn general the proper way to launch a rocket is to launch straight up, turn about 5 degrees, and turn off SAS.

This touches on something that I\u0027ve been thinking about, too, and that I\u0027ve given severely little thought to in the OP of this thread - that \u003Cstrong\u003Eone of the great appeals of the game\u003C/strong\u003E, and one of the ways in which its potential seems, in my opinion, the \u003Cstrong\u003Emost severely neglected\u003C/strong\u003E, is its \u003Cstrong\u003Epotential to educate\u003C/strong\u003E, and the \u003Cstrong\u003Epotential fun that \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ethat\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E is\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I first started playing in the early, early days of KSP - back in the first releases when it was a free game - I had \u003Cem\u003Eno idea\u003C/em\u003E how orbits were achieved, or that there was anything such as an optimal flight profile that could be achieved by throttling the engines backward or forward; I had no idea that rockets are supposed to fly east to get the greatest speed boost from their planet\u0027s rotation, if counterclockwise; I had no idea that a rocket\u0027s fuel efficiency could be neatly and easily described by a single number, Isp, and that I could use a simple equation to give me a rough idea of their \u0022range\u0022. \u003Cstrong\u003EI had to learn all of this\u003C/strong\u003E, and \u003Cstrong\u003Eit was fun\u003C/strong\u003E, and \u003Cstrong\u003Ethe reason I could do any of that and have any of that fun was because the way rockets behaved and behave now in the game is realistic in some way\u003C/strong\u003E - it wasn\u0027t simply a hard game mechanic, like learning to grapple with Dwarf Fortress\u0027s arcane control system. I actually -learned- something! Why shouldn\u0027t this figure into peoples\u0027 considerations of fun?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut at the same time, and to address your point - as the game grows in complexity, it helps \u003Cem\u003Egreatly\u003C/em\u003E to increase the amount of feedback, the amount of instrumentation, the amount of data and analysis the game gives to the player, in order to help them understand and make sense of what\u0027s going on around them. For example, I remember hearing something from HarvesteR along the lines of \u003Cstrong\u003Erefusing to implement\u003C/strong\u003E a delta-V readout or a set of aerodynamics readouts and instruments because \u0022it\u0027s not fun to know everything about your rocket\u0022; but that is \u003Cstrong\u003Enot true\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003Enot good gameplay\u003C/strong\u003E. It \u003Cstrong\u003Esimply creates an artificial obstruction for players who want to learn the real physics\u003C/strong\u003E, and \u003Cstrong\u003Emakes the game seem more obtuse and arcane\u003C/strong\u003E to players who are unfamiliar with such concepts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT:\u003C/strong\u003E As a further example, take the orbital Map view and all the data that it currently provides. The \u003Cstrong\u003Eorbital map\u003C/strong\u003E provides \u003Cstrong\u003Efairly plentiful information\u003C/strong\u003E on your orbital characteristics, and by doing so, it \u003Cstrong\u003Eallows me to set clear goals for myself\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003Eunderstand whether or not my maneuvers have succeeded\u003C/strong\u003E - and by looking at the \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0V left, at the inclination and dimensions of my orbit with regards to the planet, the ecliptic, other orbits, and suchlike, \u003Cstrong\u003EI can understand \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ewhy they did or didn\u0027t succeed\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E. If the game didn\u0027t have these readouts, it would not be more fun - it would be infinitely more frustrating. The fact is, I need to know this data anyway if I am going to advance my understanding of the gameplay; you can\u0027t just thrust randomly in space and expect to \u0022hit\u0022 Duna without knowledge of phase angles, much less knowledge of the dimensions of your very \u003Cem\u003Eorbit\u003C/em\u003E. Likewise, I think that providing better, clearer, and more insightful instrumentation and data for all other aspects of the game - \u003Cstrong\u003Esome kind of ruler\u003C/strong\u003E in the vehicle assembly building and spaceplane hanger would be muchly welcomed, for instance - will open up \u003Cem\u003Efar more\u003C/em\u003E opportunities for education and \u003Cstrong\u003Ecreativity\u003C/strong\u003E than denying them to players. It is \u003Cem\u003Einfinitely more enlightening\u003C/em\u003E to be able to see your orbit grow and shrink, and to be able to watch the numbers go up and down for its periapsis, phase angle, and so on, \u003Cstrong\u003Eat the same time\u003C/strong\u003E, than to simply watch a blue curve move around a planet, or even worse to have no orbital display at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it\u0027s not as if people don\u0027t run out of fuel even though they know their rocket\u0027s delta-V, or crash aircraft even though they have all the readouts anyway - people run out fuel all the time in cars IRL that don\u0027t deplete their supply in such unintuitive ways, and people crash test aircraft in real life even though they have plenty of computer data. Knowing and being able to keep track of more or less how much range you can expect out of a car or the flight characteristics of an aircraft does not make driving a car or flying a plane less fun! But not being able to know without running the calculations yourself or installing a mod does make it more frustrating for people who want to be able to learn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt certainly helped me a lot when I started using MechJeb in .17 and I could begin turning to its readouts to learn about phase angles and watch my delta-V fall. So yes - it\u0027s definitely very helpful, very educational, and \u003Cem\u003Efun\u003C/em\u003E to play the game with realistic elements for the purposes of \u003Cem\u003Elearning\u003C/em\u003E, and it definitely helps and increases that fun to have bountiful \u003Cem\u003Edata\u003C/em\u003E available on my flights! And if you want a challenge, you can go without the instrumentation - but just because you\u0027ve played it long enough for that to be a challenge doesn\u0027t mean that that\u0027s the only challenge there is, or that\u0027s worth undertaking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll reiterate this in the OP, because it\u0027s absolutely exactly something I want to address, but completely forgot to.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-15T22:10:23Z\u0022 title=\u002201/15/2015 10:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Accelerando\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdding in an example\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"[email\u0026#160;protected]","CreatedById":80529,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-15T20:46:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFun vs Realism is a false dichotomy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game is fun in part because of its semi-realistic physics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlapping things together and seeing how they work in a realistic environment is fun.

Would you want to cope with having to use complex weather forecasts to plan launches and landings, and having to land your already barely stable airframe with unstable crosswinds and near ground turbulence by using the not so realistic \u0022pushing asdqwe keys\u0022 control method? How would you eyeball how to enter the atmosphere in order to get where you want based on what is supposedly going on in the upper atmosphere? Miss a launch window due to bad weather and wait a few years for the next opportunity?

OP is arguing nothing of the sort. One, the thread is about why people have the (entirely unsubstantiated) idea that somehow which algorithm is used to calculate drag---that no one can see---is assumed to \u0022reduce fun\u0022 if it is arbitrarily choice A over choice B. Two, OP is right, it\u0027s a false dichotomy in general (otherwise a flight sim with no gravity would always be more fun than one with gravity, for example).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, Scramble, please do not put words in my mouth. I never said anything about having to explicitly deal with every fine minor detail of rocket construction and launch - I have even, multiple times, explicitly supported the \u0022armchair commander\u0022 model of flight control and voiced my dissent against simply requiring the player to push every possible button at every second of the mission, give an alternative, and explain why this is neither un-fun nor unrealistic. Even in real life, not every person in mission control has to worry about every other aspect of a rocket\u0027s systems or its flight plan in order to be able to do their part, operate the controls, and make it work. Everyone splits off some work somewhere; that\u0027s true of any job. There\u0027s nothing fundamentally incompatible between making a game realistic and choosing the elements of realism you want to include and in what way to implement them that they\u0027ll be fun. Since I don\u0027t seem to have gotten through, I\u0027ll point out the places where I tried to clarify my opinions, for you:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Accelerando\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Accelerando\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI remember that thing HarvesteR said a while back along the lines of how if you wanted to play a perfectly realistic game, you\u0027d go outside. But how many of us can actually reasonably expect to go out and be able to fly a spaceship tomorrow? Very few if any; much as most FIFA players can\u0027t expect to go outside and start a career in pro football tomorrow, or how most Tycoon players can\u0027t expect to go outside and start growing a business to massive proportions; you get the idea. I think it is neither un-fun nor unrealistic to gloss over certain grating parts of the challenge or leave it up to someone else or a background mechanic to take care of; leaders and executives in real life do this all the time, for one. There\u0027s clearly elements of real life that are fun and people want to do, and ways to present them so as to skip over the parts people don\u0027t want to do.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Accelerando\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Accelerando\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat\u0027s true, and I edited your second post in to account for that, since it lined up very well with what I was saying to John. I personally consider it more than realistic to simply kick back behind an armchair and direct someone or something else to move their arms to push the controls of a faraway vehicle; real pilots do it with drones today. I\u0027ve never heard anyone criticize, for instance, Dwarf Fortress for being unrealistic by not forcing players to manually carry out calculations for moving every pint of blood in every artery of every animal in order to advance the wildlife simulation going on around them; it just happens, as is realistic and as is conducive to gameplay. Such players\u0027 opinions lie in a different arena of realism, I think, rather than being a matter of simply more realism.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, yes - please stop trying to strawman my posts and use slippery-slope fallacies.
