Initially I had it thus - Cockpit, Probe Core, Service Bay, cargo bay etc. So I switched the probe core and the service bay. It took longer for the probe core to explode, but after about half a minute, explode it did. Bugger. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I opened up the heat indicators in Kerbal Engineer to watch for heat build-up, since that\u0027s the usual reason for spontaneous exploding parts, and sure enough, some phantom heating is shooting through the ship, but centered on the Probe Core!
