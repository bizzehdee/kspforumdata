But for your cfg, I always place my node\u0027s manually by editing the cfg and constantly rebooting the program (primitive, but works great after words).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s happening now is that the top node is basically 0,0,0 as seen in your definition. Each 0,0,0 of the first 3 zeros means x,y,z. Try setting the 0 to something higher and 0. Maybe 5. And work your way up or down by editing the cfg file.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
