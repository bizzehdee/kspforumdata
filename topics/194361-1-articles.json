When I rotate the camera the line rotates to match it, when I scroll in or out the line rises and falls. Its something I just cannot stand playing with anymore and Ive tried mod threads, reddit and discords and this is pretty much my last shot in the dark before I uninstall KSP for a while.\u00A0\u00A0So please if anyone knows what this is I beg of you to let me know.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImage of line is highlighted here in red, its faint on minmus\u0027 terrain but is very obvious on the others.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/jvzzgyQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/jvzzgyQ\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLogs here\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/65z0kekc7bpfxka/Player.log?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/65z0kekc7bpfxka/Player.log?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-01T09:35:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u2019t see a line.
