I hit the ground somewhere between 0.3 and 2.7 m/s each time. Recently I tried taking off a couple mods, and don\u0027t know if that might be causing the issue. I would very much appreciate some help, because it\u0027s no fun to play this game when you cannot land any rockets!

I HAD Kerbal Alarm Clock, Mechjeb, and Kerbal Engineer. There is a very real chance that I just uninstalled wrong. Next I\u0027m going to try landing on the Mun with a tripod of engines, and I\u0027m going to try landing a small ship on Kerbin with landing legs. If either of those explode, then\u00A0I will probably just backup my important save files and let Steam uninstall and reinstall KSP to my computer. I\u0027ll post again if my spaceships still explode after that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
