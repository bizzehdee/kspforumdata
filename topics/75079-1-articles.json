The good new is that you can ball-park the values pretty easily. If you have something in orbit, just set up a maneuver node that burns to an apoapsis/periapsis of your target, and then check when that apoapsis occurs by mousing over the AP marker. For instance, I have a space station in LKO at 125 km altitude. To figure out the transfer time to Duna, I just put a node on the dark side of the obit, and increased prograde until the AP laid on top of Duna\u0027s orbit (even tho there wasn\u0027t an encounter there). I just did it in like 5 mins for the \u0022common\u0022 targets, and got the following results for typical ballistic Hohmann transfers:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[table=width: 300, align: Left]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]\u003Cstrong\u003ETarget\u003C/strong\u003E[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]\u003Cstrong\u003EKerbal time\u003C/strong\u003E[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]\u003Cstrong\u003EEarth Days\u003C/strong\u003E[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]Eve[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]209 d[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]52 d[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]Duna[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]314 d[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]79 d[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]Jool[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]2 yr \u002B 287 d[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]282 d[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/table]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EDISCLAIMER:\u003C/em\u003E These are super quick, dirty \u0022back of the envelope\u0022 values.

What does that teach people about building things aerodynamically?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReentry needs to be incorporated (yes I know it is planned). Having spacecraft reenter atmo at 2000 m/s and NO heat up is ridiculously illogical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals are living entities that require food, heat, water, produce waste, and breathe air. Why wouldn\u0027t spacecraft have expendable food, water etc? LS should be part of a rockets payload. As of right now, the ONLY worry anyone has is amount of delta V to get to a planetary body. That\u0027s only step 1 of building a spacecraft...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI honestly don\u0027t care if squad ever incorporates these things into stock kerbal, because I have this great modding community to give me the mods that I want to make kerbal the game I always dreamed of!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m very excited to see what our community comes up with next to improve the kerbal experience!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to keep this thread on track, I \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83333-Difficulty-options?p=1217565#post1217565\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecreated a thread\u003C/a\u003E in the Suggestion forum as a reply.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-17T04:28:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pecan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Pecan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E:-( \u003Cstrong\u003EIn a challenge I just got the transfer completely wrong and ended-up at 310 days\u003C/strong\u003E ^^.

What now if the dV map builds in extra days because it assumes 1 extra orbit. You still have to assume an orbital altitude, so what if it doesn\u0027t match my altitude? Then I have to remove someone else\u0027s fudge factor to add my own. What if I don\u0027t know what the assumed fudge factor is?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps in this instance there could be an extra set of numbers next to a planet/moon. It would include the time to orbit at a given altitude. Now I know what the assumed altitude is and I can decide how many orbits I want to add (my safety margin), instead of someone just burying that information in the base numbers and me digging it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other factor with \u0022how long does it take to get to Jool if everything went perfectly\u0022 doesn\u0027t take into account that I can burn a bit harder to get there faster. Now we get into the other complications we discussed earlier. Am I aerobraking, slingshotting, how much oberth, etc. At some point you need to get out the pencil and start making your own dV budget for your profile. dV charts are just guides to get started. It\u0027s hard to plan a dV chart that suits everyone\u0027s wishes/desires/assumptions/profiles.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
