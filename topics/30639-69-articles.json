I\u0027ll be honest, I haven\u0027t fixed it :S The wing flex is still there. I use KJR so I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s better than what it would be stock though. While testing I tried strutting the wing to the hinge and the hinge to the ship but that created insane spinny kraken forces so I removed them to continue testing flight. I\u0027m going to go back to the strutting idea though and see if I can find a way to strut them without finding those forces. The ornithopter that\u0027s laying around in the spacecraft exchange looks to have struts extending from its hinges to its wings so i think its possible. When I did have them strutted originally there was not much flex and I could ignore it so hopefully that\u0027s the solution. So to answer your question my best guess is nicely placed struts...otherwise I pretend that the turtle is more like a puffin and part bird and flap its wings \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Now that I\u0027m home I was able to test the strut and I found that if I placed a strut from the hinge directly to the wing it was attached to it reduced some of the flex. There is still some but there is noticeably less. Every time I attempt to strut from the hinge to someplace not the wing I start doing barrel rolls so I haven\u0027t figured out any further ways to strengthen the connection.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-11T03:46:34Z\u0022 title=\u002203/11/2014 03:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by How2FoldSoup\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"XyllyX","CreatedById":105335,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-11T00:07:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s mine, It\u0027s not very good though\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71988-ASF-B38AX-Atom-SSTO-%28My-First-Craft-Uploaded%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71988-ASF-B38AX-Atom-SSTO-%28My-First-Craft-Uploaded%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aIcC6Zb.png\u0022 alt=\u0022aIcC6Zb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KIpqp7n.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KIpqp7n.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tNMXDiC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tNMXDiC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewoo\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-11T07:34:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I have a working heavy lifter now....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll stock (ish), no part clipping\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://scontent-b-vie.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc3/t31/q74/s720x720/1781709_10102522555220943_38363739_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221781709_10102522555220943_38363739_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://scontent-b-vie.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/t31/q71/s720x720/1961831_10102522555101183_621013543_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221961831_10102522555101183_621013543_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://scontent-a-vie.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/t31/q71/s720x720/1277967_10102522555340703_937978531_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221277967_10102522555340703_937978531_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst successful test flight put a 54 ton payload into orbit, with over 29 tons of \u0022rocket fuel\u0022 left (ie oxidizer\u002B liquid fuel in a 1.1:0.9 ratio) and nearly 500 units of jet fuel left for landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, by tweaking fuel loadouts of the payload/SSTO, I should get 83.5 tons worth of payloa to LKO, with jet fuel to spare for the landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIssues: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Not completely stock: the radial intakes are modded to produce a resource for electric fans, unused on this design, and those 2ndary intakes are closed the whole flight\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 80 unit jet fuel adaptors have been modded to have a lower drag coefficient - .15 instead of .2 -\u0026gt;largely irrelevant in this design, given their low weight reletive to the payload.

The issue is with the small scale of KSP that works much worse with spaceplanes than with rockets. While KSP rockets behave roughly in the same way as real rockets, spaceplanes feel more like stuff from not-so-realistic science fiction.
