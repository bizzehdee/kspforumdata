In career mode you\u0027ll get \u0022quests\u0022 \u0022missions\u0022 \u0022goals\u0022 what ever you want to call them and that will likely be the place where you go to check what is available. Maybe it will have a record of your completed missions or show your budget and the popularity of your space program. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think we need as much of the \u0022management\u0022 stuff for career mode in one building. Switching menus in a building is preferable to switching buildings to get at a particular menu. The Kerbal recruitment center seems a little spartan at the moment but hopefully additional functions will be added to that building. As it stands I\u0027d rather have the menu that, that building houses be part of the VAB and SPH.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HockeyToad28","CreatedById":41699,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T02:34:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t wait to see what purpose that building will serve\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
