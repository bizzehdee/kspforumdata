First, one must build a covering over a Kerbanaut with structural parts, and in some way deliver it to the Mun. Next, build two rockets, one a manned orbiter, the other a fuel tank. Rendezvous in orbit, and transfer fuel before landing upon the Mun. Continue by building a massive rocket that transports a second rocket to the Mun. Your final challenge is as follows: Build a manned Duna mission. Your ship must have radially attached fuel tanks, connected by fuel lines, that are able to be decoupled. It\u0027s main engines must be nuclear, but must be put into orbit by non nuclear engines. The lander may use chemical fuels, and ion engines are illegal. Its lander must be two stage After the mission, a chemically fueled rocket must bring your command module back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cmdr.
