As a result you need 85% of the take-off weight as fuel. Also you need to spend about 1/4~1/3 of the LH2 during air-breathing mode(Squad\u0027s jet engine code needs an overhaul aka AJE). Given the low density of liquid hydrogen, the tanks are huge (6.4m in diameter, about 70m length). This tank, thanks to its massive size, also becomes a lifting body. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever on Kerbin, this design doesn\u0027t make sense at all.
