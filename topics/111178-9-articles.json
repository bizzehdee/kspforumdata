Also, you aren\u0027t meant to be able to complete the Vanguard missions as soon as they come up. You should get Vanguard and Sputnik missions being offered at more or less the same time, and this is meant to parallel the real history of the space race; the Americans could have beaten the Soviets, if they had gone with the Explorer missions first instead of Vanguard, which is why in game when you complete Sputnik-1 the contract for Explorer-1 becomes available, as the Americans rushed to launch any kind of satellite of their own.\n\u003E \n\nInteresting, and I like it. If I understand the intent correctly, you would get to see/feel the options to be the first to orbit a satellite. And your choices impact your kerbal version of the history. For instance, contracts that all become available at basically the same time are Sputnik, Vanguard, and Explorer. Depending on what the game presents you, and what you choose to accept, will impact the historic recreation. You might choose, like the Americans did, to go for a Vanguard mission...and then find yourself lacking a solar panel (as you would with other tech trees, not that I don\u0027t like SETI Tech Tree and others of it\u0027s type, they\u0027re nice and stock is kinda broken imo). If instead the player chooses a Sputnik or Explorer mission to focus on first, it either matches history or changes it for your game. With this mindset the Vanguard contract should indeed be offered to the player before they have the tech required, such that the player can make that choice to focus on a more complex satellite first despite the increased \u0022cost\u0022 of solar panels.\n\nI still think this means you also want Explorer-1 to have its contract dependency be V-2N20 (instead of Sputnik-1) along with the change you earlier suggested fix of R-2A depending on R-1V (instead of V-2N20). Just my opinion.\n\nThanks again, that I\u0027m even thinking about this is a joy!"},{"CreatedByName":"Black-Talon","CreatedById":57463,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-06T19:43:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 12/3/2015 at 2:28 PM, Whitecat106 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I have been very busy lately but I now have a few days off to work on this mod, if someone could please post a list of all the current issues with 1.6.1 I will fix and upload a 1.6.2 patch by the end of the day!\n\u003E \n\nI haven\u0027t progressed far but a summary of the fixes/tweaks I\u0027ve made to my own game are listed here (using \\RegularVersion\\Full Pack\\):\n\n- (most important) Contract R-2A needs it\u0027s Orbit parameter changed to a ReachState parameter\n- (less important) Contract R-2A needs it\u0027s CompleteContract requirement changed from V-2N20 to R-1V\n- (optional) Contract Explorer-1 could have its CompleteContract requirement changed from Sputnik-1 to V-2N20 (see my discussion with gerishnakov)\n- ~~(optional) Contract Explorer-6 could have its redundant CompleteContract requirement for Vanguard-1 removed since it also has a CompleteContract requirement for Vanguard-5 (which in turn depends on 4, 3, 2, and 1).~~ edit: I misread this requirement\n- Screenshot of R-2A.cfg diff: [http://screencast.com/t/Xwu26FBz8OWy](http://screencast.com/t/Xwu26FBz8OWy) (my version on the right)\n- Screenshot of Explorer-1.cfg diff: [http://screencast.com/t/uKmknIgs1pf](http://screencast.com/t/uKmknIgs1pf) (my version on the right)\n- ~~Screenshot of Explorer-6.cfg diff: [http://screencast.com/t/nt6rMk3O8CU](http://screencast.com/t/nt6rMk3O8CU) (my version on the right)~~\n\nThat\u0027s all I had actually changed in my game thus far. But I did also make a couple observations that could be looked at:\n\n1. The R-2A mission has a whole second half to the description in the config that doesn\u0027t show up in game in case you didn\u0027t already know. Remove line breaks in the config?\n2. The R-1V mission confused me regarding the crewed or uncrewed requirement for the mission. This is because the first thing under \u0022Objectives\u0022 is (a note): \u0022Launch the first mammal into space and return it safely to Kerbin.\u0022 Is a Kerbal a mammal? Is it required to have one on board? Reading further, the combination of languard regarding \u0022returning samples\u0022 and the requirements saying something like, \u0022Crew: Unmanned: Complete: Unmanned: Incomplete\u0022 just looked buggy and I wasn\u0027t confident on what was the right thing to do. I would suggest moving the \u0022note\u0022 to the historic briefing/description so I don\u0027t have to wonder if a Kerbal is a mammal that needs to be included in my R-1V mission. See observation 3 regarding Crew requirements.\n3. Any idea why all of the Historic Missions I\u0027ve seen thus far have two \u0022Unmanned: \u0022 labels/requirements? Maybe it\u0027s a contract configurator thing but other contracts I have don\u0027t show it that way.\u0022 Perhaps this is because the HasCrew parameter uses both minCrew and maxCrew properties? If possible, a better clarification of the Crewed/Uncrewed requirement would\u0027ve helped me when I first started.\n4. It is easy to get confused about what solar panel is required for meeting the Vanguard-1 requirement because the module name is DeployableSolarPanel, which causes players to assume they need a SolarPanel that has a Deploy option/animation. Perhaps text somewhere in the mission could clarify that any SolarPanel will do, including a Fixed Panel such as OX-STAT Panel? I doubt hiding the Module name is an option but that would be ideal.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-06T05:02:15Z\u0022 title=\u002201/06/2016 05:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Black-Talon**\n  \nAdded screenshots of .cfg diffs - edit2: strikeout of my mistake"},{"CreatedByName":"gamerscircle","CreatedById":151261,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-11T14:38:42Z","Content":"Greetings -\n\nFirstly - I wanted to say that I have been really enjoying these.
