The reason it works is that more than one body\u0027s gravity is acting on the moon at the same time, and there are also tidal forces at play. For example (if there were no Moon), an asteroid which has barely above escape velocity comes into the Earth-Sun L1/L2, and falls towards Earth with a low periapsis. During this first orbit, the gravitational pull of the Sun/Jupiter/tidal forces from Earth can all change the asteroid\u0027s orbit a little bit so that its energy falls a little below escape, and its apoapsis is lowered into the Earth\u0027s sphere of influence.
