On land East-West distances can easily be measured. On a boat with the shoreline in sight they can still be fairly easily measured, and in some civilizations sailors would prefer to stay in sight of the coast to help them navigate. The problem then isn\u0027t in mapping the coast of Europe, Iceland, or North America in detail, but in accurately working out the distance between those places across the empty Atlantic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlawed because a lunar eclipse is a gradual event. There\u0027s no obvious sharp \u0022now\u0022 cue to observe. So each single observer won\u0027t get a very precise figure for their location. If you had lots of observations you could apply statistics to get more precise locations, but it seems unlikely at best that Neolithic Britons had developed that kind of mathematics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-25T16:42:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cantab\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cantab\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot needed ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlawed ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think you\u0027ve missed the point of the exercise... \u0022... working on a theory ...\u0022, \u0022...
