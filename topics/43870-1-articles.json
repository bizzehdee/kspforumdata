Below I will list off the four things I am interested in seeing for the sustainability of both Orbiting and Deep Space mission Spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. If Batteries appropriately decay during their cycling. Giving a defined lifespan of the satellite based on how many orbits it can survive before the battery can no longer hold a charge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEg. If the battery is rated for 1,000 life cycles, and you burn 0.05cycle/1orbit, then the satellite will survive 20,000 orbits before the battery approaches failure. But lets say you waste an entire 1cycle/1orbit, then you will only last for 1,000 orbits. That could be the difference of a 5 year mission against a month long mission, and an important part of spacecraft today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Solar Panel Decay in orbit. Give panels a defined solar efficiency life, and the panels will slowly reduce their efficiency as they orbit over time until you barely receive a trickled charge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEg. A Kerbin Satellite with an appropriate battery, operating for several years begins to lose it\u0027s solar efficiency. This in turn causes it\u0027s power regeneration to become slowly reduced; This in combination with suggestion 1, would result in reduced orbital efficiency until eventually it doesn\u0027t fully recharge on an orbital pass and destroys the battery even faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/topnav/materials/listbytype/SMI_Problem8.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELINK\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. RadioIsotope Thermoelectric Generator\u0027s in the very science of what they are, should decay. I know that the RTG in KSP does show an efficiency item on it, but I have yet to get that efficiency to drop with any spacecraft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEg. This in combination with degrading batteries could result in more realistic operations of the spacecraft, particularly rovers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Propellant Tanks consuming power to keep the propellant from degrading. When a propellant tank has propellant in it, it will consume an amount of power proportional to it\u0027s propellant. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.A. A Propellant Tank without power will slowly become unusable in proportion to its amount of propellant against the time power was not applied.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEg. A space probe is sent to another planet and needs to perform a deltaV at a defined point. It will provide power to it\u0027s propellant tanks to keep them operational, if the power to the tanks is lost then the spacecrafts propellant will slowly become unusable while increasing the spacecrafts dry-mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.B. Propellant Tanks consuming themselves to remain operational. When a spacecraft no longer has power applied to the propellant tanks, the tanks will consume propellant into increased dry-mass to keep the remaining propellant usable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEg. A spacecraft in orbit disables power to it\u0027s propellant tank to conserve power. The propellant tank then begins to waste propellant to conserve it\u0027s remaining propellant over a period of time determined by the propellant tank size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.C. Propellant Tank\u0027s no longer connected to a command module nor a power source will then go entirely bad and will not be usable at all after a short amount of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEg. A spacecraft ejects a propellant tank in orbit and returns to it several hours later. The propellant tank, unmaintained by a command module instantly decays with full propellant and doesn\u0027t preform 4.B.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E_________\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for reading my humble suggestions.

Everything you\u0027ve listed has degradation measured over tens of years - even batteries (look up nickel-hydrogen batteries). With mission times in KSP typically being far short of that, it\u0027s just unneeded complexity. If KSP was a 110% realistic space exploration simulator, sure, it\u0027d be a good idea to implement degradation due to age and environmental factors. But, KSP is a game, and so it doesn\u0027t make sense to add a glut of parts and mechanics that add so little.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stuff about fuel tanks I\u0027ve got no idea where, how, or why you\u0027ve come up with; it\u0027s complete nonsense.

Technically, if you want to be anal about it, they can require stirring (the part which failed in apollo 13) to maintain consistency when on standby for immediate use, but again this fails the complexity test.

The fuel loss would be a tricky and friggin annoying topic to cover with every flight. But at a minimum, I think the topic of power should be of concern. Any newb player wouldn\u0027t have to worry about battery degradation at first, because they will be way more excited they could even get to orbit in the first place. But when a few months of kerbal time passes and their launches get more efficient and better payloads developed, then they will notice their old satellites are becoming dysfunctional. It could be a mod, and hopefully soon will be a mod, (even if i have to team up with somebody to make it happen), but it could very well become a part of gameplay. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA topic we always harp on in the lab is that \u0022there is no random failures.\u0022 Having a degrading power system would be a perfect opportunity to introduce that to KSP.

For instance instead of putting a stack of batteries right in the main column of the ship where they cannot be removed, you instead put them on docking ports on short pylons along the main beam. That way when the packs have gone bad you can launch replacements, dock on, and replace them while in orbit. Already my solar arrays use this approach, I launch a lightweight vessel containing 4x 2 meter trusses each carrying 2 gigantors, and a module tug to install them. Like so I can build any size array in orbit with relative ease, and if my solar panels eventually degraded it would be a simple matter to remove and replace the worn out segment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut other than RTGs decaying, most types of depletion/wear accumulation are better left to game mods meant for people who seek the increased realism they offer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually I\u0027m not 100% certain on where to hook the API for batteries to make a wear-out mechanism for them. Solar panels and RTGs could get by using an ISP-like correction factor, and would apply that factor based on the time they\u0027ve been in service. Fuel boiloff is even easier, fixed percentage per tank in a given time period.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP recommends C# for making game mods.

They stay liquid in normal pressure and can be stored decades without significant degradation in spacecrafts. However, they give less ISP than LH2/LOX and need very exotic and expensive materials to prevent corrosion, which limits their use in large booster stages. Hydrazines are also very poisonous and need strict (and expensive) safety precautions on every phase when there is possibility to human contact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf devs consider this, I hope that they include different propellants in game. Maybe volatile but high ISP LH2/LOX for medium to large engines. Some very large Kerosine/LOX -engine for big dumb boosters. And then long living stuff for space (also for LV-N). But it would increase number of parts and complexity of game.
