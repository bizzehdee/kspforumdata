When I return to the R\u0026amp;D building, the parts are duplicated, with one set purchased and one set requiring purchase. This continues no matter how many times I purchase, with more and more copies. I can remove the duplicates by deleting them from the save, but cannot find where they are tracking individual buy ins in the save to edit that. Does anyone either know how to fix this, or at least the save location so I can force it to recognize my buy in?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fraeyen","CreatedById":232698,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-02-17T23:58:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPosting an update in case people have the same issue. I realized that these two cargo parts are in the base game \u0026amp; the breaking ground expansion, deleting them from the breaking ground expansion files resolves whatever conflict is happening. I looked through the files and they are identical of that location so no gameplay is affected. Also for those curious the save game appears to track available parts by listing them under the tech in the save.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aelfhe1m","CreatedById":142910,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-02-18T00:59:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224367014\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022223733\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221708190761\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022232698\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fraeyen\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, Fraeyen said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nor at least the save location so I can force it to recognize my buy in?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the save file, purchased tech is stored in the SCENARIO/ResearchAndDevelopment node.
