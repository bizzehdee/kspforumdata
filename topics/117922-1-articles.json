Taking an experience flight is a great idea. To start with, try to book your flights either early morning or in the evening. Small planes tend to get very hot in the middle of a Summer\u0027s day and the ride can also get bumpy at that time. That can equate to motion sickness. Fly when it is calmer and cooler. You may not be affected by motion sickness, it\u0027s an individual thing, but if you are it can shut down a lesson really quick (hard to learn while trying to keep your cookies down \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETalk with a few instructors and go with the one you prefer. Beware of instructors who are building time before applying to the airlines because if they are almost there then they may have to drop you as they take the next step in their career. You would then have to find a different instructor to finish up your training.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlight sims are a good tool if used correctly, but are most useful when training for your instrument rating. Training for your Private Pilot\u0027s License is mostly about visual flying and a sim really can\u0027t teach you much about the feel of flying a C150. FSX uses correct airport signage and markings though, so that is useful. A sim will also give you a head start by simply knowing a little more about basic aerodynamics, effects of controls etc. It won\u0027t teach you anything about the feel of the airplane or the importance of looking outside the cockpit for visual cues and situational awareness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbove all, have fun with it and fly often. Each lesson builds on the previous one, so flying frequently will help greatly in getting the most out of each session.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you wanting to fly for a career or purely for fun?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T00:51:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGet FAR. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T02:40:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnderstand the different licenses available (in the US: sport/recreational/private/commercial/ATP), then determine the least that is applicable to what you intend to fly.
