BTW I\u0027m 15 (soon to be 16 in September) and live near an airport that offers lessons, so distance is not an issue for me. Last of all discuss your own piloting/flight experiences here."},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T04:10:04Z","Content":"I am not a pilot myself, but I am working on getting a license in aviation. My best advice, read up on EVERYTHING aviation. This includes the FARs. I\u0027m positive that you may eventually need to run O\u0026Ps in the piloting end (don\u0027t quote me on that). Also, keep up on the latest news in aviation to stay informed. Finally, hang out with other people who are into aviation."},{"CreatedByName":"ColKlonk","CreatedById":137078,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T06:19:01Z","Content":"Here\u0027s a good place to start asking for info - [www.pprune.org](www.pprune.org)\n\nI suggest going for your pilot medical first, as without this you\u0027re not flying anywhere.\n\nPop along to your local flying school, they should have the study manuals that you need - buy these and read through them in the meantime. The manuals are expensive.. anything aviation is $$$.\n\nTalking about $$$, try do your license in one \u0027stretch\u0027... it saves $$$.\n\nGood luck"},{"CreatedByName":"spaceman1999","CreatedById":68861,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T17:30:02Z","Content":"Thanks for the advice and also i did some reading on the nearest flight school (Lunken in Cincinnati) and they seem like a good place to stop by and see if i actually want to learn to pilot. They offer a flight where you go up and then you can control the plane and see how flying a plane actually feels, which i may do sometime soon."},{"CreatedByName":"Astronut","CreatedById":2077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T22:24:14Z","Content":"All good advice so far. Taking an experience flight is a great idea. To start with, try to book your flights either early morning or in the evening. Small planes tend to get very hot in the middle of a Summer\u0027s day and the ride can also get bumpy at that time. That can equate to motion sickness. Fly when it is calmer and cooler. You may not be affected by motion sickness, it\u0027s an individual thing, but if you are it can shut down a lesson really quick (hard to learn while trying to keep your cookies down ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) ).\n\nTalk with a few instructors and go with the one you prefer. Beware of instructors who are building time before applying to the airlines because if they are almost there then they may have to drop you as they take the next step in their career. You would then have to find a different instructor to finish up your training.\n\nFlight sims are a good tool if used correctly, but are most useful when training for your instrument rating. Training for your Private Pilot\u0027s License is mostly about visual flying and a sim really can\u0027t teach you much about the feel of flying a C150. FSX uses correct airport signage and markings though, so that is useful. A sim will also give you a head start by simply knowing a little more about basic aerodynamics, effects of controls etc. It won\u0027t teach you anything about the feel of the airplane or the importance of looking outside the cockpit for visual cues and situational awareness.\n\nAbove all, have fun with it and fly often. Each lesson builds on the previous one, so flying frequently will help greatly in getting the most out of each session.\n\nAre you wanting to fly for a career or purely for fun?"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T00:51:05Z","Content":"Get FAR. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T02:40:48Z","Content":"Understand the different licenses available (in the US: sport/recreational/private/commercial/ATP), then determine the least that is applicable to what you intend to fly. If you\u0027re going to just putter around the farm on nice days, don\u0027t go for a Private. But if you want to take the wife and kids on long trips, a Sport ain\u0027t gonna cut it.

I got my license when I reached 15, and here it was mostly just the matter of undergoing a medical check-up, flight rules and then flying. There wasn\u0027t really anything hard about it, but I\u0027ve got one hint anyway: Playing FSX or X-Plane really helps to get grasp of basic controls of the plane."},{"CreatedByName":"ColKlonk","CreatedById":137078,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T09:01:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Get FAR. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nFAR is so **far** wrong compared to reality.. it\u0027s just not funny..![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nFlight sims..
