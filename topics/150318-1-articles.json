In my new career, I have now reached the point that I build (slightly) larger rockets that also have SRBs and/or additional \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E rockets on the sides. I notice that very often these start to rotate along the vertical axis when I start the gravity turn. I used the symmetry tool in the construction, so it is certainly not a lack of symmetry in the design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom an aerodynamics point of view, it makes sense to me: the rocket is (for a short while) not pointed exactly prograde, so the booster that is on the outer side gets more drag. If that booster is turned even the slightest to one side, that drag will start to rotate the rocket. This keeps on going as you make corrections. I would not be surprised if\u00A0real rockets also experience this - although most rockets don\u0027t use nearly as many radial attachments as we use in KSP.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut from a gameplay point of view, I just want to get rid of that rotation, because it screws up a LOT of my launches...

I will have to unlearn some behavior (in design, and in flight). I think that with more time, I will probably get a feeling for it. The designs I have here may be a little too draggy, and could probably be strutted down a bit more tight. At the same time, they are making it into orbit, so I am not getting stuck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003EA little feedback from my side:\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nTail fins: The first design has some tail fins. Also, after reading the feedback,\u00A0I equipped the \u0022medium size\u0022 design with tail fins (8 in total, one on each radially attached part), and the rotation did not reduce. While tail fins help if you have a rocket that is draggy at the top, this was not the solution for me.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe radially attached parts are strutted, but typically only with one strut at the top of the part(s). Movement of these parts relative to the central tanks is minimal (not visible during flight), but I cannot exclude that this cannot be made better. I think that \u0022Moar Struts\u0022 may be a solution here.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI am skeptical that more reaction wheels will help so early in the launch. I feel that the tail fins and especially a Mainsail engine (gimbal at 100%) can correct the heading much better, and the input of the\u00A0reaction wheels will be lost among that violence.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nBtw, in my career game, the problem is solving itself.

If you don\u0027t strut everything hard, the outermost boosters love to angle themselves a tiny bit within the allowance of the joints. That angle introduces a thrust offset - and as result, rotation, which will angle boosters on the other side as well.
