Except for each manouver node, it will show that same marker in the appropriate colour (equal to the manouver node\u0027s colour) of where the marker will be at that node (since the planet rotates of course).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe the same is done for an \u0022impact\u0022 (your orbit intersects the surface), which is treated as a manouver node for the sake of the marker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m NOT suggesting is that the planet surface itself shows where everything is in the future. Like, if you hover over a manouver node or something, the planet will seem to rotate to show how it will ook then. That would tend to become very confusing and ugly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving this would make it easier to figure out where you will actually land (assuming no atmosphere, but hey what would be the challenge otherwise \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) while still keeping a fairly easy-to-read display. Possibly it also has applications for putting stuff in geosyncronous orbit, but since I\u0027ve never tried I wouldn\u0027t really know.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
