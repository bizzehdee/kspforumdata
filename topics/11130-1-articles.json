It is always much easier to work in this backwards order.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Just the command pod and parachute, then a decoupler. These 3 things should ALWAYS be your top 3 things.. pretty much every time.. This is for entry back onto earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Munar landar. I usually just have an ASAS, RCS with a few RCS thrusters, and the smallest liquid fuel tank and really small liquid engine, and landing pegs. This is for your final Munar decent, as well as your lift off of the Mun and escaping into Kerbin\\\u0027s orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Orbital corrections phase - put simply, the phase that finishes up establishing your original Kerbin orbit, and Mun orbital insertion. This is usually simply 3 liquid fuel tanks, and a vectored liquid thruster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Main Kerbin Escape phase - Fairly simple phase - get you out of the atmosphere and into a partial orbit. I usually use 4 radial decouplers and then put 3 liquid fuel tanks on each decoupler with 4 non-vectored liquid thrusters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Lastly, your get-the-hell-off-the-ground phase. I\\\u0027m fairly sure you can tell what this should be. Usually for me this was just a bunch of solid boosters on radial decouplers at the bottom(I mean a lot, like, at least 30). Recently I have been using these RAM jets, because (until they get fixed) they have LOTS and lots of power at low atmosphere to push the rocket off the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ll link you a nice .craft file of mine when I get home, following this design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the general flight plan:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActivate SAS, ignite first stage. Fly upwards until either your solids run out, or your jets can no longer INCREASE the velocity of your ship. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFire 2nd stage, at full throttle. At 20km altitude, drop spacecraft to 45 degrees pitch at 90 degrees angled. (Going east, 45 degrees above horizontal). Slowly decrease the angle. You should end up at 60-70km, moving horizontally east. Continue to pick up speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFire 3rd stage. At this point you should nearly, or already have, an orbit around Kerbin. Continue to increase speed horizontally until you achieve one. Turn off all thrust. You should still have lots of fuel left in your 3rd stage liquids. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo into map view. You are going to want to fire your rockets in the direction of your velocity when the moon comes over the horizon of Kerbin. If you fire them in that direction, your orbit should extend out to the Munar orbit distance, and you will be on an intercept course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime warp, and wait until you are on an intercept course with the moon. When you are at 37,000 meters altitude on the moon, aim your rocket straight in your reverse-velocity direction, and fire what is left of the liquid fuel in your 3rd stage to get rid of ALL velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContinue to use the 3rd, and fire the 4th stage when the 3rd runs out, to keep you moving VERY slow on your decent to the moon. Extend your landing pegs, use rcs translational movement (kijl) to keep your decent vertical only. Land!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo take off, go east, and stat moving fast enough that you get an orbit around the Mun. Extend this orbit outwards toward earth. Only a few million meters should be fine, you will be captured by Kerbin\\\u0027s orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you are captured, wait until you are at the pariapsis of your orbit (because you are moving the slowest then), and fire in your reverse-velocity direction until your orbit is planned to actually HIT kerbin. Then just time warp it out, and dont touch anything. You will hit the atmosphere, and the atmosphere will slow you a LOT. Then just jettison your pod out, deploy parachute, and just drift to a landing!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know there are a billion tutorials of this out there, but I was in class and really bored.. I needed something to do... SO I wrote this massive wall of text instead of working on, you know.... Physics.. (Irony huh?)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
