They are basically indestructible at any speed or altitude. You can completely ignore re-entry heating and just hammer your craft into the atmosphere at 4k/s, pop your shoot, watch your gees max out for a couple seconds and then its a long boring drift to the surface. This really needs to be fixed, no parachute should be able to withstand those forces, or any Kerbal for that matter.\n\nParachutes have always been this way. I\u0027m not saying it should or shouldn\u0027t be improved, I\u0027m just remarking that this was a characteristic that was not modified in 1.0. Parachutes have been modified when interacting with the ground; in the previous version, as soon as your vessel touched the ground, the parachute disappeared from the craft. Now, it persists until the vessel\u0027s velocity (over the surface or angular) is very close to 0.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E SAS is broken. Even a very short stiff craft, a Mk1 and one fuel tank and one engine, often gets stuck in a wobble that uses up all your RCS or battery. Wobble isn\u0027t even the right term, its more live a vibration. The craft stays steady but the gimbals and RCS just fire like crazy in all directions.\n\nThis means you have too much torque in your SAS and/or not enough electric charge. Try adding some batteries and cutting back on the number of SAS parts you use. If you need the Smart SAS, try just using a different probe body to augment your controls, rather than an entire Inline Stabilizer."},{"CreatedByName":"Jananton","CreatedById":83920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T20:34:32Z","Content":"A few issues I experienced are already mentioned here, like the uncontrollable flipping round of capsules with heat shields on reentry and radial parachutes that when launched at this flip moment - going at 1800\u002B m/s at around 19000 m - not only not break off, or burn to a crisp in the reentry fireball, but stop the speed of the capsule to a mere 350 m/s in less then a second. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nAdditionally to the above I have a symmetry problem during construction in the Aircraft hanger, were I either can\u0027t seem to switch from radial to symmetry placement mode, or there\u0027s something else wrong with the result as [shown in this thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117308-Strange-mirroring-in-the-SPH).\n\nAnd finally a minor strange behavior of the small heatproof cargo container as show here.\n\n![closed_cargodoors_attitude.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16919187/Screenshots/KSP/closed_cargodoors_attitude.png)\n\n![opened_cargodoors_attitude.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16919187/Screenshots/KSP/opened_cargodoors_attitude.png)\n\nBoth images with no SAS applied just on the way down hanging on a chute.

No SAS modules at all, just the built in SAS in the MK1 pod. I don\u0027t know what batteries would have to do with anything. Either you have power or you don\u0027t.

They put a lot of effort into heat shields and re-entry but its all completely irrelevant because of the parachute behavior, and they where not always that way, in earlier builds if you deployed over about 800 M/S the chute detached. It was actually a much more realistic challenge as you had to re-enter at an angle that would let you areo-brake enough before you hit the ground.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T21:11:57Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 09:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Aerindel**"},{"CreatedByName":"Yakky","CreatedById":94432,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T21:10:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yakky: there\u0027s also flow separation from high pressure vs too-high area ratio, that would contribute to Isp being lower than a straight chamber pressure vs static pressure comparison.\n\nFair point, this would cause ISP to fall more, maybe a lot more, but still not to zero.
