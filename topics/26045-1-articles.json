I rightclick on one port in the pair and say \u0022disconnect\u0022, then quickly click the other one and do the same, and the two ship modules drift apart as expected, but one of the couplers breaks off its module when I do so.

Yes. As a test when I first heard about this problem, I built a small test rocket that was \u0022probe module/tank/bi-coupler/inverted-bi-coupler/tank/engine\u0022 and despite the total lack of docking ports, the engine could exhaust the bottom fuel tank but wouldn\u0027t touch the top one. I further simplified it to \u0022probe/tank/bi-coupler/tank/engine\u0022 and the engine drained both tanks. \u0022probe/tank/inverted-bi-coupler/tank/engine\u0022 again demonstrated the problem, with the top tank remaining untouched. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that the single side of the bi-coupler can\u0027t draw fuel from either of the nodes on the other side of the bi-coupler. Either of the two nodes on the double side can draw fuel from the single side, however. The two nodes on the double side cannot draw from each other, however. So it appears to me that the only fuel flow allowed through a bi-coupler is from the single node to either/both of the double nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also tried variations of each case where the engine could drain the tank, and the presence of docking ports did not affect the results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I sure that docking ports do not cause fuel flow problems in the absense of multi-couplers? No, but I\u0027ve never been able to create a case where this happens, so at the very least, I feel that docking ports are at least unlikely to cause this kind of problem. I\u0027ve tried replacing both bi-couplers in the non-working designs with docking ports and it has always worked fine for me at that point. If you could recreate the config you had problems with, I\u0027d like to see it. I\u0027m not going to claim that my scientific method is perfect (my anything, for that matter), so I\u0027m quite open to scrutiny.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I sure that you can get away with bypassing only one of the bi-couplers with a fuel line? I think so, but I\u0027m not sure as I haven\u0027t tried it. Since bi-couplers let fuel flow one way but not the other, then only one bi-coupler is the problem, so bypassing the problem bi-coupler should resolve the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
