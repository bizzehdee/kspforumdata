Sometimes a docking port can be selected that is facing the wrong way, and will screw you up big time!\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSometimes your engines can confuse mechjeb. Surface attached and radially attached engines can cause this. Make sure your engines are activated and placed in the very bottom of your stage list, AND other engines that are not activated are in a different stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf mechjeb does make a burn but it is slightly off, you can choose \u201CFine tune closest approach to target\u201D and it will plan a correction burn for you, but if it is way off it\u2019s usually because either you chose the wrong option, or your engine set up has confused it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
