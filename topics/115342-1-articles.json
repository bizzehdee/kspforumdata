There shouldn\u0027t be stuff in there that\u0027s wildly out of date, so you\u0027re pretty safe. Steer clear of anything really old that suggests loading a .dae directly into the game. As long as the workflow involves getting the model into unity, then using part tools to compile the model into a .mu, it\u0027s still relevant as the process hasn\u0027t changed much since part tools came out. Sketchup is fine for making models, though I believe it doesn\u0027t give you a way to set up UV mapping for your textures, so you\u0027ll have to shift to something else like Blender to do that bit. But don\u0027t let that put you off rigging an untextured model up and getting it into the game to get used to the workflow before you invest the time in learning how to unwrap and texture.

My channel is fritzbuild3r, and have a few KSP vids. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy goal is to find a workable pipeline to part creation because I want to do more than just a 1 off part. My idea is to build on for more station parts like Nertea\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91814\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91814\u003C/a\u003E , and station science. I really get into building stations in space (and colonies). I want to create station parts that are modular and have docking ports built-in. I find once you get multiple station pieces in orbit all those part joins make things very unstable. So the idea is to have pre-built sections you launch and then connect in orbit, and can rearrange and change later on the fly. Also, my goal is to make parts that have a minimum amount of surfaces to not bog down the game for big stations. So much of the detail may be textures etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
