The \u0022Explore\u0022 and other \u0022pure science\u0022 contracts would be considered \u0022missions\u0022 that your program dreams up vs \u0022contracts,\u0022 which are launching satellites, testing parts for subcontractors, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now, you get those \u0022milestone\u0022 contracts\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 launch a rocket, achieve an altitude of X, etc. Many new players likely don\u0027t realize that if your first launch is overly successful, you miss out on the various altitude records contracts, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo how about the game has those early missions replaced with \u0022contracts\u0022 akin to the \u0022Explore the Mun/Minmus/Duna/etc\u0022 contracts (many would have small science rewards).:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022Achieve Spaceflight!\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would be like the \u0022Explore the Mun\u0022 contract, but the end goal would be leaving Kerbin atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInternal milestones might be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Launch a rocket (same as contract now)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Reach 5000m (same as now)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3-5(?) Same altitude records already in game, but they are sub-requirements, so if you do 2 or more in one mission, you get credit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. (whatever 2d to last number is) Take a crew report, or science from space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7.

If they really screw up, they can do some of these to get back on their feet)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMilestones here would be various science from points in the atmosphere, and perhaps sensible parts testing (use a parachute, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExamples (add more!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Take crew reports from various altitudes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Safely land craft in various kerbin biomes (not too many, but water, plains, etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

Other missions might include rendezvous. The goal is teaching new players, so the milestones should have this in mind. I\u0027d like the clamp-o-tron-jr to be available early for this. Perhaps very low-thrust attitude control jets very early, and only the mono in the pod? The might include, for example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Place spacecraft in an inclined orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Create a highly elliptical orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Take science/crew reports from a couple distances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Do an EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Do an EVA where you let go of the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. (assuming a docking port and attitude control) Successfully dock. (This could be a single rocket with 2 docking ports)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Successfully use a maneuver node to do X. (assuming a contract can check for this---it would look for the node as \u0022green/complete\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Rendezvous and dock two craft launched at least XX minutes apart. (Forcing a real rendezvous as a teaching aid)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese mostly use existing mechanisms to flesh out the early game experience for new players, as well as providing guidance as to what needs to be learned.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-20T01:59:03Z\u0022 title=\u002202/20/2015 01:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T01:03:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm, I do like the idea.
