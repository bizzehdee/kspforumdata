And also I believe that it is very hard to remember for which case circles\u00A0converge and diverge, especially for new players. Cost of mistake is high - you will get retrograde orbit instead of prograde, and reverse. I believe there must be markers for them in all cases, in this case for relative to Minmus view\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nUpd: I describe problem for 0.1.1.0 version of ksp2\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-17T16:13:29Z\u0022 title=\u002203/17/2023 04:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 17, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Vortygont\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded game ver.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
