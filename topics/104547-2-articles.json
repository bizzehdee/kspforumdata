What will \u0022states\u0022 represent ? Something like snapshots of current positions of all parts ? If not, here is (yet another) idea for Sequence Builder (with load/save) - set all parts to certain position and then take a snapshot, set them again then take another snapshot. This kind of workflow is similar to stop-motion animation. That way one can quickly build multiple sequences that are independent from each other. Making sequences that are dependant on each other is a bit non-sensical except for \u0022archiving\u0022 purposes (reusing same code etc).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStates was an idea I proposed to Ziw towards the end of development. My thought was that states would be arbitrary things that you as a player define, but you can then assign sequences to states so they will only run when within it, and when finished can trigger a state change. If you\u0027re familiar with how state machines are represented then sequences would be the transitions between states, rather than the states themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe example I came up with at the time was having Folded and Deployed states on a craft. When folded all you can do it play the Unfold sequence that then triggers a change to the Deployed state when it finishes. Once in Deployed the Unfold sequence is locked from playing, but other sequences such as Spin Antenna and Refold become unlocked.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fatcargo","CreatedById":93302,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T15:51:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAhh that\u0027s why i did not recognize the term, i did not directly learned about this (there is no shame in admiting ignorance, only in refusing to learn if needed).
