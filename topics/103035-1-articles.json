The Shuttle SRB\u0027s (The SLS SRB\u0027s) are over 20x more powerful than their Kerbal counterpart. That is a very unkerbal thing for kerbal to do! Yeah, it already provides enough thrust as is but... Thrust. The engines exerts about 13,800kN of thrust.\n\nAm I the only one wondering about 1: Why the SRB is so powerful and 2: why Kerbals have such a puny version (A 1/10 thrust ratio would be better not 1/21)\n\nAny biters?"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T13:17:05Z","Content":"The reason is physics and aesthetics. Kerbin is 1/10th the size of earth (roughly).\n\nBecause of that you only need 1/sqrt(10) of the dV to get into orbit. If you would use normal Isp and twr ratios you\u0027d end up with very overpowered rockets. Pretty much everything would be SSTO. So they\u0027re compensating for that by nerfed Isp\u0027s and ridiculously heavy parts.\n\nAlso, note that the SLS boosters in real life are much larger than the ones in game. In game they have a diameter of 1.25m and IRL they\u0027re a whopping 3.7 meters"},{"CreatedByName":"Dkmdlb","CreatedById":70275,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T14:31:42Z","Content":"Kerbal engines in general are much weaker than real ones.

When last I started a 737 engine, it took nearly 20 steps! APU on, bleeds in the correct configuration, fuel cutoff, hydraulics, fuel pumps, etc. There\u0027s just so many things to go through. A KSP engine just needs an intake, some fuel, and someone to throttle up and hit the ignition.
