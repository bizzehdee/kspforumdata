The Shuttle SRB\u0027s (The SLS SRB\u0027s) are over 20x more powerful than their Kerbal counterpart. That is a very unkerbal thing for kerbal to do!

When last I started a 737 engine, it took nearly 20 steps! APU on, bleeds in the correct configuration, fuel cutoff, hydraulics, fuel pumps, etc. There\u0027s just so many things to go through. A KSP engine just needs an intake, some fuel, and someone to throttle up and hit the ignition. Also, KSP jet engines don\u0027t require constant maintenance, but I doubt most KSP engines ever survive long enough for that to matter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dkmdlb","CreatedById":70275,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T15:52:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think he meant that KSP jet engines are more powerful than jet engines in real life.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Neil1993","CreatedById":92469,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T15:56:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dkmdlb\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dkmdlb\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think he meant that KSP jet engines are more powerful than jet engines in real life.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot necessarily.
