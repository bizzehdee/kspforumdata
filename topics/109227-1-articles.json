I got into orbit and as the fairing is for aerobraking at Eve the antenna was still stowed. I warped a bit and the antenna started transmitting. When I stopped warping it stopped.\n\nCould someone who plays stock check to see if this happens on a stock game please?\n\nJust wondering if this is a stock bug or if it is due to me running loads of mods."},{"CreatedByName":"Arsonik","CreatedById":79705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T15:58:04Z","Content":"This sounds like it could be related to clipping in some way. The same way timewarp allows two physical bodies to pass through each other. It is skipping the checks against your fairings. This is just a hunch of course ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Shawn28","CreatedById":143994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T16:23:36Z","Content":"It happened to me too, but i\u0027m playing with mods, though not a lot. Antennas can\u0027t transmit while in fairings, but time warp kind of messes things up XD"}]}
