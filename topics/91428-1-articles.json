Am having difficulty changing my avatar. I know it\u0027s not a biggie to tackle, but my screen doesn\u0027t have an option to allow me to change it from default. Am thinking it will present this option the more posts that I contribute here, maybe? This would be my second post, am new here and just got playing the KSP game a couple weeks ago. Love it. Hope this question doesn\u0027t bother anyone, in not being a big tech challenge.
