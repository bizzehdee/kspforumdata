I have 5t probe powered by one ion engine which means long burns (12hrs to burn all the propellent). What is the best strategy for doing burns? I need to get far enough from kerbin to be able to a long enough burn on one side of the orbit to go interplanetary. Should I do lots of burns at prograde and then one long one at the apoapsis to leave kerbin, or go for a circular higher orbit before leaving, or just burn prograde all the way around until I am higher? Added tothis is the problem of not being able to burn in the shade of kerbin, which is where I probably want to most of all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny tips?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-17T15:10:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would go for a higher orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spica","CreatedById":65153,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-17T15:12:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI only turn on my ion engines once I have reached escape velocity by using my main rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dante80","CreatedById":91509,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-17T15:16:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA question would be why do you need a 5tn probe to have a single ion engine.

The problem, however, is that all these exotic engines require beaucoup electricity PER SECOND, creating which quickly adds a lot of weight, offsetting the benefits of the higher thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the real question I have is, what do you need a 5-ton payload for? I\u0027m starting to use ion and Near Future engines a lot these days and I can usually do everything I need for about 6 tons total, including engines, fuel, and the massive electrical power planet. Science parts are very light and even other stuff doesn\u0027t weigh that much. For instance, last night I built a probe mining unit for use on Pol. It carries the small refining unit, 2 of the small drills, small tanks for every type of fuel, and flies on 2 of the Near Future ion engines powered by a mid-sized nuclear reactor. The whole thing weighs only 6.5 tons and has about 8500m/s delta-V even fully loaded with enouth TWR to land and take off from Pol.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"codepoet","CreatedById":73449,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-17T16:36:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESince many of you are asking - the reason I have a large probe with a small ion engine is I am trying to put together my own baseline entry for a challenge (which I might post on the challenge thread if I can figure out how to do it myself) which is something along the lines of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What is the smallest lauch mass to establish a kethane plan on laythe?\u0022 So for 5t I have a kethane tank, drill, coverter, empty fuel tank, ion propulsion, solar, and Entry-Decent-Landing system. The design challenge boils down to the fact that using a small kethane drill creates a lopsided craft, so you have to find ways of balancing it. Also landing it on laythe is a challenge without lots of fuel\u002Brockets. There is also the piloting challenge that we are discussing here, and then the challenge of getting into LKO as efficently as possible.

The problem with the eplipse is that it takes much longer to raise the apoapsis, and then you can end up missing your transfer window. You also need to get the AP to be opposite to the sun at the moment of the transfer window, but it would not be when you start doing your AP raising burns. Also there is the problem of the time at PE being so small to do the AP burns. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes I am using mechjeb to take the boring away.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-17T20:02:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmmm.

You are right - it is probably not a good idea to set up Laythe as a base of kethane operations. However I do have a backstory to make the challenge make sense. I hope to provide a game file where there is kethane in an appropriate place on laythe - the challenge is to get it with the smallest possible launch (in fact it will probably be to refuel (and so rescue) a crew that has been stranded on laythe by a fuel leak).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo back to the OP... I am thinking the best option is to burn prograde for a couple of orbits, until I have a roughly circular orbit at about 1000-1500km, than then to a series of big burns on the sun side to raise the AP to near the edge of kerbin SOI on the night side. Once a the highest AP then do the interplanetary burn. I think the problem is that I will need about 5-6 days lead time to get to the high AP, so really setting off 2 hours after the transfer window is not the best start!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-17T21:04:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you really want to do it with that 1 engine, you are going to have to do it in multiple orbits.
