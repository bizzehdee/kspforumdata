Based on the Jim Chamberlin design of the original two-crew Gemini spacecraft, the Big G would use an evolution of the Gemini avionics and combined designs of both Gemini and Apollo spacecraft.

Since it did not require a Saturn 5 to launch, the Big G could rely on other proven low-cost lifters like the S1-B or a boosted Titan III. In this exploration, the Saturn S1-B lifter is the primary launcher for Big G missions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea of the LORL was to place a large crew aboard a space station that was designed to support multiple docking ports and would be re-crewed with \u0022taxi\u0022 style launches using the Big G. The initial LORL missions would have been launched with two Saturn 5 launches and assembled in orbit. All other resupply missions would have been performed with the S1-B, leaving the remaining supply of Saturn 5 rockets for Lunar missions.

Once the chutes opened, the craft tore itself apart and crashed on the surface. The rover problem was a design issue that prevented the rover from getting power once the batteries were drained.
