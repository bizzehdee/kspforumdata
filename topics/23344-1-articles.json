I offer this information for those who don\u0027t realize it...the parts load into the game in the order in which they sit in the folder. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, using a simple and free program called \u003Ca href=\u0022http://download.cnet.com/File-Renamer-Basic/3000-2248_4-11753579.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFile Renamer Basic\u003C/a\u003E I set about adding a simple coded prefix to every folder, to influence the load order into the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe aforementioned program makes it easy to scan the contents of a folder, select items and then add a sequential prefix system to the folder names.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used a six digit system that categorized the parts by category/subcategory/item# with two digits for each. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI set up the renamer to place numbers by increments of 10, leaving room for future insertion of new parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny system of numbers or letters could work, my point is that by using a simple renaming program, the process was relatively easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, the process took about two hours. In the end I now have a parts screen in the builder that is a breeze to navigate, with things grouped just as I like them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found only one instance in which the renaming of the part folder caused an issue. This was with the ISA Map sat parts. The plugin seems to look for the part folder to find the artwork for the application icons. SO changing the name prevented the icons from being properly accessed. Easily remedied by just not altering those two particular part folders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is also worth saying, that the renaming of the folders in no way affected existing ships or flights in progress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor others who may be facing similar frustration at finding what they want in an ever expanding parts list, I hope this info is helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow on to conquer the stars.
