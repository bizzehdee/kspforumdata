In this pack there were many mods that in in 32-bit versione worked just fine. But creating this, i noticed that even a single part rocket put on the lounchpad in a new save causes me a lot of freeze and lag that make the game unplayable. So, i tried to remove and reinstall all the mod and I figured out that this problem ther\u0027s only when I install the Interstellar Mod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I though that could have been that the mod wasn\u0027t updated and I installed the Interstellar Light with tweakables, but the problem remained. I\u0027d like to play with this mod, so can anyone figure out what the problem can be?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for bad english.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mokmo","CreatedById":62363,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-31T15:35:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edid you remove the old interstellar mod folder?
