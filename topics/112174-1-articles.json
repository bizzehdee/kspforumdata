First off, I would like to say that you guys are awesome; I love the community and I\u0027ve been spectating the forums since I got this game in March of 2014. Much of what I\u0027ve learned about the game has come from reading here and on the wiki, which I\u0027m just gonna assume some of you guys also have a hand in maintaining. So thank you for all that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that my introduction is out of the way...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m perplexed by something that happened today. I created a standard heavy ascent stage (3.75m parts, asparagus staging, etc.), put a fairly heavy payload on top to test it, and as I\u0027ve become accustomed to doing, I calculated the Delta-V by hand. I came up with something like ~3800 m/s sum total for the first 3 stages. The thing that confuses me is that I\u0027m able to easily get this thing into a 75 Km orbit around Kerbin with some fuel still left in the 3d stage, but everywhere I look the Delta-V that is needed to get into orbit around Kerbin is about 4500 m/s. I downloaded MechJeb (I hadn\u0027t used it before and I must say I\u0027ve been missing out on something amazing) and it confirmed my calculations, listing my Delta-V in the first 3 stages again around 3800 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my question is: What am I forgetting to factor into this? I know I\u0027m thinking about this wrong somehow, I just want to understand exactly what I\u0027m doing/thinking wrong. Does it have something to do with the free orbital velocity one gets from launching in the direction of the rotation of Kerbin? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnything you guys can tell me to help me figure this out would be greatly appreciated! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a link to a photo of the rocket in case it helps to see it; all engines firing are Mammoth engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198036634230/screenshot/544154344546083166\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198036634230/screenshot/544154344546083166\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-07T12:20:11Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2015 12:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mr.T\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T14:45:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mr.T\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mr.T\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat am I forgetting to factor into this?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat all those charts still show the value you needed to go through the pre-1.0 souposphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T14:45:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll the sources you\u0027re looking at were from before 1.0.

How long you stayed in the gravity well affected your gravity losses, but staying below terminal velocity was enough to minimize your drag losses. However, in 1.0\u002B it really depends much more on how much drag you experience, which is a combination of design and piloting. With high TWR (1.7-2.3), an aerodynamic single stack design, and a quick gravity turn with a low ascent profile you might manage around 3200. With low TWR (1.3), a fairing the size of Gilly, and a late gravity turn with a high profile to prevent wobble you might take 4200. A good conservative number to use for planning is probably in the 3600-3800 range, with the lower end for those who favor high TWR and full throttle and the higher end for the low TWR and reduced throttle crowd.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Coga19000","CreatedById":125394,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T19:59:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe variables are always a major factor in how much Delta -v you need.
