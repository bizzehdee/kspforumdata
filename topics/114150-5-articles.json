Its a unique game that makes the player do actual engineering on complex systems. It was a great game around 0.24. \n\nBut then we had the \u0022final\u0022 release. 1.0. Unfortunately someone missed Software 101 where \u0022beta\u0022 is a feature complete release, and after final bug fixes it gets released as 1.0. Meanwhile (as in at the same time), you can have an alpha release with new features, that then turns beta, and after testing becomes 2.0 . (with out without backwards compatibility as you wish). \n\nInstead Squad has released a series of what are reallyalpha releases (new features) in their main line. This is frustrating for long term players, but much worse for Squad it will rapidly discourage any new players - the ones you were hoping would pay real money for the game and let you stay in business. This is not typical for games in production release- don\u0027t fool yourselves. \n\nI get the distinct feeling that a layer of pointy-haired management has been put in place on top of the good creative programmers at Squad. Whoever you are, its YOUR fault not theirs so stop shouting at them to fix the bugs. \n\nIf you aren\u0027t careful this is going to be a disaster for the company - which would be a shame - its one of the most creative games I\u0027ve ever seen.\n\nMy suggestion - back off. Go to 0.9, fix the bugs and release it as 2.0. Then work on an alpha -\u003E beta version with better aerodynamics, heat etc. Wait for modes to be compatible with that version, then in a year release 3.0 with the new features. Make arrangements with the modders to sell bundles of mods (like RO) as game add-ons through steam. \n\nLook - people make fun of me at work for how much time I used to spend on Kerbal, but I haven\u0027t played significantly since 1.0. I just dabble a bit with 0.9 RO because that is more stable than your main release."},{"CreatedByName":"nohelmet","CreatedById":99742,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T01:48:02Z","Content":"I really like it!

The radiators are a welcome addition and the game is a ton of fun!\n\nUsing a mod that shows detailed thermal data and experimenting with yet more low tech micro-shuttles, I completely agree the new thermal model is loads of fun! \n\nConstructing craft just got a bit more challenging with the need to ensure that the craft can re-enter safely to the limits of the current career tech level.\n\nThe new stock aero model appears to make aircraft behave much more responsively and pull Gs in a more realistic manner than before too, no longer does it feel like flying through cream of mushroom. Aircraft can also get to higher dive speeds than before."},{"CreatedByName":"xiombargdei","CreatedById":125757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T06:32:51Z","Content":"I havent played 1.0.3 or 1.0.4 yet because CKAN forbids me to install mods that are considered \u0022incompatible\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"lodger","CreatedById":126565,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T14:00:20Z","Content":"Dito.

Because my glass is half full, I will selectively quote this (but be sure to check the link.)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Why are there so few CKAN mods for 1.0.4? \n\u003E by pjf - CKAN Dev\n\u003E \n\u003E  **Because the recent KSP releases have been too stable.** Yes. Really.\n\u003E \n\u003E In the past, most mods broke with each new KSP release. Which meant that most mod authors would recompile and upload new releases. When that happened, authors would include .version files, or update their mod\u0027s metadata on KerbalStuff, and in turn, our indexing bot (which tracks about 650 mods in total) would spot the new metadata and roll it into our directory.\n\u003E \n\u003E For 1.0.4 in particular, none of this happened. It was a small bugfix release, which meant that practically everything that works in 1.0.3 also works in 1.0.4. You\u0027d think this would be great, but almost nobody has updated their .version files or KerbalStuff entries to reflect this. \n\u003E \n\u003E [...]\n\u003E \n\u003E In the meantime, there are some workarounds, namely: (details at the link)"},{"CreatedByName":"Nigeth","CreatedById":146838,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T16:54:54Z","Content":"I disagree with the assessment. It\u0027s not that KSP is too stable. It\u0027s that the mod interface has stabilized. A game can have a stable API and still be broken in places.
