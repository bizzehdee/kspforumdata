Plate armor was built to defeat blunt force trauma by deflecting the impact and fullered to resist crushing (fullers are magic). By the scenario given, jousting with blunt tips would be a bloodbath. Furthermore armorers were always on hand at the battlefield or tournament. Knightly armor can be cut off a wearer by bench shears, if you absolutely had to. Most pieces can simply be untied and removed. Plate is easier to wear than chain due to load-bearing being distributed across each section of the body. Chain was to convert lacerations and puncture wounds into bruises and broken bones. In this it prevented the risks of bleeding to death and infections. Chainmail was notorious for after-injury affects; links could break off after being crushed into the skin where bits of rivet would fester. However one never wore chainmail over skin. There was always an arming-coat of some sort which acted as padding and arrow-proofing. These coats were five or ten or twenty layers of linen, depending, and by some accounts could stop a sword. By many actual tests, they could be useful against arrows.
