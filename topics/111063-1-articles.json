I noticed that a lot of the armour worn in these RPG\u0027s look very epic and intimidating (and in some cases, very skimpy) but probably isn\u0027t something you would want to wear while traveling or dungeon crawling. You also don\u0027t want something so light even a big rat could incapacitate you.\n\n![DwarvenArmor_Skyriim.jpg](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20111121180131/elderscrolls/images/b/b3/DwarvenArmor_Skyriim.jpg)\n\nYeah, it looks cool, but how hot would it get in there? In the cramped and stuffy halls of an ancient tomb, how would you be able to react quickly to *anything*? Wouldn\u0027t those giant boots alert potential enemies of your presence? If there was an enemy too strong for you, or a particularly blunt trap, or a 5 foot high ledge (shoulda brought a stepladder), you couldn\u0027t do run away or do anything. You get the picture.\n\nAnd the higher level you go, the more impractical and bulky things get (female armour gets the opposite treatment)\n\n![tumblr_mi1dn0k6E51ro61hco1_250.jpg](https://24.media.tumblr.com/2467f983d52f57b15e7f246329fe6017/tumblr_mi1dn0k6E51ro61hco1_250.jpg)\n\nBut we are not here to complain about that.\n\nIf we were to make an RPG dungeon crawl as realistic as possible without taking out the danger (traps, dragons, level 5 Dire Weasels), what kind of attire would be appropriate for it? Also, if you were to be ambushed on the road to said dungeon by bandits, what would you like to be wearing?\n\nI thought at one point that a cuirass would be a fantastic adventuring armour-piece.\n\nDISCUSS!"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T22:13:20Z","Content":"Not to rain on your parade, but both medieval European armour and traditional Japanese armour were not much less bulky than the one shown in the image. Even modern soldiers have heavy army boots and bulky vests and jackets. Of course, game armour gets embellished, but people go to war in and with stuff that is pretty intrusive.\n\nAlso, a lot of games make you less silent with big, heavy boots on. The TeS series do this, for instance.

Quite the opposite, in fact.

The key is that it\u0027s custom-fitted to you.\n\nThis should surprise no one once you think about it. Yes, it was not worn when it wasn\u0027t necessary, but warrior nobles spent the equivalent of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars for kit, and they would not have put up with that if it unless it gave them a significant advantage in battle. And weapons that were reasonably effective against it such as warhammers (more like picks, actually) were carried both by unarmored foes and other knights, so it wasn\u0027t just a slugfest against impenetrable armor. Knights were rightly feared for their battle prowess, and not because they could only stand and take blows.

Knights were effectively impervious to arrows at all but the closest ranges and greatest forces, as evidenced by the abandoning of the shield.\n\nI don\u0027t know what Iskierka is talking about. Plate armor was built to defeat blunt force trauma by deflecting the impact and fullered to resist crushing (fullers are magic). By the scenario given, jousting with blunt tips would be a bloodbath. Furthermore armorers were always on hand at the battlefield or tournament. Knightly armor can be cut off a wearer by bench shears, if you absolutely had to. Most pieces can simply be untied and removed. Plate is easier to wear than chain due to load-bearing being distributed across each section of the body. Chain was to convert lacerations and puncture wounds into bruises and broken bones. In this it prevented the risks of bleeding to death and infections. Chainmail was notorious for after-injury affects; links could break off after being crushed into the skin where bits of rivet would fester. However one never wore chainmail over skin. There was always an arming-coat of some sort which acted as padding and arrow-proofing. These coats were five or ten or twenty layers of linen, depending, and by some accounts could stop a sword. By many actual tests, they could be useful against arrows. Most first-rate harnesses were a composite affair of all three.\n\nWere I picking my own armor without a budget, I would wear a Maximilian harness with a longsword. Were I paying for it, I would wear an open salet helm, chain coif and hauberk, longsword, shield and warhammer."},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T05:20:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Knights were effectively impervious to arrows at all but the closest ranges and greatest forces, as evidenced by the abandoning of the shield.\n\nPowerful bows with armour piercing tips tend to do nasty things to plate and its wearer, as it does to pretty much all other things.

Chainmail offer very good protection against cutting, you have to pierce, the padding give some protection against blunt but it works the same way as with leather. \n\nPlate offer best protection against everything and is lighter than heavy chainmail, since most parts has an front and back its seldom no problem removing, blunt work well against plate as most other stuff don\u0027t work, you can pierce but this is also hard. lamellar is sort of halfway between chain and plate, most plate armors will have laminar parts even chain parts. \n\nDownside with plate is that its expensive, has to be pretty custom made, and is hard to put on.\n\nAs for adventuring, an light chainmail will protect you against daggers and lighter hits without being to heavy."},{"CreatedByName":"Wesreidau","CreatedById":75430,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T05:47:03Z","Content":"Agincourt was the test of longbows against plate, and the French knights largely made it to the English lines.
