Here is what I am looking to do in order of importance:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Must be able to mine resources and build a functional base to refuel and with luck even build new ships and rockets at I think I saw a mod that does this in fact I think I even have it installed right now but have had trouble getting that far in research. This will require some way to move the materials too for refueling I think that was called Kerbal Attachment system?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. More realistic flight system (I think this is called Ferrum or something like that I do not currently have it) With 1 and 2 I could also be interested in life support systems that can also be made self sufficient at the base (mun or mimas) with a lot of work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. More parts to make realistic flight more friendly. Aka Fairings to put around payloads and possibly some more plane parts? Would like to have awesome space shuttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Some future technology eventually like I have seen in Scott Manley\u0027s Interstellar quest. To beam power and harvest antimatter etc. some big big projects for end game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. More Science projects to work on possibly something that is continuous but not entirely unbalancing. Like an orbiting space station with a science lab that you fly projects up to to be researched for 10 science per project or something. You could haul up 10 projects for 100 science in a shuttle after you dock or if the life support stuff is running, run up 2 projects and a ton of supplies for your researchers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat mods can I get to do this? How exactly do I make them work and play well with each other; if it is a RAM issue and I need to install some odd texture pack items where can I snag them and how do I set them up to run correctly etc? If you guys can help me out with this and think there is something else that would go with this group without causing further difficulties I would appreciate that as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBedlem\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will post what mods I currently have in my gamedata folder in a bit to let you know where I have been really in playing.
