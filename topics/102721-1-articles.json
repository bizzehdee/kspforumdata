I\u0027m getting good at this KSP thing. This took a mere one hour and 116 parts, including the \u003Cem\u003Esingle\u003C/em\u003E test flight. Much better than I expected... I only had to F9 once! Which is actually due to the only inaccuracy that sneaked in, BTW: since I couldn\u0027t get SpaceX\u0027s awesome tankage mass fractions, a single \u0022Merlin\u0022 (LV-T45s) just can\u0027t give TWR over 1 going down, so you have to go with three like in the retro-burn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NNDcdCv.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NNDcdCv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what is it that I like enough to put it out there so quickly? Well, mostly the fact that I eyeballed the fuel level on the first try to the point where staging the (empty) second stage after landing the core (no mods and all done in one go sequentially) leaves the Dwagon on a 99x70km orbit while the second stage goes back to a disposal 55x80km orbit (two big decouplers working on such small weights can do wonders). Talk about nailing it! The Dwagon itself is clipped to kingdom come, of course, but it has 500m/s, TWR 1.3, and the four (pressurised) seats baselined for NASA. I have yet to land it, though, and I didn\u0027t put chutes in the prototype (truth be told, I didn\u0027t expect to make orbit without something going wrong). Maybe I\u0027ll regret that when I get around to testing reentry... I threw in a couple when I revised the action groups for you guys, though, so that should pose no problem. Also, check out the trunk, plenty of room in there for... ... ...well, it\u0027s not really functional ^^\u0027.

It\u0027s quite simple, really, though it has its challenging moments if you want to go all reusable on the sucker:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Straight up until 10kms, throttling down a notch once you reach 130m/s to keep aerodynamic efficiency hovering at about 95%, According to KER.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Pitch about 2.5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA towards the 90 (half a line on the navball), and burn the core until your apoapsis reads about 60kms. This will leave the core falling mostly over KSC. Then cut throttle and stage, you need that remaining fuel to land!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Stage again to turn on the upper stage, throttle back up (slowly, it clips a bit), and burn horizontal until you run the second stage dry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Switch back to the core now, it\u0027ll be dropping quite close to KSC. Hit \u0022brakes\u0022 to turn off the excessive engines, and do the correction burns to put you as close to KSC as you dare (the trajectories thingy helps a lot). Landing gear is \u0022G\u0022, of course. Good luck with the landing burn, there is margin in there, but I wouldn\u0027t drop under 50 m/s until I was really close to the ground. Also, even though I set her up at a 6.2 slope (!), I wouldn\u0027t try more than 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA: I landed at 1.5 m/s, and kept her pointing skywards with RCS while I hurriedly locked suspensions on the legs on one side, then proceeded to be very surprised when that kept it from toppling over. Plenty of control authority and stability, though, if you are a good pilot you will be able to do it without any problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, excuse the crappy images.

It\u0027s quite simple, really, though it has its challenging moments if you want to go all reusable on the sucker:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Straight up until 10kms, throttling down a notch once you reach 130m/s to keep aerodynamic efficiency hovering at about 95%, According to KER.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Pitch about 2.5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA towards the 90 (half a line on the navball), and burn the core until your apoapsis reads about 60kms. This will leave the core falling mostly over KSC. Then cut throttle and stage, you need that remaining fuel to land!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Stage again to turn on the upper stage, throttle back up (slowly, it clips a bit), and burn horizontal until you run the second stage dry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Switch back to the core now, it\u0027ll be dropping quite close to KSC. Hit \u0022brakes\u0022 to turn off the excessive engines, and do the correction burns to put you as close to KSC as you dare (the trajectories thingy helps a lot). Landing gear is \u0022G\u0022, of course. Good luck with the landing burn, there is margin in there, but I wouldn\u0027t drop under 50 m/s until I was really close to the ground. Also, even though I set her up at a 6.2 slope (!), I wouldn\u0027t try more than 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA: I landed at 1.5 m/s, and kept her pointing skywards with RCS while I hurriedly locked suspensions on the legs on one side, then proceeded to be very surprised when that kept it from toppling over. Plenty of control authority and stability, though, if you are a good pilot you will be able to do it without any problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, excuse the crappy images.

Which made for an interesting takeoff, with the full weight of fuel you can just barely keep it vertical on the pad... with help of the RCS. Looks like my rocket vents fuel like real rockets!

Even though it doesn\u0027t really matter much since you don\u0027t have to touch the controls on the way up, it\u0027s a mostly vertical first stage burn. However, the core on it\u0027s own has always been very rigid, and the aerodynamic surfaces on top means it is \u003Cem\u003Eextremely\u003C/em\u003E stable when going down almost empty, while the Vernors still give enough control authority to put it it at \u0026gt;45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA attack angles.
