You can certainly make them just for the fun of driving around but there are no structured goals that rovers are really suited to. Without mods (and even with them) it just takes too long for a rover to travel far from the landing zone, meaning at best a rover might be able to visit one other biome if it landed really close by. Visiting other biomes just seems faster and easier using rocket power. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea is to use the upcoming contract system to let the game provide incentives for short trips on a body you have already landed on. The game would periodically generate a contract for performing a specific experiment at a specific location (within 1m). In terms of wording it would be like \u0022\u003Cem\u003EWe\u0027ll give you this science/money/reputation reward if you take a closer look at that cool rock for us\u003C/em\u003E\u0022. The contract generator would make these \u0022look at a rock\u0022 contracts very close to craft that have already landed, within a dozen km at most (in theory these contracts represent a request to followup on previous biome wide reading with a more detailed reading of a specific object detected). And there would be a short time limit so you couldn\u0027t just launch a brand new mission. While you could you rockets to make a hop to that location you\u0027d need a very precise landing to be close enough to claim credit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spinomonkey","CreatedById":102142,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-17T22:10:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like it!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CsendesMark","CreatedById":101916,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-17T22:32:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this idea! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-17T22:49:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome enabling parts for this would be nice, as currently you\u0027d need to bring along a command pod to \u0027store\u0027 reports, results and samples\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome kind of mountable sample \u0027pod\u0027 which you can store your collected Science! in allowing you to drive and sample and drive and sample and drive and sample without needing to go back to the lander command pod after every sample.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe even some \u0027rolling science\u0027 which requires activation and then a certain amount of traverse\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaking some terrain scatter solid and sampleable could also be interesting, you don\u0027t want to land near it in case you land on it and tip over, but you still want to be near it so you can drive over with your rock drill for a sample\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nemrav","CreatedById":91029,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-17T23:07:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suggested not too long ago an ai that could, even with timewarp drive your rover to another biome to do an experiment, not to many people read it due to me naming it something people didn\u0027t recognize...
