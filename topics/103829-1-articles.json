To me they look like 3.75m cylinders with the sides cut away.

The B9 HL parts come with a fully circular version anyway. The reference is 24 sides for a cylinder for most KSP parts, so that should be enough as it is. You can load any part into Blender with Taniwha\u0027s .mu loader to get the basic mesh to use as a template - you don\u0027t have to use Blender to model further, obviously \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB9 HL compatible part on the right, 24 sided cyl @1.875m radius in yellow - where to slice should be obvious \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/rJJ6m2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7659/16892424717_57d70f6bec_c.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002216892424717_57d70f6bec_c.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chaos_Klaus","CreatedById":140720,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T09:54:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethat image tells me everything I need to know. :]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethank you!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
