Once two ships are docked they show as a single ship on the map. Likewise if you launch a ship with more than one probe core attached (so that you can de-orbit spent booster stages for example) then the extra cores only show up once you decouple or undock them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) I\u0027m not completely sure but yes I think so. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) No. You could have a single large ship consisting of the station module and an \u0027engine\u002Bprobe\u0027 section attached to it with a decoupler. Dock the whole thing to your station, decouple the engine\u002Bprobe and you\u0027re good to go. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Yes - right click on the core you want and select \u0027Control from here\u0027. You can do the same with spare docking ports too, which is helpful for lining up the station to receive new modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry about the bullet point answers - hope they help.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-21T06:04:42Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2013 06:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Akala\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00ABl","CreatedById":58210,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T09:38:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KSK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KSK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E2) I\u0027m not completely sure but yes I think so.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) I am completly sure, it does \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce docked, the parts of you station will share the ressources.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeoMorph","CreatedById":58200,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T09:55:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is definitely something a bit wonky with the \u0022Who is in control\u0022. For example you dock to something and then you get control of the whole thing. But undock and you don\u0027t get back control of your original ship but the ship you docked to.

I guess resource sharing means that I can dock modules to the station that don\u0027t have cores?
