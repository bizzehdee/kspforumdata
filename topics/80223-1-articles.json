I\u0027ve been playing KSP for only a few weeks. I did start a career mode in 23.5, but I got only as far as Minmus, and I didn\u0027t come close to finishing the tech tree. Last week I started a new career game in 24.2, and I\u0027ve been loving it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first missions were probably standard stuff. Launches, orbits, parts-testing, Kerbil-rescuing, etc. From a newb\u0027s perspective, the contracts are pretty nice. The \u0022rescue Kerbil\u0022 contracts forced me to learn how to do an orbital rendez-vous. With some help from the nice folks in the Gameplay Questions thread, I was able to figure it out, and I now can do them reasonably well. The \u0022test parts\u0022 contracts introduce me to new parts, or even to existing parts that I\u0027ve been ignoring, and they give me a look at them. These contracts have also induced me to make a plane, because I thought it would be fun to splash down with a jet to run those splashed-down-test contracts. I also test some stuff on a rover I made, just because. My first couple docking efforts went surprisingly smoothly, partly thanks to the practice rescuing Kerbils.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I soon had a couple million roots, because I\u0027m afraid I\u0027ve been rather liberal about using the \u0022revert\u0022 button. (It\u0027s that, not the reload-quicksave button, that I abuse too much.) So off I went to the Mun and Minmus. I stranded a Kerbil on the moon because I didn\u0027t have enough fuel, but that turned out okay, because he did a few plant-flag missions until I decided that was a bit cheesy. I had an easier time hopping around Minmus for science, as its lower gravity requires less fuel expenditure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the past day or two, I\u0027ve been using Minmus as a practice proving-ground for my upcoming launch window to Duna. (I\u0027m using Kerbal Alarm Clock to help plan launch window; what an amazing mod. I had resisted installing it for a while, but I got it yesterday, and I\u0027m glad I did. My other mods are Kerbal Engineer Redux and Final Frontier. Mod-light so far, but I look forward to playing things like Remote Tech 2 and Deadly Reentry later.) So I put a space station and a refueling station in orbit around Minmus, then just sent another manned mission there. The intention was to have a lander sample a bit more science, then return to orbit to dock and refuel just to make sure I could do that. But before I could rendez-vous with my tanker, my Duna window started to open.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s now 2-3 hours before the optimal launch window, and I\u0027d like to start sending stuff toward Duna. My first effort was a miserable failure. I figured I\u0027d try sending a simple orange tank, equipped with a nuclear engine, to Duna, just to get an idea of what the maneuver nodes would be like. But I didn\u0027t make my lifter big enough, and I had to try to fire the nuclear engine to make the final push into orbit, and the engine gave out or something. (I know the LV-N doesn\u0027t like atmospheres.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI need to think more systematically about how to build infrastructure at a place like Duna. I was thinking tanker, then space station, then lander. I\u0027m still not quite sure how to make or use a tug. (Do tugs operate only in orbit, or do people use them for transfers?) I\u0027m still reading posts on the forums for guidance, but it\u0027s kinda fun to engage in my own disastrous trial-and-error too.

One lesson I\u0027ve learned is to put docking ports on *everything*, so my next vessel was a capsule, the Duna Orbiter, manned by three Kerbils. They\u0027ll dock with the station, theoretically.

So I went into landing mode, stopped my horizontal velocity, slowed vertical velocity, deployed two radial chutes, and ... landed smoothly. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E It was almost anticlimactic, it was so easy. I\u0027m sure it\u0027s not always so easy there, but the descent was straightforward (though I\u0027m not sure how much the chutes really helped). The only complication was that I didn\u0027t have time to plan *where* I would land, and I ended up on the dark side of the planet, so I couldn\u0027t see where I was landing until I was a few meters off the ground. I guess I got a bit lucky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.aganazzar.com/HA/Razzle/StrategyPC/KSP/DunaA.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DunaA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Spock","CreatedById":116542,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-07T21:02:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI sent probes and landers off to Eve, and two probes to Moho.

I added RCS to the rover to help it land softly when the time comes. I\u0027ve tested the rover extensively on Kerbin, but a low-gravity environment will be another kettle of fish. Assuming I can get it *onto* that low-gravity environment. The whole kaboodle is on its way to the Mun now. I used the gigantic Kerbodyne tanks and engines to lift it to orbit, with fuel left over to help make the transfer to the Mun. Now the rocket is in its second stage (the LV-N). I hope the LV-909 will be enough to land the thing.
