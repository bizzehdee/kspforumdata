I can get some fairly detailed (static) mechanics modeled if I wanted to.\n\nThe problem with that is the rigging and animation.  The torus is animated through simple scaling and there is no (easy) way to keep the orientations/rotations/positions of animated elements in synch with the torus inflation.  Tried a few of those yesterday, and it looked terrible due to things getting out of synch/misaligned during the animation; it looked fine when deployed, and not terrible while stowed, but during the animation it made me cringe....  (Someone with experience at skinned meshes / bone based rigging could probably pull it off; but I\u0027ve not been able to get bone rigging to do -anything- properly, it always mangles the model in undesirable ways).  Even if I could keep things in sych, anything that is part of the torus mesh itself ends up beings skewed by the scaling (such as the attach points for the braces, end up being odd shapes in the stowed animation state).\n\nTake for example the external scissors-jack type structure from the image; If I parent the structure to the torus itself it will stay mostly in synch, but then the meshes get skewed during the animation (e.g. a round pipe will end up looking flat when in the stowed state; things that should be square end up diamond shaped).  If I rig the external structure as independent meshes the animation becomes much more straightforward to rig, and looks much better (no skewing), but then I have ~128 separate animated objects in the model, which is terrible from a \u0027use in a game\u0027 optimization standpoint (and still may take hours to animate).  Even if I were to add bones I\u0027m pretty sure I would need \u003E100 bones in order to animate it properly.
