I\\\u0027ve been lurking this forum and played the game for a while now, so even tho this is my first post - I\\\u0027m not a complete newbie ;P.\n\nI have a couple questions.\n\n - In the next update (0.15) there will be a space vehicle building where you can build that C7 aircraft for example. Will this building allow you to build in a modular fashion like the rockets? Will it be only limited to flying or can you also build ground vehicles? Can the vehicles only be flown inside the atmosphere or also in space? Can you attach the vehicle to a rocket construct and carry it to a different planet and fly/drive around there?\n\n - Will it ever be possible to construct things outside of the factories? Like in orbit or on other planets?\n\nThanks for your time ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)."},{"CreatedByName":"Rico88","CreatedById":3712,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-07T20:01:32Z","Content":"Welcome to the Forums!\n\n- You will be able to use every part in both buildings, so you can build rockets horizontaly and planes verticaly as well. The construction will be modular. Aircrafts will be able to fly in space, but you have to add rocket fuel tanks and engines to it to do that. The airplane parts\\\u0027 fuel can only be used for atmospheric engines. Although this might change in future updates. \n\n- In orbit yes, as far as I know the actual method hasn\\\u0027t been decided yet, but it will be probably done by the means of docking or similar to that. You will be able to build bases on other planetes, but it\\\u0027s still a question whether spacecraft construction will be included or not."},{"CreatedByName":"Tingle","CreatedById":22543,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-07T20:31:58Z","Content":"Thanks ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nEdit: One more question, how can I develop a plugin for KSP?
