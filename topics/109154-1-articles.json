Do the strutting(from the lower stage to the fairing-encased upper stage), temporarily detach everything below the fairing so you can complete the fairing, then re-attach the rest of the rocket. Detaching stuff removes the strut colliders, so the fairing can be completed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azuratte","CreatedById":72598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T05:10:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EERRRRMAGEERRRRD...

In short, you can\u0027t (normally) connect either end of the strut directly to the fairing shell, as when you try to mouse over it it dodges out of the way; but what you CAN do is place something (anything really, since this is a temporary piece) outside the fairing and then run a strut \u003Cem\u003Ethrough\u003C/em\u003E the fairing.
