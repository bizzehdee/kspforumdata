In fact its best if the LS system has a kind of built-in grace period of 10 or 20 days with no ill-effects so you don\u0027t really have to worry about it for the first several missions, and even after that consequences can set in slowly. Say you send your kerbals to an asteroid and its going to take 50 days to get there, but you forgot to pack any snacks. After 15 days without food they start to get cranky and the value of any science they collect starts dropping off at 1%/day (we don\u0027t even know if science will be a thing, but just as an example). By the time they got there they\u0027d be pretty grumpy, only collecting 65% of full science value, and by the time they got home they\u0027d be downright miserable at 15%. Once they arrive home or to a station or colony with plenty of snacks their happiness would climb back up, say 5%/day to be nice. After 17 days they\u0027d be hale and healthy and back to %100 capacity. There could similar consequences for lack of habitation space, and similar negative impact on things like mining and research.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MechBFP","CreatedById":184845,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-08-03T03:54:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the primary design goals is to allow the player to time warp as they want to allow them to do what they want without having to babysit anything or come back and see all their work destroyed/lost.

The crew won\u0027t be happy for the duration of the trip spent at this higher radiation environment, and you might only be able to have the \u0022glowy bits\u0022 active for short periods at a time to avoid outright (semi-permanently) disabling the crew, but it shouldn\u0027t outright kill them.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf that crew does become \u0022semi-permanently disabled\u0022 as I was describing, the function of \u0022Medical care\u0022 would be solely available at colonies with gravity in a certain range (more than Mun but less than Eve).\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere would be no \u0022dedicated doctor-type crew\u0022, the fact that the crew becomes part of the population of a colony would be enough to say that you \u0022saved\u0022 them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT:\u003Cbr\u003E\nI guess what I\u0027m saying is that if I\u0027m going to have to deal with a Life Support mechanic, it should punish me if I mess up the DESIGN of the craft or colony, but if I don\u0027t mess up then I shouldn\u0027t have to pay any attention to it while I\u0027m FLYING the craft or doing things with the colony that aren\u0027t specifically about the life support.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-08-08T19:21:29Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2022 07:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by SciMan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"t_v","CreatedById":213541,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-08-08T21:05:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224162104\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022209200\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221659986176\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002212748\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SciMan\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, SciMan said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, we further shouldn\u0027t need separate recycling parts because hey guess what \u003Cstrong\u003Emore parts means more lag\u003C/strong\u003E, and if they\u0027re not procedural then you\u0027ll eventually be needing more than one recycler on your ship or colony.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thing is, I think some people want life support to run out in the early game, so the recyclers can\u2019t just be bundled into the pods, because early game pods still need to be viable in the late game, otherwise those parts are never getting reused.

(And then change the tolerance zone to the place where they recovered)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, since this is an LS thread, why not talk about how I would like gravity to play into LS? Kerbals all have a gravity that they are adapted to, and this (alongside their bravery/stupidity) determines their g-force limits (both upper and lower) as well as their strength. The upper limit is just the standard KSP 1 where Kerbals pass out, and the lower limit is where their strength begins to degrade. If a kerbal is left in 0g or at a gravity lower than their limit, their gravity will slowly decrease to the one that they are experiencing, or down to a minimum if they were in 0g. A kerbal who has gone for years in 0g will pass out during engine burns and while landed on pretty much any celestial body. This isn\u2019t lethal, but it sure reduces their effectiveness.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo get a kerbal\u2019s g-tolerance back up, you simply need to accelerate them, and they will slowly build up tolerance, maybe at a faster rate than they lost it, but large changes certainly cannot be done in just a few days. I\u2019d like the kerbals to not gain tolerance if they are passed out, so you have to ramp up the gravity slowly, but I\u2019m not sure if that would work well in gameplay. I think this is a good mechanic because it affects not only the design of your ships but also the design of your flight paths, the burns you do, and other elements of the game. Additionally, I\u2019d love to see Ovin kerbals (are their last names Ovman or Oviman? Oman?) on a planet like Duna, jumping super high and carrying full tanks of fuel.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-08-09T07:51:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224162104\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022209200\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221659986176\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002212748\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SciMan\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 hours ago, SciMan said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, I\u0027m looking at those of you that want to use that new Mammoth-II as a Kerbal cannon\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif it\u0027s not science, let it be a sacrifice for the Kraken\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-08-09T12:56:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think if you are going to talk LS look at which moders are part of team, see which systems they built or had a hand in and what that might tell about possible thinking.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe one that comes to mind is Roverdude \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E LS which was designed fairly late and reasonably simple and scalable.
