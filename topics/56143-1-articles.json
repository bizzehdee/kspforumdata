I have done part editing before without an issue. If I put it in the \u0022parts\u0022 folder, the game loads everything, but in the VAB no parts show in the tabs. Like there is nothing there to select. If I put it in with squad\u0027s parts, the game loads in the start up screen until it reached that file and stops. What could be the problem? I edited mass (presumably the dry mass because it was .5), and name of part, file folder name, and amounts of fuel and oxidizer in the correct proportions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TZ9AhYI.jpg?2\u0022 alt=\u0022TZ9AhYI.jpg?2\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/K0v5SGD.jpg?2\u0022 alt=\u0022K0v5SGD.jpg?2\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-14T19:16:32Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2013 07:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tank Buddy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tarrow","CreatedById":33293,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-14T19:45:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tank Buddy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tank Buddy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat could be the problem?

I ran into something perhaps even sillier than your issue recently: I duplicate all of my LFO and RCS tanks, so that I can assemble payloads and launch them without the fuel weight. By sending the empty payload to an orbiting fuel station, I can save on launch weight, thereby achieving greater overall payloads to orbit. (The added benefit is that, once fueled, my payload is 100% fuel capacity, whereas launching fueled payloads generally means using some of its own internal fuel to simply achieve parking orbit to begin with.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny at rate, in doing so, in one of my recent edits I accidentally entered \u0022-\u0022 (hyphen) instead of 0 (zero) for the fuel content. The load screen got to that part file and just hung. Took a few minutes of trial and error to button down the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlways backup your files before modding them, sir. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
