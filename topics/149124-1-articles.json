When I unzip the 1.1.3 archive into my applications folder, it creates a KSP osx_2 folder inserted of updating the KSP osx folder with it\u0027s Saves and mods history. If I unzip it into the KSP osx folder, it creates another KSP osx folder nested within it.

You will have to re- download all of your mods as they will have been updated since 1.0.4.
