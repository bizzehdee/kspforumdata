Well, they have interstellar flight.  And they must have used anti-matter pion propulsion to do it.  (or maybe a black hole engine).\n\nSo there\u0027s actually one big advantage we\u0027d have on Earth.  Warning time.  Their ship would take decades to decelerate, and leave a flare of gamma rays as it does so.  Both engine types emit much of their exhaust energy in the form of gamma rays.\n\nOk, what else do the aliens have?  They probably have molecular nanotechnology, and they probably can copy themselves very rapidly given the needed resources.  But their starship itself is probably very small and light at the end of an interstellar voyage, having burned off most of it\u0027s mass during the trip as propellant and expended stages.\n\nIf that\u0027s true - again, I\u0027m assuming *plausible* limitations based on *current* scientific knowledge - then it\u0027s not hopeless.\n\nBasically you have to assume that the alien ship is higher quality than anything we can make on earth.  It can probably reconfigure itself and repair damage very rapidly.  So you need at least 100 : 1 odds.  If the alien ship weighs 1000 tons of payload\\*, you need to send 100 kilotons of warships to intercept it.  And you have to reach it before it can dock with an oort cloud object and grow rapidly into an unstoppable fleet.\n\nWhat would the warships be?  Orion nuclear pulse battleships, armed with lasers and nuclear howitzer rounds.  Obviously.  There\u0027s no stealth in space so you just have to get into range.  Realistically you\u0027d probably want to try to ram the alien ship.  You\u0027ve got to assume that long before you get into range, the alien ship would probably reconfigure itself into a gamma ray laser with incredible range or something.  Maybe 100 : 1 odds isn\u0027t enough...\n\n\\* you calculate the payload mass of the alien ship with spectroscopy to analyze their engine flare, then you look at how fast it is decelerating.\n\nIt certainly sounds like an interesting scenario.  \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-20T18:46:28Z\u0022 title=\u002209/20/2016 06:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by SomeGuy123**"},{"CreatedByName":"Diche Bach","CreatedById":76097,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-20T18:54:24Z","Content":"Aren\u0027t \u0022wormhole\u0022 generators just about as plausible as \u0022pion\u0022 propulsion (whatever that is)?\n\nAre the tracking and targeting parameters even realistic?

If you had typed pion propulsion into wikipedia, you\u0027d get this : [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatter_rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatter_rocket)\n\nTLDR, if you combine antiprotons and protons you get charged particles called pions.  You can redirect them out the back with magnetic fields.  People have worked out how strong the magnets would need to be and what geometry they would be in.  All feasible with current science.  The missing piece is mass production of antimatter but there are plausible methods to do that.\n\nA ship decelerating from interstellar flight headed for an Oort cloud object would be interceptable as it would be going far slower at the end of it\u0027s journey.\n\nThere isn\u0027t stealth in space.  All weapons use thrusters to course correct during flight, casablanca howitzer rounds would have onboard control and thrusters.   \n\nThere\u0027s no reason to assume that the aliens could \u0022hack\u0022 or \u0022fool\u0022 human systems they have never encountered, especially since the hard laws of physics means their ship must emit a signature flare that is incredibly bright in order to have the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E for interstellar flight.\n\nYes, if the aliens plan to ram the earth we are screwed.  I\u0027m assuming they recognize the earth, as a naturally occurring biosphere, is in itself valuable and they intend to seize it without destroying it\u0027s value.  Their plan, if they got that far, would be to dock with oort cloud objects.  Self replicating factories would rapidly expand, and in a few years they\u0027d have an unstoppable fleet of thousands or millions of warships.  They\u0027d be able to conquer earth by sniping all the military forces with laser fire from orbit and then sending ground robots to the surface to root out any remaining resistance.

It is true that science is a bit uncertain about certain critical facts\\* as we\u0027ve never seen a black hole, so using one as an engine may not be possible - but from *current* knowledge it *is* possible.  All it is is E=mc^2 in the opposite direction.  The black hole is acting like a perfect converter of matter to energy, and then your ship just has to reflect the released gamma rays (doable, using methods demonstrated on earth) backwards.  The black hole must be able to hold an electric charge so that it can be kept attached to your ship\u0027s engine bell via magnetic or electric fields.\n\nI find is reasonable plausibly that you can do this.  What isn\u0027t plausible is wormholes because they require negative energy, which current science has never observed anywhere.  We\u0027ve observed black holes and theorize that a small artificial one would do what we want.\n\nThose theories may be wrong - but maybe fusion drives are also impossible.  Maybe AI\u0027s impossible.  And molecular nanotech.  Essentially you can assume that anything that doesn\u0027t exist right now this very week is impossible due to undiscovered laws of the universe.  I would call that \u0022motivated cognition\u0022 - you disagree with me on plausibility and thus want everything I want to be impossible.\n\n\\* the 2 major critical facts are : can a black hole hold an electric charge, and how easy is it to feed a tiny black hole via a particle beam?\n\nTLDR, a black hole engine is : \n\n1.  Ram together metal rods at close to the speed of light to form a black hole using an apparatus that spans across a solar system\n\n2. Feed the resulting black hole from a particle beam so it remains the same size.  Size determines power output, it would emit gigawatts to petawatts in the form of gamma rays so it burns matter constantly.  Feed the hole a diet rich in either positively or negatively charged particles so that it retains a charge, even if said charge is actually matter clumped at the event horizon and the hole itself is neutral.\n\n3.  Using magnets and electric fields, install it in a starship, which is a gigantic parabolic dish of gamma ray reflective lensing material that bend the gamma rays to all travel backwards.  \n\n4.  Ride that baby to wherever you want.  You can even collect interstellar hydrogen to feed the black hole, unlike a fusion ramscoop you would actually gain velocity doing this.  You have an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E of something like 5C...and an acceleration somewhere between a few centimeters per second^2 to m/s^2.  (limit is how well you can reject waste heat from the gamma ray reflector and how much of the gamma rays are absorbed)\n\nAn infinite improbability drive is a purely fictional contrivance and it has no mechanism described whatsoever.  I\u0027m sure you can see the difference now between the 2.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-20T19:35:38Z\u0022 title=\u002209/20/2016 07:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by SomeGuy123**"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-20T20:33:27Z","Content":"Disagree.
