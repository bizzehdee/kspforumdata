It will not completely save you because the root part of a vessel can change in flight (for example when undocking, or when parts are destroyed). On the other hand a scaled root part is completely fine while building, or when using a vessel as a subassembly.

Or is there some specific restriction regarding landing gears?\n\nIt should work, but I am not sure how good the exponents for the landing gear module are (like braking force or suspension stiffness). I think I remember tiny wheels that did not support as much weight as I expected. However, the landing gear module is probably not worth too much research because it will be redone in the next KSP version.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Hi, I\u0027m having trouble with the newest Tweakscale (221) to work with the newest Modular Fuel Tanks (560). The tank fuel amount won\u0027t scale anymore with MFT, works without it though. Any ideas how to get them to work along each other?\n\nMFT does its own TweakScale support, so I do not touch fuel amounts if a MFT module is present. Most likely the breaking change comes from MFT.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m having the same problem and I have no idea what\u0027s causing it.\n\u003E Here are pictures and the log file as requested.

I looked at the .cfg and the definitions are missing. This is as of version 2.2.1.\n\nAlso, not really a bug, but an observation. I think the scaling of lifting surfaces is a bit odd... bringing a \u0022FAT-455\u0022 control surface down to 50% scale will bring it to a similar size to the 100% scale \u0022Elevon 1\u0022... So it should be capable of maneuvering the aircraft just about the same as the Elevon 1. But it doesn\u0027t, despite having a slightly greater surface area (even at 50% scale), the scaled FAT-455 is incredibly lethargic compared to it.\n\nIt seems like the scaling is taking into account the cross section of the wing in addition to the surface area in order to generate a lift (and drag?) rating. It\u0027s really odd to see a thinner wing and control surface at full deflection barely moving an aircraft when a fatter control surface with the same surface area results in quite a bit more maneuverability.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-07T18:11:58Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2015 06:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Justicier**"},{"CreatedByName":"tjsnh","CreatedById":108021,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T10:35:46Z","Content":"So, ignorant noob question. \n\nJust started messing with this mod this morning. \n\nIf I want to change the **default** size (say, of a fuel tank - nothing fancy) , is that something tweakscale can do for me if I edit the cfgs ?"},{"CreatedByName":"Evil4Zerggin","CreatedById":147214,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T04:13:12Z","Content":"Great mod!
