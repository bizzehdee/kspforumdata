I either come in too hard or too fast (not having enough runway to break on). I\u0027ve played quite a bit of flight sims, so this shouldn\u0027t be too hard, but I don\u0027t have my joystick anymore, so I might be hampered by needing to use keyboard. \n\nHOwever, when I come from orbit, I find it hard to line up with the runway. The cockpit view is not that good, and the externals are not much better. As I don\u0027t have the luxury of landing legs, or circle the airfield, I find a lot of error in descent speed is made trying to align. \n\nA way would be to place probes, giving markers similar to a real runway approach. But how to place these so that they\u0027re correctly aligned?"},{"CreatedByName":"Dedjal","CreatedById":57220,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T18:30:45Z","Content":"Place flags at both ends"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T18:33:40Z","Content":"HSI and ILS mod - [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85353-1-0-2-NavUtilities-ft-HSI-Instrument-Landing-System-v0-5-1-RC-1-%2AJune-2015%2A](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85353-1-0-2-NavUtilities-ft-HSI-Instrument-Landing-System-v0-5-1-RC-1-%2AJune-2015%2A)"},{"CreatedByName":"Xyphos","CreatedById":139010,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T18:42:58Z","Content":"build a 2-kerbal rover in SPH\n\ndrive rover PAST the end of the run way, in the grassy area\n\nplant a flag named \u0022AIM HERE\u0022\n\ndrive rover to other side, PAST the run way, in the grassy area\n\nplant a flag named \u0022YOU MISSED IT\u0022\n\nline up the flags and profit."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T18:43:57Z","Content":"I find chase view to be best for landing planes.

Since the runway runs perfectly EAST/West, the 90/270 degree marker is your target that you want the prograde marker to line up with.

It can be an easy mistake to think you\u0027ve adjusted your heading by using the rudder, cause of where the plane is pointed, but make sure the prograde marker has moved to where you want it. When your very close to the runway and aligned, you want to make sure your prograde marker is dead on the 90/270 degree marker so that you\u0027ll run off the runway.

I ask because I find that the default brake torque is often too slight to make a short enough landing in most circumstances, and I find it is a good idea to up the torque in order to help bring it to a controllable stop. A caution when doing this though, make sure that the rear wheels receive much more torque than the front. I prefer to leave the front torque alone and double the back torque from default, usually. If you have too much torque up front and not enough in back, you might find your plane flipping over its nose. \n\nOn that note, the new(ish) A.I.R.B.R.A.K.E.S. part is brilliant for this. Place a few of these near the back of your plane above the center of mass, make sure they are disabled for pitch and yaw, and just activate them like you do the wheel brakes. They can help to shed unwanted airspeed before you touchdown without throwing off your approach. Use them carefully to get down to a controllable gliding speed as you are coming in, and they help you slow down more quickly once you have made contact with the airstrip too."},{"CreatedByName":"GraviTykillz","CreatedById":60694,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T20:04:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E A.I.R.B.R.A.K.E.S.\n\nThis makes all the difference for me in sheading speed."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T21:04:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yes, I have been thinking of placing flags, however, upon switching to my spaceplane, the loading bugged and all parts separated.

Break torque was eventually maximum on rear wheels. \n\nI asked because this aircraft in particular has quite small lift - it\u0027s a rocket SSTO with wings on it (starting weight 380 tons, landing weight ~80t). It relies mostly on body lift. Landing speed was at about 275 m/s, and that\u0027s where I will do my next modifications - more wings, or chutes, or retro thrusters.

I would say you should try and get down below that before touching down. And yeah, you need that speed to maintain your lift, but once you are lined up and on track for the runway you need to deliberately induce a controlled stall to shed both speed and altitude. Not sure how aggressively you can flare your descent without knowing the shape of the craft (tail dragging can turn a controlled landing into a crash) but you certainly sound like you have enough aerobreaking capacity built into the plane itself. \n\nI would say try to get the plane lined up, like you will do a narrow overshoot of the runway, and get down to your minimum cruising speed for that altitude. Then as you approach the runway (might need to experiment with timing here) nose up a bit, and activate the airbrakes on full. If you have done it right, the plane should slowly start loosing both speed and altitude until it hits the ground rear wheels first. \n\nYou mentioned parachutes. Might be worth considering as well. Place a couple of the small diameter aerodynamic stack chutes on the rear of the plane, and trigger those when you hit the ground. Pretend that you are landing on an aircraft carrier and you need them to kill your velocity as you hit touchdown."},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T22:32:01Z","Content":"I always shoot my deadstick landings for 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 angle of attack rather than a set speed. Getting set in the glide to assure you\u0027ll get there with decent speed means a steeper descent path. If you\u0027re going long, then s-turn to bleed off energy, but whatever you do don\u0027t allow yourself to go short. It\u0027s like carpentry; you can always cut excess wood off, but you can\u0027t get it back on again...\n\n You should drop yourself into the final with *some* excess speed (but not 275 m/sec!). Just flare just before touchdown and ride the 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 AoA. The speed will bleed off and drop you into a nice gentle landing.\n\n As for the markers, I personally use marker drones, but flags can work just as well. I set them at 5km, 10km, and 20 km west of the runway. Use the latitude in the map screen to get the lineup and something parked on the runway to get the distance.\n\n This will give you reference points for lineup that are so clear you can see them from orbit. As a bonus, you can check your altitude as you pass over them as checkpoints during your descent.\n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-10T22:40:24Z\u0022 title=\u002208/10/2015 10:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GoSlash27**"},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T23:35:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The navball is a handy guide.

Most my craft have enough wing loading and control authority to pull out of a 200 m/s dive to level flight. Unless your craft is less aerodynamic than a brick, 200 m/s should give you a couple of klicks of near level flight. This requires non-trivial lift however. A minimal lift rocket may not be able to control a dive.\n\nThe runway is the friendliest landing surface in the game.
