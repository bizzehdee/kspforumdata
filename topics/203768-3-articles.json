IMO, like websites and search engines these days, the game needs to sense what you are most interested in doing and try to serve you contracts that are in line with that. It seems like maybe it\u0027s doing that a little bit now, but it could definitely be doing it a whole lot more. There also seem to be big holes relative to what people frequently like do in the game, like for example why are there no \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E or K Prize or other aviation-based contracts?\u00A0 And I spent almost a whole\u00A0year with a full Jool 5 mission in-system before I got a single Jool-related contract.\u00A0 And perhaps all this would all indeed be better if there was just some sort of mission tree, where you have to accomplish certain things to unlock its different branches, but then that runs the risk of becoming too repetitive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Klapaucius","CreatedById":181256,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-20T20:38:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224003908\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022203768\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221626169396\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002273725\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Superfluous J\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 7/13/2021 at 9:43 PM, Superfluous J said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would not be sad if they found a way to eliminate right clicking parts and clicking one of a dozen randomly sorted buttons to perform a critical task.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m talking .no.part.action.windows.at.all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis does not bother me.
