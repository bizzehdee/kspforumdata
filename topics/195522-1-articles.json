Long time lurker and player. The past two weeks I have dived deep into making mods. I successfully made some fuel tanks and an engine with all the bells and whistles. What a headache learning this stuff is!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo my issue. I have made a light and I can not for the life of me figure out how animate both the light object and the emissive color in unity. I\u0027ve tried combining the two animations... I just don\u0027t know what the hell I\u0027m doing and I\u0027m\u00A0starting to pull out my hair lol. I did some experimenting before adding the emissive and the light worked just fine, but now I\u0027m lost. Both animations work when played but i need them to play together lol.\u00A0I have a tenuous grasp of unity. Can someone break it down barney style for me? Thanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
