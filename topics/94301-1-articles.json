I woke up inspired and decided to go about making a program to do just that for SpaceEngine! However, I\u0027m going to need everyone\u0027s help developing story pieces for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EHow it all works:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E The program will take user inputted information about the planet (sadly, I have no idea how to just mod SpaceEngine to have all of that done for me), like its\u0027 temperature class , its\u0027 type, whether or not it has life (and what kind of life that is), along with the magnitude of gravity and the atmospheric pressure, amongst a few others. The program will then pull mad-lib-esque stories that match those criteria from a text file, fill in the variables with randomly generated values, and output the modular story to a textbox.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat you can do:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E I\u0027m here to basically ask for story snippets (it\u0027s all in Star Wars and Star Wars: Legends continuity). They don\u0027t have to be (and aren\u0027t really supposed to be, but it\u0027s alright if you want to add plenty of detail) particularly long, but basically all I ask is that they have as many variables as possible to allow as many permutations (or is it combinations, I keep forgetting XP) as possible. Then tell me what aspects of the planet the story is restricted to (e.g. only gas planets, only planets with thin atmospheres, any planet with gravity similar to Earth\u0027s, etc). I personally think it will be a lot more interesting if there are plenty of story snippets to choose from, so that we can have as many possibilities (and therefore the fewest number of repeated statements) as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe variables must be inside percent signs, as that is how the program distinguishes between text to read, and variables to generate random information from, therefore if you want to refer to percentages of something in your story section, use the word \u0022percent\u0022 instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample sentence: In %Rnd2500-3000% BBY, the Sith Lord %SithLord% bombarded the planet with %Rnd1-10% Star Destroyers, leaving most of the planet turned to slag with the exception of the majority of the city, %City%, which became a symbol of hope, and the new capital for the planet after the Star Destroyers were finally fought off by the %Faction%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe above would be restricted to any planet that isn\u0027t scorching, hot, frozen, an asteroid, a gas giant, or has a gravity of \u0026lt; 0.75.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t yet specified actual names for the variables (outside of the random numbers), so you can name them anything you want as long as I can understand what it means. I\u0027ll edit all the variables myself once I decide on actual variable names, after I start getting some story snippets in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERelease:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E Once I finish the coding, get a decent number of story snippets, and make sure everything works properly, I\u0027ll release the program to you guys. Since most of the variables are drawn from .txt files, you can add new story snippets any time you want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
