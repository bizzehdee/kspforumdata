Adding fails to get a result either.\n\nHow do you figure out how far the object has truly moved horizontally?"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T10:34:52Z","Content":"Think we need some testing to figure this one out. \n\nThoughts: Might be an idea to try it modless? Does the payload or original launcher come apart and so its showing when the first part hit the ground? Is it going backwards and that\u0027s doing odd things to the numbers?\n\nBTW...I seem to be getting the opposite to you. I get F3 to show a slightly higher ground distance covered than the screen shows as the distance to the target. I do \u0022control from here\u0022 on the payload though - do you?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-14T10:46:37Z\u0022 title=\u002203/14/2015 10:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Foxster**"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T11:07:25Z","Content":"Here\u0027s something vaguely interesting...\n\n![oPeaadQ.png](http://i.imgur.com/oPeaadQ.png)\n\nThis is from switching back to the launcher of my mass driver after getting a low distance F3 reading on my payload.

I think I got something. You can work out the distance from the f3 menu, but it\u0027s horribly inconsistent.\n\nThe launcher is bolted in place, so moving shouldn\u0027t be much of an issue. It wobbles a bit, but doesn\u0027t bend or go anywhere. Launch procedure used was just: full throttle, stage and switch to the now accelerating payload. Payload always exploded on impact, no bouncing was recorded.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/26xmD)\n\nConclusion - At first I thought the F3 menu divided the distance based on how many times your craft has \u0022divided\u0022 (be it by decouplers or explosions) - That would explain the inconsistency on payload impact (based on the angle when hitting the ground - sometimes exploding all at once, sometimes hurling parts a little further). However, using a payload consisting of 1 part gave me the same funky results (and I\u0027ve tried multiple times) - the launcher itself was still complete, nothing fell off or exploded there.\n\nAnyway, based on my tests and my launcher design, the gound distance covered seems to be divided either by 2 (in one case), or by 4 (in a majority of cases). I wouldn\u0027t trust either.\n\nOther than that, I have absolutely no idea what is going on."},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T14:23:53Z","Content":"I have looked at this a bit, and I\u0027m not sure whether there is any rhyme or reason. I do know that \u0027Ground Distance Covered\u0027 is wildly inaccurate. It also seems to vary from one craft to another from what I have seen, or maybe even from one install to another.\n\nThis screenshot shows the F3 readout for a craft which has circumnavigated Kerbin twice.\n\n![4qbVYht.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/4qbVYht.png?1)\n\nI have also see screenshots from other players, which obviously showed a much larger distance for \u0027Ground Distance Covered\u0027 than what they actually traveled.\n\nI don\u0027t know of any way to accurately measure distance traveled in the game.\n\nHappy landings!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-14T14:27:32Z\u0022 title=\u002203/14/2015 02:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Starhawk**"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T16:35:03Z","Content":"I think the in-game distance to an object (the distance shown next to an object) seems to be accurate. At least it counts down in a reasonable way, reaching near-zero as you arrive. \n\nF3 seems totally out of whack. The distance seems to get shared or divided or is just wrong. \n\nSo, best bet is, I think, to rely on the object marker distance. Of course, that won\u0027t account for surface curvature."}]}
