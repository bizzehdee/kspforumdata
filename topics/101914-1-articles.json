I think I got something. You can work out the distance from the f3 menu, but it\u0027s horribly inconsistent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launcher is bolted in place, so moving shouldn\u0027t be much of an issue. It wobbles a bit, but doesn\u0027t bend or go anywhere. Launch procedure used was just: full throttle, stage and switch to the now accelerating payload. Payload always exploded on impact, no bouncing was recorded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/26xmD\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled. View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConclusion - At first I thought the F3 menu divided the distance based on how many times your craft has \u0022divided\u0022 (be it by decouplers or explosions) - That would explain the inconsistency on payload impact (based on the angle when hitting the ground - sometimes exploding all at once, sometimes hurling parts a little further). However, using a payload consisting of 1 part gave me the same funky results (and I\u0027ve tried multiple times) - the launcher itself was still complete, nothing fell off or exploded there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, based on my tests and my launcher design, the gound distance covered seems to be divided either by 2 (in one case), or by 4 (in a majority of cases). I wouldn\u0027t trust either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, I have absolutely no idea what is going on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T14:23:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have looked at this a bit, and I\u0027m not sure whether there is any rhyme or reason.
