The Block I, and it\u0027s ICPS is planned for use in Europa Clipper, EM-1, and ARM. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, NASA\u0027s advisory group is recommending that the decision be made not to human-rate the Block I, and use a IB for ARM, as Block I is only planned to be used for humans once, in ARM, before being succeeded by more powerful blocks for crew (human-rating Block I would also cost an extra $150 million). They believe that this money is a waste, and would be better used to hurry the development of the Block IB, NASA\u0027s planned \u0022powerhouse\u0022 for the future. Additionally, SLS employees themselves would like to have the money and time spent on Block IB, as it would open up further missions beyond EM-1 and EM-2, which is a current concern.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Block I is not being cancelled, it\u0027s ability to be able to hold humans, however, is. The SLS Block I is already beginning it\u0027s production for EM-1, meaning that total cancellation will be an extremely hard sell at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing I found interesting is that the Block I/IB will sport advanced SRBs once the current supply of Shuttle boosters are flown out. (Block II will probably have bigger versions of these advanced boosters). It\u0027s also been suggested that the Block II SLS be cancelled entirely, leaving only the I/IB, as this would save money, since SLS Block I/IB could provide all the upmass capability needed, and it is much further away to completion (2030) than the other 2 variants (2018-2021)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESLS Block I will most likely not be human-rated. Block I/IB will continue to be used beyond the Shuttle SRB supply.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T00:55:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThats....actually fairly reasonable outside of cancelling Block II.
