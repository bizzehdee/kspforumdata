I plan to adjust this range to something like 1000-2500 meter effective range and up to 5000-10000 meter with diminishing effect. As you have noticed there is not diminishing effect on the tractor beam now and this is likely the cause of what you experienced. However it does sound a little strange that you were pulled out of your orbit. Exactly what happened? And secondly was the command pod detached so you lifted only the empty command pod and what was the mass of your lifter?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have only tested this with my hovercraft lifter which use two tractor beam systems (configure that in the config panel) One for hovering and one for lifting. So with my secondary tractor beam system i will just target the vessel i want to lift, move on top of it and press the lift button then set the distance. Of course i have the new version with the up and down buttons that make lifting control a lot easier. ;-)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VlamBallas","CreatedById":42696,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-31T11:55:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E50Km range is awesome, Will we be able to restore this to the old setting in the new version?

It will apply force in both directions. Are you able to gain thrust if you aim the tractor beams at the ground and apply max negative force to it? The next version corrects all of this so you are able to set how much force you wish the system to put out. When orbiting the mun you are also traveling at hundreds of meter per second, i doubt anyone in the star trek universe would recommend flying at 500m/s and pulling an object off the ground with max force =p.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the range adjustments it is only the range that will be affected. 2500 meter is still quite far. I have never seen a star trek episode where they tractor something that is out of the visible range anyways ;-) And as always, the more lazors you put on the vessel, the more force you can put out, to the point where the lifting potential is ridiculous. If you can build a vessel to support that kind of force remains to be seen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally you should approach your vessel and lock on when you are within a couple hundred meters max. Then set the distance you want and press Lock. The system will then (depending on the distance set) usually apply maximum force to get the target to the desired distance as fast as possible. With the old version this would result in the following. I hover at 100m. Set distance to 30m and press lock. Then my target would get to 30m and swing around my vessel like a jojo. This is because the lift system can only apply force in the lifting direction and thus, any angular displacement from the gravitational vector cause speed in a perpendicular direction. This is a feature. It is possible to construct your lifter to limit this effect somewhat. Hint: Force is applied between the target and the induvidual lazor origin points.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kyle.mk.howard","CreatedById":22844,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-31T14:49:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Romfarer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Romfarer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGood suggestion, i will add this to the target cam display.
