Is there a list or general rules about what will and will not update? I\u0027ve figured out that Resource amounts won\u0027t update but mass and and nodes (but not whats attached to the node) will change. Is it the basic values update but modules and resources and the like (things inside a second bracket set) won\u0027t?\n\nThanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T01:12:02Z","Content":"It\u0027s to do with how the values are used in code.
