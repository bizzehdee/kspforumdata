That was before any Career mode features were implemented. As a result, it is glaringly outdated and needs an update. However, common Wiki editors cannot edit the main page; only those with admin privileges can do that. Would someone who has permission please update the main page so it has proper links to the Career Mode, Science, and Tech Tree pages? Those, if nothing else from recent updates, should definitely have main-page links.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-10T16:49:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Wiki is definitely on the radar - it needs updating bad. Sadly no timeframe at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-10T16:56:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d be quite happy to help with that, but of course I don\u0027t have the authorization to do so. A game like this that\u0027s in development and quite popular really does need at least one dedicated Wiki moderator and maintainer. It\u0027s a tedious job, but some people (myself included) actually enjoy that sort of bookkeeping work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
