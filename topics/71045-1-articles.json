So I want to dock with the command module as quickly as possible on ascent. I\u0027ve gotten pretty comfortable setting up a rendezvous between two ships in different orbits, but sometimes it can take several orbits for their relative positions to make a rendezvous feasible. Any tips on planning launch timing in order to make the rendezvous in the first orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-30T17:00:40Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2014 05:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SabreRedleg\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dkmdlb","CreatedById":70275,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-30T16:07:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWait until the target ship is about 1/8th or less* of its orbit away from passing over the launchpad and launch to the same altitude as the target. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* This will vary depending on factors such as target altitude, orbital eccentricity, launch vehicle TWR, launch profile, body characteristics, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-30T16:14:00Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2014 04:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Dkmdlb\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FREEFALL1984","CreatedById":104993,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-30T16:10:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just tend to do it by eye, depending on the body your lifting from. If I have to overcome a thick atmosphere I always launch early, if not I like to launch late and keep travelling towards the target marker. it generally takes an orbit or two to get docked, but remember the fastest launchpad to ISS was 6 hours, which is 4 orbits of the earth (wherever that is) and docking in 4 orbits on KSP is fairly easy with some nice timing and a little luck.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-30T16:12:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, sometimes I even wait till the target ship is right overhead or just a bit past to be safe.

It really helps if you know exactly how long it takes for your craft to reach the same altitude as your orbital station (X), and what angle the pink target reticule on the navball indicates at t-x. For instance, my Mun lander takes about 120 seconds to reach an apoapsis of 50km, and the target reticule is at ~40 degrees, retrograde. I just wait for those conditions and launch. Usually, I\u0027ll come within 8km of the station - close enough to rendezvous in an orbit or two.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tortoise","CreatedById":68002,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-30T16:30:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIm not sure, but make sure its a little bit infront of you or ahead, because you\u0027ll come in at a higher velocity than your target. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI never plan, I just launch and rendezvous\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-30T16:30:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E*whisper* use MJ to \u0027practice\u0027.
