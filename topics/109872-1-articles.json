Not just for a re-purposed Aerospike, but this brings up a very valid concept of custom engines. What if this was how it worked for every engine? Maybe allowing nozzle adjustments and therefore efficiency changes, like a balance for air or space travel \u0022Isp\u0022 wise, kind of similar to the modeller for the fairings would be amazing.

Swapping nozzles around on engines just seems too fiddly, and particularly not viable to use the Aerospike as an alternative nozzle for a conventional bell engine. Even swapping bells around on bell engines seems dubious to me, as the bell has to be matched to the other parts of the engine, as I understand it, it\u0027s a complete package where the size and design of the bell has to be closely matched to the turbo pumps, etc. The nozzle is actually part of the fuel system as well, with fuel circulating around pipes integrated in the nozzle, to cool it, before it goes to the combustion chambers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot convinced at all by this, or that a whole custom engine system would really be worth the effort. The game might benefit from some more choices in engine, but I don\u0027t think we really need the vast array of choice from custom mix and match building.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T06:50:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry, but that\u0027s a very bad idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Aerospike isn\u0027t an overpowered engine, at least it doesn\u0027t have to be if its stat were balanced correctly.
