But wait, there is a catch. Because, you see, the first SLS launch in 2017 will be...unmanned (I can already hear the groaning in the audience of viewing forumers. Much anticlimax). However, not all are happy with an unmanned mission. Already in the NASA ranks, there is an movement to make EM-1 an manned launch.
