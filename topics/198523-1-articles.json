When you build a vehicle, the first part you lay down is the \u0022root\u0022 and that\u0027s where the control will be, when other parts are detached. Those detached parts should be renamed with \u0022probe\u0022 or \u0022ship\u0022 appended to the name, if it has a remote probe or a crew-carrying component on it (or relay if it has a relay antenna).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second problem will be, its not possible to \u0022pause\u0022 one part, while you control the other. So you\u0027ll need to do something clever with making sure one of the parts can autonomously keep flying itself, or be able to switch between them at the right time. For example if you were to recreate the SpaceX Falcon, jettison the first stage (and then switch to it, or just one of them, to fly it back) you\u0027d have nobody flying the second stage and it would probably overshoot its orbit badly or not make it into orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s also an issue that parts which ought to look after themselves (eg bits parachuting down), below a certain height, don\u0027t get modelled properly and can just blow up as mentioned above.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BigFatGuy","CreatedById":208532,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-05T01:22:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTurns out, I\u0027m an incompetent boob. \u003Cspan\u003E:-)\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf two drones separate, and one has all the antennas, the other shuts down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
