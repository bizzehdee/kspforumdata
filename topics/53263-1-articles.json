Yet many of these players can build great things that they want to show off. This is why I have decided to start offering recording crafts for players who want to show off the craft, even if they don\u0027t have a computer good enough to do so. Videos are recorded in full 1080p at 60 fps on high quality settings. All you have to do is post a download link for your craft file (or just a link to a forum post to it), and sit back. Although please make sure to tell me how you want it recorded and any other special requests. When finished I can either PM you a download link, or post it to my youtube account and send you the link.
