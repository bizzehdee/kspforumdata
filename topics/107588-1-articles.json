Once initiated it starts to pick out the location you choose, but then veers off course. In my situation, starting out at an orbit of 100 Km. MechJeb, instead of putting me on course for a landing, reversed course and fired my engines relocating my orbit to 130Km. I have KSP .25 with MechJeb and it WORKS. Same settings and all. Something is very wrong here. Before you ask, I set my landing settings as soon as I achieve orbit after liftoff giving me plenty of time. Why don\u0027t I manually land? Because that\u0027s why I downloaded MechJeb."},{"CreatedByName":"Jackson Mackenzie","CreatedById":77204,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T18:14:15Z","Content":"Probably better to raise this issue in the MechJeb thread, but I wouldn\u0027t bother doing so as I believe this is a known issue stemming from the aerodynamics changes; if you\u0027re having the problem I think you are, they already know about it and are working to fix it."},{"CreatedByName":"Galane","CreatedById":77949,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T09:29:46Z","Content":"Dev build 446 set a lander down within walking distance of KSC for me tonight.
