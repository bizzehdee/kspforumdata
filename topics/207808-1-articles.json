First, the centripetal acceleration. At 1km/s, to keep it down to 1g of acceleration, the radius of the arm would have to be over 100km long. And if you plan to have this structure be reusable, it will have to be able to absorb the shock of releasing the cargo, which will propagate as a wave through the structure. So it\u0027s not trivial to build something like this. It\u0027s a major project.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, conservation of momentum is still a thing. If this arm is orbiting a planet, the recoil from launch is going to alter its orbit. You need to compensate for this somehow. The most practical use case is if something like this both sends and receives cargo. You can also just use it to de-orbit random rocks to absorb that momentum, but basically, if something goes up, equal amounts of something must come down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, corrections will still have to be made, and something with that size and artificial gravity at the tips won\u0027t be possible to mill with sunlight. A sail of that size will not be able to withstand the rotation. So you\u0027ll have to expend reaction mass for correction and to initially spin up the structure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Davi SDF","CreatedById":197335,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-19T18:09:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey will probably be useful so our Kerbal\u0027s bones aren\u0027t made of jelly when they reach another planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vl3d","CreatedById":219348,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-19T18:24:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224119296\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022207808\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221650320943\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257710\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 hours ago, K^2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nexpend reaction mass for correction and to initially spin up the structure\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree with some lightweight engines for the correction burns.

Enough power to run the life support, enough habitable volume to prevent them from going crazy (crew probably like having their own personal space and/or a place to get away from the rest of the crew for a while, after all), and maybe enough gravity (or zero-g exercise equipment) to prevent their physical condition from degrading.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince that\u0027s the logical end-point of all the existing KSP 1 life support mods anyways, and this is supposed to be \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022The Future\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E so it\u0027s a safe assumption that they\u0027ve mastered such a \u0022mundane\u0022 technology as true closed-loop life support, and adding all those life support resources processing machines just makes the game more complex \u0022for a while\u0022 while continuing to give the CPU running the game \u0022more to do than it needs to do\u0022 when you\u0027ve reached the end-game and have the totally closed-loop life support systems unlocked anyways, so why bother with it when that\u0027s not the focus of the game?\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe\u0027re not playing \u0022Factorio in space\u0022 after all (that\u0027s Dyson Sphere Program, which strangely DOES run on Unity), and life support (without being closed loop from the beginning) adds just a lot of extra (and extra imposing) complication that would scare off new players anyways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-26T22:26:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRando, I remember a friend of mine launching swarms of satellites by flying straight up, no gravity turn, then when he got to about 90km he spun carriage up with rockets and released them all at once.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027d also personally love to see a \u0022life support medium roast\u0022 system with a single depletable resource and recyclers that can be made 100% closed loop but only using very heavy modules best suited for stations, colonies, and very long journeys.

Rather, from what I\u0027ve read about merely existing in a zero-g environment for long periods of time (such as on the ISS) I have gathered that the human body is not well suited for such conditions. The human body \u0022tolerates\u0022 such conditions \u0022somewhat well\u0022 if you mitigate the muscle atrophy by using zero-g adapted exercise equipment (that\u0027s why the ISS has a stationary bicycle), however even a relatively small amount of gravity (such as 0.1g) is enough to massively improve crew comfort.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor instance, do you know how hard it is to burp in zero-G without throwing up a little bit? It\u0027s basically impossible, because in zero-g your stomach is like the liquid fuel tank of a rocket (that is also in zero-g), in that there\u0027s usually a mixture of liquids and gases in it, and when you burp you only want to expel the gas, but in zero G your stomach\u0027s contents are basically randomly arranged, so you get a little bit of all of it no matter what you do.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is similar to how a liquid fueled rocket that is in zero-G can\u0027t start its main engine(s) without first using the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E or igniting purposefully placed small solid rockets (called \u0022ullage motors) SPECIFICALLY to settle the contents of the fuel tanks first. The only exception to this is most satellites that use hypergolic or monopropellant rockets. They have special fuel tanks that have additional things in them to mitigate the liquid/gas phase blending that happens in zero-G, such as a bladder to separate the liquid and the pressurizing gas, or simply a mesh structure that uses surface tension to cause the liquid to preferentially settle near the fuel pickup. However the human stomach contains no such features, so the comparison with a satellite fuel tank is not valid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I said, even a small amount of acceleration is enough to prevent that particular unwelcome effect of living in zero-G. There are many other beneficial effects of gravity as well, not least of which is the prevention of bone density loss, which is extremely important if you\u0027re going to be landing on Mars or another body in the solar system (or even another solar system in the case of interstellar craft) later on in the mission, or plan to return to Earth (or Kerbin).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo for me, the reason it \u0022looks right\u0022 is because the presence of a centrifuge is basically required on any interplanetary journey that will be taking a long Hohmann transfer (or using electric propulsion, tho that is quite a bit faster).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, Considering that the thread\u0027s title is \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003EACTUAL\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E uses for centrifuges\u0022 (emphasis mine), I\u0027m pretty sure that we\u0027re not talking about aesthetics (if it looks good or not) here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, there IS a situation where you in fact don\u0027t really need a centrifuge on an interplanetary vessel.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith good enough propulsion systems (high specific impulse and high thrust at the same time, so \u0022torch\u0022 drives), you don\u0027t need to spin to make artificial gravity.\u003Cbr\u003E\nInstead, you can use the thrust of the engines themselves!\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo best take advantage of this, you need to build the habitation section of the vessel like a skyscraper (EDIT: And not like an ocean liner or the Starship Enterprise [end edit]) (but hopefully out of aluminum not steel, because steel might be strong but holy crap is it heavy compared to high strength aluminum alloys).\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou do need to fly a brachistochrone trajectory for this approach to be able to provide \u0022gravity\u0022 during the vast majority of the voyage, so it is limited to vessels with the ability to accelerate at roughly 1G for not just days, but weeks on end (tho in the Kerbol system \u0022days\u0022 is probably plenty enough).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my prediction is that early crewed interplanetary vessels will have centrifuges, but later ones (with the torch drives) may not, or may only have them for use when the vessel is docked (and therefore not under acceleration provided by the drives), however I think it would still be far more likely for those centrifuges to be located on the stations that such vessels dock to, rather than on the vessel itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-04-27T17:47:18Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2022 05:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by SciMan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
