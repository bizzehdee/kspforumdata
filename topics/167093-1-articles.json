So it drove it to the side of the runway, went to space center and launched a similar probe to the runway, then left it there for my test rover to pick up. I couldn\u0027t switch, it said no craft in range. Which I was skeptical about, seeing as it was 180 meters away. But I went to space center and got in the rover, I went there and it wasn\u0027t there. It just wasn\u0027t. Target markings and the such are there and work fine, but the craft doesn\u0027t exist. I rammed the spot it should be, but nothing happened. I went up to a couple other things I had lying about, same problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The-Grim-Sleeper","CreatedById":183905,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-29T07:32:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid you use revert flight at the end of the placement?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWas the vehicle still there (viewable in the tracking centre) when you went back to the space centre?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid you get a prompt to clear the runway at the start of the second launch?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jas0n","CreatedById":57441,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-29T14:32:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso press f3 for mission log and see if there was a report of your rover being destroyed?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dangerhamster","CreatedById":146944,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-29T14:49:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemember that something next to the runway is still counted as being on it.
