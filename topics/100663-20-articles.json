It was a fun exercise in figuring out how to create the part and animate it all, but I agree that it\u0027s not the most useful part and will become pretty obsolete after 1.1. If folks would like a redesign I can put it on the list. My options that I see are:\n\n1. Remodel the Twin Turbojet to be an F-22 style and replace it.\n\n2. Do option 1 and also create a 1.25m version sharing texture space (saving memory).\n\n3.
