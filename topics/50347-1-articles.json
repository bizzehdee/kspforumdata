I discovered this on last night\u0027s flight of my sun probe, since a sun probe has virtually unlimited power to continuously send out data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStating this, i have tried both ; trying to collect science data and returning it to kerbin and \u0022maxing out\u0022 with the aforementioned method. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion the issue at hand is, that we have to consider that the tech tree is an introduction to get new(er) players accustomed to parts and gameplay elements in a smoother learning curve than to just expose them to the vast opportunities sandbox offers, but at the same time it should be done in a fun way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t get me wrong, i was psyched for the science update and i\u0027m not disappointed with the 0.22 update, on the contrary.

This would open up new opportunies for upgradeable space telescopes and the like to detect this anomalies and so on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother, albeit more far fetched, opportunity would be to have a \u0022global gameplay\u0022 mode, in which there are certain anomalies that spawn globally, meaning in a passive multiplayer fashion, for example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 7p.m. there opens up an anomaly in lower minmus orbit. This anomaly will be displayed to all players currently playing with the \u0022global gameplay\u0022 option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Player 1 reaches this anomaly at 7.15, awarding him with the science points for the experiments conducted and a special score (let\u0027s just call these \u0022achievement points\u0022 for the sake of this thought). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- As soon as the first player conducts certain experiments at the anomaly, it starts to decay, yielding less achievement points with progressing time (but keeping the science points gathered at the same value)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Player 2 arrives 5 minutes later, he will still get the (same) science points for the experiments, but slightly less achievement points, since he wasn\u0027t the first one to arrive at the anomaly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion, this would make for a motivating \u0022space race\u0022 situation, since there would be a \u0022leader board\u0022 with high scores and so on, and at the same time you would gain science points for your \u0022local\u0022 space program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, these achievement points are only awared for the first time one conducts a specific experiment and there could be bonus/penalities depending on multiple factors, for example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- tech used (did you get there with a tech 1/2 ship, or did you use more advanced technologies like atomic engines etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- way of recovering the conducted experiment\u0027s data (did you bring back the vessel and recover it on kerbin, or did you just send them back?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- specialized science equiment (did you use equipment, that is specialized for this kind of anomaly, or did you use generic science equipment? - specialized equipment could have more mass, making the ship desing more difficult)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR summary: Some sort of random element with higher rewards and higher diminishing returns on \u0022spamming experiments\u0022 could spice up the science gathering, without bringing too many disadvantages to newer players.
