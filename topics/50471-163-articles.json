For this reason, as you already deduced, most people use procedural parts for this purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, parts in Realism Overhaul have realistic sizes, so the 3 man pod is 4 meters wide, because that\u0027s how wide the Apollo capsule was. Engines also have roughly real-life dimensions, so they are often narrower than the tanks above them (as they are in real life, look up pictures of Saturn V for reference). Given how stock interstages work, this is a slight problem, but one that is easy to mitigate by using procedural interstages (procedural fairings mod has this option). I never tried using them, but the interstage parts from KW rocketry might work too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout logs we can\u0027t be sure why your game crashes, but the most likely culprit is that your game is running out of memory.

It has two tutorials from Ferram, one for building a rocket and one for flying it, and one from me regarding using MechJeb to fly ascents.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany modern rockets *do* finish their burn after their original apogee; it\u0027s not uncommon or bad. Likely your upper stage(s) has too much thrust. A TWR that starts at 0.9 (vacuum TWR) is a *high* thrust upper stage. Centaur on Atlas V has more like a 0.4 TWR (maybe even 0.3). I don\u0027t recommend that for LEO--Atlas V is optimized for GTO missions--but it gives you an idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re launching a traditional 2-stage LV, then you want to use the first stage to establish the correct apogee--200km for a parking orbit, higher for longterm LEO orbiting--and burn the second stage to establish orbital velocity at or after that apogee. The best way to do that is to make your second stage\u0027s burn time around a minute longer than what \u0022time to apoapsis\u0022 is when you start firing it, and burn it more or less completely horizontal, only burning \u002Bpitch when time-to-apoapsis goes below 20 seconds or so as Hattivat says.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kitspace","CreatedById":109786,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-23T09:03:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you everybody for your very patient support!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo as far as I got it it is normal to run over apoapsis while still running the engines and to keep flying you need to pitch higher than prograde. Right? But that is all about the mild modern rockets and what about the old classic ones that could give some very good gees even on the upper stages? How to keep the apoapsis from running away from me? The Titan had a place in the pitch program where it had to pitch down until the ascent vertical speed came to zero and only then thrust horizontally again as far as I know. Do I need to keep my apoapsis steady where it is supposed to be and let me come up to it or at least keep it somewhere? And should it still start to run away and rise quickly how to stop it? What if it rises way too quickly too complete the gravity turn and go below horizon and catch it before it reaches the required altitude maybe it even happens in atmosphere?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kitspace","CreatedById":109786,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-23T09:15:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso I have read the tutorials in the wiki more than once but they do not answer some of my questions that are quite essential for me understand what is wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is like when a real life rocket is doing this again and again in Orbiter it looks nice and it works but when I am doing the same thing it looks much the same but it does not work at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have successfully tuned my mechjeb to make it look very much a like a real life launch and minimie the remaining required speed but never managed to eliminate the coasting part it loves so much and then of course it is all completely screwed up with a tiny little change in payload or something.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hattivat","CreatedById":110255,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-23T11:47:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks Nathan, your praise means a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Kitspace: Ah, so you want to pilot a historical rocket, that\u0027s a different story. In this case you cannot adjust the rocket to fit the most comfortable ascent path, you have to adjust the ascent path to fit the rocket (truism, I know, but it has to be said for clarity). It\u0027s probably also worth pointing out that launching to space on repurposed ICBMs is hard, and was hard in real life - it\u0027s one of the reasons why early satellites had such pronouncedly elliptical orbits and abysmal success rates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me most of the fun comes from designing my hardware, so I\u0027m not too much into piloting replicas, but I think I can help you with some suggestions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Generally the higher the TWR (initial and/or final) of the first stage (and the more delta-v it has) the flatter your trajectory should be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. If your flight plan includes a transition between a stage with high final TWR and a stage with low initial TWR, you probably need to pitch down (even as far as fully horizontal in some cases) some time before staging (so that your high final TWR doesn\u0027t rise your apoapsis too far), and pitch up after it (so that your time to apoapsis doesn\u0027t fall too fast with the low TWR of the other stage).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. There is also the option of using your first stage to establish an apoapsis quickly (like Nathan described above) and coasting for some time between MECO and second stage ignition. In this case, you should probably include solid rocket ullage motors in your second stage design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What if it rises way too quickly too complete the gravity turn and go below horizon and catch it before it reaches the required altitude maybe it even happens in atmosphere?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I\u0027m afraid that is a \u0022you will not go to space today\u0022 moment.
