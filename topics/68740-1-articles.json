Yea they aren\u0027t the most amazing things, but then again they do represent the what Kerbal Space Program designs themselves. The new parts look amazing mainly because NASA built them, and they are essentially those parts in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVisual upgrades are always welcome, but a full rework of spaceplane parts with reskin seems more important.

Also, I\u0027m not a huge fan of the wide rim at the ends of the tanks.
