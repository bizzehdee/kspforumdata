All of the parts are shown on the left without being in any particular order (instead of the default of being grouped by function).

Here is a screenshot of the problem. You can see how the parts are not sorted by function like normal, and how adding a part puts it in the middle of the floor of the VAB. Along with that, you simply can\u0027t pick and move parts at all.\n\n![ksp_mod_issue.png](http://www.gypsywoodarts.com/pics/ksp_mod_issue.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"beelzerob","CreatedById":147002,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T16:50:20Z","Content":"Ok...I reinstalled KSP and started the game. Works fine. I then exited and installed KER and started a default game. It works! I then copied over my save game and loaded it. It works!

When I\u0027ve seen that before, it was a result of system files that were copied along with the save. The only file you absolutely need from your save is the persistence.sfs. Start by creating a new save on your Mac, then replace the persistence.sfs. As needed, you can copy over .craft files from the [your save]/Ships/VAB and [your save]/Ships/SPH folders."},{"CreatedByName":"beelzerob","CreatedById":147002,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T17:47:58Z","Content":"Thanks for the help!\n\nI reinstalled KSP, started a new career game, and with the KER mod, verified it worked.

In the VAB, all equipment was sitting unorganised in the left panel, I couldn\u0027t filter/browse through it, clicking an item would spawn it on the ground and I was unable to move it.\n\nLike you, I started playing KSP on desktop and wanted to continue on Macbook by copying mods and saves over from my desktop. For me, that was the cause of the issue. Instead of redownloading the mods I copied them from my desktop, assuming that they\u0027d be the same files. \n\nI fixed the issue uninstalling all the mods, and redownloading them all for a clean install. The next time I booted KSP it was actually \u0027installing\u0027 the mods and this time they worked. I assume the mods config files change after installing in a way that you can\u0027t just copy them from another installation."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-05T12:14:16Z","Content":"Please upload the persistent.sfs beelzerob, you can put it on dropbox."}]}
