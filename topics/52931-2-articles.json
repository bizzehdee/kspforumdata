In fact, it\u0027s the reduction in pressure as the vehicle the chute is attached to slows that allows the chute to fully open as the pressure of the air rushing past the outside of the envelope becomes sufficiently low to allow the ram pressure inside the envelope to reef the parachute fully. By changing how the risers are arranged, the material, and the stitching of the envelope, the designers can create \u0022staged\u0022 reefing to allow for a single parachute to act both as a drogue and a main. For higher speeds, use of a \u0022reefing ring\u0022 on the risers has been used in the past to do the same as the pressure against the ring will \u0022cinch\u0022 the risers and prevent the chute from attempting to reef at too high of a speed.

Parachutes are more complex than they look like, my goal is to make parachutes more realistic by \u003Cstrong\u003Esimulating\u003C/strong\u003E realistic deployment without faring too far away from gameplay and stock behaviour. I\u0027m not trying to do a full reality mod like FAR or the realistic solar system mod, or even like RemoteTech, I\u0027m just trying to improve general gameplay and making the parachutes behave in a more conventional way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright, about parachutes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA parachutes is made of three things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst theres the base. This is a model, with a collision box and all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there\u0027s the canopy. This is a transform, it does not have a collision box and my knowledge about modeling is null, so I have no idea if it can have one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird is the cap, which is ALSO a transform. It can\u0027t just be jettisoned like this unfortunately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy goal with this mod is not to \u003Cem\u003Eimprove\u003C/em\u003E the stock, not to recreate parachutes. So for this, I need it to be compatible with the stock module, so modders can create parachutes just like they used to and add this module to it. This limits the possibilities because of how parachutes are made in stock, but for now I do not intend to change the way parachutes fundamentally work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57646?p=770729\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post770729\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E for more details.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, thank you everyone for the feedback, this is greatly appreciated \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-13T18:24:05Z\u0022 title=\u002211/13/2013 06:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by stupid_chris\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T18:28:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor FAR compatibility, set stowedDrag to 0.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Climberfx","CreatedById":57126,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T18:31:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat Job Not stupid Chris. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T18:33:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NathanKell\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NathanKell\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor FAR compatibility, set stowedDrag to 0.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrue much, the 0.22 is to keep the pod oriented correctly.
