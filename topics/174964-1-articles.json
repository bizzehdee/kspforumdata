However, at high speeds (about 1.3 km/s), if I turn (even slightly to change pitch a few degrees), it is easy to turn too violently and have my plane break apart from the extreme g-forces. I have already strutted my wings and engines together. Also, I have tried reducing the authority on the control surfaces, but reducing it too far has made it hard to take off. The center of lift is always behind the center of mass during flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere are screenshots of my spaceplane:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022EnteXxe.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022543\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/EnteXxe.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022L1KnEc7.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022543\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/L1KnEc7.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KewnHS7.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022543\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/KewnHS7.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022MyEbpjM.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022543\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/MyEbpjM.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for any help!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-05-15T02:21:00Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2018 02:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by TheWildDefender\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-15T03:16:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose large control surfaces may be imposing excessive forces while steering.
