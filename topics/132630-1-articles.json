I do not think my mods are to blame because I have another save with the exact same mods that is launching fine. I really do not want to start another save beacuse the first one I started got bugged and then I started a new one and THAT got bugged and now I started ANOTHER one and THAT got bugged. So... Help? Also, I put hyperjump beacons around Laythe, the Mun, and Minmus and landed on the Mun and Minmus so I do not want to start over. Help?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Benoit Hage","CreatedById":104585,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-21T16:13:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe need your mod list and a screenshot would help too.
