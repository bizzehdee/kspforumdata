But, in a way, the shuttle was a partial SSTO, in a way. It atleast showed it\u0027s allmost usefull. The ET (big orange tank) did reach LEO, or would have if it was not deorbited controllable. So in a case where the shuttle itself would have been only it\u0027s cockpit with wings, and not separated, it would have been one stage, complete from earth to orbit. With reusable boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here\u0027s my take at that, I don\u0027t know if those boosters where economical sound to reuse or not, but I hope they where. The idea that was ditched due to budget and whatnot, for a crew launch vehicle on a single booster with a LF tank and engine as it\u0027s second stage, did have so e possibilities. So what if, they built something like that, for launching a simple capsule with crew and/or supplies for ISS or other uses, more or less as is planned, but instead of dumping the last tank, leave it in orbit, and use an unmanned tug to move it to a usefull place, where it can be used for construction. The remaining fuel in it will also come to good use, moving it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei know that kind of reusability is frowned uppn by the high-ups at NASA, since it was dropped in it\u0027s inception when it was proposed early during the shuttles developement. One of the arguments was that it would require redesigning the tank and sarificing some capacity for the shuttles, and become another thing that could go wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that way, there would be reusability of all the parts involved, and still be a staged stack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Estaging is not the same as not reusability, stupidity is.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fuzzy Dunlop","CreatedById":27329,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T21:07:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESSTO isn\u0027t that hard: Atlas style ballon tanks, and NK-33 engines should do it nicely (In fact a Titan II first stage could probably get itself to orbit).

Long term SpaceX plans involves this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis design has the benefit that you don\u0027t have to carry all the mass to orbit and only the small upper stage has to be hardened to survive orbital reentry. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou also has the option to do more things, going to GEO or behind don\u0027t take the upper stage into orbit but increase the size of the transfer stage.
