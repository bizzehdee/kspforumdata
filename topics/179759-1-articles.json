They are going to be strong in different areas, and probably at least a decade off of each other in the important areas. For example, if one planet has a thicker atmosphere and/or lower gravity they will probably be better at atmospheric flight than the other world. If one world has harsher weather, they will likely be better at building things. But as far as both species being at approximately the same level of progression, even though it\u0027s improbably, I\u0027ll handwave it and call it \u0022it had to happen somewhere.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223486062\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022179759\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221542056715\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022111640\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FleshJeb\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 minutes ago, FleshJeb said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocheworld\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERocheworld \u003C/a\u003Eand \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_to_Rocheworld\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EReturn to Rocheworld\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, what \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/74091-p1t1o/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002274091\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/74091-p1t1o/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@p1t1o\u003C/a\u003E said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAhh, I forgot, it\u0027s 2018, all the good ideas are already taken...

Early Polish sci-fi writer W\u0142adys\u0142aw Umi\u0144ski wrote a charming novel about such low-tech communication attempt. It involved lighting up nine extremely bright signal lights on the \u0022cross\u0022 plane in South America during the Great Opposition of Mars. Protagonists of the book barely survived the adventure (locals were not too happy with crazy foreigners turning their peaceful night into an EXTREMELY bright day without any warning) but the attempt was ultimately successful, as couple of months later astronomers photographed bright spots on Mars\u0027 nightside forming another cross.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EYou can use something similiar - we can\u0027t be only sentient beings in the Universe obsessed with finding neighbours we could chat with \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerekL1963","CreatedById":57091,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-12T22:01:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223486064\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022179759\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221542057122\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022161505\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ultimate Steve\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n46 minutes ago, Ultimate Steve said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was planning on making the two planets pretty close to each other, closer than the Earth and Moon are to each other\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNot if you intend to be in any way realistic.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223486064\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022179759\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221542057122\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022161505\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ultimate Steve\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n48 minutes ago, Ultimate Steve said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately it\u0027s likely they would discover each other by radio if sudden visual wasn\u0027t an option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhy unfortunately?\u00A0 If you\u0027re trying to stop them from talking to each other, whatever does that will also restrict them basically to early/mid 1800\u0027s tech - forever.\u00A0 (Basically, no radio means no space flight.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ultimate Steve","CreatedById":161505,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-12T22:18:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223486101\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022179759\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221542060111\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257091\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DerekL1963\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 minutes ago, DerekL1963 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNot if you intend to be in any way realistic.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhy unfortunately?\u00A0 If you\u0027re trying to stop them from talking to each other, whatever does that will also restrict them basically to early/mid 1800\u0027s tech - forever.\u00A0 (Basically, no radio means no space flight.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.
