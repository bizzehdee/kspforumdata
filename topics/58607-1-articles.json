Jeb had, of course, been the first to set foot on Mun, landing in East Farside crater piloting the Wilbur I. Jeb had then performed the tricky hop into the canyon on the east side of the crater. He gathered rock samples and performed science experiments at both locations, all the while breathlessly watched by all of kerbal-kind. After Jeb splashed down in the Kacific Ocean, he was immediately whisked off to the Kresident\u0027s office to receive medals, and then on to parades across Kerbin. He appeared on the Johnny Karson show. Jeb was feted, applauded, and huzzahed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith Jeb\u0027s smashing success, KSC launched Kewton Station into orbit about Mun, placing Bob in charge of operations there. While this didn\u0027t generate quite the hoopla that Jeb\u0027s landing had, a visibly nervous Bob was interviewed on the David Ketterman show via satellite uplink. Bob explained Kewton Station\u0027s purpose of being the orbital lab in which future Mun rocks and Mun-based experiments would be processed before being returned to Kerbin for futher study.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSC engineers designed the Wilbur II, a craft capable of visiting two separate landings sites on Mun and docking with Kewton Station. They tapped Bill for the pilot of Wilbur II, as Jeb was quite exhausted by groupies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill was initially thrilled to be chosen. He would not only land on Mun once, but four times! He would advance Kerbal science to an unprecedented degree, as he would explore a whopping eight regions with Wilbur II. Not only that, but he would perform the tricky dockings with Kewton Station, and would perform extended EVA missions hauling in the samples and results of Wilbur II\u0027s experiment bays. He would finally be able to outshine Jeb!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELittle did he realize the fickle ways of fame.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn his first trip he landed at Twin Craters, explored the Midlands adjacent to them, and successfully delivered his bonanza of science to Kewton Station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Good job, Bill,\u0022 said Bob, \u0022but we\u0027re kind of on a tight schedule here as the East Crater window is coming up. We\u0027ll need you to undock and de-orbit as soon as the experiments have been re-fitted.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill gamely rushed back to the cramped confines of Wilbur II and performed a flawless landing in East Crater. He performed his allotted sampling and experimenting, and then skipped over to the Highlands for another round before again returning to Kewton Station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hey, Bill,\u0022 Bob said on his return, \u0022the Kresident wants to talk to you.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Finally,\u0022 Bill thought to himself. \u0022I\u0027m getting the recognition I deserve!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill activated the satellite uplink with a smile. \u0022Yes, Mr. Kresident?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Bill, you know Jeb best,\u0022 the krackly voice of the Kresident said. \u0022What\u0027s his favorite kolor? I want to present him with a ceremonial sash to hang his medals from, and want to make sure he\u0027d like it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill was of course krushed. \u0022Klear!\u0022 he snarled into the uplink, and then disconnected. He stomped back to the now fairly smelly, cramped confines of Wilbur II, made sure the experiments were ready to go, and decelerated toward the Munar surface. This time Bill took on the Northwest Crater, and then performed a pinpoint landing in the Midland Craters. Again, he returned the science bounty back to Kewton Station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob met Bill at the lab\u0027s airlock. \u0022All we need now is the Farside Crater, Bill. After that we can take all of these results back to Kerbin. I don\u0027t have to tell you the scientists back at KSC are really chomping at the bit to get the complete data set back. If you hustle you can just make the de-orbit window.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill had finally had enough. \u0022If KSC wants those results so badly,\u0022 he shouted at a rather startled Bob, \u0022they\u0027ll have to play by my rules!\u0022 He stormed back to the Wilbur II and cast off before the lab personnel had a chance to refurbish the experiments. It\u0027s hard to say whether the fire from the Rockomax engines or Bill\u0027s rage was hotter as he landed in Farside Crater.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill stomped (as well as one can stomp in 1/6 G) out onto the Munar surface. In full view of the cameras he cut the Wilbur II\u0027s fuel lines. Bill\u0027s epic pout had begun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m tired of being cooped up in this tin can! Send me a proper habitat that\u0027s well stocked with delicious snacks, or you will never know the secrets of Farside Crater!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engineers at KSC quickly attached a Hitchhiker to a Stayputnik, imaginatively named it Farside Habitat I, and landed it near the disabled Wilbur II. Bill immediately entered it, removed his suit, took a long-overdue shower, and gorged himself on snacks. His pout, however, still endured.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Um, the really good samples are a few klicks away from the landing site,\u0022 he radioed back to KSC. \u0022You\u0027ll need to send me a rover if you want them.\u0022 He then took another shower and ate more snacks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engineers at KSC were up to the challenge. They sent not one, but two rovers to Farside Crater.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022This is more like it!\u0022 Bill chortled to himself as he zipped about the Munar landscape. He was not done with his epic pout, however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The findings here are so rich, you should send a full science lab here,\u0022 was Bill\u0027s next transmission back to KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis caused some konsternation among the engineering staff, but they were (barely) able to launch a lab staffed with the least stupid recruits and equipped with two full experiment kits, and land it by the rest of the klutter that Farside Crater had accumulated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022OK, Bill,\u0022 the scientists aboard the lab said, \u0022load up the samples and we\u0027ll take it from here.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill kackled evilly. He knew the scientists didn\u0027t have EVA suits aboard their lab.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I will only hand these samples over to Jeb!,\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb was quickly bundled aboard a kourier ship, and landed at what was now known as Farside Base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe climbed down the ladder, medals gleaming on his klear sash he wore over his EVA suit, and konfronted the recalcitrant Bill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Bill,\u0022 Jeb said, \u0022don\u0027t you think it\u0027s time to come home?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Why should I?\u0022, asked Bill. \u0022Here. Take these rotten samples and go on.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But Bill,\u0022 replied Jeb, \u0022don\u0027t you realize that with all of the discoveries you\u0027ve made, once we get all of the results back to Kerbin we will be able to go to Duna? Heck, I\u0027ll even let you go first this time. Now let\u0027s grab Bob and get home.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo Bill finally ended his epic pout. Bill and Jeb rendezvoused with Kewton Station, retrieved Bob and the accumulated research stashed there, and returned to the jubilant scientists eagerly awaiting them at KSC. As Jeb predicted, the research Bill had gathered was enough to catapult kerbal technology into the interplanetary arena. So impressed was the Kresident with the results, he forgave Bill his pout and awarded him the Kobel Prize on Bill\u0027s very own klear sash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHE END \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bengsch85","CreatedById":75728,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T17:12:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love the story!
