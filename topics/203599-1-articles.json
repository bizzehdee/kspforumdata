I\u0027d suggest moving the position of the engines down. Additionally, the model of fin you are using for a vertical stabilizer does not pivot and so is not helping with attitude control. Other than that, I find plane building to be a matter of many small tweaks to improve balance and response to controls.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-04T01:55:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the landing gear and vertical fin are fine as they are. The main problems I see are 1) the wing is too far forward and 2) the control surfaces haven\u0027t been specialized to not fight each other. Also the horizontal stabilizers are a bit big and the reaction wheel hasn\u0027t been disabled, but these are minor points.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn point 1... The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E is misleading in that it thinks every horizontal surface is there to provide lift, but that\u0027s not necessarily true. The horizontal stabilizers are there to provide downforce to counter the weight of the nose, not provide lift. I\u0027d recommend temporarily rotating the the horizontal stabilizers in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E so that they provide no lift, then move the wings so that the center of lift is slightly behind the CoG, *then* restore the horizontal stabilizers to a close- to-horizontal position with the leading edges slightly low. This will make your pitch response less janky and should cure your tailstrike problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn point 2, control surfaces in KSP should be limited to provide control over only one axis in order to avoid cross purposes. Ailerons should only respond to roll, elevators only to pitch, and rudders... You don\u0027t really need active rudders in KSP and the plane will track more true in turns with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E on if you don\u0027t have one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the minor points: Smaller horizontal stabilizers will give you more precise pitch control and reaction wheels will simply drain electricity and lead to cross control crabbing the same way active rudders do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBest,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Slashy\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-04T08:19:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStick another wheel at the back of the tail to avoid tail strikes. Move your engines down so that they\u2019re level with or under the wings. Fix your main gear- they\u2019re angled wrongly and the wheels are pointing in a bit, make them level and it\u2019ll be a bit more stable on the ground.
