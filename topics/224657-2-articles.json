So here\u0027s what I would have to say on the matter.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe public environment around development seemed to sour when the performance requirements were released and early access soon afterward. Before then, I couldn\u0027t recall mass disapproval of the development of KSP 2. I could think of a few names that would be doomers about development when they would announce a delay, but most of the KSP community was very patient and understanding about the delays.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf it is dead, which I\u0027m not sure about, I haven\u0027t played the game in a year so I haven\u0027t been necessarily in the heat of the moment as I have found interest in other things like Amtrak, I think what \u0022killed the game,\u0022 was the apparent lack of significant progress. Yeah, we could tell if they have enhanced a new extraterrestrial planet or changed some graphics whenever they released a trailer or screenshot. But to have less than the KSP 1 base game available at the start of early access, and take an entire year to get some science into the game? Like when was multiplayer expected to release, in 2028? I think most of the KSP community was exhausted by the worn-out hype.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt seems there were some management issues. Throughout development, I could recall the controversy that came when Star Theory was replaced by Intercept Games. And it seems that the game was held back in development from such. However, that is speculation on my part, not official.
