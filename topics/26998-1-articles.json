I have had considerable experience with Orbiter by Martin Schweiger. So when I stumbled onto Kerbal Space program, I must say I was very pleased with the functionality it provides.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know how many times I would alter code and copy paste mission content from the save files in order to emulate what KSP does by design. The ability to build the vessels from the ground up, the ability to enable a launch of said vehicle, the ability to dock and build stations of ones own design, the Kerbals themselves that add a natural external visual component rather than a readout of a pulse on a screen to show that your crew either survived or passed into oblivion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll combined KSP is exactly what I was \u0022imagining\u0022 when I was in orbiter. And it delivers beyond my expectations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter Orbiter.. KSP was a natural progression for my vision of a world outside of our own gravity constraints.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am very pleased to meet like minded enthusiasts of the genre and continue to enjoy the pics, the vids, the mods, and the imaginative story lines you have all contributed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T20:33:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe design aspect is definitely as much a draw to the game as the piloting one (more so, for some people).
