Thus, as the focus travels, the orbit follows the focus and remains with it. However, that is all. The orbit does not follow anything other than the position. If the focus rotates, the orbit ignores it. If the focus itself orbits something else and thus takes a curved path, the orbit ignores the attitude change. It always* stays exactly, perfectly fixed in the same orientation it was when it was first established.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat means that any orbit, but especially polar orbits, will appear to \u0022drift\u0022 from the point of view of their focus. If you are on the Mun, and there is something in a polar orbit of it, you will notice that sometimes, this polar orbit is orientated so that the north pole pass will go in the prograde direction of the Mun\u0027s own path. But at another time, the north pole pass may be radial in, radial out, or even retrograde to the Mun\u0027s own path... or anything in between. That is because the Mun travels in a circle around Kerbin, but the polar orbit only follows the position. It does not turn with the circle to always face the same direction with respect to the Mun\u0027s path of travel**. So from Kerbin\u0027s point of view, the polar orbit is sometimes edge-on towards the observer, and sometimes shows its broad side.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich also works for Laythe, or course. Sometimes, a thing in a polar orbit of Laythe will be edge-on towards Jool. And sometimes it will be broad side on. And not only towards Jool... it can also be any position with respect to your arriving spacecraft. It can be aligned for rendezvous, it can be perpendicular, it can be anything in between. \u003Cem\u003EWhen\u003C/em\u003E exactly each phase happens depends solely on how and when the orbit was intially set up. If the orbit is not aligned for rendezvous when you arrive... well, tough luck. There\u0027s absolutely nothing whatsoever you can do. Go perform a plane change to align yourself after capture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo workarounds can mitigate the issue.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- One, if you arrive at the wrong time, that means that you \u003Cem\u003Eleft\u003C/em\u003E at the wrong time, resulting in intercepting Laythe at the wrong position in its orbit. Leave later, or leave sooner, or try wasting time or accelerating while already en route. Perhaps that way you can hit Laythe when the position is better.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Two, if you\u0027re forced into a large plane change, try to employ your usual bag of tricks to make plane changes cheaper, especially the \u0022highly elliptical orbit\u0022 trick. First, circularize equatorial, then line yourself up under your target orbit, push the apoapsis waaaay out there, and once at apoapsis, flip your orbit polar. It will still be costly, but this method usually saves at least some \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(* in a 2-body approximation like the one KSP uses, anyway)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(** this is why a single polar satellites can scan an entire celestial body - regardless of whether or not the body itself rotates.
