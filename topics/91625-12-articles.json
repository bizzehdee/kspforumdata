I\u0027ve just completed the SpawnVessel behaviour (will be released in 0.6.0) which could be used, but I\u0027d suggest sticking with waypoints for a starting point - much lighter weight... 100 one-part vessels might already be getting up there. In fact when you move away from waypoints, I\u0027d be included still keep the same logic as in-flight waypoints - rendering a single image for the coin, rather than a 3d model.

So once you have your proof of concept working and you want to generate \u0022coins\u0022 instead of waypoints, you can swap out the GenerateWaypoint behaviour for one that you\u0027ve written yourself and Contract Configurator will load it and expose it for you.
