I just finished a major excursion to Jool bringing 8 landing probes and 8 space probes, and the landing probes were useless. My main ship didn\u0027t have the fuel to visit every moon, and the ground probes didn\u0027t have enough fuel to both get to the moon and slow the landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here\u0027s my new idea, a combination of the two. The space probe already weighed 1.21 and together it weighs 1.56, so shouldn\u0027t affect it too much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LgmoPhO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022LgmoPhO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d love to see other people\u0027s probes.
