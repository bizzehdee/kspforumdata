I only noticed after my ship was set to land on it. As I landed, I noticed a weird little thing. I had found a Mun Arch! Unfortunately, my ship crash-landed, but my rover pod was unharmed. So after a little work, I got the pod on the road. Attached are a few pics. (I\u0027m beginning a program to set up a base there, and rescue my stranded comrades.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"darkwolfpaw54","CreatedById":37377,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-29T02:00:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edid you go through it? any way good job! not many kerbals see that in there lifetime\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"yoyo478","CreatedById":31789,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-29T02:01:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022darkwolfpaw54\u0022 data-cite=\u0022darkwolfpaw54\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Edid you go through it? any way good job! not many kerbals see that in there lifetime\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have Bill stationed there with Bob and Jeb back at the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rover is located under the arch, with Bill chilling out on top.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-29T03:00:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFun fact: the cart mod as a \u0022sticky\u0022 factor built in, to keep it from bouncing around over bumps.
