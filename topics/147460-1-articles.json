If you are trying to use updated mods for 1.1.3 with 1.0.5 then unless they are part only mods they are unlikely to be trouble free.\u00A0 A look at you r log would tell me a lot\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ryanmdoyle","CreatedById":168602,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-11T22:34:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I don\u0027t even have 1.1.3 on my Mac any more. \u00A0Basically, I could do a clean install and if I tried to create a new game, it would show the Loading graphic in the lower right corner, freeze, and never start up. \u00A0I went as far as going into the Library/Hidden files and deleting anything associated with KSP, starting 100% from scratch, but still something was wrong.
