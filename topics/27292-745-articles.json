After it spent about 200 days in orbit waiting for the window to the red planet to open, it was time to send up the crew. Earlier in those 200 days, I had built my first space plane in 1.0 with a successful hands-off re-entry after it had docked with my LKO research station to bring some upgrades to it (such a docking port). After it was refuel and refitted with a crew cabin, a tourist - Tratha Kerman - joined the expedition crew on the shuttle to visit the expedition craft in LKO. Jeb and Val tossed a coin to see who would be the one to pilot the personnel shuttle. Here in front of the shuttle are Jeb, Bill and Val just before take-off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OVkTds1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022OVkTds1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the first ascent into the upper atmosphere, I messed up. I was probably taking too many screenshots and I got distracted. But eventually I managed to break through into a 70 km apoapsis. I levelled out the craft immediately after this so I could catch up to the expedition craft, which was in a 72-83 km orbit about 50 km ahead. I was forced to dock at a particular awkward angle with limited battery power because I had not replaced the extendable solar panel in the cargo bay that I replaced with the crew cabin. Anyway, it seems like Bill will have to modify the positioning of the radial docking station to get connected living spaces to work. For now, I disabled it out of laziness. I will place the greenhouse and cargo bay (with a probecore inside) on the radial attachment point instead once the station is in orbit around Duna. That will be super inconvenient some later on for sure. The same happened on my LKO research station as my game progressed over the past 200 days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Z859hs9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Z859hs9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile Bob and Bill - who are both level 3 kerbonauts - would be the scientist and engineer on the trip to Duna, it was not yet certain which of the pilots would remain on the expedition craft, and who would return to Kerbin. It was decided that, since Jeb was the one who got to pilot the \u0022Orbiter Two\u0022 personnel shuttle, Val would be the one to pilot the expedition to Duna. Thrata was not up to the challenge of Duna and returned to Kerbin with Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will add a few more pictures \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/PEo61/all\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eon this imgur album\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-19T21:34:40Z\u0022 title=\u002209/19/2015 09:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Flayer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
