I can be overly pedantic myself, and it is always best to try to be clear here. I don\u0027t know if there is a standard term for this particular maneuver, though on these forums, some people call it an Oberth maneuver. I don\u0027t know if people call it that elsewhere, or if there is just no accepted term for it. I don\u0027t like that term because the Oberth effect is always in effect. All fuel-ejecting maneuvers are Oberth maneuvers. Some are just better than others. Anyway, I thought it was somewhat appropriate to call it a powered slingshot since you come in from a different SOI and end up on a hyperbolic orbit.
