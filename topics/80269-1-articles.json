Keep up the great work!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I finally managed to join the forum after about a year into KSP. I started with 0.20 last summer and a few month later after visiting all the planets and moons (except the Joolian moons) I tried some mods, mostly visual and HUD mods like EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements, AlarmClock, EnhancedNavball, ... but also KSP Interstellar. Since 0.22 I play the career mode without any mods until the stocktree is finished, afterwards I include the mods. Since two weeks now I can fully enjoy the beauty of the planets in 64 bit without texture reduction \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E. At the moment I try IVA-only flights with RasterPropMonitor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI often read that KSP brings people into science, which is great I think (because science is great!) but for me it\u0027s a bit upside-down. I was and still am into science quite a while before I started playing but the game and the (modding-)community also inspired me to learn how to use blender/unity/gimp. I\u0027ve done some little things and few animated parts but I\u0027m really horribly bad at giving them a soul (texturing). So there is still a long way ahead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENone the less KSP changed my priorities in science. I now keep my eyes open for space-related projects at the univeristy \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I have a few maybe stupid questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I would like to make a lab coat with the KSP logo on the back (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/u1Ew63n.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://i.imgur.com/u1Ew63n.png\u003C/a\u003E) to express my love for the game but I\u0027m not 100% sure if this allowed due to copyrights etc. I looked up the Fan-Art rules but could not find anything in detail. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Is there a list with company names being used already? I have an idea but don\u0027t know if that name is already in use by someone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I want to help improving the game but also not to slow the development down with useless crashreports. So whenever the \u0022would be very helpfull to the developers if you send in the crashreport\u0022 message shows up I\u0027m unsure what to do. I don\u0027t really need support for myself because the game is not finished yet, crashes happen and I learned to make backups of my savegames (the hard way \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E) but also I\u0027m not able to judge if the report is usefull or not ... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the end a little apology to to the linguist for my english skills.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-31T17:06:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello Eleusis la Arwall. Welcome to the forum. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Currently, the rule is that you can make fan crafts like this as long as you\u0027re not selling them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I have not made one up, but somebody probably has, so ask around. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Please do post the crash reports in the Bugs sub-forum, and the developers will get around to it when they have time, so you\u0027re not causing them any inconvenience. (To help keep things orderly there, there are \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24543-NEED-SUPPORT-Read-this-before-posting-No-modded-installs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ea few rules \u003C/a\u003Eyou should read over before submitting the post.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd your English is just fine.
