I\u0027m looking for a (unmodded) design of a stable aircraft that is pretty forgiving in flight. I picked up a mission for some temperature scans and would also like to possibly fly around Kerbin and do some science. Yes I know there is quicker ways to make science but I\u0027d like to fly around and have fun. Also is it possible to get to 16k with the first jet engine alone?\n\nThanks\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nI did find a tutorial finally. I will give it a try, but any input would be helpful!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-02T16:15:19Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2015 04:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FiannaTiger**"},{"CreatedByName":"Prepper-Jack","CreatedById":143834,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T14:47:07Z","Content":"16k is pretty hard with the basic jet engine. More realistically, even with a lot of air intake, you\u0027re looking at 12-13k. Ramjet can do that altitude quite easily - but unfortunately that\u0027s way up the tree. Until that time, supplemental power is needed.\n\nDesigning a forgiving aircraft is fairly easy. Throw some delta wings on the back with elevons on the back of those. Put a tail fin up top between them. If it\u0027s a longer craft, you\u0027ll want some controllable wings up front as well. Make sure the lift is a little bit behind the center of mass, throw on some wheels, and some parachutes if you hate landing, and you\u0027re set.\n\nIf you want to add in the added weight of a rocket to get up to 16k\u002B, you\u0027ll probably want 2 or more jets to facilitate that."},{"CreatedByName":"FiannaTiger","CreatedById":145523,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T15:03:44Z","Content":"Thanks Prepper-Jack. Yeah I think my problem was I was putting the CoL just behind the CoM (inside of one another) which made things harder to control than I wanted. I believe for the temp reading over the 16k alt I will just build a rocket and \u0022fly\u0022 it over there to gather that data point and then do a plane with parachutes to get the other two points real quick, since one is on the ground and I was able to land my plane but couldn\u0027t get close enough to the area without crashing my plane trying to find it."},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T15:06:47Z","Content":"Might come in handy:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Ok silly question (just got Kerbal 3 days ago) Where do I place the craft file to show up in my list of loadable planes?\n\nIn your KSP folder there is a folder called \u0022Ships\u0022 and in there are seperate folders for SPH and VAB.\n\nAs for aircraft design: Look at this thread: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52080-Basic-Aircraft-Design-Explained-Simply-With-Pictures](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52080-Basic-Aircraft-Design-Explained-Simply-With-Pictures)\n\nTurn on the markers for center of mass (yellow) and center of lift (blue) in the hangar (icons in lower left corner of the screen).\n\nCoM should always be a little in front of CoL. That way your craft wont want to fly tail first. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nNext you need control surfaces in the right places. Think about the levers they are going to have around the CoM.\n\nBut that is all explained in the link above. What is written about the crapy stock aero is not true anymore. All the principles described also work for stock now.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-02T15:54:12Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2015 03:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Chaos\\_Klaus**"},{"CreatedByName":"SanderB","CreatedById":83050,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T15:52:29Z","Content":"you can target sites from the map view, a purple target marker will help you find the correct survey spots."},{"CreatedByName":"FiannaTiger","CreatedById":145523,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T16:56:55Z","Content":"Ok I think I found one of my major problems, is that I didn\u0027t have any control surfaces on my wings. I thought the slope back wings had elevons but they do not, and I guess in building my plane I picked them up but had a hard time getting them to attach so I ended up not using them. That should make things a lot better along with the center of lift behind not inside and just behind the center of the CoM maker.\n\nThanks everyone with the information and the craft ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) will give it a try tonight!"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T17:10:21Z","Content":"One I made a while ago and made available for download is a pretty stable flyer.
