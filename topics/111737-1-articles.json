I\u0027m looking for a (unmodded) design of a stable aircraft that is pretty forgiving in flight. I picked up a mission for some temperature scans and would also like to possibly fly around Kerbin and do some science. Yes I know there is quicker ways to make science but I\u0027d like to fly around and have fun. Also is it possible to get to 16k with the first jet engine alone?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did find a tutorial finally.

More realistically, even with a lot of air intake, you\u0027re looking at 12-13k. Ramjet can do that altitude quite easily - but unfortunately that\u0027s way up the tree. Until that time, supplemental power is needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesigning a forgiving aircraft is fairly easy. Throw some delta wings on the back with elevons on the back of those. Put a tail fin up top between them. If it\u0027s a longer craft, you\u0027ll want some controllable wings up front as well. Make sure the lift is a little bit behind the center of mass, throw on some wheels, and some parachutes if you hate landing, and you\u0027re set.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to add in the added weight of a rocket to get up to 16k\u002B, you\u0027ll probably want 2 or more jets to facilitate that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FiannaTiger","CreatedById":145523,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T15:03:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks Prepper-Jack. Yeah I think my problem was I was putting the CoL just behind the CoM (inside of one another) which made things harder to control than I wanted. I believe for the temp reading over the 16k alt I will just build a rocket and \u0022fly\u0022 it over there to gather that data point and then do a plane with parachutes to get the other two points real quick, since one is on the ground and I was able to land my plane but couldn\u0027t get close enough to the area without crashing my plane trying to find it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T15:06:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMight come in handy:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/SwlF8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
