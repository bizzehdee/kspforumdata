Storing food for a hole year should not be simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Actually if they irradiate the food you will pretty much never have to worry about spoilage also as most food is shipped to space dehydrated this is even less an issue. Simple filtering of the water will remove most if not all contaminates that can leach in, after all you know what your storing it in you should know the best way to filter it out. Storing food is much easier in space no need to worry about small animals etc as most of the food is stored in a vacuum and only brought in when needed etc. While spoilage may not be a problem if the food is correctly prepared, it will still lose its nutritional value after a certain amount of time and until they invent stasis fields I\u0027m not sure that there is any way to combat that.

A vessel is put \u0022on rails\u0022 when: (1) you timewarp (at 5x and above), (2) the vessel exits the 2.4 km radius of the active vessel, or (3) you exit the Flight scene. Vessels are \u0022loaded\u0022 if they are the active vessel or within 2.4 km of the active vessel. My mod actively works with any vessel that is loaded, even if you are time warping (i.e. on rails). It does not do anything if the vessel is unloaded. When the vessel is next loaded, it does the calculations to catch up consumption since the last time the vessel was loaded making it seem like it was working all along.\u003Cp\u003EIf a vessel is loaded for the first time, the mod sets the \u0022last update time\u0022 to Now and starts tracking consumption.

Page 56, table 4.3.1. ISS Phase II numbers. Some, but not all ISS food is shipped up hydrated. The main issue here is that it really depends on one\u0027s assumptions.

A container built solely to store food can reasonably hold at least half its volume in packaged foodstuffs, but probably not more than about 75% : 5-10% is needed for the module\u0027s internal structure, and another 10%-25% is needed for access space, to prevent the crew from having to stack and re-stack to access a particular package. If all the packages are identical, then much of that excess empty space can be ignored, but not all of it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EP.S. water doesn\u0027t \u0022go bad\u0022, but it can pick up flavors from the storage container that gives it a strange taste.
