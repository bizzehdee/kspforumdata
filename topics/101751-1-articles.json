With some ship designs (especially highly symmetrical ones) it can be difficult to know at a glance where the \u0022front\u0022 of my ship is and therefore it is hard to transition from the navball guidance to what I see from my camera view. What I would love to see is some form of direction indicators overlaid on the screen that adjust with my camera movements. This would be purely for camera use, it would have nothing to do with direct ship navigation control - that is covered by the navball just fine.\n\nI\u0027ve made a few mock-up screenshots that show (roughly) what I mean. I can envision a couple approaches to this idea:\n\n1. Use an overlay that covers much of the screen view, more like a HUD view.\n\n2. Use a small and simple window with a compact view of the camera direction.\n\nThere would be different indicators for orbital and surface views. The orbital view would show your prograde, radial, normal markers as appropriate for your camera angle. The surface view would should show cardinal directions like a compass. There could be options to adjust size, color, amount of detail, etc.\n\nPlease excuse my crude attempt at drawing, I\u0027m sure someone else could make this look tons better.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

If not, I hope this wouldn\u0027t be difficult to create and I think others might find it useful."},{"CreatedByName":"ultrasquid","CreatedById":10944,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T19:38:14Z","Content":"I think you could do something that indicates your current view orientation on the navball, a symbol like **[\\_O\\_]** that indicates the current view facing relative to the ship\u0027s actual orientation.\n\nNot as fancy as your idea, but might be easier to implement, perhaps as an augmentation to the Enhanced Navball mod."},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T20:57:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I think you could do something that indicates your current view orientation on the navball, a symbol like **[\\_O\\_]** that indicates the current view facing relative to the ship\u0027s actual orientation.\n\u003E Not as fancy as your idea, but might be easier to implement, perhaps as an augmentation to the Enhanced Navball mod.\n\nMy only worry with that is if your camera is facing something in the opposite hemisphere of what the navball shows then it would not display at all."},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T03:08:29Z","Content":"Would this work for you?\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81543-0-90-NavHud-a-NavBall-inspired-Heads-Up-Display-1-1-4](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81543-0-90-NavHud-a-NavBall-inspired-Heads-Up-Display-1-1-4)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T03:46:26Z","Content":"That\u0027s almost exactly what I was looking for, thanks!\n\nI\u0027ll have to fool around with the options and colors, but I think this will accomplish what I was hoping to do."}]}
