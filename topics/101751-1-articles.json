With some ship designs (especially highly symmetrical ones) it can be difficult to know at a glance where the \u0022front\u0022 of my ship is and therefore it is hard to transition from the navball guidance to what I see from my camera view. What I would love to see is some form of direction indicators overlaid on the screen that adjust with my camera movements. This would be purely for camera use, it would have nothing to do with direct ship navigation control - that is covered by the navball just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve made a few mock-up screenshots that show (roughly) what I mean. I can envision a couple approaches to this idea:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Use an overlay that covers much of the screen view, more like a HUD view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Use a small and simple window with a compact view of the camera direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere would be different indicators for orbital and surface views. The orbital view would show your prograde, radial, normal markers as appropriate for your camera angle. The surface view would should show cardinal directions like a compass. There could be options to adjust size, color, amount of detail, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease excuse my crude attempt at drawing, I\u0027m sure someone else could make this look tons better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/BwTKK\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
