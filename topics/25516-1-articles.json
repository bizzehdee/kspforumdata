The combination of detachable jet engines and rocket power really seems to work wonders in reducing the overall weight of the craft and improving the efficiency of its lower stage engines. Here\u0027s the sort of thing I\u0027ve been using:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lBYCFR1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lBYCFR1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe highest stage in this variant is a tiny lander for a Gilly landing. This one is approaching the maximum pad liftoff weight for 12 jet engines, so it has some liquid boosters for liftoff assistance. I usually kick on the main engine at around 13-14k, not amazingly high, but more than enough to get the rest of the platform into orbit without any trouble. The payload section can achieve orbits of 150-200k using only fuel from the orange tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lypz04i.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lypz04i.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main downside is high part count due to the engines. Your payload shouldn\u0027t be too complicated or it will cause serious lag. Wobble is manageable with struts, and detaching the jet engines usually goes smoothly... usually. Ideally, they fly above the rest of the rocket and start spiraling away. Sometimes Murphy\u0027s Law intervenes. But, the failure rate is reasonably low for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, thoughts on hybrid rockets?

Now you need an action group to both shut down the jet engines, decouple the first stage and you can just as well start second as well fire up second stage as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor second stage use two lv30 on tanks as side boosters for the nuclear stage to get enough trust to get you in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ComradeGoat","CreatedById":59041,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T13:06:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBind jet separation to a custom function and have it shut down the engines and close the intakes at the same time.
