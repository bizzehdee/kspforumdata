The\u00A0 nature of the challenge I was \u00A0working on also made optimal gear placement impossible. If I put too much weight on my rear gear, \u00A0it would always explode as I came off the end of the runway. Maybe it\u0027s also because they\u0027re off-kilter mounted to the wet wings in the back, but they sure\u00A0looked pretty straight to me. Moving to bigger gear would probably have solved these problems as well, but the large gear really seemed to add a lot of drag to the vessel which made it a non-starter for this. In any case, that plane took off just fine the way it was, so long as I didn\u0027t have too much weight on the rear gear and/or started retracting it right before hitting the end of the runway.

It\u0027s just the 1st tier runway might as well be made of concrete. Without soft body physics, it simply does not behave like it\u0027s made of dirt. It\u0027s just bumpy and has a texture to make it \u003Cem\u003Elook\u003C/em\u003E like dirt. It\u0027s completely silly to have a runway that is less flat than the surrounding grass. I\u0027d buy it if the dirt was flat and everything had more friction, but it\u0027s just ridiculous for the runway to be harder to land on than the outside area. It\u0027s pointless to compare it to real life. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, when did I say anything about bigger planes?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
