Although they originally thought that it was mostly harmless, they soon discovered that some of it\u0027s planets had rings going around them. Enthralled by their beauty, the Kerbals decided they were going to have rings, and nothing was going to stop them! Unfortunately, some of the moons in their system wouldn\u0027t hold a ring system, no matter how hard they tried, but they managed to get brilliant and technicolour ring systems around most of their planets and moons.\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n== Background (real) ==\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter I made the Jool Rings Mod, I thought, \u0022let\u0027s do that again, but all over the place.\u0022 I consequently went on a spree of adding rings to every planet and moon in sight.\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\nCurrently this is only a developmental version; I still have to optimise some of the rings. The mod also comes with an OPM extension, adding rings to the Outer Planets Mod moons, but it is only half-finished. Pictures will be added soon.
