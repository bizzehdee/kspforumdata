Am I doing something else wrong, now?\n\u003E This doesn\u0027t effect usability so far, which seems fine. I just really wanted to try out your wonderful parts!\n\nDid you just drag and drop the previous version into GameData? If so, you should find a folder called \u0027parts\u0027.

Goal is to eventually be able to make orbit with it, but the fuel burn required during the transsonic phase is killing me. I have to run the rockets from Mach 0.97 all the way to Mach 1.47 before the Afterburns will be self-accelerating. Total time for that is about 20 seconds, so you can imagine how much more useful it\u0027d be to have that burn up higher, not down around 7-8 km.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-18T05:38:16Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2015 05:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MaverickSawyer**"},{"CreatedByName":"Hellbrand","CreatedById":65742,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T07:32:42Z","Content":"you shoudl totally make a mk.3 expansion that adds wider fuselages for cargo transportation! and all sorts of other stuff!"},{"CreatedByName":"MinorInconvenience","CreatedById":112453,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T17:44:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The Mantas.
