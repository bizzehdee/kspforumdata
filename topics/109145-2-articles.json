And surprisingly, the Mantas actually provide the best performance AND most badass looks. So I need to add either drop tanks to provide more rocket burn time, or just need to revise the aerodynamics of it. :/\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T00:48:23Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 12:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MaverickSawyer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
