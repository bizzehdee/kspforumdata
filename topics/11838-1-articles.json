It uses a command module from the BACE mod and the cart from the Carts mod. (Made this in .15, not the latest update because I\\\u0027ve heard of some really bad glitches that came with it)\n\nMax Speed: 102 --Fastest I got when going straight on flatish land\n\nAverage Speed: 90 --Again, on flatish land\n\nBreak time: 6-10 seconds --Breaks from 102 m/s to 0 in around that time, and does not flip over!\n\nTurning the car: It\\\u0027s safe to just hold down J or L from 0 to 60 m/s, however it will flip from around 70\u002B, so just quickly tap the keys instead of holding them down.\n\nI had quite a bit of fun with this thing, I just drove around for a few minutes and jumped hills every now and then. This cart seems to be really stable because of the BACE command module, as it is just a cylinder. \n\n(Headlights can be turned on by pressing U, if you don\\\u0027t know.)\n\n**EDIT: Messed around mountains with it, you need to control it when it\\\u0027s mid-air using the WASD keys to keep it steady. Added a picture of me flying off of a mountain.**\n\n\u003E ![screenshot13.png](http://i1129.photobucket.com/albums/m520/Pingonaut/KSP%20LGV/screenshot13.png)\n\u003E ![screenshot14.png](http://i1129.photobucket.com/albums/m520/Pingonaut/KSP%20LGV/screenshot14.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![screenshot15.png](http://i1129.photobucket.com/albums/m520/Pingonaut/KSP%20LGV/screenshot15.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![screenshot24.png](http://i1129.photobucket.com/albums/m520/Pingonaut/KSP%20LGV/screenshot24.png)![2h2kzts.png](http://i50.tinypic.com/2h2kzts.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nLet me know what you think!! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Feragorn","CreatedById":7549,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T19:10:46Z","Content":"Those wingboards are intriguing. I assume the extra lift they give you makes jumping things more fun, but also could pose some stability issues on a long jump. Does the lack of vertical stabilizers cause issues?"},{"CreatedByName":"Pingonaut","CreatedById":15723,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T20:16:57Z","Content":"The wing things are just to make the cart bit look less bland.

(It has a density slider, too)\n\nThanks for the feedback. I\\\u0027ve found that you HAVE to control it mid-air using WASD to keep it level with the ground. Doing it that way it works (mostly) fine depending on how good you are at keeping it level and noticing the angle of the terrain you\\\u0027ll land on.\n\nI added a picture of me messing around on the hills west of KSC, seems you can get really good air, even when you\\\u0027re not trying!"}]}
