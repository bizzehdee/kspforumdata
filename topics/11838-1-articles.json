This cart seems to be really stable because of the BACE command module, as it is just a cylinder. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Headlights can be turned on by pressing U, if you don\\\u0027t know.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT: Messed around mountains with it, you need to control it when it\\\u0027s mid-air using the WASD keys to keep it steady.
