I am currently mapping each node on the tree (I have 68 mapped so far and am not even 1/2 way through, boy there are a lot of nodes!) I am then creating a config file for each supported mod.  \n\nThe idea is to make it easier to customize the tree for different play styles (e.g. unmanned before manned, historical progression, airplanes first), and to make it easier to add mod support in the future.   \n\nBasically the impetus was that I am trying to do a historical progression career save starting with aircraft, and found that due to where many of my parts fall in the tree, I have to upgrade the RnD building to access the nodes well before I have the funds to do so (due to my settings, the 1st upgrade is 500K).  \n\nAnyway, will post the results here when I\u0027m done.   \n\nOh, and for airplanes first, it will just be a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patch that adds supersonic flight as a parent to the 1st manned command module node."},{"CreatedByName":"GrubbyZebra","CreatedById":168140,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-15T20:08:28Z","Content":"Here is the current tree layout I am working with:  \n![bKQkcSb.png](https://i.imgur.com/bKQkcSb.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"GrubbyZebra","CreatedById":168140,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-15T20:55:54Z","Content":"In other news, I\u0027ve just finished mapping the nodes to a relational array.   \n\nThere are 212 nodes and it takes 128,030 science points to unlock them all at their base cost (difficulty multipliers will increase this, of course).  \n\nThat\u0027s a lot of Science!"},{"CreatedByName":"GrubbyZebra","CreatedById":168140,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-21T23:26:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 7/15/2018 at 4:55 PM, GrubbyZebra said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E In other news, I\u0027ve just finished mapping the nodes to a relational array.   \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E There are 212 nodes and it takes 128,030 science points to unlock them all at their base cost (difficulty multipliers will increase this, of course).  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s a lot of Science!\n\u003E \n\nSo I figured if I was going to go through all this, I may as well incorporate a request from elsewhere in the thread, so I am making the tree a more conventionally left-to-right tree instead of the spiral tree. I also pruned some duplicate nodes between ETT and CTT, so I\u0027m down to 204 nodes, but remapped the science cost to increase approximately exponentially by tier. Using a cubic relationship across the 20 tiers, the most expensive node was reduced to 8000 science from 10000, but the total science required to unlock the whole tree actually increased slightly to 129,983. To provide more granularity for the early game, tiers below 7 were split into 2, 3, or 4 sub-tiers.  \n\nI\u0027ve just finished mapping out all the coordinates for the nodes (by hand, because it was easier to just make a big grid), and have drawn all the relationships between them. Now I am starting the arduous process of building the text file manually (I am trying to remove the yong tech tree dependency) using the stock tree as a template.  \n\nWill post screenshots when I am done....\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-07-22T01:39:44Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2018 01:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by GrubbyZebra**"},{"CreatedByName":"GrubbyZebra","CreatedById":168140,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-23T20:19:10Z","Content":"Another update:  \n\nMy tree is 100% Stock and CTT compatible (it actually will require CTT due to node and icon usage).
