Yes NASA uses it, but thats because they don\u0027t want to waste America\u0027s tax dollars trying to cowboy up. Although its use doesn\u0027t take away from the technical impressiveness of the video, I would find it personally less fufilling to know that I used the AI to complete the majority of the most difficult tasks.
