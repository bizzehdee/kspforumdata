And it\u0027s a really nice feeling knowing that I\u0027m filling a niche and that people enjoy it. But here\u0027s reality. 1. I\u0027m not wealthy. As a matter of fact, I don\u0027t even consider myself middle class. 2. I\u0027m a school bus driver and while the hourly pay and being home during the day is nice, the pay checks aren\u0027t all that spectacular. 3. My wife had to go back to truck driving to pay the bills and I really don\u0027t relish the thought of her being out there by herself. 4. I\u0027m 50\u002B and while mortality has been a lingering subconscious thought for some time, being comfortable in my retirement is even more pressing. I have 10-15 years to come up with something financially supportive so that I\u0027m not working till I\u0027m dead. I never expected or anticipated that modding would be a second income (though if I had been able to afford to do this full time, believe me, I would). It was a \u0027hobby,\u0027 an experiment and an education so I\u0027m not disappointed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI truly do appreciate all the donations and the praise. But as many of you know Dice and I have been conversing a lot of late. Dice is off working on his new boat project, and like me, he\u0027s not a young man any more. Whether his retirement plan will work or not, I can\u0027t say, he has a lot of work to do. He\u0027s pretty much given up on modding for KSP though in order to focus on what could be a nice payoff and I honestly can\u0027t blame him. My retirement plan, on the other hand, is non-existent. So, I\u0027m seriously having to consider whether the time investment in modding will pay off in the long run. It\u0027s sad and it pains me to do so, but I\u0027m having to look at my time investment financially.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then, about 2 weeks ago, I fired up a new sandbox game. I installed a few mods to make it \u0027fun\u0027, like RemoteTech. Within 2 hours I had a small fleet of geostationary satellites in orbit, a communications station in geo orbit and a refueling station full of fuel with RCS tugs in LKO and then I stopped and asked myself, what next? And I honestly couldn\u0027t come up with something I hadn\u0027t already done, something I wanted to do or something within the limitations of game physics that I could do. That was the first time since I started modding in June that I planned on \u0027playing\u0027 KSP and it lasted 2 hours before the \u0027fun\u0027 vanished. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I\u0027m not the only modder who\u0027s reached this point (though I seem to have reached it pretty quick). Dice is moving on, Lo-fi, the modder behind Kerbal Foundries is on a leave of absence and dozens of other really nice mods have simply been abandoned... and I have to ask if their reasons aren\u0027t the same as mine: motivation? Investment vs. reward? Lack of fun?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t reached any solid decision yet, but before I spend hours going though every single part in both mods to find out how badly Squad has screwed these mods over I\u0027m going to spend a bit more time thinking on it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kagame","CreatedById":141304,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T15:18:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, I see.
