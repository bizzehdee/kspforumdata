Sorry about the waste of a thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the final version, the panels will be offset in so they\u0027re just barely exposed. Hopefully FAR will barely even notice them. The winglets are because my REV is quite long with the Mat bay and the service bay being recovered, and I was having a hell of a time keeping it butt-first. It\u0027s only 66kg for the 3 of them, out of a 1763kg REV, so it\u0027s not a huge loss. 50% scale is still quite excessive, but 10% is insufficient. And now I have enough lift and control that I can just aim for 40km from anywhere up to SOI boundary and just glide along with a 0 vertical velocity bleeding off speed ad infinitum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks a ton.

Certainly not a waste of a thread, you had a support question and tbh, it\u0027s a pretty niche bug that not many people are likely to know about.
