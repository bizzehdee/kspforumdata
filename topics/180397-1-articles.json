I\u0027ve had several mission aborts where I was only able to EVA 1-2 kerbals (out of 4\u002B) before the crash. The delay was mostly due to having to wait for reloads when switching back to the doomed craft before I could EVA the remaining crew.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIdeally the behavior would be to remain\u00A0focused on the craft while kerbals EVA and then disembark one-by-one.\u00A0Once the last crew is out, you can then [ and ] to cycle to each kerbal and parachute them to (relative) safety.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as keys go, maybe backspace 3 times rapidly? As in bailout-bailout-bailout (abort-abort-abort). The first one would actually fire your abort sequence - once that\u0027s done, or if your craft is only singled staged, then the tap-it-thrice mode will pour out your crew.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS: imagine all the shenanigans this could result in with large-capacity craft?
