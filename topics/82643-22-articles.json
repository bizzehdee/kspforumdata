I\u0027m currently in a solar orbit near Moho and testing endurance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having a lot of issues with KSP crashing while testing. I\u0027m not getting any debug messages so I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s caused by BoxSat, something I\u0027m doing, or something with KSP. Memory performance is very good and garbage collection seems to be working so I\u0027m not sure what the problem is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my case, I prefere a good work than a fast work, take your time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"naloxone","CreatedById":23786,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T04:03:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the work, orc, I\u0027ll be looking forward to it whenever you are satisfied it is ready for primetime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFell off the wagon a bit after .24 for other reasons, but Boxsat brought me back in a big way, I was having great fun with it and Remotetech! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0AelsrB.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220AelsrB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"orcmaul","CreatedById":19612,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T09:22:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022naloxone\u0022 data-cite=\u0022naloxone\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0AelsrB.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220AelsrB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA molniya constellation and a keosync triangle? Someone\u0027s working overtime to achieve global communications. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems like Squad might not be done tweaking how thermal works. I\u0027ve got BoxSat halfway to behaving how I want thermally but I had to give it some extreme stats to get that behavior. Squad may change it again and I\u0027ll have to retune it again. We\u0027ll get there eventually. What I\u0027m looking for is some noticeable thermal cycling between orbital night and day and to have BoxSat reliably burn up during unprotected kerbin reentry. Right now, not much of anything will burn up for me but with a shallow reentry it breaks up nicely. Despite my apparent obsession with fiery death you can still visit Moho semi-safely (you\u0027ll be warm but not hot). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also getting some stupid behavior from hard water landings (which aren\u0027t supposed to happen anyway). Parts go shooting off of after hard splashdown and if you focus on them they never decelerate. Maybe this is a known issue. Right now it\u0027s just a silly known issue. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s see, what else. Pretty much all of the basic issues are patched up. I\u0027ve got the new module manager files using NEEDS in place so the install should be smoother. I\u0027m still running PNG textures but I plan to try DDS conversion once I have everything else in place. I removed a mod I was using to show me part temperatures and I\u0027m crashing less now (I finally found the thermal debug option in cheat window). BoxSat exhibits high drag while reentering with solar panels extended (duh) but the current aerodynamics model does not reliably break the solar panels before BoxSat has decelerated so much that it no longer burns up during reentry. I have long sought a way to change the value for \u0022Panel strength\u0022 but never found anything useful. If you know how please let me know.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phers","CreatedById":67094,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T09:51:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs this updated for 1.0.2?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"orcmaul","CreatedById":19612,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T09:56:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Phers\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Phers\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs this updated for 1.0.2?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot yet.
