Although it isn\\\u0027t necessary, it is quite useful and fun for using as the RCS controls instead of the keyboard. The Extreme 3D Pro by Logitech which I believe is like $5 more has the hat switch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\\\u0027re willing to spend $45 I would recommend the T-Flight Hotas X, it has a separate throttle unit and IMO gives you the best bang for your buck of any joystick under $100. I can play 100% keyboard free with my Hotas X.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-18T05:02:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAt Fry\\\u0027s last week the Attack 3 was $18 (marked down a little) while the Pro was $30. I went with the Attack 3 both because the price was a little nicer, and I liked the feel a little better. The twist function would have been nice, but I haven\\\u0027t really missed it. While it doesn\\\u0027t have a hat, the A3 does have 4 thumb buttons at the top that do the same thing, and I\\\u0027ve mapped them to RCS. I\\\u0027m pretty happy with the A3. \u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
