Unfortunately, it still doesn\u0027t suit me. I think the reason I don;t feel comfortable with it is that the contracts seem rather arbitrary to me. Why flight test an engine if it\u0027s already in use and has been performing fine? If it was the case that there was a certain amount of risk of explosion the first time an engine is flown, and that risk decreases per flight, I\u0027d see more point to it. And I\u0027d be wanting to do such tests with unmanned rockets at first. The current system just feels a bit \u0027grindy\u0027 - I have successfully put a sattelite in orbit, but am way short of being able to upgrade any of te hbuildings. SoI\u0027d have to do odd \u0027tests\u0027 for no other reasons than that in order to ever be able to get better parts and do more interesting things, I have to do them. Contrast this with a science only game where yes, I do need to gather science points in order to be able to unlock more parts, but I can make every flight one which has a reasonable objective, even if it doesn\u0027t directly gain me more science. I like the idea of upgrading capabilities by upgrading buildings - giving my discomfort with the Career game, I am sad that the buildings aren;t upgradeable in teh pure science game. Likewise crew experience - I very much like the sound of the way it\u0027s now implemented, but it\u0027s a shame if it\u0027s not available unless you play a Career game. In short - I\u0027d enjoy career mode more if the contracts made more sense in encouraging progression and/or had more obvious point to them (eg: build small space station and put into orbit; dock with space station and leave 2 crew in orbit; exchange crew at space station, etc - the swap crew at space station ones might not be strictly necessary, but they are logical) and I;d like to see crew experience and upgadable builings in pure Science games. Long term, I will, of course, be using mods to add thigs in that I like the idea of (MKS, Tac LS, ScanSat...), so it may well be that I can have a perfectly enjoyable game with a modded KSP, just thought I;d let you know my first impressions of KSP unmodded though. :-} As I haven\u0027t been able to get beyond level 1 in the Career game, I\u0027m now going to start a science-only game :-}\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stevealive","CreatedById":132471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T20:52:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been looking at the experience abilities of levels of Kerbals, they look pretty good so far.

I wanted to make myself \u0022Ace Ciprioni\u0022 as a pilot but it seems no matter what kerbal I rename, even if hes already a pilot it makes my character into a Engineer, so then I try my wives name \u0022Kiari Ciprioni\u0022 and it makes her a pilot? how does this work? does anyone have any knowledge at all about job picking and where I alter this or force skills on kerbals. It really bugs me as I am a pilot IRL and my wife is in the pilots seat lmao.

I am a big fan of creating my friends into my game so I tend to edit the Persistent file and rename kerbals. now in the event of me doing so it seems it changes their skills based off the names.

There is no new value in the persistence file for skills so I guess they just used their names. Not a big deal until want to add your own custom kerbals. If this is true then I don\u0027t think there will be a stock fix.
