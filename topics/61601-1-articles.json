Admins are welcome to manage their own server listing. It only lists servers that are currently up. Feel free to register and list your servers today. Your pwds are hashed for security, but as with all things, dont give us a pwd that you don\u0027t want lost. If you run into issues, please contact godarklight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is Kerbal Central?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are just getting started as a fan-based community, and as such have not formally introduced ourselves to General Discussion and elsewhere. Before KerbalCentral.com officially launches we have a lot of work to do. Our three top priorities are to get a stable KMP server list published, an alternative to Spaceport (possibly spaceport.kerbalcentral.com), and a forum to manage Kerbal Central discussion. We could use volunteers who are familiar with php, css, html, and managing a Wordpress engine, forums, etc, as this project exists for the fans of KSP and is totally managed by them. If you are a fan of KSP, this is \u003Cem\u003Eyour\u003C/em\u003E community. We\u0027d love your input in this thread as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Central is offering subdomains to 24/7 KMP and community admins:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your server is 24/7, or you run a Kerbal website, you are welcome to request a kerbalcentral.com subdomain CNAME redirect:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyourname.kerbalcentral.com \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStatic server admins simply post below your static ip or dns with your desired subdomain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny dynamic server admin that wants a KerbalCentral.com subdomain redirect, simply sign up at noip.com and then install, configure, and run ddclient from a linux vmware box to update your noip DNS automatically. Post below your noip dns and if appropriate, I\u0027ll create a subdomain.kerbalcentral.com for you (you choose) as a CNAME record, and bam, you\u0027ve got a nice kerbalized DNS for your dynamic KMP server such as yourservernamehere.kerbalcentral.com and you will help promote the community. I am not sure how long I\u0027ll be able to offer management of such, so request your subdomain today to reserve it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome applications may be rejected if they are inappropriate, or are reserved by Kerbal Central.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Central is a project offered for free to the community.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-30T16:35:51Z\u0022 title=\u002201/30/2014 04:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by inigma\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-30T16:49:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs it actually official, i.e. has been approved of by KMP devs?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"inigma","CreatedById":69310,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-30T17:19:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KvickFlygarn87\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KvickFlygarn87\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs it actually official, i.e. has been approved of by KMP devs?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts developed and run by godarklight, a KMP dev, yes.
