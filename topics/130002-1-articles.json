The trick is to hide docking ports inside the parts you want to attach. Put one port on each face/end/surface you wish to connect, and use the offset tool to slide one of them back into the part it is attached to. The two smaller sized docking ports work best for this. Now the tricky part is to position the docking ports so that they just barely touch each, so that as soon as the craft spawns they dock. To do this you have to zoom way into the part with the port offset inside it, so you\u0027re actually looking beneath the rendered skin of said part. It might be helpful to offset the entire craft off the vertical axis of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, since the game will only zoom in so close to said axis. Then select the offset tool, and select the port you tucked inside the part/ This can be very tricking, usually takes me a few attempts. Once you have it selected, offset it to be in the proper position right up against the other port. The ports should NOT overlap or have a perceptible distance between them. On the outside of the craft, it should just look like the parts the ports are connecting are just attached to each other, as the ports are tucked inside one of them. If I were currently at my own computer, I\u0027d provide you with picture demos. When you have all the ports set up, you should send it to the launch pad, zoom in on the part with the docking ports hidden inside it, and see if the ports are docking as desired. The newish \u0022aim camera\u0022 option when you right click on a part in game play makes this easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhenever i\u0027m designing a craft, I always have the \u0022part clipping\u0022 \u0022cheat\u0022 turned on. I\u0027m not sure if that is required to make this trick work. Also in some craft designs, like ring shaped space stations where some larger components overlap, the \u0022unbreakable joints\u0022 cheat seems to be required if the final craft using this trick is sitting in a gravity well (i.e. on the launch pad). I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s because the ports are tucked inside of larger components, or because the method I use to construct ring stations involves overlapping larger components (like fuel tanks and hitchhikers). when sitting in the free fall of space, no cheats are needed to hold these stations together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, if you haven\u0027t already you should go into the game settings and enable \u0022Advanced Tweakables\u0022, so you have access to the \u0022rigid connection\u0022 and \u0022autostruct\u0022 features. You want the hidden docking ports to be rigidly connected to their mother parts, and this trick seems to work better when the ports are also autostructed. I used to autostruct them to different parts, one to the root part (usually a cockpit module or medium sized fuel tank) and the other docking port to the heaviest part; but I\u0027m not sure that made a difference. And it might have contributed to the deadly \u0022ground vehicle shimmy of death\u0022 or summoning the Kraken in the case of my space stations. More experimentation is needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve tested the strategy extensively, including in a huge mobile ground base on Eve, and it seems to work beautifully. In fact in a few destructive tests when i\u0027ve deliberately crashed my creations, often the two parts the ports are connecting will remain connected even after breaking off their own parent parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope this finds you well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tyko","CreatedById":164179,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-19T20:43:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoesn\u0027t this mod enable multiple connections?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed6841674994\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/157131-13x-14x-recoupler-monocouple-your-bicouplers/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:228px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
