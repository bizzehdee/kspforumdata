It\u0027s been a long time since I posted in the forums.\n\nLook at the picture I\u0027m gonna show you\n\nWhat\u0027s wrong here: The walls of the VAB and the parts background got corrupted.\n\nMods installed when this happened: \n\n- 000\\_Toolbar\n- CivilianManagement\n- CollisionFX\n- CommunityResourcePack\n- CrossFeedEnabler\n- CTNlanderpack\n- Firespitter\n- Hydrogen NTRs\n- ImpossibleInnovations\n- LazTek\n- MechJeb2\n- NearFutureConstruction\n- NearFutureElectrical\n- NearFuturePropulsion\n- NearFutureSolar\n- OpenResourceSystem\n- PlanetShine\n- TechManager\n- TextureReplacer\n- TweakScale\n- UmbraSpaceIndustries\n- Module Manager\n\nThat\u0027s all, coz, unfortunately, when it crashed, it didn\u0027t give out a crash report, so yeah. My temp solution was remove the mods. Can I fix this with my mods still installed? Thanks for reading...\n\n- ![Screenshot_53.png](http://s3.postimg.org/yz9h5tcdv/Screenshot_53.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-20T08:37:03Z\u0022 title=\u002204/20/2015 08:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RocketScientist00**\n  \nI forgot to put the Workaround Found tag..."},{"CreatedByName":"NasaSpace101","CreatedById":140410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T13:32:47Z","Content":"This is strange.. Did you try to reproduce the event? If it happens again, slowly remove mods and add them back. I know that firespitter is not updated for 0.90 so maybe that\u0027s it? I\u0027ve had can issues before, but not this bad."}]}
