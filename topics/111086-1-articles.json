Sunk legs have a decent chance of being stuck to the ground, giving you some tilt when you lift off.\n\nPutting on enough legs so the sinking won\u0027t happen means one heavy-duty leg for every 6-8t of *weight* (mind the local gravity). Properly holding up a lander on Eve or Tylo requires an insane number of legs. The stickyness usually isn\u0027t a problem, the sunk appearance merely cosmetic, so most people don\u0027t use \u0022enough\u0022 legs and accept that they may sink in: you can get away with something like one leg per 15t or more until they break.\n\nFor the newbies among us: \u0022breaking\u0022 doesn\u0027t mean that they fall off. It only means that their suspension becomes stuck in an mostly-extended state. As a landing gear, they still work as well (or badly) as any rigid structural piece.\n\nIf you don\u0027t mind the looks, airplane landing gear outperforms legs in every way: holds up near infinite weight, doesn\u0027t break, and doesn\u0027t stick to the ground.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-29T18:19:07Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2015 06:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Laie**"},{"CreatedByName":"CaribouGone","CreatedById":138623,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T17:13:02Z","Content":"the micro-landing struts have always had this problem, as far as i know.\n\nthe other legs seem to work well enough for me, though."}]}
