I\u0027m playing the Career-Mode in RSS (no RealismOverhaul). I want to land on Mercury, but everywhere I land there are mountains and hills and I cant land with my ship! Every time I topple down and thats why I can\u0027t fly home after landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you know/Can you give me good coordinates to land? With no gradient and hills etc.? I tried 10 times to land but every landing failed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI watches videos on youtube and there is everywhere a flat area if they land. I think I have an another version of RSS and in real life there aren\u0027t very much flat areas on mercury.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you very very much for helping!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGreetings, Daniel\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dogenutt","CreatedById":151770,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-29T18:21:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d recommend using SCANsat for mapping out good landing sites, If you don\u0027t have it installed already. It\u0027s a mod that allows you to map out the surfaces of the planets.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
