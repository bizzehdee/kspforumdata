I had a plane design that could pass Mach 1 on dry thrust, but upon adding struts it took a huge hit in performance. The craft files are below for reference. I tried changing the strut placement so that they weren\u0026#39;t inside the hollow fuselage, but it made no difference. Is there any way of adding struts without inducing crippling drag? Is there a (stock) alternative to using struts for reinforcement? Any help very much appreciated.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nCraft files for proof:-\u003Cbr\u003E\n[url]http://pastebin.com/hzQhYVYD[/url][B] (Struts)[/B]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[url]http://pastebin.com/NPr0KnLz[/url] [B](No struts)[/B]\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-25T17:22:22Z\u0022 title=\u002211/25/2015 05:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Laughing Man\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aethon","CreatedById":110755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T20:38:54Z","Content":"\nYes struts create drag now.
