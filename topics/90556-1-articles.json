I just grabbed Remote Tech 2 recently, and is designing my first set of satellites to be used as relays.

The thing though, it only looks good with the Communotron 88-88. With the DTS, if I want to keep the form factor when retracted relatively the same, I have to put it on the side, making it looks unsymmetrical (and for some reasons, it ticks me the wrong way).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.minus.com/i15AnLkJmLyHW.png\u0022 alt=\u0022i15AnLkJmLyHW.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I wonder if I could still use the Comm88, or I can just ditch the dish antenna altogether, since I got a set of specialized comsats with loads of dishes planned after launching these relays.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-18T03:09:37Z\u0022 title=\u002211/18/2014 03:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by RainDreamer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TechnicalK3rbal","CreatedById":86903,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-17T18:00:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERemoteTech doesn\u0027t have many set-in-stone rules for satellites, it all depends on their use. Generally the best way to do it is to set up three geo(keo?) stationary satellites, one right over the space center, to transmit the signal to other satellites. You can either use the long-range Omni for this or set the directional dishes to target the entire planet, and it will transmit to everything within it\u0027s (arc? range? angle?

The long-range dish will connect to the active vessel while the omni\u0027s relay it to the KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest problem is knowing how many batteries you need for your sats so they don\u0027t run out of power when they\u0027re on the dark side of a planet.

That is a range of 3000km so as long as you drop enough of them to act as relays (If you sync them up right you can do full coverage with 3-6 of them) they will provide all the control needs you need for local area around Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOften the reason to include a directional is to set it to \u0022Active Vessel\u0022 so that they always point to whatever ship you are actively flying. The usefulness of this depends on the goal \u0026amp; the antenna stats.

You can point the ones in Kerbin Orbit targeted to \u0022Mun\u0022 and the cone will cover the entire orbit so any ship with a DTS with the target \u0022Kerbin\u0022 can form a link. The SS-5 can do the same thing from Minimus, where the DTS doesn\u0027t quite have the range. However using the SS-5 in Mun orbit results in a cone too narrow to cover Kerbin\u0027s Geosync orbit so you might loose connection if the sats pointing at the Mun leave the cone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the 88-88 you MUST point it directly at something because the cone is too narrow, it is designed for interplanetary after all. Using it on your sats with the target of \u0022Active Vessel\u0022 will let them point at whatever you are flying, but on the ship you are flying you would have to manually choose the target you want to point it at rather than just pointing it at the planet and letting the remotetech auto pathing forge links.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can intermix the antenna though so if you do use the 88-88 on your dump sats your active vessel could mount something with a larger cone \u0026amp; still get a connection... at least until the range is enough to prevent a two way link.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso the SS-5 is nice for remote launches since it can be deployed \u0026amp; linked before launch and doesn\u0027t sheer off during flight. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
