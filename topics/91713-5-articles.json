The LLL Parts made perfect sized rectangular pods, and the thin CBM square docking ports could attach either via node or flat to any surface that would allow a general non-node attach area. Fortunately the Eagle truss had that type of colliding surface in those spots that I needed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I was able to make pods that fit perfectly in-between the two docking nodes. The Eagle could even drop a pod, and then move off, come back and pick it back up again. As long as one of the docking ports \u0022Locked\u0022 on, the other would as well. (I improved the ability to strengthen the links and align the pods with Quantum struts, but it was possible to do it without them) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Image: Eagle with LLL parts making a passenger pod fitted under the truss.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3YUxmj9.png\u0022 alt=\u00223YUxmj9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a closer look at what I\u0027m talking about - the CBM Docking port is fitted to the Eagle truss, then a matching CBM on the pod mates with it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DYZYnvb.png\u0022 alt=\u0022DYZYnvb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IoGZdH0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022IoGZdH0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what\u0027s the point of the above example? Well think about it - instead of a single truss going over the top - what you want is to make a single fuselage part that has forward and aft sections that mate smoothly to the other fuselage mod parts, but has a \u0022cut-out\u0022 in the middle between the outboard \u0022bulges\u0022 and a cargo pod that will fit in that space smoothly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can only do this crudely, but take the example below - imagine that the hollow \u0022RCS\u0022 hull parts at the fore and aft end and the girders make up a single part. Also imagine that the sections of hull below do NOT have the bulges on them so that the central part fits into the cut-out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/quDOhDZ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022quDOhDZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qqxl3by.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qqxl3by.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow - what else would you need to make this work? I suspect that it\u0027s not possible to have docking ports integral to the \u0022cut-out\u0022 piece. So you\u0027d need to make docking pieces that fit on the ends of the cargo pod and on the matching surfaces on the inward facing parts of the cut-out section. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd to make it fit smoothly into the cutout, both the cargo pod and the hull cut-out sections will have to be recessed far enough to fit the needed docking ports AND allow the sections outwardly to fit together with minimal seams. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther - how would you make a cargo section that has a door AND space for a docking port? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell - Thankfully - your parts are large enough to accommodate both. Plus - you\u0027ve already got a good visual texture that might serve as the starting point for a docking port already. Check out the image below. Ignore the RCS fuel pods and imagine this plus the wall of the pod attached to it as one end of the proposed \u0022cut-out\u0022 section. Note the door with the windows on either side near the top? Well imagine that as the node location for a docking port. (which could look quite similar to that door/window section) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lUsf1As.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lUsf1As.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, turn your mental viewpoint around 180 degrees and imagine you\u0027re looking at the matching end of the cargo pod (sans the bulges). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ve got that docking port area up top - plus enough room below that section for a fairly wide aperture - whether that winds up being a simple open \u0022walk through\u0022 area, or an actual drop down ramp/door (like what you\u0027ve done with the ramp/tail of the plane) is up to you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re going to make telescoping legs, then docking/redocking a cargo pod is possible. As I mentioned above with the example of the Eagle - if the fit is close enough, then if one docking port connects and locks on, so will the other. Trust me, it works! I\u0027ve done it many times! And with a TB2 style arrangement, it might be even easier!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIIRC, TB2\u0027s cargo pods had rollers or wheels on the bottom of them. I think they were mainly so that TB2 could taxi. But if you allowed for some small rover wheels to fit along the bottom of the cargo pods, then it would likely make lining them up for re-docking much easier. Which brings me to my last observation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the Eagle pods, they needed to have their own internal power supply in the form of an RTG or solar panels, a battery, and a probe control body. That way they became their own \u0022craft\u0022 when separated and not register as \u0022debris\u0022. If something is debris, it can\u0027t be docked to again (unless you hook to it with KAS or something like it so that it becomes powered and part of the main ship again. The cargo pods could be written to have those qualities like a probe or command pod inherent to them in the part instead of it being necessary to attach other parts as I did with the Eagle pods. If they had rollers/wheels on the bottom (possibly created as extremely low profile landing gear?) then the cargo pod itself could act as a limited rover. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope these ideas and observations help!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nertea","CreatedById":83952,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-05T19:10:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Logan.Darklighter\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Logan.Darklighter\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETons of stuff\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELots of info there!

It wouldn\u0027t need to be very pointy, just enough to add some visual style instead of being just a straight line, that\u0027s all.
