Unfortunately I run out of Hydrogen even before I get to the intended destinations.  This leads me to believe the two mentioned tools are not programmed to handle Hydrogen fuel  -or-  my approach is flawed.   I\u0027ve scanned thru all 25 pages on this topic and find very little information on this.\n\nAny assistance would be appreciated.  I really want to use Hydrogen fuel as it is lighter and mass is everything in this wonderful game.
