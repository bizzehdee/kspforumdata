Sadly, after i started equipping every single new AKS vessel with manual targeting systems it allows me to be accurate enough to target specific sections (not quite a particular weakspot but i can choose the general area the shot lands), and the whole get up to point blank range to hit reliably is nolonger even needed when every one of my ships can just use IVA to aim at enemy ship with near 100% guaranteed accuracy at 500m or farther even (MK1 inline is the next best thing for targeting with its crosshairs, well you dont aim directly at corsshairs but there is still a spot u can aim at to get hits reliably, or add antenas on teh front to make it even easier to hit stuff).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other issue i have against reaction guns, mass drivers, whatever u call them is the part count. The ONLY make sense with extremely high ammo capacities, since it is alot of parts/mass for the gun assembly (most decent ones use mutliple stacked engines instead of one large one), only does the part count drop below that of conventional weapons once you start having in excess of 20 shots for the weapon, and in general ive still found your classic long ibeam\u002B2 seps to be plenty adequate against almost any vessel that had armor wea enough for a cannon to actually kill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIve yet to see the weapons get powerful and reliably enough to take down anything that is well built and has a armored core without insane luck (ive split a drek 12P one time and one time ONLY with a pocket ibeam, never managed to recreate it but it happened). They are great at phasing thru and crippling ships, but all my designs (and all ones ive downloaded and tried) just fail at dealing with heavy armor. Perhaps if the projectiles were XL-3 tires, but thatd be one bloody large weapon to fire those at anything but low velocity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically they offer very little incentive to use, are more complex, tend to be easy to disable with a well aimed shot, and most of all they kill your dV in general. My recent corvette design has around 2.5K dV fully armed, and 3.5K dV with all weapons removed, and the cannon armed version has very similar dV fully armed, but gets less then 3K dV with ammo and cannon fuel used up. That is a very big difference, and while i know in the style of combat we have here, this doesnt matter at all since once out of ammo who cares, but in more realistioc games, real time, ect, these things make a difference. that and the cannon armed version i use has ~20 shots total of ammo, whereas the conventional one has 30 bloody shots, some of which are actually more powerful then the cannon on the other version. The only improvement on the cannon one is part count, but since it doesnt have drone missiles (S drones have 4 parts, 8 carried, M drones have 7, 8 carried, ibeams have 4, 8 carried, and RT-5s have 3, 2 carried), its less parts, but is in general less effective, easier to destroy due to extremely vulnurable cannon shooting system and ammo feed, and well, its just a for fun ship, with little use unless ur killing fighters, carriers, or stuff with low to no armor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethat said, they are very nice to have on carrier hybrid warships, as i can actually propell a fighter for very little fuel useage and cut down the dV the fighter itself needs to use up allowing for shorter ranged fighters to get farther out then you would normally expect. Ive even managed to slow down an incoming fighter with such a cannon, its tough to aim and took some save scumming, but i did manage to actually stop a incoming fighter at ~80m/s with a quick tap of the trigger for the cannon. It has nice utility useage, but as a weapon is not exactly ideal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso Spartwo, i hope you dont mind me stealing your weapons to use on my fighters. That multi-shot thingy u have on some of your smaller ships is kinda cool, its short, stubby, easy to stack, and small profile, and most of all actually kills anything with garbage armor. Until i develop my own super small weapons, i hope u dont mind seeing AKS utilizing some of your tech.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOhh, and a bit of a unrelated topic, i found a great use for crewed pods in armor protection.
