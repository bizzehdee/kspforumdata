You need to vary the impact velocity for maximum effect based on enemy hull design/thickness. When firing at dreks or other very heavily armored and thick hulled ships, you basically fire from 2km and blast full power to get as much V as you can. When firing at thinner vessels (such as my SK-CRV-III series), ive actually found that you want to come in at a velocity that is LOWER then maximum attainable, such as 200m/s or something similar. Against very small targets, i rarely exceed 150m/s as if you go faster there is a good chance that you will phase through the entire vessel and not even interact with it, not to mention lower speeds are better vs weaker armor (those intakes arent exactly high imnpact tolerance).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile im not questioning your armor (as i dont have the vessel to actually test out) or your ability to use my weaponry, the Tripedo-S is a very finicky weapon since it is lightweight and short. It was designed to be a precision weapon that has a very specific way to engage each individual target. Heavier weapons such as most 1.3m torps used by the best players here, and my Tripedo-M you basically gun it at full speed at target and hope for the best since the combo of mass and longer length make it way less susceptible to the speed you ram into with. The Tripedo-S is from experience the toughest missile i have to use properly, it is not just a point at middle and hit there, you need to know how to engage each target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for deploying Ms on fighters, the HK-103 (you have seen this multiple times before) is perfectly capable of arming up to 10t of ordinance before it becomes so painful to use its not worth it. The Tripedo-M is what, ~5t, so i can at least in theory mount 2 of them on a HK-103, although the tonage will go to around 15t then. That, and i do actually have other craft availeable that are basically all capable of mounting at least 2 Ms standard (although i dont enjoy using super powerful weapons all that much so they are currently equipped with 4 Tripedo-S or RT-5 based weapons). Almost all my mainstream fighters can bring Tripedo-Ms into battle, and my capitals are also all capable of bringing Ms in the side bays, i just elect not to as i like to give the enemy a chance and not turn every game into a guaranteed every turn something gets 1 shotted problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, im reather interested to see how that thing is made, so unless its something you would rather keep classified, a link woukld be cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Three1415\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Three1415\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs long as one does not bring them within render distance of each other (and I see no reason to), part count is completely irrelevant to combat performance; a similar-mass ship with a lower part count but inferior performance is simply a waste, in my opinion. \u003Cp\u003EThe chaingun is 1.8 tons with six rounds and fits into less than 1.3 cubic meters of space; I fail to see how that is more efficient than six I-Beams (not to mention the fact that it is vastly more effective due to higher damage output and accuracy).

I for one like to have multiple ships within render range and ive actually started using mods such as burn together and BDArmory to have say 4 vs 4 combat. Ofc if uou only do 1 vs 1, the parts arent as big of a deal, but i often like to have way more then 2 ships loaded at once, and for this playstyle (or if you play DMP where even 200 parts can cause lag let alone 500\u002B), part count makes a MAJOR ISSUE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell its larger for a fighter (i was thinking of mounting a rapid fire weapon on fighters, but i doubt thisll work for a fighter), and it doesnt appear to be reloadeable which is something i like to have on my ships.

Its just a weapon i never bothered with cause in turn based there is no counters to it, and it is very effective especially against certain ships. just like the Tripedo-H which was actually completely developed btw and is fully combat capable (my new SK-FRG-III which is in the works is designed to carry 4 of them even if i wont depoy them unless its some super competitive game where odds are every ship will 1 shot every other ship anyways). Still, its a weapon that i jst wont use as its no fun, takes no real skill (just aim at midsection and gun velocity to maximum), and is again, virtually impossible to not cripple a ship with regardless of its armor levels or quality. You know that it can pretty much 1 shot nullify your dreadnought, and it wasnt even designed for that, when it comes to dreks, they just go away with it. It used to be named the DrekBuster, but since it ended up looking liek a upscaled Tripedo, i named it Tripedo-H. Btw, while i cant find it myself, a long time ago i posted something called the Hexpedo-M, which is what this weapons evolved from, the Hexpedo was such overkill though, over 15t, powered by skipper, and so bloody overkill against every single target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso did some more testing ve your ships, and they are quite good, although a single solid hit to the rear of the bomber will take down all its fuel around 75% of the time.

Ill say (once i caught on what the optimal speed and spot to hit was), i could wipe out its fuel supplies pretty regularly, but not exactly reliably.

The few times it was destroyed, it just split in half down the middle (im guessing it got lucky and phased into the center girder joing destroying it, this is a common issue with most ships, if any half decent intact warhead hits the core girder its cut in half, nothing at all you can do about it (but luckily for your design its very hard to actually do this even if you aim at it unless the weapon is a Tripedo-M which is as good as the most popular drek killing weapons such as teh popper-H.
