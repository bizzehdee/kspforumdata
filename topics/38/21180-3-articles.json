Charley felt disliked because his spacesuit was pink and he wants blue so he went to the ocean which burst into tears because it was blown up by smoking cow that were falling from harley\u0027s weed Protection service company owned and operated by a cantelope which was from a far away sun called Bol that was beginning to explode soon, but luckily, some ten thousand ballistic missles and shot At Planet X making it crash into the Bol-Star Causing the universe to collapse into a black hole where it started to fly out from the exploding Solar System Bol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next day a rotten taco decided to leap into a portal to 1969 so it could see Carl Sagan reenacting the moon landings because they involved rockets. Kerbin\u0027s doomsday began when Jeb danced the jig of the saw puzzle with Jigsaw, a puzzle made up with Jigsaw pieces mass produced in Jigsaw, a city on Joolipter, which didn\u0027t look like a puzzle piece from the game Shoot The CAT!!!! After a puzzling day on Laythe a dinosaur named T. Ryan Sorous ate Bill Kerman while he was eating but vomited all over his new car, making soup. Cleaning it, he got Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis from mining titanium on Bop. After several days of Living on faith, a car salesman crashes into a rocket which was from Korlkinnikon. The name is foreign to everyone alive today because it is A K-name made up in the land called Kerbalkistan located behind Those atmospheric ghosts who hate Cheetos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheese is dairy but tastes like the Jeb\u0027s spacefood that was used to wash socks. Does it taste Like Cinnamon Toast or rotten vegtables? We may never taste something as a roasted kerbal, but maybe we can taste like a roasted human. Where is Bill? Somewhere over the event horizon of the black rainbow, of course. How he got there is a question that only Tony probe can answer. He knows everything about the first generation quantum mechanics used by kerbals to make a ton of dynamite to blow up but for fishes, the dynamite seemed to be tragic despite the lack of kerbal oxygen in the atmosphere. The 69 kilometers that separated Bob from the disturbing eagle-eyed Jebediah who wants to blow everything up and then travel to Eeloo, and built a snowman. After the snowman was created, it melted due to It\u0027s incredible evilness and Jeb found a large booster To be quite awsome, and so he began replacing flying cat mines with orbiting dogs to confuse pirates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn another note, all submarine sandwiches are now cheeeeeezburgahs because of Bill made a button for his coat. Laika the dog profited from Carl and he ate no more than three ounces of New Year\u0027s fireworks Which weren\u0027t cold despite it being very explosive for two years until someone named Kraken ate them so now, they lack the explosive punch and were forgotten. Meanwhile on Laythe, the Kraken exploded and got flung by my ship into the depths of space and proceeded to protest the rights and citizenship of all cows who looked Like Barney. Moonkun Munchkin was a bagel that liked to be eaten by an elephant that wished it can swim in eleven herbs that tasted like Big, juicy, and tasty bananas. That morning, uncooked onions and buckets of KFC, seasoned with the 11 secret herbs And 12 spices. It\u0027s finger licking time! Said Kerby. The chicken attracted all the gals living on Ganymede while kissing some Carl Sagan dolls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGanymede doesn\u0027t exist in the mind and reality of Kerballand. They think Ganymede, a Timbits biscuit in space, is a fictional space rabbit that can land on The unmagical boulder. Twenty light-years away, Jebediah had just EVA to the surface of a piece of debris in Kerpollo One that had seemed to explode on contact. He thought it was a good thing, but the debris then crashed into a Semi-conductive electric probe, it was fully electrified, so thunderbolts and lighting came raining down on Charley the Unicron who ate three kilos of what he called \u0022Kerbalinator,\u0022 which causes Rocket fuel to spontaneously fire out of Bob\u0027s toilet which caused mass from mr Charlie\u0027s and went into a coma, which a cardiac arrest Murdered cave dude and called 911. All the while, Bill was reading PSY, the creator of the delicious Goongam style, a Russian delicacy best for dancing Korean who needs more celery for his delicious, spicy Kimchi which he sold to Jeb as space food for Loren ipsum, a dolor sit amet \u0022Air Crash Investigation,\u0022 program. Charley\u0027s stomach exploded, causing banking problems in banks all around Jupiter, by 60000000000 degrees of toxic pudding. A flying pudding smacked me in the 23rd vertebrae Said Charley. He grinned deviously, \u0022I Can\u0027t believe you would eat chicken without offering me one overcooked fried potato chip tasting like yummy garbage!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen Adam Kandler, Kerbool Deeds\u0027 brother, Decided to murderize Charlie because he pooped on Jeb\u0027s Parachute, ruining it, he drank lumpy Juice And Kerby Went to Duna. Kerby then proceeded to dance on the broken parachute at 90 mph which he had smash into the taco of time. The taco can imagined as a dictator over the school of jell-o located on Bop, Which, coincidentally, was the dentistry headquarters of all dental gorillas of the Dentist variety, thus were accidentally wealthy. Maaren Kerman, Dentist of all gorillas, was accidentally assigned to brush the giant evil cow. Meanwhile, the presidential election was over, angering all indentured old denists, who served their masters by brushing underneath their gums using Oral-K brushinator which is made in Italy, along with dental floss. The Great Pillow was traveling across the Pilou, a 45mm screw driver usually drills dental replacement holes. Midway past the future, but it hurts, way too much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, on Laythe, he took off like a scary Jebediah riding a Dental dentistry rocket. The rocket horrified a P-51 D Mustang pilot, because he had arm amnesia, a very strong alcoholic beverage, ice cold. Jeb likes arm made of plastic. But Bill hates Bill Gates, the president of Kerbal Dentistry Overclocked Computers (or KDOC for troubled readers or short, which uses objects for stuff). Jebediah couldn\u0027t figure out the calamities in the cars of slugs and walruses that explode, causing their tusks to melt into flavorful pineapple juices. The juices cause gastroenteritis, which is a disease only caught by orange potatoes grown in Japan, which is frequently hit by the mighty rocket powered cannon, which is in Area of a circle, is 51 cm2, which is large compared to a mushroom growing on a pineapple. The Same pinapple that the walrus ate which caued BOB to implode on Neptune, while eating spaghetti. Jebediah\u0027s mother was very fat, and everyone insulted her. Her name was Kerbalia and she can fly rockets too bad so Jeb taught her to ride horses while eating a roasted pink crobar topped with juicy plutonium that might decay into a 1 eyed dinosaur saying J/Yodelleehoo scary cabbage will all explode until it bows down before a giant waffle in the palace of purple puke.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen Joobidaeiah, who is an imposter of Jebediah, the spaceman of dreams, attempted to go over the rainbow to get to Kerbaltopia, a paradise on an island shaped like the nose of a at ugly bat that is not green as some preliminary reports suggest. Secondary reports however report the bat is actually purplish for being scary when it is doing things like afirin\u0027 its lazoars at defenseless zebras near the mystic shrine of the Holy Koala Institute. After the tiny space probe crashed liquid which tasted of stale melons, the melons revolted and killed bob and billidiah, a shorter clone of Jebediah, that was trained in the caverns beneath the secret caves of Jeb\u0027s front lawn. Jeb went out to feed his pet rock named Rocky the Great, king of the Mun Pies, then Rocky\u0027s rival, who just so happened to be Bill\u0027s evil object thing, which can devour approximately 47 cubic-meters of Pandas. Meanwhile, Bob\u0027s old friend, Billybobidiah, a monster made in China, but sold in Cuba, attacked Canada\u0027s Socialist ways and converted it into a nuclear stockpile that will be used to explode an unused spork. If the spork Becomes a planet, the society of icy glampernoodles will melt all of this forum which will sadden me because we need all the things that are spicy because they are disliked by many Asians that eat all of the spicy buffalo wings that give you bronchitis if eaten raw or cooked. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, somewhere in Spork \u0022launch\u0022 foods, some angry vegetarians ate meat because \u0027twas dyed green, With red gas from Jupiter, the king of all giant waffles and maple syrup from Joolpinearteer, a fake gas giant orbiting exactly 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 ,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,0 00,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 miles away from your home planet of Kirth, another fake planet made up of completely no nuts and gluten, really, no joke. Kirth was set to become king of the pirates, ultimately to destroy And Jebediah said,\u0022I like big slices of pizza, which are stinky and somehow glowing when dipped into green slime sauce manufactued by fish\u0022, which was completely pointless and unnecessary but yet they are communism supporters, albeit green ones. To remedy this gross problem, Scott developed a cannon to shoot all opponents into the mesosphere, a sphere nobody quite understands yet mentions allot because it is said to contain dead kerbal\u0027s ghosts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, on the Kerbal Space Center had begun rising due to acute back pains, causing more kerbals to demand a cure for back pains, but it tastes like grasshoppers with spicy ice cream made for people with back pains who live in Kentucky and explode. Then the thing that created democracy turned to anarchy from back pains, causing many people to horribly explode if they went kaboom too much while playing Kerbal driving simulator. When this game was for back pains, everyone hated it, except in Japan where they thought It was groovy because it heals OOOOOOHHHHHHH NOOOOOOO disorder hence causing the kaboom. A ludicrous Japanese scientist programmed a ninja robot that will assassinate Bob\u0027s box of president-shaped chocolates for back pains that were caused by back pains in German-Chinese. An atroscious apple that caused back pains that were South of the amazing all natural back of pain which cause back the back pain to hibernate until a presidential mousepad was impeached and once again everyone was forced to vote for republican democrats who believed that both Romney and Obama could Start another war against the USSR, And the moon, and Jool\u0027s moons, which would disrupt the back pains of Carl Sagan\u0027s old telescope.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, The super back of back pains will devour George he devourer, then A Miss-ile will devour a back massager when Stalin Eats this message. Then, with a hiccup, He burped it out and sal_vager felt ashamed. Then, all moderators became evil so Gandalf the White defended the dumb stoopied mawderatiers frum the wrath of the smarter ones that are developing indie video games that might become back pain worthy if they are capable of selling back pain cream. Meanwhile, several lamps bought several art In the new city of LegoLand. Disney Land, however, was strangely empty because everyone filed into the strange filing cabinet of not a trap-ness that might contain a giant man-eating corrupt file, which is on fire. Backety back pains that watch the small children playing a game called Minecraft which is Kerbal space program. This game was made of burritos that tasted like and white, fleshy meat pies which contain no meat but front pains caused several people to turn up the music so back pains can find their way to the temple Of the Knights at night while Lightning Mcqueen drives wayyyyyyy too fast, even faster than a sadistic orangutang from cancer pains that hurt more than bad viola players that recycle bent pineapples with an apple pie that hates you because screen cleaners are mutually biased towards glasses but the Hulk wears contacts, so liquid strawberries can explodify and make oreo cookies that support various fundraisers. While Irish soldiers are fighting sharklike olives That are going to attempt to create \u0022Olive and Petroleum Kingdom\u0022, Bill figured out how to copy-paste his thoughts on the awe-inspiring story that is about ULTIMATE BBBBBAAAACCCKKKKK PAAAAIIINNNSSS...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-19T22:48:40Z\u0022 title=\u002204/19/2013 10:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by (An Original Name)\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TooManyErrors","CreatedById":57113,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T23:02:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShould we continue from the salvaged version?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chobit-389","CreatedById":40105,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T23:08:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERelieve tense muscles\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mars90000000","CreatedById":27349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T23:37:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eto paddle his\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(No, I think we can keep Have a new fresh story.
