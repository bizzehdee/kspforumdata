The plains were sadly empty because previous pioneers had stripped them bare of any life without a second thought. Beans made do with a special Fungi that absorbed nutrients out of the air and consumed waste. Beans would take a portion from it each day and was very good at crafting it into something that tasted good and looked like something that had once existed on the plains. Beans was very proud of his ability to make tasty dishes. Unfortunately there was a passenger on the wagon train who hated seeing pride in anyone and seethed silently when seeing Beans. He came up with a plan to kill Beans. One night after dinner, when they were camped near a ravine, Beans had gone for his nightly walk to see what was around and gaze up at the Mun. Little did he know, that he was being followed. He was standing on the edge of the ravine looking down and did not realise someone was rushing up from behind. Just as the attacker was almost on him he hit his toe and bent over in pain. The attacker wasn\u0027t expecting this and couldn\u0027t stop in time. With nothing to stop him he ran straight off the edge and went screaming down in to the ravine. Beans jerked up in surprise at the sound, wondering what had happened. The next morning when a head count was done and the ravine checked, they found the body of Hubris Kerman. Not knowing what Hubris had planned they named spot \u0022Hubris Fall\u0022 That is why to this day we have the expression: \u0022Hubris (or in the modern parlance: Pride) comes before the fall.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCuster Kerman - His last stand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Abel Military Services","CreatedById":219257,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-09-28T09:55:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCuster Kerman was a fighter and have a SMG that shoots 1300 rounds per minute(about the firing rate of Glock 18).

Very scared. Contact with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E was made. So they immedately told him that he had 340 hours, 36 minutes and 21 seconds until he merged with Kerbol. He panicked again, but Kerbin immediately sent a mission to save him, with a craft they made in the time he was unconscious. But in just 13 days they lost contact (quite some time before his body became fossil fuel for the Sun) So they turned the mission into a Moho fly-by mission that was succesful and gave new studies, including 5.8 science points.
