There was not much to do after acquiring the stream of data the satellites beamed back. Harry found one way to kill his boredom, which is to use the satellite dishes to view the night sky, yet there was little to view. The orderless noise kept repeating on the liquid display screen, extending infinitely in both ways, like grains of time lined up in a one dimensional desert, without pattern. Harry knew that it has continued long before his birth, and will continue long after his death, devoid of all life. Kerbin might as well be a small island of life on this desolate plain. But this time it was different. When Harry came into the control room, he at once noticed that the displayed line in the liquid display screen differed from usual. The line rose and fell steadily, like waves on a sea. It did not repeat, but carried a subtle pattern with it. Excited, Harry read the information level. A 9.97! The Deep Space Network has never before detected anything that was rated higher than 6.4. A rating of 9 meant that the message had a 95% chance of containing intelligible information. A rating above 9.95 meant that the software system in the Deep Space Network Control knew how to decipher it. Instantly, Harry fed the data into the software system, which attempted to read all signals rated 7.75 or above. Instantly, Kerbalkind got the first message that came from another world. It stated about the civilisation losing their homeworld in a galactic war, and was forced to become refugees amongst the stars. Harry pondered. Based on the current technological level of this civilisation, if they decided to turn against the Kerbals, the Kerbals will stand no chance, and given the current state of this civilisation, such an event is highly likely. However, the Kerbals have longed for company in this lonely universe, and there it is. Why don\u0027t they seize it? Harry made a decision. A highly risky strategy, with a very high chance of failure. However, if successful, Kerbals will be able to gain technology that they previously wouldn\u0027t have imagined, and become masters of the universe. He quickly composed a message, and placed it into the Broadcast databank, ready for launch. Now, all he had to do was to press a green triangular shaped button that will initiate the broadcast. Harry hovered his hand above it. The fate of the Kerbal civilisation depended on those slender green fingers. Without hesitation, Harry pressed the button.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ColdJ","CreatedById":211123,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-06-23T14:22:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224400883\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224537\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221719143365\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022232679\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tryharder\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, tryharder said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithout hesitation, Harry pressed the button.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeautiful, as good as reading a novel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fizzlebop Smith","CreatedById":227275,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-06-23T14:32:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224400883\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224537\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221719143365\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022232679\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tryharder\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, tryharder said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EWithout hesitation, Harry pressed the button.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomewhere deep within the hidden Munar base.. a red light began a steady rhythm of\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\non...off...on.. .
