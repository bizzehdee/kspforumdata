With these he preserved most of the knowledge already acquired by Kerbalkind, thus providing future generations with a foundation of knowledge planted in the tragic (and short) history of Kerbal civilization. It was around the time of the Kerbalakahn conquest, that Kerbo began his observations of the night sky. His tablets serve as the first known record of the Kerbals\u0027 knowledge of the heavenly bodies, including those which we now call the Mun, Minimus, and the planet Jool.
