All your subatomic particles tumble away into the unimaginably infinite void, where every tesseractic centimeter of space could hold a billion of your universes and still have room for more. Fortunately for me, I\u0027m four-dimensional myself and have been projecting into your universe all this time, so I\u0027m not affected. Sadly, stable orbits can\u0027t exist when gravity works according to the inverse cube law, so the new universe, like mine, is rather chaotic and lackluster.
