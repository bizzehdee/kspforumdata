This is (at least in the AKS fleet) the weakest weapon used period since even this is kinda useless against anything with armor. Now against capital ships the weakest weapon ive found workeable is a RT-5 with a structural panel in the nose. It takes some luck and i have had many tests where a full salvo did barely anything, but it usually at a minimum cripples some systems, knocks out weapons, engines, ect. For a much more effective but still basic and low part count weapon take a RT-5 or RT-10, place a small structural panel atop, and then place 2-4 short ibeams ontop of that, making it into a cone for appearance if you prefer.

Tripedoes are pretty much lightweight high velocity phasing rounds tipped in the rover wheels that have better impact tolerance and dont actually weight much (its like 0.95 or something per wheel).

Ive actually gone back to the original tri-fighter and redid that one to new standards (and made it into a ion drive since new fuel tanks make ions feaseable now). Didnt come out quite how i wanted, but that bloody firepower is amazing, 3 0.6m hardpoints and 1 1.3m hardpoint give this thing firepower equivalent to most bombers or even some corvettes (depends on your classification standards, its not even close to what id consider a corvette).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts actually quite well built, its 53 parts fully armed (not counting the 2000t lifter i sent it to dres on, probably overkill to use a capital ship lifter, i pretty much got to orbit on teh 1st stage alone!), ~8t fully armed, ~5t unarmed, and its maneuverable and has a useable TWR for something i never intended to go anywhere without a carrier/interplanetary transfer ring. TWR is roughly 0.4 using boosters, and 0.2 with pure ions, its not very good, but considering the thing was designed for low gravity, its adequate (and the omnidirectional vernor control make sideways flight possible to avoid incoming rounds. dV is approx 6K with ions but it also has a nice supply of LFO for the vernors, and can use its missiles as emergency boosters if you really run out of dV for some reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for weapons, armed for now with the usual Ibeam-S unguided junk (that can barely scratch a capital ship), as well as a basic RT-5 torpedo to save on weight (it can be armed with a Tripedo-S or Tripedo-M when facing capital ships). Its also equipped with my new docking system allowing them to be parked on anything that can be docked to just like the comparable shorter range smaller HK-102 \u0022Vulture\u0022. I can even have them attached to the outer hull of any capital ship, ready to be deployed when the enemy strikes. Finally, it is quite hard to wipe out completely since it it (like my capital ships) made atop a girder core, making it very hard to completely vaporize with any smaller weapons (as you can see the pics i shot at it with a shade from macey\u0027s vids, using torps with a oscar-B and a 48-7s, and they did absolutely NO DAMAGE at all).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPretty much the best fighter i have thats under 10t, has good range, and actually has some firepower to boot. And yes, i know a point defense interceptor does not NEED to have over 6K dV, but hey, its a AKSTechnologies craft, almost every fighter released is kinda overkill in the dV dept.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-17T02:44:13Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2015 02:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astecarmyman","CreatedById":65422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T04:19:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ScriptKitt3h\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ScriptKitt3h\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell... they\u0027re not exactly \u003Cem\u003Enormal\u003C/em\u003E I-beams... t\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fQgnQgU.png\u0022 alt=\u0022fQgnQgU.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made these a year before they were cool \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWHO\u0027S HIPSTER NOW?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T16:16:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehey Spartwo, your smaller vessel fleet has given me some inspiration to make some actual fighters for once (before 1.0 hit all my fighters were laythe SSTOs so not too practical and very heavy).

There are 2 short ones, the ones i have in say my craft, and one thats lighter and fatter but even shorter. The shorter fatter one is considerably worse, to the point that they dont even do much to a FIGHTER let alone a capital ship. The Mbeam 200 is pretty good though and will do damage (sometimes you get unlucky and it just desintegrates) most of the time to medium armor ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for splitting dreks, its a matter of 3 things that the weapons must have. It must have high impact tolerance penetrator (ibeams, struct panels, girders, what have you), must be capable of \u0022phasing\u0022 through outer armor (more on that later), and it must have sufficient weight to actually overload the joints. As for phasing, this means it essentially bypasses armor by taking advantage of the tick based physics so itr only interacts after its passed inside the vessel. This has alot to do with luck (even the strongest weapon like my tripedo-H has a very very small (less then 10%) chance of doing nothing when it passes through say a very thin vessel entirely, and it really depends on speed and target. Some ships that have very thick hulls make it best to fly in at excess of 500m/s, thinner ships are best targeted with 200-300m/s, you get the idea. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBtw, if you want to do a for fun battle i could deploy my for fun ships and arm them with weaker ordinance so they are roughly similar to what you have. I was never a big fan of superweapons as it doesnt allow for thjose drawn out battles. Finally, i have a version of the ship you used in the last battle thats upgraded with AKS armor/engine layout. If you would be interested i can sell it to you for free. The only reason i did this is cause i actually liked the way your ship looked, but wanted something that could take a beating and still function fine.

Im going to be using ibeam-M and Tripedo-S (not Tripedo-S but Tripedo-S, the S in the other one stands for small, the s in the new one stands for stubby as its gotta be the single smallest 1.25m weapon ive managed to create, fully stackable and reloadeable too and only 11 parts per shot. As much as id love to switch to unguided rt-5 weapons, the way my ship is designed makes that impossible (it has weapon bays on the hull, not much forward firing munitions as i wanted to go with redundancy as the front is just too tempting a weakspot to shoot at). Working on a new front that will allow 1.25m weapons to be mounted and fired forwards, that is also somewhat better armored as the front of my corvettes is just terrible even if it can survive some very weak weapons. But for this battle ill stick to something i know can at least work. Hopefully though the dV savings from lowering weapons weight will be enough to let me actually get somewhere i need to go to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, i see you have upgraded your firepower considerably. If weight allows it, i reccomend bringing a few of those longer Ibeams as well, they are better vs capitals, and very lethal to fighters and other unarmored crap. I find a good general purpose weapon to be the longest Ibeam\u002B4 seps, its lowish part count, and if you fire far enough away can get up to some amazing velocities. The short ibeams are best vs fighters though as lighter and faster.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-17T19:13:08Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2015 07:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Three1415","CreatedById":85754,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T19:30:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is nice to see battles being set up again...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have decided to mothball my dreadnought indefinitely, or at least until the liquid fuel-only tanks are improved; I am now constructing an 85-100-ton cruiser to act as a core fleet vessel.
