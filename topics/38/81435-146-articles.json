Although myself i havent come up with anything at all armor wise thats say, under 200 parts and can reliably block poppers or other high end weapons, im still hoping that some day some stroke of luck comes and i come up with something revolutionary, actual armor protection against heavy ordinance at lowish mass/part count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBtw, does anyone know what is the best core layout? Im working on a frigate (itll have a 300 part hull, higher then what i normally like but im actually trying to make something hard to kill), and i could use some help with the core layout as my SK-CRV-III is starting to really become obsolete. It served AKS well for a long time, but that hull is just showing its age, and now that ive found a weakness that every one of my ships i have carries (all based on the same core structure), it needs to be replaced by something better, preferably similar on parts and not much heavier either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIve also discovered a few more things that may be of help to anyone building hulls. It seems that for one, parts can actually get weakened by an initial salvo and then are easier to break. While ive never actually thought such a thing was true, ive consistently produced results where a bombardment of even weak crap like stubby ibeams can weaken a hull and make it get cut in half far easier with say a RT-5 then had i fired that RT-5 before bombarding with the ibeams. When fighting, ive found one shot at a time in sequence to be the most lethal vs heavy armor as well, if you get the timing right the enemy ship will not fully recover from built in stresses and the joints can be ovcerloaded by stuff that would normally not do much. Placing wings onto structural panels is a BAD IDEA, as ive actually removed the wings from my SK-CRV class ships, and it seems to have better resilience vs weak crap like ibeams, and is of roughly equal protection vs high velocity phased rounds. It seems that the weapons put stress on the wings that break apart and then that stress travels through ripping out more of the hull then had the ordinance hit just the panels under it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, while im still not going back to 100% competitive builds until U5, i think ill spend the next few days i have off testing armor layouts as i really need to find something that works for my new fleet im redoing completely (old ships as nice as they were, are just starting to die too easily when you know how to hit em).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Three1415","CreatedById":85754,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-17T04:23:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022panzer1b\u0022 data-cite=\u0022panzer1b\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlthough myself i havent come up with anything at all armor wise thats say, under 200 parts and can reliably block poppers or other high end weapons, im still hoping that some day some stroke of luck comes and i come up with something revolutionary, actual armor protection against heavy ordinance at lowish mass/part count.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have not either; however, my Gen.
