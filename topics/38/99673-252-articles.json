All post must clearly and correctly, and \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eexplicitly\u003C/span\u003E states the current number, so that new players can simply join in without having to go back pages to understand the context if everyone use that move. In all, this seems like a very valid revert.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHOWEVER. I made a big mistake during the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/110598-The-Number-War-Count-to-100-or-100?p=1924775#post1924775\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Erules update\u003C/a\u003E recently, in which rule 4 was saying:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that, it has \u0022whether it is explicit or implicit\u0022 regarding to \u0022stating the operation you have done\u0022 \u003Cstrong\u003Eand\u003C/strong\u003E \u0022the current number.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps you already see it. When the rule states you can implicitly state the current number, it means fel\u0027s post would be perfectly valid, as from the context available, it can be kind of assumed that the current number is minus 1 from the current number above. Before the rule change it was not permissible, but I forgot about it when I combined the rules and did not clearly stated it. Furthermore, even if multiple interpretation rule is applied here (which number is being subtracted from?) the new rule 5 would force the most obvious interpretation on it, making it valid still.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould have updated the rules after a round, lol, not during it...
