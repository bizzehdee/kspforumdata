As the most viable solution depends on a crucial piece of equipment (found laying by the side of the road), they turn to its original inventor, Jebediah \u0027Bruce\u0027 Kerman and his unlikely team of misfits to do what no kerbal has been asked to do before: to prevent a global killer from hitting the planet. Halfway through the mission, Jeb thwarts the implementation of a Secondary Protocol that was intended to blow up the asteroid with the aid of nukes, and with the aid of his team turns the weapons into engines instead, using the thrust to capture the asteroid in an orbit around the planet, making it Kerbin\u0027s third moon and calling it Liz, declaring independence from Kerbin because as Val put it, none of them wanted to pay taxes again.
