It could be described as an odd sort of decentralised Nomic, but who knows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEssentially, I post a statement here which contains rules. You may use those rules to modify the statement, as long as it is in following with the rules. Players may modify that statement as well (under the rules outlined in the statement), and so on and so forth. The only core rule is that you must begin it with the number of the statement and which statement it was based off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201C\u003Cstrong\u003EStatement 1\u003C/strong\u003E: You may modify this statement.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201C\u003Cstrong\u003EStatement 2\u003C/strong\u003E (based off \u003Cstrong\u003EStatement 1\u003C/strong\u003E): You may modify this statement so long as any addenda contain the letter \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153e\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201C\u003Cstrong\u003EStatement 3\u003C/strong\u003E (based off \u003Cstrong\u003EStatement 1\u003C/strong\u003E): You may modify this statement so long as any addenda do not contain the letter \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153e\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E and so on.
