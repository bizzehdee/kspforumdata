And we protect it\nwith our lives.\n\n  \nUnfortunately, there are\nsome people in this room\n\n  \nwho think they can take it from us\n\n  \n\u0027cause we\u0027re the little guys!\nI\u0027m hoping that, after this is all over,\n\n  \nyou\u0027ll see how, by taking our honey,\nyou not only take everything we have\n\n  \nbut everything we are!\n\n  \nI wish he\u0027d dress like that\nall the time.

I find that\nto be a very disturbing term.\n\n  \nI don\u0027t imagine you employ\nany bee-free-ers, do you?\n\n  \n- No.\n- I couldn\u0027t hear you.\n\n  \n- No.\n- No.\n\n  \nBecause you don\u0027t free bees.\nYou keep bees. Not only that,\n\n  \nit seems you thought a bear would be\nan appropriate image for a jar of honey.\n\n  \nThey\u0027re very lovable creatures.\n\n  \nYogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.\n\n  \nYou mean like this?\n\n  \nBears kill bees!\n\n  \nHow\u0027d you like his head crashing\nthrough your living room?!\n\n  \nBiting into your couch!\nSpitting out your throw pillows!\n\n  \nOK, that\u0027s enough.

And so here\nwe have yet another example\n\n  \nof bee culture casually\nstolen by a human\n\n  \nfor nothing more than\na prance-about stage name.\n\n  \nOh, please.\n\n  \nHave you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?\n\n  \nBecause I\u0027m feeling\na little stung, Sting.\n\n  \nOr should I say...

Is that a crime?\n\n  \nNot yet it isn\u0027t. But is this\nwhat it\u0027s come to for you?\n\n  \nExploiting tiny, helpless bees\nso you don\u0027t\n\n  \nhave to rehearse\nyour part and learn your lines, sir?\n\n  \nWatch it, Benson!\nI could blow right now!\n\n  \nThis isn\u0027t a goodfella.\nThis is a badfella!\n\n  \nWhy doesn\u0027t someone just step on\nthis creep, and we can all go home?!\n\n  \n- Order in this court!\n- You\u0027re all thinking it!\n\n  \nOrder!

Luckily, he was free.\n\n  \nOh, that was lucky.\n\n  \nThere\u0027s a little left.\nI could heat it up.\n\n  \nYeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.\n\n  \nSo I hear you\u0027re quite a tennis player.\n\n  \nI\u0027m not much for the game myself.\nThe ball\u0027s a little grabby.\n\n  \nThat\u0027s where I usually sit.\nRight... there.\n\n  \nKen, Barry was looking at your resume,\n\n  \nand he agreed with me that eating with\nchopsticks isn\u0027t really a special skill.\n\n  \nYou think I don\u0027t see what you\u0027re doing?\n\n  \nI know how hard it is to find\nthe rightjob. We have that in common.\n\n  \nDo we?\n\n  \nBees have 100 percent employment,\nbut we do jobs like taking the crud out.\n\n  \nThat\u0027s just what\nI was thinking about doing.\n\n  \nKen, I let Barry borrow your razor\nfor his fuzz. I hope that was all right.\n\n  \nI\u0027m going to drain the old stinger.\n\n  \nYeah, you do that.\n\n  \nLook at that.\n\n  \nYou know, I\u0027ve just about had it\n\n  \nwith your little mind games.\n\n  \n- What\u0027s that?\n- Italian Vogue.\n\n  \nMamma mia, that\u0027s a lot of pages.\n\n  \nA lot of ads.\n\n  \nRemember what Van said, why is\nyour life more valuable than mine?\n\n  \nFunny, I just can\u0027t seem to recall that!\n\n  \nI think something stinks in here!\n\n  \nI love the smell of flowers.\n\n  \nHow do you like the smell of flames?!\n\n  \nNot as much.\n\n  \nWater bug!

I like it!\n\n  \nI always felt there was some kind\nof barrier between Ken and me.\n\n  \nI couldn\u0027t overcome it.\nOh, well.\n\n  \nAre you OK for the trial?\n\n  \nI believe Mr. Montgomery\nis about out of ideas.\n\n  \nWe would like to call\nMr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.\n\n  \nGood idea! You can really see why he\u0027s\nconsidered one of the best lawyers...\n\n  \nYeah.\n\n  \nLayton, you\u0027ve\ngotta weave some magic\n\n  \nwith this jury,\nor it\u0027s gonna be all over.\n\n  \nDon\u0027t worry.

What matters is\nyou\u0027re alive. You could have died.\n\n  \nI\u0027d be better off dead. Look at me.\n\n  \nThey got it from the cafeteria\ndownstairs, in a tuna sandwich.\n\n  \nLook, there\u0027s\na little celery still on it.\n\n  \nWhat was it like to sting someone?\n\n  \nI can\u0027t explain it. It was all...\n\n  \nAll adrenaline and then...\nand then ecstasy!\n\n  \nAll right.\n\n  \nYou think it was all a trap?\n\n  \nOf course. I\u0027m sorry.\nI flew us right into this.\n\n  \nWhat were we thinking? Look at us. We\u0027re\njust a couple of bugs in this world.\n\n  \nWhat will the humans do to us\nif they win?\n\n  \nI don\u0027t know.\n\n  \nI hear they put the roaches in motels.\nThat doesn\u0027t sound so bad.\n\n  \nAdam, they check in,\nbut they don\u0027t check out!\n\n  \nOh, my.\n\n  \nOould you get a nurse\nto close that window?\n\n  \n- Why?\n- The smoke.\n\n  \nBees don\u0027t smoke.\n\n  \nRight.

Where is everybody?\n\n  \n- Are they out celebrating?\n- They\u0027re home.\n\n  \nThey don\u0027t know what to do.\nLaying out, sleeping in.\n\n  \nI heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way\nto San Antonio with a cricket.\n\n  \nAt least we got our honey back.\n\n  \nSometimes I think, so what if humans\nliked our honey? Who wouldn\u0027t?\n\n  \nIt\u0027s the greatest thing in the world!\nI was excited to be part of making it.\n\n  \nThis was my new desk. This was my\nnew job.
