However, the ship is fully modular, split into fourteen individual sections; each is fully autonomous, capable of at least 4.5 km/s of delta-v, and armed with at least an I-Beam and a Micro-torpedo. Likewise, all components are attached by docking ports, allowing each segment to reassemble the complete ship, meaning that all fourteen segments must be completely destroyed before the cruiser is no longer capable of firing at least some of its weapons. Further complicating such an attempt is the ship\u0027s extremely durable plating, as each segment is as resilient as my bomber but without the structural weaknesses incurred by internal weapons mounting.

Ok, well 1 shot isnt the right term, more like 2 shot, as your ship usually survives with half intact somewhat, impressive armor, but nothing beats my Tripedo-S/H anti-everything missile especially considering it is lighter then most capital ship weapons and has less parts then any 1.25m weapons that isnt just a RT-5/10 with a decoupler and a structural panel atop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlas, I thought I had you with this one...But apparently the warhead on the Tripedo-S/H makes it equivalent to a girder missile nearly forty times its actual mass; an 87-ton girder missile did the same level of damage in testing...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pazner1b\u0022 data-cite=\u0022pazner1b\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOhh, and a few more tests resulted in me deeming it unfit for combat due to kraken attacks. It tends to tear itself apart, even a glancing blow that tore off the top section only (you would guess superficial dmg at best initially), then instant resonance kraken (what i cann vibrations that increase intensity until vessel kaput) hits it and leaves only a small skeleon behind if that.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feared that would be the case; more struts are required...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022panzer1b\u0022 data-cite=\u0022panzer1b\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIm just hoping 1.1 fixes the effin lag, its just so sad how limited we are right now due to the game being unoptimized (and dont tell me get a better machine, i have a quad core cpu, and KSP being a single threaded program, just cannot take advantage of the entire CPU in its current state. I also know how hard it is to run physics on non preprogrammed vessels, so it is logical that excessive parts will lag, but why cant we be able to say have 2000 parts in one area and not tear our eyes out.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lack of optimization or multi-threading is sad, yes, but improvements to it are rarely pushed for because very little else in the game requires ships above a few hundred parts. Still, though, performance is terrible and has only been getting worse...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Tegu","CreatedById":76643,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T17:09:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wonder if they really are all that tough....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReporting back soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, 1st attempt on the Torus:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CO3senG.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022CO3senG.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BrghgPz.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022BrghgPz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EsM975z.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022EsM975z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe\u0027s dead in the water, no propulsion or control left.
