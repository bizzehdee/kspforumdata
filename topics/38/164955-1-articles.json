(if anyone\u0027s interested) We can gather a group of people on a discord\u002BDMP server, and do ATC things, like at a airport (squaking, IFR\u00A0clearances, VFR clearances, stuff like that) For squawking, 1200 is for VFR flight, and to best simulate transponders, rename your aircraft\u00A0to a well, aircraft. For IFR, use 1000 (turn ship to lander), loss of radio\u00A0is 7600, and turn ship to a relay, and 7700 is emergency (turn ship to station). we can decide who shall be in the tower before we start!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRules:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nplease stay professional on the server during flight\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nno mods in DMP server\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwe will be using real ATC terms, be prepared\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nname your ship your call sign!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf there is already a thread like this, please bring it to my attention\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsay that you are interested in the thread, or in a PM to me, and I will PM you the server invite\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf someone could set up the DMP server, that would be fantastic, or I could try and do it myself, or we could use a empty server\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joseph Kerman","CreatedById":176176,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-30T10:40:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis isn\u0027t a forum game, it is a discussion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/27914-vanamonde/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002227914\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/27914-vanamonde/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Vanamonde\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoadRunnerAerospace","CreatedById":177973,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-30T11:54:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\noops!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoadRunnerAerospace","CreatedById":177973,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-30T17:34:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, Mods, please delete this thread\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-30T23:00:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe can close the thread if you want, but there\u0027s no harm in it.
