You can see how you play your last turn then, won\u0027t make a bit of difference since both should be capable of shooting down whatever remains. But we have to clear that rule next time, if I am to fight someone. That, and turn order as Frozen Heart says. What ship\u0027s turn would it be if my reassembly move was legal? Ships can change tonnage... In that case, I\u0027d houserule that turn order for the ships in one fleet is decided beforehand, and any ships needing to do serious salvage work can/have to skip their turn in order for other ships to act without having to forgo all attacks that turn.
