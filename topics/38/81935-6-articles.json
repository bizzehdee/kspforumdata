Most breaches of Kontainment are caught quickly, but one particularly nasty outbreak of SKP-217 (a mysterious virus that converts kerbals\u0027 flesh into rocket parts) fails to be rekontained after an incident involving an ornery molten salt reactor and a very powerful carbon dioxide laser. Within a month, an XK-class End-Of-The-World scenario is in full swing, and most of the Kerbal population has been converted to evil rocket cyborg kerbals. \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003Etrochee fixation, anyone?\u003C/span\u003E In a surprise display, the Global Occult Koalition tries to salvage the situation with six strategically-placed keostationary railguns, but it\u0027s already too late- the SKP-217-infected kerbals have already launched into orbit and overtaken the keostationary satellite ring. The remaining living Kerbals on the SKP Foundation\u0027s orbiting facilities manage to escape to a large inertial-fusion-powered transit vehicle still untouched by the cyborg kerbals, board it, and start burning for Laythe.
