A large space station, home to 500 people, is in Earth orbit. After communications are lost, the Constellation erupts into chaos, and many die. Now the remaining inhabitants must survive, and find a way to get back to Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGOAL: You are a survivor.

Trading must only be done in the Trading Hub.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPET RULES: Pets are animals that follow you around. They can help you find resources, and hunt wild animals in areas like the Suburbs and Starleaf Forest. Only ShachonianX can decide when a pet will appear, and in what area it will appear in. If you are in the area the pet appears in, you can take it as your own. Pets can also be claimed if they start following you.
