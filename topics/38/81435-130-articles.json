Seeing 1st hand what the primary weapon of the Blade of Eternity was capable of, and knowing the SK-CRV-IIIg3 had less armor then their unlucky flagship, the only way to win this battle was to disable the remaining warship\u0027s weapons systems.

During a scan of the vessel, a weakspot was found that had the potential to cut the entire front half, including the weapons clean off the vessel, and the fighter used its RT-5 torpedo in an attempt to do this. It missed, and failed to destroy the entire front, but managed to dislodge half of the ship\u0027s weapon systems. Afterwards, the ibeams were used agaunst the other hardpoint, the 1st missing entirelky, and the 2nd scoring a direct hit and shooting it off. The 3rd was used to just shoot at the midsection but it did not do any real damage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the success, the HK-103 was given orders to find and disable all weapons that have been dislodged.

The 2nd stack of missiles was also found, and disabled by wasting its fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a resounding success, the data from B#2 was deemed valuable enough to upload to the AKS network for all HK series fighters and interceptors to learn from.

Ofc the 3rd generation cut back on alot of this redundancy (not every section has 6 vernors anymore), so it lost the benefits the designh had when it was 1st made (the g1 and to some extent the g2 has this). Nukes switching to lf only also didnt help me as now i need dedicated RCS (err vernor) fuel which just makes it less attractive to use them. A prototype g4 with LFO only drive and WAY more redundancy worked better, but the loss to range was so bad it just didnt make any sense. better have useable dV (its still bad even with nukes) then a situational feature such as the absurd redundancy the ships used to have (not to mention the sheer part count that took up).

I think i could easily fight a 15t fighter and a 90t warship, provided i can have a slight edge in numbers (perhaps 1 more ship then you (say you deploy 1 capital and 2 fighter, i would prolly bring 1capital and 3 fighters, or just increase the firepower/armor of my ships and make them similar to u tonage wise).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E \u003Cp\u003EI would be willing to accept a one-ship disadvantage (especially as it would only be a fighter), but of course true negotiations must wait until the ships are complete...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022panzer1b\u0022 data-cite=\u0022panzer1b\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso, what do u mean by ibeam effectiveness? ive always had mixed results with ibeams, sometimes i actually manage to shoot off a nice chunk of enemy ship, sometimes multiple volleys do absolutely nothing but superficial damage if that. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean that I have constructed a weapon system that A: Allows the storage of a large quantity of (short) I-Beam rockets; and B: Allows them to be extremely effective against capital ships, to the point of causing severe damage to even Dreks with single volleys. They are as of yet inconsistent, but I believe I can decrease their variance from volley to volley with further testing. This weapon system will be mounted and field-tested on my cruiser; it is classified until then. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022panzer1b\u0022 data-cite=\u0022panzer1b\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFInally, as for the 650 armor, it looks nice yes, but i dont use those as they up the part count way way way too much for my tastes and dont offer enough benefits imo. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree in this respect; the only time I ever use 650s as armor is on small fighters, where they are more economical mass- and volume-wise than plating; capital ship armor does not at all benefit from their use, thus my concern over ScriptKitt3h\u0027s new ship\u0027s durability (I suspect that the 650 column is too flexible to avoid being clipped through the outer armor when taking fire; this would result in the destruction of interior components with great rapidity).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T09:40:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing my own weapons to destroy my corvette.
