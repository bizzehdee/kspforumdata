These can be as crazy and frivolous as you want them to be.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n3.\u00A0Something Changed\u00A0- like Something Old, but you change the events of how the work of fiction goes before and/or after you place it down. These changes can be as minor or as frivolous as you want.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou can make these events happen in\u00A0any\u00A0year you want, and you can mix and match between the three types!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMake sure to add the classifications of\u00A0SO,\u00A0SN, and/or\u00A0SC\u00A0depending on the event in parentheses after the number.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nExample:\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. (SO) Groundhog Day\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. (SN) During the Civil War, copies of Shrek 2 rain from the sky\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. (SC) Friends, but in 2004, Ross, the largest of the friends, eats the others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
