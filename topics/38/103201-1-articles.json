Follow all [Forum Rules](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/30064-Community-Rules-July-24-2014). (Duh).\n2. Stick to the game, don\u0027t start conversations, etc.\n3. Make the word a real word rather than a made up word, i.e CAR instead of IMSOCOOL.\n4. Please make the completed acronyms sound like a thing, rather than just a sentence, i.e Ceres Activity Recon instead of Cats Attack Rats.\n\nGameplay works like this:\n\n1. First poster (me) posts a word.\n2. Second poster has to come up with a somewhat reasonable acronym that has the letters of the word and posts a new word.\n3. Repeat step 2 indefinitely.\n\nExample:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E word\n\n\u003E \n\u003E (W)hacky (O)bstructionist \u00AEandom (D)ichotomy.
