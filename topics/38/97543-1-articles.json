Allow for the possibility of the simulation to bring about the birth of a cloud that turns into a star that blows its guts apart upon supernova that would then seed a future galaxy of stars that would then build planets that would possibly yield life that could possibly bring intelligent life that might also build a computer at some point able to simulate the entire universe down to its absolute tiniest level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHUSSSSSSSSSSSSS bringing about another simulation.

But I\u0027m not sure if we\u0027ll ever get to the bottom of things: There\u0027s so much data to find that it would take more computing power than all the brains of planet Earth (including animals) and the computers can handle. This doesn\u0027t contradict the statement that the universe is quantifiable, since infinity also belongs to the array of real numbers (sorry if I\u0027ve used a bad math term(ite).) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) At least out of quantum universe, the physics are entirely compliant to boolean statements: To use the example of gravity, it could be written as such:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Efunction gravity (int mass_a, int mass_b, int radius) \u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Eint gravityConstant = 10; // don\u0027t get me wrong, i know that the actual gravity is 9.81 m.s; but to keep things clean\u003Cbr\u003Eint gravityForce;\u003Cbr\u003Eint handle; // this variable is there just for syntax purposes\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Ehandle = (mass_a * mass_ / sqr(radius);\u003Cbr\u003EgravityForce = gravityContstant * handle;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Ereturn gravityForce;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow while this goes only for general gravity and doesn\u0027t apply to light, since it is virtually massless and yet is captured by gravity, a similar function may be made compliant to relativity theory (too much physics for a doctor, sorry \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ). If it looks tht the gravity doesn\u0027t work like that... it does. There\u0027s just another force altering the result.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow to the boolean point: I can simply say that physics apply at all times: So they comply with boolean rules, but virtually \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E physics = true \u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E at all times of the day no matter if they\u0027re working on a planet or a photon. Any given physical law works at the same time and if a physical law was written like a function and a test would be made whether it\u0027s true or not, it would always return true (or a syntax error). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is something that looks like a \u0022Maybe\u0022 concerning the behaviour of living organisms, because they don\u0027t seem to use the binary logic at all sometimes. (hello, my fianc\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9e). It may be confusing, but generally physics apply before biology, and physics say that most of the thinking process are just short electrical pulses: their intensity may vary, but the intensity can be coded binarily, as shown by computer games and, in fact, computers themselves. So, IMHO, the world does comply to boolean statements, at least at its crudest forms. The reason why it doesn\u0027t always seem like that is that we don\u0027t always see it as a chessboard and have virtually no information on the current situation at any given time (do you know what my brother is doing right now? Me neither. Can it influence you? Yes, it can.).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow to the most difficult question: How did the universe go from quarks to black holes: The answer is... physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s no secret that most of the natural elements seek to make themselves stable, i.e. get as close to an inert gas as possible. This is why they\u0027re reacting and making up other compounds. But some of these compounds are not stable either, and interact with other compounds that are available to create a more stable form of themselves. This would eventually lead to formation of carbohydrates and organic matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI won\u0027t lie, I have no explanation for how we did transform from a simple chains of hydrogen and carbon into a thinking being, but we\u0027re still essentially those carbohydrates. So the chemistry of a human body, broken to pieces, is in fact really simple: We\u0027re being held together by the same joints that hold together these black holes - just in a different set-up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe atoms are made of protons, neutrons and electrons, and these particles are made of quarks: There are two types of quarks: Up (1) and down (0). Seems possible to make with a computer, although our universe (even if possibly simulated), is made of so enormous amounts of physics that it would take years to implement them. So the world as we know it, if simulated, is clearly not a beta version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I\u0027ve written above, you can easily conclude that I think that the world is theoretically computer-simulable, but such a feat is technically off limits for humanity right now. But the computers, as we know them, would eventually run out of resources if we simulate inside a simulation: So an administrator would either have to \u0022correct\u0022 the simulation on time or the system would crash, resulting in the death of all of those universes but the original one and those above it in terms of hierarchy of simulations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the world is really simulated, we would sooner or later find out a proof: A computer glitch. These occur in every program and are inevitable. I\u0027m not saying that the universe isn\u0027t glitchy right now (the black holes, for example, could be a prime example of such a programming error), but they\u0027re just not glitchy enough for us to see. I\u0027m only saying that this is the most likely way to discover that we\u0027re not real at all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeez, it could make for a nice book, if I only could write fiction...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL; DR: The real world is not necessarily real.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.
