Someone posts a word, and everyone else replies to it, adding one word at a time until the first post on 31, where words can be added/edited, and 61, where sentences can be added, 91, where sentences can be edited, and 121, where punctuation errors can be edited. This continues for paragraphs and letters as well (respectively) but after this there are no updates. You cannot edit your own punctuation errors, and combination-words like so are permitted as long as they are not their own sentence. You may make a different variation of this post as long as I am credited, you start with only a single word, and it has the same rules.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Atlas 0187","CreatedById":223897,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-22T16:53:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah Kerman is bragging about how he can say \u201Cyo soy embarazada\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
