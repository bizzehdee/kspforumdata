The microbes in Jool\u0027s atmosphere and the [DATA EXPUNGED] on Vall and Laythe also agree that this is the best course of action, and everyone lines up to cast their votes in the first election. GreeningUniverse-Beta and General Rarity are elected co-presidents, while everyone else on the thread is elected to the senate.

I mean,- [banned for political ranting]\n\nIn any case, the sudden reappearance of the abhorrently capitalist Kionicles from my shoddily-constructed spatial redirection envelope wrecks the system when the Kionicles decide to attack for \u0027fun\u0027 and \u0027profit\u0027. In a fit of anti-Kionicle rage, GreeningUniverse-Beta draws upon the energies of a hundred of her largest stars, then crushes the cores of every one simultaneously. The resultant hypernova blasts all its energy out through her universe-body, focused into a tight, coherent beam aimed individually at every Kionicle-associated entity. I set up a new, tougher spatial redirection membrane, this time trapping the Kionicles, all of their ships, and the constantly-rebounding supernova laser inside a volume smaller than KSC. I then lock the membrane inside an Alcubierre bubble and send it towards the edges of the universe at 200c. \n\nThis pleases the Kerbals, and immigration to the Jool system increases dramatically in the aftermath, improving production of our democratized economy.\n\nMy sister and I return the bottom of Vall\u0027s ocean, where we have a little house on a hill.
