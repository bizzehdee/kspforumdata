Language changes with a matter of decades, slang is created poisoning speech and writ, and spell-check does not help because it has made many of us indifferent to re reading what we write. So not all but man English professors view themselves as the stalwart defenders of words and context. Every infraction and bad habit to be nipped in the bud and destroyed to defend against an unstoppable enemy. Math teachers on the other hand or at least man of the ones I had interviewed (125 in total across 21 universities) tend to be more laid back. Math defends its self. Opinion does not change it, time does not weigh it down, and the mixing of culture does not warp it.
