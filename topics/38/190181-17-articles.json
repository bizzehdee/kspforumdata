It selected a target from the list in its memory, assigned it a missile from its arsenal, and then fired, over and over again. The missiles had smart guidance systems so they found their target with ease. One day Arkhtag chose the laythean wardrone Alpha-369. Except that it didn\u0027t. You see, on neutral Kerbin there lived a kerbal that just so happened to be named Alpha-369, and when Arkhtag\u0027s list of targets was being written by a certain Auldan Kerman, Auldan was very tired. So tired she j\u003Cspan\u003Eust couldn\u0027t be bothered to specify if she was referring to the kerbal or wardrone.

Inside the cottage Alpha-369 Kerman happened to exist. When the investigation concluded with its results proving Alpha-369 Kerman had been killed by a dunian missile, Kerbin\u0027s neutrality was no more. Kerbin\u0027s inexhaustable spacecraft industry proved too much for what remained of Duna\u0027s wardrone fleet to handle.
