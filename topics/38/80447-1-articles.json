These laws of physics determine how an input is processed. These are defined at the start of the round, and can not be changed afterwards. Nature can also decide which types of input are acceptable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll other players play as Scientists. They give an input to Nature, who then applies the laws of physics to the input in order to give an output. This is called an Experiment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Scientists win once they have successfully found out the laws of physics from giving input. Whoever works out the law of physics gets to be Nature, or they can pass on the title to someone else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, general play would go as such:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20AC\u02DC: I am playing as nature, and have came up with the laws of physics for this round.
