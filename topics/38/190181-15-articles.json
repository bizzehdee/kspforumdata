He had done missions to every body in the solar system, he even claims to have gone to dres. No he was sitting in a scrappy little crew capsule, about to be blasted up to the first interstellar ship. But then, he heard the loud beep signaling the final countdown to launch, but he forgot about that and was so startled that he jumped up, hit his head, and then landed face first on the abort button. Being unbuckled he shot up to the top of the capsule as the Escape tower detached. He smashed head first through the docking port airlock and flew out of the capsule. He pulled his parachute, nothing. He pulled his back up shoot, it shot out but had a massive hole, he cut it. Then the ground got closer, then closer, then even closer.

It landed on the Mun and Kerman10 went down to the surface for a closer look. A kerbal jumped down from the top and he engaged invisibility just in time! He opened up a compartment and inside was a great big, white, shiny Mun rover. Of course, Kerman10 had no idea what the Mun rover was. He stood in front of it, and marveled at the finest of kengineering. He watched as the Kerbal got on top of the rover... and ran him over at 12 m/s.
