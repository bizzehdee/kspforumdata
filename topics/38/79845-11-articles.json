Geothermal power could sustain us for a limited time, but since the earth\u0027s core relies on orbital stresses to remain hot, it would cool down over time and eventually stop being a usable power source. Nuclear power wouldn\u0027t be viable either, because the process of mining and refining uranium takes far more energy than the actual uranium puts out. Long before we ran out of energy, though, the biosphere would freeze and collapse, and no one would survive for very long even if they had a geothermal-powered hydroponic greenhouse to grow all their food since disease and cold would eventually claim them. Keeping a breeding population alive would probably be impossible unless you had time to construct some kind of really intense underground facility, which could last for a bunch of generations, but probably wouldn\u0027t keep humanity alive long enough to get anything significant done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only \u003Cem\u003Ereal\u003C/em\u003E option, obviously, would be to build a big spacecraft, fly back into the solar system, and set up colonies on Mars and the asteroids while we work on building starships.
