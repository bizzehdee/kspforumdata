Don\u0027t you mean \u0022momentum\u0022 not \u0022velocity\u0022? Yes, I suspect the wheels work well because they have higher crash tolerance than plates plus they have suspension so they are able to transfer more energy to the target before breaking and exploding. My experiments with the airplane gear were based on the assumption that when the missile hits, more parts flying around inside the ship equals more damage. So the gear are moderately high crash tolerance, easy to put in a missile, and massless so they don\u0027t affect the flight of the missile.
