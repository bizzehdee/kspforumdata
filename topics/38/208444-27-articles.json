He expected the safety inspector to appear before dark, as the team thought that massive boosters might counter the lack of struts on Kerbin. The mission would gradually devolve into reaction wheels, something literally revolutionary to Kerbalkind. How extraordinary that is, considering the effort required to make big ol\u0027 pitch forks and feather dusters with large torches, and wiggly tentacles playing the piano for fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:rgb(27,30,31);color:rgb(201,197,190);font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\nExactly one week later, the inspector woke to find a great disturbance in the force - a PowerPoint presentation. The horror of it overcame him with great quantum superlinearecitation. A Massive vortex opened to reveal a terrifying cake-producing monster. The inspector immediately panicked and reached for his pogo-stick, deftly bouncing off the bed that he was floating on down the Nile and into the grasp of Curveball-Anders who spontaneously barfed. Rutabaga, meanwhile, emerged in the river of dreams. Snark saw Kerbiloid and thought, is that Adsii?

The cake-producing monster began slithering towards the first person to run a bakery in the best area of Dakota. Competition wasn\u0027t anything the monster felt like wasting time on.
