Seeing as teh damage was minor and that all but one fuel tank was intact, the droid warship calculated that the best course of action was to switch orbital direction and pursue the enemy vessel before it drifted too far away. The burn was slow as only half of the ship\u0027s engines were left operational, but nevertheless A#2 managed to rendezvous with the CJS Blade of Eternity. Despite having a full complement of Tripedo-S general purpose guided missiles, the Ibeam-Ms were heavy, and not very effective against most enemies, so they were fired off 1st. Surprisingly the first shot aimed at the midsection destroyed the command pod and knocked the entire rear off of the vessel. After an intensive scan of the area, the now massively damaged vessel was determined to be neutralized and unable to either move, shoot, or do much of anything, so A#2 burned away to clear the wreckage safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/zrGKQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Ive gotten to the point that i accepted it as a universal weakspot, and modified my ships in such a way as to allow them to maintain functionality in the event that the ship is cut in half. My SK-CRV-IIIg2 has vernors all over it, and the front still was able to move some (although the switching of nukes to LF only hurt redundancy ALOT as i dont have much dV with vernors, before i could get over 500dV from a section, now its like 100 at best, and 0 if i choose to go with pure LF). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout engine armor, ive come up with a few workable armor schemes but they just werent implemented since i cant deal with so many parts. If i ever declassify it ill show you the Sk-CRV-IIIg1, the original of the entire line, and the best in both armor, and redundancy. Its powered by radial LFO engines in each section separately so you can literally get shot into 3 parts and STILL have full out mobility/weapons capabilities. Its rear engine cluster of nukes is also heavily armored, allowing me to have almost immunity to ibeams and other junk. And as for external armor/survivability, i concluded it to be no worse then a drek, but at a part count of over 400, it wasnt exactly any more practical mass/part count then drek, and it had utterly garbage range, i needed to have a dedicated interplanetary transfer ring to dock it inside of to even send it to duna, but it was intended for deplyment on very low gravity areas where dV didnt make a major difference such as minmus or smaller. Had i used this in our game youd prolly be unable to touch it (also has a sacrificial root part system which also makes it useless to use the automatic aim squad added in 0.90, although myself i prefer manual, since its more old school and lets you target weakspots better). That said, it has no practicality and well, its just a ship i keep around if i ever get into one of those super high level battles where you are dealing with weapons specifically designed to counter dreks (it also mounts 6 Tripedo-H missiles, 6 Tripedo-s, and 10\u002B Ibeam-Ms, and 16 KDrone-Ss, so anything that sees it can and will die).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for splitting dreks, they are suceptible (like any ship including mine) to a phased round to the central girder. Now the larger dreks take advantage of spaced armor in an attempt to deflect or destroy a phased round before it gets past into the central spine, but even still, i have managed to kill dreks with the Tripedo-S i had in our battle. Its not a reliable drek killer (sometimes it takes 3 shots, sometimes it takes 10\u002B), but its bloody accurate and can accelerate to well above 400m/s to maximize energy and phasing capabilities. The Tripedo-S i had on A#1 was an older model, and that was specifically designed as a weapon to bypass armor, it is VERY weak against anything that lacks armor since it has low weight, is very small, and has basically penetration\u002Bphasing only. The Tripedo-M (overkill for this battle so i didnt bring any) is comparable to zeke\u0027s popper-H in firepower and damage dealing, and in some regards it was inspired by that weapon, short stubby, but good firepower, although teh method in which is achieves the destructiva capabilities is different from teh popper-H, and its a bit lighter too. Still, aside from Tripedo-H (which is technically a 2.5m weapon even if it uses a 1.3m docking port as stuff sticks out radially), there is not a single weapon that is not excessively heavy capable of guaranteed drek killing. I suppose that id you got lucky (and managed to hit the drek in the core girder) even your new RT-5 weapons would cut it in half, but this is a matter of luck. I think that you actually got lucky in our battle with splitting my ship (i did some tests myself and i did manage your levels of damage, but i had at least 5 tests for every one split ship that did nothing but superficial damage to it, and a few critical damage like engine cluster shot off but even then usually at least 1 engine survived).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a major luck factor when dealingw ith phased weapons, and the most you can do is make weapons that maximize the odds of massive damage. Heck, as ive said somewhere before, i split a drek 12P in half with a shorter ibeam\u002B2 seps. It was a one in a million shot and i have yet to manage to recreate it, but it did happen ONCE. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, a few tips of weapons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe higher the impact tolerance of your warhead the less likely it is to desintegrate on hitting tough armor and it increases the odds of destroying whatever it collides with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe heavier your weapon is the more likely you are to overload joints, and weight decreases teh probability of weapon being desintegrated as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt all boils down to mass and impact tolerance, and its not necessarily one or the other but a combo of them. For example if you shoot a fully fueled 14400 nasa tank with a ibeam (despite the ibeam having higher impact, the sheer mass difference will actually give the fuel tank an advantage and the ibeam will usually desintagrate. The same cannot be said when firing teh same ibeam at a FLT-400, which is heavier then the ibeam, but not THAT heavier as to not be vaporized by ibeam. If you want better reliability you want to increase the mass, preferably teh mass of the impactor that has a higher impact tolerance. If you want to destroy tougher armor with high impact, you want to match the impact with your warhead, or idealy exceed the impact so your warhead is more powerful (rover wheels at 100 impact work wonders from my experience but are so light that they are again, unreliable against some armor).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethere are also other tactics that may or may not work better then the classical kinetic weapons. Some players use shrapnel warheads to try to destroy the internals of a ship. Ive had mixed results with these, on some ships they are exponentially better, and on others they end up worse then a solid warhead. Shrapnel (if you are interested in making them) basically require a very weak part to which small ibeams or other pats are connected to. This part breaks instantly on impact and releases a cloud of smaller parts. Conventional kinetic warhead have all structural parts connected to structural parts and usually teh warhead is still partially intact after it has collided with teh vessel and done damage, whereas shrapnel will leave a cloud of small debris. I dont use shrap as i havent had much luck with them, and they are inherently higher part count as you need volume of parts to create the debris cloud, but properly done they are capable of phasing through outer armor, and wreaking havok on internals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-18T19:42:54Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2015 07:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"8bitgammers","CreatedById":108555,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T20:09:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei don\u0027t know what all this discussion is all about, but...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eas the national overseer of the \u0022\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EO\u003C/span\u003Erbital \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EK\u003C/span\u003Eerbal \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EN\u003C/span\u003Eations\u0022 union\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei would really like to battle... somebody.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ejust a short 1v1 to test my designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eanyone up...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eno rush\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T20:40:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00228bitgammers\u0022 data-cite=\u00228bitgammers\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ei don\u0027t know what all this discussion is all about, but...\u003Cp\u003Eas the national overseer of the \u0022\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EO\u003C/span\u003Erbital \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EK\u003C/span\u003Eerbal \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EN\u003C/span\u003Eations\u0022 union\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei would really like to battle... somebody.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ejust a short 1v1 to test my designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eanyone up...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eno rush\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIll be glad to fight you, i just need to know roughly what tonage you want and roughly what mass each ship (and how many of each class) you plan to deploy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have some fighters (all under 10t) and a 75t corvette capital ship that i could fight you with. if you want much heavier i probably cant do it as i run with an absolute part limit of 1000 loaded at once (so no more then 500 parts on your end in a single ship).

Bombers can be as heavy as some of the lighter corvettes, but tend to look like planes, and also tend to focus on firepower above all else with 0 armor to speak of. Frigates are at least for me somewhat larger in teh 100-200t range, and focus more on armor and less of weapons/mobility/range. My SK-CRV-IIIg1 (the 1st generation) could be classed as a smaller frigate, its size and shape was just a little small for my taste and it didnt get called a frigate, despite its focus on armor and protection. Anyways, as a rough classing corvettes are 50-150t, frigates 100-200t, destroyers are above 200t, and the smallest cruiser i could make would be as big as the SPH, with the largest destoyers exceeding it. That said, if something is lightweight and LOOKS massive, ill classify it as a destroyer, if its super heavy but small, itll still get into frigate/corvette, this is just a rough approximation. I kinda view a cruiser as say something like the galactica from BSG, compared to a fighter that is made from a mk1 cockpit. Basically the scale KSP has with its kerbals, you could fit an entire colony inside just part of the ship. most of the dreks i would call frigates as they are a decent size, have a focus on armor, and well thats it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-18T21:36:02Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2015 09:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"8bitgammers","CreatedById":108555,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T21:36:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022panzer1b\u0022 data-cite=\u0022panzer1b\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIll be glad to fight you, i just need to know roughly what tonage you want and roughly what mass each ship (and how many of each class) you plan to deploy.\u003Cp\u003EI have some fighters (all under 10t) and a 75t corvette capital ship that i could fight you with. if you want much heavier i probably cant do it as i run with an absolute part limit of 1000 loaded at once (so no more then 500 parts on your end in a single ship).
