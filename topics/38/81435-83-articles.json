Decided not to use my large battleship but instead went with 5 lighter ships: one Joedrin (old corvette), one Correy (new corvette, heavier and ion powered, more small missiles), two Sonalds (standard destroyer, but I rearranged the internal fuel tanks again for more delta-V, now has new missiles), one Hansel (standard cruiser, now has new missiles.)
