Pressure upon volume division will multiply as to retain the same amount of energy. You are right though, the specific heat [HSP] will increase. However, in the same manner as temperatures achieved briefly do not affect much of what is around them because of how thermal transfer works under time, a super small object with that same density of thermal energy will not be as hot if you remain as distant.

Quantum adds in all sorts of nasties and can even allow energy to transfer across vacuum. In either case, the reaction rate of the blue dwarf would be much faster due to the increase in the number of molecular collisions occurring which hence creates more energy and hence leads to higher temperatures.\n\nAlso, you\u0027re thinking too 3 dimensionally, you need to be thinking 11 dimensionally to exit the universe!"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T22:11:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I think you\u0027re talking about the misconception of temperature, A.K.A. \u0022Space is cold.\u0022\n\u003E As matter is brought closer together, the ability to transfer energy between individual units of matter also increases, due to kinetic collision theory, which describes temperature as a function of molecular collisions, this makes sense.
