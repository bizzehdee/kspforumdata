The reason it is inactive when you launch is that your ship will always point straight up when it is inactive, so leave it off when you launch until you want to start turning.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Collider1","CreatedById":114806,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T21:06:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Overfloater\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Overfloater\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhen building cargo space-planes, concentrate hard on aesthetics.
