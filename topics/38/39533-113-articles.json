I figured out the problem with them and its like a 3 year old designed it. The \u002B - that run through the headset to the mic have exposed ends near the mic that after a while start to touch and short out the mic. All they would have to do is stic a small bit of scrap cardboard or paper or anything with a good amount of ohms and your have fixed your problem costing you nothing in materials and only adding 1c to the cost of 100 units.
