It has some resilient armor against I beams however. Also what are your ships made of? Mainly structural panels of wing panels?

You pretty much need to aim at weakspots such as the engine, or weapons mount to do catastrophic damage to it without extreme luckshots (every ships ive ever come across can always be massively crippled with even 1 ibeam rocket if you get very very lucky and hits its root part). Still, of all my ships it is the best when it comes to armor (hull is ONLY 210 parts, weapons add like 100-200 depending on loadout to that), and its probably one of the best ships ive come across if you take (protection)/(part count\u002Bmass) ratio under consideration, no drek, but its less then half the part count of the smallest dreks, and ive had some test runs where it took more then 3 of zeke\u0027s super 5t torps to actually obliterate it (by that i mean cut it in half). Still takes massive damage though from those super torps.

That said, only my frigates and higher have any form of actual protection, and teh corvettes are more support ships intended to bring weapons to teh battlefield, or when that doesnt work, act as cannon fodder \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E. My 2nd generation corvette (class-I) uses like 70% wings, with just an armored spine, whereas the new corvette im working on (class-II) uses a armored core and has wings covering non-essential stuff like fuel tanks, weapons, engines, ect).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy current 2 primary weapons are Tripedo-S (guided 0.9t thing) and Tribeam missiles (unguided weak but high velocity), both of which are anywhere from mediocre to decent depending on target\u0027s armor layout and your attack vector. The Tripedoes are a single 48-7s pushing around .8t of mass, lightweight but still effective in large numbers (10 parts a piece, fully guided, accurate enough to actually focus on a particular portion of the ship (such as rear, front, ect), but not accurate enough to reliably hit any particular weakspot reliably). The Tribeams are basically 3 Ibeams around another core ibeam and 8 separatrons pushing it, the lightest somewhat effective missile ive managed to come up with, and it has gotten me some surprising levels of damage. This thing can get respectable velocities, and is very deadly to wing armor/fuel tank core builds, but its far from useful against a properly designed capital ship (with a structural core), and against those the only thing you can do is fire multiple salvos hoping to score some critical hits on important components such as engines/ammo storage. In general, while i know these two weapons are kinda meh, they are both below 1t, and are still able to do do quite some damage given multiple hits to teh same section of a ship (unless i get very unlucky and the physics trolls me). Ive even managed a very very lucky 1 shot drek kill with the Tripedo-S on it, but that was before when the S model was 2t heavy, now i doubt itd touch a drek. Tripedo-M and the very massive H can do way more dmg, but are way to heavy to have any fun with (ok, the H can 1 shot obliterate a drek 12P 90% of teh time, then again, a 10 ton missile tends to do that and isnt much fun to use). The trick to the Tribeams and Tripedo-S is to have many of them, and focus fire a specific portion of teh ship for guaranteed damage, although how much it will be is still based on luck/how well you aim.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to use some 909 rockets im fine with that (my Tripedo-S is a guided 1250mm round, although its so light i push it with a 48-7s, which can get it up to 250m/s before it hist a target, and above 300 with minimal fuel loaded). Btw, how heavy are your 909 missiles? Ive found a direct correlation between weapon mass and the amount of damage it does with a good hit, and this is why i proposed a low mass weapons game, where the odds of any 1 shot kills are very low, and most if not all craft with an armored core would be able to take a few hits before kaput. Ive also done tests, and any weapon below 1t is impossible to make super lethal (regardless of composition, you just dont have the mass to induce enough forces/torques to tear the joints apart on a properly strutted craft, best you can hope for is doing damage to weaker parts, or destroying a panel or two here and there (wing armor is another story, against that even a 1 ton shell is able to do damage if you aim it right).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, one thing ive learned after experimenting with various armor setups, is that wings are very underrated but can be superior to the structural panels for certain applications. For example the barrel (the thing that stored a large number of shells in the front of ships, similar to the drek series style) can be made of wings (as a direct hit to that area will more likely then not take out the barrel AND the ammo inside it, regardless of what you use to armor said barrel. Same for things like auxillary systems, stuff thats non-essential. Actually i place most non-essentials outside the hull (or farther away from teh core), it acts as pseudo spaced armor, and if i have to take hits, id very much rather tank a hit to some non-essential crap then loose valuable parts of my ship (the loss of spaced junk actually slows/stops many enemy projectiles saving my inner core from destruction).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter messing around, ive swapped large amounts of teh armor in my frigate into this type of armor, as its lighter and larger (now the primary missile bay is longer allowing me to bring a total of 16 missiles instead of the previous 12). I still keep the core and inners as structural panels, but the outer layer is now supplemented via wings, and it also helps vs Ibeams to a certain degree, and ofc using those largest ones you dont gain too much in terms of part counts, and depending on who you ask, wings may or may not look nicer then panels. Im also reclassifying ships and making many redundant/ect. My new corvettes actually use the new frigate hull made with heavy wings, and teh frigates themselves use structural panels (i consider a frigate to be similar to a corvette in size and general role except for better armor/guns and less mobility).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-07T00:16:30Z\u0022 title=\u002203/07/2015 12:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astecarmyman","CreatedById":65422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T03:32:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022panzer1b\u0022 data-cite=\u0022panzer1b\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDepends, my frigate class ships use almost 100% structural panels, and have medium quality armor protection (not immune to ibeams, but by no means are ibeams super effective just aiming at midsection.

My Tripedoes use wheels to improve lethality, but they are EXTREMELY lightweight, and thus suffer the problem of having to rely on impact damage, and not overloading enemy frame. This makes them ideal precision weapons, easily capable of obliterating any engine (provided i can 1 hit it and 2 dont get screwed by physics derping and exploding my entire missile for no reason with no dmg to enemy ship). As for my other primary weapon, i use kinetic drones, which i consider somewhat unique in that they are purely powered by RCS thrusters, and are low velocity, but absurdly accurate, able to hit a single probe core or the like with ease, and are reuseable a large percentage of teh time. Ofc against any armor they are worthless, so not a anti-capital ship weapon. Most of my ships carry 10ish Tripedo-S and 2 drones, but i do swap stuff around when needed. My new missile frigate though has like 30 ibeams (just simplistic 4 engines short ibeam), so id like to test if thats just useless or actually viable (i mean 30 bloody ibeams have to do something). I also use Tribeam missiles, whcih are heavier/more engines then the firgates ibeam missile spam, but tend to make little sense from a part count perspective, and i usually stick to just the classical long or short ibeam with sepatrons fired in larger quantities, or my relatively recently developed Tripedo-S or kinetic drones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, im pretty close to having a fiull complement of ships, and id be glad to have a battle then, and see how bad my designs really are \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E (only so much i can prove shooting at em myself).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zamovinar","CreatedById":127282,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T04:38:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EA \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMaelstrom Alpha\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E and\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E Tank\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E after doing a beachead and landing at \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022Hawk Island\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E near \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003ESparrowhawk\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E during the\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E Second Krakenary War.
