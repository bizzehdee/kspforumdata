Most of the experiments would have still succeeded, since they were made to be multirole. Multirole as a microwave, to be exact. Sarcasm?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs sarcasm unethical? Sarcasm, of the ancient greek \u00C3\u00C6\u2019\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B1\u00C3\u00C2\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00BA\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B1\u00C3\u00C6\u2019\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00BC\u00C3\u00C5\u2019\u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u0161 / sarkasmos; designates an ironic mockery, a jest that puts its target in derision. It is biting, even bitter and hurtful. It can be considered as a form of \u0022spicy\u0022 irony, which consists of saying the opposite of what we think, while making it understood that we are doing so. Sarcasm is harder to detect than irony. In effect, being sarcastic is saying the opposite of what one thinks, without showing it, hence being deceitful. Now, I would like to address that the view of sarcasm as being rude is cultural, to me. In the U.S, it is widely considered extremely rude to be sarcastic in dialogue with another, whereas in Europe, France most exceptionally, sarcasm is regarded as being witty. The question is linked to ethics though, which is an \u0022applied\u0022(if i may) field of philosophy. Ethic is situated in correlation with the ethical triangle (I want, I can, I must), with ethics, ideas aren\u0027t black or white, they are applied to corresponding situations, ethics are linked to reality. I would say that sarcasm can be quite ethical to use in the case that you are familiar with its target and he is familiar with you. Sarcasm is used at a target for a goal, the important ethical dilemna lies here: \u0022I want to use this bellicose strategy to get my point across with that particular target, should I? Must I use it to get the effect I want or can I go another way?\u0022 Should the target be novice, or amateur, and you use sarcasm to show the weakness of that target\u0027s question, or answer, than you need to know that targetting the person\u0027s intellect will be beneficial to the overall argument. Inherent with sarcasm is the idea of deceit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaelumEtAstra","CreatedById":109360,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-08T02:04:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E9/10, I admire your bravery, but you probably won\u0027t get a response from these forums.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tkw","CreatedById":142638,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-08T03:15:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E10/10\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou\u0027re Overheating your profile pic\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UnionPacific1983WP","CreatedById":140982,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-08T03:51:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EX/10 ok\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-08T05:16:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat happened to the trains? 0/10\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceplaneAddict","CreatedById":149322,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-08T05:19:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E10/10.
