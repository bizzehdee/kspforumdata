It\u0027s a bit more of a logic puzzle than a proper \u0022riddle\u0022 as such, but hopefully it\u0027s still within bounds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany years ago, two countries were engaged in a sort of undeclared war. They never clashed directly -- there would have been too much to lose on either side -- so the conflict, such as it was, was waged mainly by spies and saboteurs trying to steal each others\u0027 secrets and muddle one anothers\u0027 secret projects to gain the advantage. Both countries were fairly well matched, up until one country sent their best field agent behind the lines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis agent had been a veteran military intelligence officer of many years, and he was always very careful to keep his cover secure. He based himself out of a small country farmhouse, and sent his messages home through a cleverly-disguised transmitter. Every weekend, he would go into the city to buy groceries; while he was there, he would receive the information for his next transmission from his contact, who would slip it into one of his two grocery bags as he walked to the bus stop for the bus that would take him to the gas station a few miles from his home. The path to the bus stop led him past a playground in a public park, and so he quickly became a familiar face to the children; they would call out to him and wave, and he would wave back with his free hand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs was mentioned, the agent was a very clever and careful man. Nevertheless, he was eventually captured because he had made a very small mistake, one so small that even he thought nothing of it until the man who first spotted this mistake called it to his attention during the interrogation. What was the slip-up that gave him away?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is not an open-ended riddle; there is a certain answer I\u0027m looking for, and all the clues for it should be contained in the text of the story, though it might take a bit of thought to link them all together correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-21T23:55:50Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2014 11:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Specialist290\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFixing minor inconsistency.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-21T23:41:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome inconsistencies bother me, but I don\u0027t see how they would catch him up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA school playground shouldn\u0027t be all that busy on a weekend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo grocery bags but he has a free hand; you\u0027d expect one in each hand to balance the load, assuming plastic bags.
