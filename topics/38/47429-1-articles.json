Everyone loves them, but there\u0027s a few things we should follow to ensure that everyone can play along, understand, and, most importantly, have fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#7D4900;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHave Some Extra Rules!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want people to be able to play your game, you must add a set of rules so everyone can know how to join. Rules can be basic, overly complex rules can alienate potential players. Simply explaining the mechanics and limitations of the game is sufficient. If there is a scoring system, ensure you explain how it works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#0D004C;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFollow the Forum Rules\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother thing to remember when you make a forum game is that they also need to follow the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/guidelines/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EForum Guidelines\u003C/a\u003E! Most importantly, make sure your game does not involve any elements from rule 2.2. Additionally, make sure your game won\u0027t turn into a chat thread as those become incredibly hard to moderate for us. One of the points not to forget is 2.2 j) roleplay. The distinction between roleplaying and playing a regular game is when you start acting on the behalf of something fictional. For example, if the game is a board game looking like Risk, roleplaying would be posting as if you were a part of the country you control. If you are not sure whether or not your thread is against a rule, you should PM a member of the Moderation Team, that way we can recommend alternatives to you if it does indeed break a rule.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#790000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERefrain from Spamming\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nForum games tend to grow large threads very quickly, so it\u0027s best for everyone if you don\u0027t spam the game threads. Avoid derailing the game by switching the topic or posting simple chat in the middle of the game. Most games will also have users reply to each other with the game element, so don\u0027t reply many times in a row to yourself, it simply kills the fun for everyone else.\u00A0 A good rule of thumb is to post no more than twice in a row in a game.\u00A0\u00A0 Games are more fun with multiple people, don\u0027t play by yourself.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#4B0049;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDon\u0027t Forget to Have Fun!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs they say by themselves, forum games are meant to be fun. There\u0027s no need to become heated and angry over such a thing. If you have a problem with someone\u0027s behaviour/post/thread, simply report it using the Forum\u0027s report system.\u00A0 Remember though, the moderators are not referees of the game rules, the only rules they follow are the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/guidelines/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EForum Guidelines\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0 If there is a dispute over the game rules, it\u0027s usually best to work it out amongst yourselves before calling in a moderator.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#005E20;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA Short List of Prohibited Game-Types\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOver time, a few types games have proven themselves to be too hard to moderate or to cause too many problems.
