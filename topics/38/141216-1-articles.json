I think it\u0027s a good alternative, but this stuff is obvious fake.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirstly, carrying around a nuclear reactor in your car is a bit...dangerous.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRun one 8 grams of fuel for 100 years, you say? The average horsepower of a car is around 200hp, or about 150 kW. Over 100 years of 1 hour trips per day, around 150*1*365*100 = 5.5GW of energy required. Now they\u0027re using a turbine, which is about 80% efficient, requiring about 7gW of heat from steam. And they\u0027re heating the steam with damn LASERS, which only have around 40% efficiency, meaning we need a total of 17GW of heat from the thorium. And this is assuming a magical heat-to-laser device!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a breeder thorium produces about 80tJ, or around 22kWh, per kg. Even without doing any maths the 8 grams claim is bogus. To go on a 1-hour trip you would need about 7kg of thorium, worth around $560. To run the system for 100 years, you would need nearly 800 tonnes of thorium, worth $64 million. 8 grams would only get you around 4 seconds of full power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPetrol has an energy density of 46mJ per kg. Their claims about how much energy there is in it compared to petrol is even fake.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what junk have you found on teh interwebz?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
