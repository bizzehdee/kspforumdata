Aside from that, not bad, although (provided what i see is the only ship core), its very vulnurable as MK-3 hull, while great mid-range armor, is not going to work against any accuract hits (if the mk3 cargo bay is the actual skeleton, i bet i could kill that with a FK-100 micro-fighter using a SINGLE one of its micro-railguns, and i always have a 2nd shot if needed). Looks pretty nice, but i doubt itll hold up to actual enemy fire (unless there is some hidden spine that i cant see in the screenie made of 80m/s parts).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, i think ive actually discovered how to massively lower lag, without actually lowering part counts all that much. I believe large numbers of engines exponentially increase lag on any vessel, much more then adding another part such as a girder or wing. I accidentally discovered this when i compare my Sk-CRV-I 3rd and 4th generation, the 4 has less ibeams in the front, and it barely lags at all, and the 3rd gen is way more slow, and it really gets unbeareably laggy in atmo when trying to get it to orbit using the rocket i made for it. The part count is slightly higher on the 3rd gen, but it also has more engines, way more so then the newer vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning of this, im redesigning all my craft, railguns will be replaced by a equal part count weapon that has only one engine and performs similarly, it has less accel, but it becomes a matter of firing at longer ranges (not an issue if you have MK1 inline cockpits to aim with), and as a bonus it actually attains much higher velocity at extreme ranges (too bad that engine was nerfed, 30kn of thrust was amazing back when it had that much not to mention better ISP). Only medium rail-cannons will stay as is (2 seps and a long ibeam, since there is no 0.6m engine powerful enough to beat 2 seps and even with 2 seps the acceleration isnt exactly great).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, apparently spamming RCS thrusters also adds to lag, a single engine is better then multiple RCS engines in terms of lag (although im still gonna keep some KDrone-Ms as they are really really good if you have good aim). Time to redo the weapons on all my ships, less engines means i can bring more weapons in even with a higher part count (300 parts with half the engines is way less laggy then even 250 parts with alot of engines).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOhh and now i avoid ion engines like the plague, i had a ship with ~200 parts, 100 of them being ion engines, and with this new realization, i think i know why it lagged so bloody badly (couldnt explain why my craft that had excessive ion engine numbers were so bloody laggy compared to other higher part count ships). More then one engine for redundancy is a must, but 100 engines is an instant guaranteed lagfest even if you make the whole ship low on parts total.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, i need to do some research, do struts add as much lag as say another part? DO fuel lines cause lag? Does having large numbers of fuel tanks cause lag? Im guessing that it may be parts that have to use fuel/produce thrust that mostly add to the lagginess, but i have to actually test this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"8bitgammers","CreatedById":108555,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-30T18:25:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022panzer1b\u0022 data-cite=\u0022panzer1b\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou need to upgrade ur resolution of screenies (when u take screenshots just up ur settings a bit, even if it gets laggier).
