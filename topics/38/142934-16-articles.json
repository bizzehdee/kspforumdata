I hate that I have to put on the moderator duties a second time to deal with an issue that I feel is starting to happen more and more. The world has changed a lot in the past few years. And I also am trying to keep in mind this is a game thread where the object is to borrow the goals and rules from other games. But one of the things we\u0027ve never allowed on the forum is gratuitous violence and the promotion of such violence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith that in mind and in today\u0027s sensitive environment and because we have a forum here that needs to be kept at a PG-13 level for various reasons, let\u0027s keep the comments promoting gratuitous violence at a minimum. So, from this point forward, let\u0027s not make threats to do bodily harm to any more forum members in this game thread, even in jest, as some people may find such talk disturbing - and not just our younger members, either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, keep in mind that two of the forum guidelines we all agreed to follow when we set up our accounts kinda cover gratuitous violence:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:80px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EForum guideline 2.2c: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 style=\u0022font-size:10.5pt;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EC\u003Cem\u003Eontent unsuitable for children or younger audiences, e.g. nudity, sexually suggestive or explicit images, excessive violence, gore and recreational drugs.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:80px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EForum guideline 2.2d: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 style=\u0022font-size:10.5pt;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EInsults and threats, stalking, bullying or any other behavior construed to be of a potentially rude, slanderous, accusatory, combative or otherwise harassing nature to/of another person;\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, anyway, let\u0027s please keep from bringing in various threats to stab, cut, poke, burn, mutilate, or otherwise harm one another, even in jest.
