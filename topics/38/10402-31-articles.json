Although I do love the Gauntlet level, it does not make any sense to use a level that was never part of the plot.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E However there is a belief that Mobius 1 is Galm 1, some years later, that it was a nightmare Galm 1 had... it\\\u0027s something for the viewers imagination, there is no set thought, and some people (like me) don\\\u0027t really care. \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E And yes this is off topic.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E The point is that the gauntlet, it\\\u0027s not used to confirm anything, it\\\u0027s a bonus level and if it\\\u0027s used for the plot, it\\\u0027s up to the viewers thoughts like a cliffhanger.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E But I worship Mobius 1. Even more than Jebediah Kerman. Excuse my exaggeration.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E I predicted someone would of brought Ace Combat into the subject, and I also predicted that that is the exact moment I would get pissed (though this is my fault) off because someone said I didn\\\u0027t do my research on a plot. I hate it when someone does that to me, because if I cared, I\\\u0027d read everything on it. And to say it is confirmed that Mobius One would be flying in an F-22 after operation Katina and finish it, and all of a sudden get\\\u0027s owned by Galm 1 and die like a dog, but with burning jet fuel, who\\\u0027s idea is that? No offense, but did you really have to say that? I mean that\\\u0027s not really good to think about, because that\\\u0027s just bad, just flat out bad. You can believe it, but out of guessing that is something you should really keep to yourself, I\\\u0027m very sorry for saying this but you have wrecked Ace Combat for me so much I can\\\u0027t even look at an airplane anymore.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E Someone say that the above is not true, because of it is, that just pants sh\\*tingly sucks for Mobius One to die like that, by another person we played as. Two nameless and speechless characters who are meant for war, and characters we control in two video games (zero and 4) almost all of us love because of there silence, and then have Galm 1 shoot down Mobius One, let alone having them encounter each other as part of the main plot is not good for my brain. To me it\\\u0027s like a lesser version of Rule34. It ain\\\u0027t porn of the two characters, but it is something along the line of that.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E Sorry if I pissed you off, but for the love of Jebediah Kerman. I mean, if Galm is better than Mobius, fine but people still debate about who\\\u0027s better, and it\\\u0027s very kind for them to shut up about it and I don\\\u0027t mind if Galm is better. But being told that Mobius just died while flying home from the last level in operation katina? At the hands of Galm? Then saying this non-canon level is part of the plot?\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E That\\\u0027s just not right. I\\\u0027m terribly sorry, but Ace Combat is my Star Wars. And thinking about the above just makes me feel terrible.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E I mean if you look at the fifth trivial part in this wiki page, it makes for a far better plot:\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E [http://acecombat.wikia.com/wiki/Mobius_One#Trivia](http://acecombat.wikia.com/wiki/Mobius_One#Trivia)\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E Sorry, but please don\\\u0027t mention that again. I don\\\u0027t read many book, I read more technical stuff like documentaries like all my aerospace pal\\\u0027s in this forum. But you just mind raped me. If you were trolling, I would have a stiff drink with you, and I\\\u0027d pay for the drinks because you have more victory over me than what victory a magnifying glass has over ants under the sun.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E Again, sorry. But that\\\u0027s just not a good history. If we say Galm 1 shooting down Mobius 1 and it\\\u0027s part of the plot, you better have a good reason. But As a cold person myself, what you said is nearing absolute Zero.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E I mean, look what you did to me!\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/EWnIi2pUx3g?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Bioman222","CreatedById":30364,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-10T14:00:04Z","Content":"![02-antimatter_low_.jpg](https://cache.gizmodo.com/assets/images/8/2010/06/02-antimatter_low_.jpg)\n\nAntimatter ;P"},{"CreatedByName":"Imandreas","CreatedById":18071,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-10T15:21:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Antimatter?\n\u003E \n\u003E INVALID!\n\u003E \n\u003E ![rock06.jpg](http://academic.emporia.edu/aberjame/garden/rock06.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kreuzung","CreatedById":21035,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-10T15:43:49Z","Content":"Crush the stone with a sword!\n\n![trig_run_ori.gif](http://www.mintsphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/trig_run_ori.gif)\n\n(\u002B1 if you know where that sprite is from)"},{"CreatedByName":"Phoenix Aerospace","CreatedById":26120,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-10T16:52:01Z","Content":"![shield.jpg](http://www.ashleygale.co.uk/dat/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/shield.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kreuzung","CreatedById":21035,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-10T16:58:14Z","Content":"The knight can easily crush a shield\n\n![char_run.gif](http://www.mintsphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/char_run.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Imandreas","CreatedById":18071,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-10T17:33:35Z","Content":"Melt sword, post results:\n\n\u003E ![flamethrower.jpg](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_pPsuc9rvU4Y/S-nZaYfhbnI/AAAAAAAABlg/VqXK-eqXd_4/s1600/flamethrower.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"madspy","CreatedById":24257,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-10T17:50:56Z","Content":"![BlessedFlamingSword.gif](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_MFZ5NRcGvQ/TrFCjq8I78I/AAAAAAAAAD8/ryJ4vuQW0_I/s400/BlessedFlamingSword.gif)\n\nWhoops.
