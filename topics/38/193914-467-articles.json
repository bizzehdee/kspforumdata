The reason such threads were no longer allowed was that it separated a section of the community off in one little corner of the forum, where a lot of activity could happen, but unless a moderator happened to also be a fan of whatever the thread was about, that thread could go on for months with no moderator checking in at all, sometimes resulting in all sorts of problems. This announcement was adopted as part of the official community rules and we know it today as rule \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/guidelines/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E2.2l\u003C/a\u003E. You might notice that Ted\u0027s announcement also says that the same rule applied to chat threads.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, you may be wondering, \u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022Hey! Isn\u0027t this kind of a chat thread?\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E And well, yes, the answer is that it \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E a chat thread. The moderators had a long discussion about this at the time the thread was started and we all agreed that, according to rule 2.2l, we should shut the thread down. So why didn\u0027t we? Well, basically because we\u0027re not mindless and emotionless robots, and we could see that you were having fun. The community isn\u0027t as busy as it used to be, and we felt that it would be nice to let you all have your fun and see how it went. In short, \u003Cstrong\u003Ewe made an exception and allowed this thread to continue as an experiment\u003C/strong\u003E to see if we really had to enforce rule 2.2l.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow has it gone? Well, this is where the hard part comes in. Some of you will know that the moderators have had to step in here quite a few times. As an example, one of the things that keeps coming up is that things get posted here that belong somewhere else. For example, KSP content should be posted in a relevant KSP thread, such as the \u0022What did you do in KSP today?\u0022 thread. Some other subjects probably belong in the Lounge or the Science and Spaceflight sections. But it keeps getting posted here, and of course it does, because it\u0027s a chat thread, and you are all fans of KSP and perhaps you\u0027re developing an interest in space flight and science. But by posting things like that in here, what is happening is that you are creating a second community - a private little club within the regular KSP community, and subcultures are really not a good idea for a forum like ours because it splits the community, in addition to causing moderation problems like Ted talked about in that post.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo we wanted to let you know what\u0027s going through our minds. We know you\u0027re having fun, we know you have a goal, we know that some of you have already invested a lot of time in this thread and made friends in here. This thread has required an unusually high amount of moderation and we just don\u0027t have the resources, time and energy to keep it up, but we also don\u0027t want to disappoint you all. We have not yet decided whether or not to close this thread, but we want you to know that it has been under consideration for some time. Please don\u0027t get too attached, because we really might have to close it some day. It really all depends on how well you can all keep the thread friendly, avoid arguments, keep KSP content in the proper place (not here!) etc., so we don\u0027t have to keep stepping in to moderate this thread.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, we want you to have fun, but we also have to look after you and the rest of the community. We hope you understand.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: locked for a short while so the message doesn\u0027t get buried completely.
