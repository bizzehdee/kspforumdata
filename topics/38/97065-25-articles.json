Thanks to zekes, r4pt0r and megatiger for making things a bit less one-sided and more entertaining, and to Frozen_Heart for starting the game. Hopefully some reputation was sent to some under\u003Cstrong\u003Erep\u003C/strong\u003Eresented modders and other contributors as you reloaded your rep cannons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomeone with moderator powers negatively repped a poster who had no positive rep, causing a red pip to appear. This sparked a thread in the Kerbal Network forum about negative reputation in general. The discussion made the moderation team curious about how negative reputation worked, so it was decided to make a dummy account for testing (testing the forum software for edge cases and exploitability is one of the lesser-known moderator duties). The name Green Iron Crown was given to it (inspired by a comment from zekes in the negative reputation thread), and we tested negatively repping it. However, there only being a few moderators we could only down rep GIC by a few dozen points, so we got an administrator to alter his rep down by 2000 points (similar to the inflated positive rep of the SQUAD account and the famous kerbals). The negative-repping ability has since been disabled for all users, including moderators. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen it was decided to reveal GIC for comedic value in the Negative Rep thread, which then spontaneously spawned a forum game from Frozen_Heart (the thread you\u0027re reading now). This made us curious to see how quickly the community could negate all that negative rep so the thread was moved to a part of the forums where repping was possible, and the rest is history.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks everyone for all the fun, but all good things must come to an end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"}]}
