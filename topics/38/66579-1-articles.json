Whether you want to be a rocket engineer, a mission controller or an Astronaut, KASRA is the place for you. Using a combination of KMP, Mechjeb and Telemachus, we can recreate the real process of a daring space mission, from the design of the rocket to take off! Check out the website for more information.
