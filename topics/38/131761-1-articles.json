Barring distortions due to rapid rotation, the horizon is a virtually perfect sphere, so on a small scale like yours it appears perfectly flat, covering about half the sky.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYour civilization\u0027s astronomers debate at length over the nature of the universe: since the sky is on one side completely black, and on the other filled with points of light, it is easy to conclude that you live near the edge of the universe. So which side is the universe and which is the void? Given that one side seems to be full of stuff, which some scientists surmise includes other tiny dust-grain planets, clearly that side is the universe, and the black void on the other side is nothing.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut then they discover the technology to measure tiny variations in gravity and movement over long distances - perhaps a gravitational wave telescope \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E They peer out into the sky and notice increasing redshift over greater distances, indicating that the universe is expanding. They also notice that the black void behind them is ever so slowly shrinking away (due to Hawking radiation), and as it does so it recedes faster and faster. The prevailing hypothesis is that the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMeasuring differences in gravitational forces and other physical laws on opposite sides of the dust grain world suggests to the scientists that the laws of physics are the same throughout the universe, so they surmise that if the grain were farther from the edge, the same basic observations would still apply - the universe is expanding, it expands at an accelerating rate, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe analogy isn\u0027t perfect; for example, at the moment Sagittarius A* is actually growing by absorbing energy from the cosmic microwave background.

Why does an infinite and always existing multiverse sound more logical than an infinite and eternal Creator? If the multiverse was infinite, that would mean that not only is there another me out there somewhere, there are in fact, an infinite number of mes out there.
