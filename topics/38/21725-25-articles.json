I\u0027ve travelled an unimaginable distance at an equally insane speed in a flying tin can to an alien world. This world is so amazingly strange and desolate and yet it\u0027s stunning. I think of the people who took leaps like these in times past. Childhood idol\u0027s really as they are for many, but none have taken a leap quite so large. Quite literally following in the footsteps of some of the greatest people who ever lived, and then going even father. I can feel they\u0027re spirts with me in this moment, along with those of the millions and billions of people all with me in this one moment in time where humanity finally leaves it\u0027s cradle. I think of my place in all this, out of all the people on Earth, billions and billions of incredible people, it was ME. I feel an incredible sense of honor to be the representative of humanity in this moment. I look to a mounted camera on the elevator that lowered me down to the red surface of the planet and wave to the world I was once apart of, a wave no one will see for 15 whole minutes.\u00A0 With nothing left to do I finally begin to move forward, all of my life, all of everything, converging on this singular moment. I feel the dust beneath my feet give way as I walk onto the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the awe of the situation slightly subsiding I realize that I don\u0027t have anything to say, what would this historic moment be without some memorable quote for the ages? And worse still; my joints feel like they just came out of one of those annoying family road trips! I do my best to stretch my back and legs in the bulky suit and then it happened; the quote materializes in my head, it\u0027s a little on the nose but it\u0027s powerful and most importantly it will do the job.
