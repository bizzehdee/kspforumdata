It can be played here: [http://voar.io/](http://voar.io/)\n\n**Game Instructions**\n\nTo play the game, you only need to use the left mouse button. Every time you click, it send you a little more prograde. Its like a tiny burst of delta-v every time you click. You\u0027ll get the hang of it pretty quickly.\n\nThe point of this game is to take a screenshot of your highest score on Voar. (when you crash, your score is still displayed on the bottom, hit \u0022print screen\u0022 to take a screenshot)\n\nPost your screenshot here, and I will keep a leaderboard on this post. There isn\u0027t really a way to prove that you actually took the screenshot though, as your name isn\u0027t displayed on screen. If you wanna prove it was you, have another tab open in your browser with the KSP forums in it. That would help a lot. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nPlease remember that this is a **friendly** competition, so no rampant bragging or putting others down. \n\n**Leaderboard:**\n\nAlso, to moderators, I wasn\u0027t entirely sure where to put this, it isn\u0027t a KSP challenge, so I put it in forum games. Hope I didn\u0027t put it in the wrong place. ![:sealed:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-27T19:32:50Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2015 07:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Endersmens**"},{"CreatedByName":"jake9039","CreatedById":122602,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T19:19:53Z","Content":"how do I play it?"},{"CreatedByName":"Endersmens","CreatedById":80723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T19:33:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E how do I play it?\n\nUpdated OP with instructions. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Overfloater","CreatedById":94031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T03:16:54Z","Content":"Oh i cant believe it returned!
