Its jet-black glossy finish cannot be scratched even if you should take a titanium-alloy blade to it, and the paint job is known to quaff the blood of anything living careless enough to come into contact with it. You were never told any of this, however. Putin merely ushered you inside with a pilot he considered disposable, and watched as your maiden flight tore your very soul to smithereens. Your screams were never heard, for you never had time to utter any.
