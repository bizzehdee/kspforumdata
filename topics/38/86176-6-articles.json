It knows this because it knows where it isn\u0027t. By subtracting where it is from where it isn\u0027t, or where it isn\u0027t from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn\u0027t, and arriving at a position where it wasn\u0027t, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn\u0027t, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn\u0027t, the system has acquired a variation, the variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn\u0027t. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe missile guidance computer scenario works as follows. Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn\u0027t, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn\u0027t, or vice-versa, and by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn\u0027t be, and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T21:14:50Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 09:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mythbusters844\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;","CreatedById":78047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T21:21:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Efact:\u003C/span\u003E we\u0027re differents.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Efun:\u003C/span\u003E And that\u0027s why and because we\u0027re the same.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T21:25:36Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 09:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by WinkAllKerb\u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E(reversi reverso, slighty better) but work both also\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skyler4856","CreatedById":76452,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T00:53:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWoopity doo\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBurning jet fuel cant melt steel beams.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ChrisSpace","CreatedById":140622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T00:55:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EElephants communicate with a \u0027laguage\u0027 that includes a word for \u0027human\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ChrisSpace","CreatedById":140622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T07:29:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJellyfish kill 10 times as many people as sharks do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T16:39:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYuri Gargarin was, in fact, not the first man to orbit the Earth.
