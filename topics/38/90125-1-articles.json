It goes like this: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, I would say something like, \u0022I have a book. You jelly?\u0022 And then the next person would say something like, \u0022No, I\u0027m not because I have a flying book. You jelly?\u0022 The next person would then try to one-up the flying book, and so on. For example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1st Person: \u0022I have a couch. You jelly?\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2nd Person: \u0022Nope, because my couch has a built in flatscreen TV.

For example, the first person says, \u0022I have a million dollars! You jelly?\u0022 The second person could then say, \u0022No, because I have a job that pays me 10,000 dollars an hour. You jelly?\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first person to reply gets to start. (See, I\u0027m nice.
