It may not be as simple (low on parts) as the mid generation models, and it defenetely isnt as effective vs multiple smaller vessels, but it eats capital ships for breakfast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdvantages:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERelatively mobile, with 3 nukes pushing ~65 tons, its not the best out there, but it will outturn and outrun most of the mainstream heavies on this thread that dont use LFO and thus have garbage range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDecent armor against guided phasing rounds such as the popper-H, the older missile zeke developed, my own tripedo-S and tripedo-M, and zamo\u0027s tirepedoes. Its by no means immune to these and other weapons, but it is very hard to kill the craft with a single hit from anything that is not excessively heavy (~10t weapons will kill it, like anything else for that matter).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERelatively compact making it a difficult target compared to most larger ships, especially if looking at its front/rear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnough firepower to simply make it go away (or turn into a cloud of debris). With 4 Tripedo-Ms (export version is armed with popper knockoffs and not Tripedo-Ms as id rather keep em to myself until i use em at least in one battle, but these are similarish in effects), it can wipe out anything ive shot at, although some larger vessels do require multiple shots to actually bring down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEffective against fighters too due to optional forward facing railguns (can be swapped for any 0.6m weapon).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWeapons are fully modular, you can fit most 1.2m weapons in the side bays, and you can fit most 0.6m weapons in the forwards slots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooks good (thats questionable, but i think it looks pretty good).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EONLY 270 parts with all weapons, and ~170 parts unarmed, and lowers the suicide rate of those with potato comps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eincredibly lightweight given its combination of armor and firepower. At 65 tons, you can easily bring 2 of these for every one larger 120 or so ton warship, and it only takes one of these to kill said 120t warship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDisadvantages:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtremely vulnerable engines. And by extremely vulnurable, it means anything powerful that phases in and actually hits the rear of the ship will most likely destroy all 3 engines that are clustered and have no bulkheads or strong protection. This is honestly the achilles heel of the entire vessel, yes its hull is quite strong, but if you cant move, what good is a fully intact hull. The engines are also exposed from teh back partially, making fighters capable of destroying engines with precise shots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWeapons are somewhat vulnurable, easy to knock out with accurate hits to the exposed bays. The one good thing here is that the weapons are spread out throughout, making any one shot extremely unlikely to knock out more then 2 of the primary torps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESubpar range. Well, maybee not bad as its ~2200dV, more then enough for anything that isnt interplanetary, but kinda nothing compared to many vessels on here that have in excess of 4K, some even 10K.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbove average vulnerability to weaker weapons, since the armor is rather minimalistic. Compared to say a drek or other heavy warship, the SK-CRV-IA1 is easier to kill or neutralize with heavy railguns, and doesnt quite have that immune to weak weapons feel that many heavier designs do. Its not that bad, but itll die to ~10 or so well aimed railgun shots, something other ships could pretty much ignore. A future version is being worked on that adds another armor layer fixing this issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomewhat susceptible to shrapnel since it has no dedicated internal bulkheads. many weapons that break into chunks will tear through the interior and take at least a few fuel tanks with em. For a single shot this is often irrelevant, but multiple hits, even if they dont \u0022kill\u0022 the corvette by splitting it in half, will probably leave it with little to no fuel, very low maneuverability (without all 6 reaction wheels it turns kinda badly), and probably even destroy most if not all engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload is the usual spot, in my craft repository on the AKS company page (clicky the signature image thing and scroll down for link to the mediafile folder, then go to AKS ships directory and its the one called SK-CRV-IA1 Export).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the armor is patented AKS technology, while i have nothing against everyone learning from my ships, i would prefer not to see everyone running around with carbon copies of this thing \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E (provided its even good enough for that.....).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-09T06:04:25Z\u0022 title=\u002211/09/2015 06:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alphasus","CreatedById":147173,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-09T09:07:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022zekes\u0022 data-cite=\u0022zekes\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve got a new fighter if anyone wants to play....\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/H3pwtT8.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/H3pwtT8.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBd armory or stock?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-09T09:39:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s stock and BD armory. this plane will literally fly inside of any other plane\u0027s turning radius and if you give it the room it\u0027ll accelerate to insane speeds.
