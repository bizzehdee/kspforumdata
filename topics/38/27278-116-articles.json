At the height of the winter floods, 65 km2 of land were under water. The reason for the flood was a combination of human and physical factors. Despite the area being prone to floods in the past, the floods were the most severe ever known here. No one was prepared for the extent of damage and havoc brought by the floodwater. Several villages and farms were inundated and hundreds of people had to be evacuated for several weeks. With the risk of flooding likely to increase in the future due to climate change, there is continued pressure on the government to invest in flood defences in order to protect areas at risk from flooding.

This continued into February 2014. The huge volume of water falling on saturated ground meant that both the Parrett and Tone rivers reached their bankfull capacity, forcing the rivers to flood. The physical characteristics of the Somerset Levels and Moors mean that flooding is generally a natural occurrence there. It is an area of low-lying farmland and wetlands situated between the Mendip and Blackdown Hills in central Somerset. This area forms the floodplain of the river Parrett and much of the area lies at sea level, or just a few metres above it. Thousands of years ago the area was covered by the sea, but now it is a landscape of rivers and wetlands. The land had been artificially drained, irrigated and modified to allow for agriculture, human settlement and wetland conservation. Today, it has become an area of social, economic and environmental importance. The area covers 650 km2 but has a low population density (that is, the number of people per km2 ). Despite its natural vulnerability, no one was prepared for the extent of flooding, or for the socio-economic and environmental impacts that followed (Figure 1). What caused the flooding on the Somerset Levels? A river flood happens when a fluvial channel bursts its banks and spills onto the surrounding floodplain. A floodplain is an area of low-lying ground adjacent to a river, formed mainly of river sediments and subject to flooding. A flood can last days, weeks or even months \u2013 the time depends on the river\u2019s ability to drain the floodwater. A flood event is often caused by a combination of human and physical factors. This was certainly true in the case of the Somerset Levels flooding. \u201CA flood event is often caused by a combination of physical and human factors.\u201D The most common cause of flooding is prolonged rainfall. In January 2014 in southern England there was 183.8 mm of rain, which is approximately 200% higher than average for that month (Figure 2). It was the wettest since records began in 1910. This intense downpour caused the ground to become saturated and led to the frequent over-topping of the Tone and Parrett rivers, creating a huge lake which covered 11500 ha. High tides and storm surges from the Bristol Channel (which has the second highest tidal range in the world) made the problem worse. The surge prevented the floodwater from being taken to the sea, and forced it to back up along the rivers across the Levels and the Moors. Many local people believe that the decision by the Environment Agency not to dredge the rivers was responsible for the floods. Silt washed up from the Bristol Channel and carried inland had clogged up the river channels, reducing their ability to store water. If the rivers had been dredged of this silt they would have been made wider and deeper. This would have increased their capacity to carry away the floodwaters. Changes in farming practices are also thought to have contributed to the floods. In the hills above the Levels, such as the Quantocks and Brendon Hills, many of the fields have been converted from grassland to maize (a fodder crop for cattle). This more intensively used land is less able to retain water and this causes surface runoff rather than the water being absorbed into the ground. Impacts of the Somerset floods The extensive flooding meant that the Somerset Levels soon made the national headlines. People travelled to the affected areas to see the \u25CF 549 GeoActive Series 27 Issue 2 Fig 549_01 Mac/eps/illustrator v15 s/s OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS Artist: David Russell Illustration Taunton Langport Somerton SOMERSET Glastonbury Bridgwater River Tone Bristol Channel River Parrett N 0 10 km Somerset Levels Areas under water, 11 January 2014 Key Figure 1 The extent of flooding across the Somerset Levels, January 2014 Source: Environment Agency 3 GEOACTIVE Flooding in the Somerset Levels, 2014 549 \u00A9 Oxford University Press 2016 GeoActive Series 27, Issue 2, January 2016 Extension floods for themselves (such people became known as \u2018flood tourists\u2019). While many of those living on the Levels had experienced some form of flooding in the past, no one was quite prepared for the scale of these floods. No one died, but there were personal tragedies. People had to witness their homes, possessions farmland and animals succumb to the floodwaters (Figure 3). There were many evacuations, and people had to seek temporary accommodation elsewhere while they waited anxiously for the floodwater to subside. Only then could they begin to salvage what was left of their homes. More than 600 homes and 6880 hectares of farmland were inundated with quickly rising waters, and entire villages were cut off after roads became unusable. In the village of Muchelney, for example, the residents\u2019 only way of leaving the island was via a boat which left every two hours (Figure 4). Isolated communities soon provided an opportunity for thieves: in January, 900 litres of fuel was stolen from a pumping station in Westonzoyland. By early February, there were reports of heating oil and quad bikes being stolen from homes of flood victims. Many of the main roads were closed, such as the A361 which links Taunton and Street. Trains were also disrupted on the Bristol line between Bridgwater and Taunton. The economic costs soon started to mount up. Fuel for emergency pumps used to reduce water levels in parts of flooded Somerset cost \u00A3200000 per week. Local businesses reported losses of more than \u00A31 million. According to \u2018Visit Somerset\u2019, the floods on the Somerset Levels cost the county\u2019s tourism industry \u00A3200 million. Farmers struggled to deal with flooded fields, ruined crops and the costs of moving livestock away from the affected areas. After nearly three months under millions of tonnes of water, much of the soil was now severely damaged. Standing water prevented oxygen getting to the Figure 3 Aerial view of a small village between Taunton and Yeovil on the Somerset Levels Source: \u00A9 SWNS/Alamy Figure 2 Rainfall anomaly map 1\u201328 January 2014 Source: \u00A9 Crown Copyright; Met Office 4 GEOACTIVE Flooding in the Somerset Levels, 2014 549 \u00A9 Oxford University Press 2016 GeoActive Series 27, Issue 2, January 2016 Extension land beneath, killing insects and destroying nutrients, making the ground toxic. Land scientists, known as agronomists, believe it may take up to two years to restore the soil chemistry and biology sufficiently to grow crops. Flood-hit home owners are likely to see their insurance premiums drastically increase in the future. Many people are now without insurance as they simply cannot afford to pay the premiums. Management and response \u201CThe response to the floods was rapid and well organised.\u201D The response to the floods was rapid and well organised, as to be expected in an economically developed country (Figure 5). The Met Office issued an advanced amber warning for heavy rain in South West England, informing the public to be prepared for significant flooding. Many residents were able to respond by using sandbags to protect their homes and by moving valuable items upstairs. One man even built a giant wall out of clay and soil around his house in the village of Moorland on the Somerset Levels, in a bid to protect it from rising floodwaters. The fire brigade visited hundreds of properties, helping those who had been affected, and rescue boats were deployed to help stranded people. In early February, rescue crews waded through Moorland on the Somerset Levels, knocking on doors and urging villagers to evacuate. Owners of around 80 homes complied\u00A0but about 30 other residents chose to remain (Figure 6). Extra police patrols were brought in to respond to increased crime. By the end of January, the army had been sent in with specialist equipment to help those in the affected areas by delivering food, transporting people and distributing sandbags. By 6 February, they were accompanied by 40 Royal Marines. At the height of the floods, 65 pumps were 24\u201331 December South West England is hit by storms.

This included 13 high-capacity pumps imported from the Netherlands. In the midst of the crisis, there was enormous local support for those affected by the floods. This was coordinated by the charity organisation FLAG (Flooding on the Levels Action Group). Volunteers organised fundraising, collected supplies to help those who had suffered, and made extensive use of social media via Facebook and Twitter to communicate news. \u201CThere was enormous local support for those affected by the floods.\u201D Future considerations Looking ahead to the future, a long-term plan was needed to reduce the frequency, duration and severity of flooding in the area. \u2018The\u00A0Somerset Levels and Moors Flood Action Plan\u2019 was commissioned by Environment Secretary Owen Paterson. It was compiled by Somerset County Council, the Environment Agency, residents and other interested parties. It included measures such as dredging, a tidal barrage, and extra permanent pumping sites \u2013 total cost \u00A3100 million. Ten million pounds was provided by the government, a further \u00A310 million came from the Department for Transport, and the Department for Communities and Local Government gave \u00A3500000. This formed part of a 20-year plan for a more sustainable future and gained the backing of Prime Minister David Cameron who stated: \u2018We cannot let this happen again\u2019. In November 2014, the Environment Agency (EA) kept its promise and completed the crucial 8 km dredge of the rivers Parrett and Tone, at a cost of \u00A36 million. This will certainly go some way to help protect homes and agricultural land from the effects of flooding. However, some critics argue that dredging alone is not the answer. To be successful it should be used alongside other forms of flood defence, such as flood relief channels \u2013 but at what cost? Can the government justify spending money on maintaining the dredging of the river Parrett when the socio-economic value is low? This is especially pertinent given the high population densities and the many urban settlements along the Thames river basin (South East of England) which are also in need of protection. Given the future implications of climate change, the South West region is likely to experience more heavy rain and more storm surges. According to the Met Office, sea levels around the UK are likely to rise by 11\u201316 cm by 2030. Investment in expensive hard engineering defences may prove to be unsustainable in the long term. A more sustainable option would be to allow some areas of the Levels to be set aside for flooding, with farmers compensated and home owners moved to higher ground. However, this is unlikely to be a popular option. Conclusion The harsh reality of the recent floods is that, over several decades, more people have put themselves at risk of flooding by occupying this low-lying floodplain. The growth of farming and settlement in the area can be attributed to the belief that flooding was under control. This was clearly not the case and it is therefore not surprising that the local people felt so let down. While the impacts of this flood were felt by many, they could have been far worse if it had not been for the effective and rapid response, from the emergency services, the army, and the local community. All of these can be depended on in an economically more developed country. The longer-term implications for the residents are likely to be the reality of higher insurance premiums and a struggle to sell their homes. \u2018I was mobilised to Moorland, one of the communities that was affected. When I arrived at the scene, it was like an apocalypse. I had never seen anything of this magnitude. All around there was floodwater. The Fire Service\u2019s first role was to prevent loss of life, so evacuations were the priority and then rescue, by boat, of people who were stranded. After this, the many different rescue agencies were put to work on the construction of temporary flood defences using sandbags and defence barriers. People had been notified well in advance, so only a limited number of people needed rescuing. The problem we encountered was that a number of people were reluctant to leave because they were afraid of looting, despite extra police being drafted into the area to help with security.\u2019 Figure 6 Extract from an interview with Phil Musgrove, a local firefighter 6 GEOACTIVE Flooding in the Somerset Levels, 2014 549 \u00A9 Oxford University Press 2016 GeoActive Series 27, Issue 2, January 2016 Extension Learning checkpoint \u25CF The Somerset Levels floods occurred during winter 2013/14 and were the most severe ever known to this area. \u25CF An inland lake was created covering 11500 ha which affected more than 600 homes and thousands of hectares of farmland. \u25CF It prompted a huge response from community to national level and led to a \u00A310 million flood protection investment.
