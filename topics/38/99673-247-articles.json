It\u0027s gonna be hard to top this one.\u003Cp\u003EMight not be the biggest revert in terms of a number change, but it sure is the biggest one in terms of pages rendered invalid. The furthest revert ever done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E601 - 414 = 187 pages. Over 1,870 posts, not counting the ones nulled by other reverts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs per rule #7, and the one minute limit for override, what Dman declared invalid was valid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game is still at \u003Cstrong\u003E34\u003C/strong\u003E, set by me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one is valid.

This is the biggest revert in game history in terms of pages nulled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Everyone likes a fresh start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the reasoning is right, Green wolf explicitly stated to ignore the post, therefore nulling it intentionally. I know it is an edit so there might be some fuzzyness in this, but the next poster was long after the edit (which was done within 3 minutes hence we don\u0027t see the edit time stamp) so it would be safe to assume that the fact it was nulled by an edit was not a problem. It would, if an edit was made after some other player post - and that is why I discourage editing. But this case doesn\u0027t seem like it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, what I am saying is, this revert is not valid, since the quoted post was explicitly nulled by the poster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, last correct number is 34\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Endersmens\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Endersmens\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDeu you\u0027re on the verge of being accused of purposefully causing mistakes to use as reverts later. Which is against the rules. It says not to purposefully make mistakes.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERules actually state that you are not supposed to make any mistake, at all. Intentional or unintentional doesn\u0027t matter (because I can\u0027t read minds). What happens if you break them? Well, your post gets nulled (do you expect me to send a SWAT team over?). Which mean it can be used as a point to revert as per rule 6, which allow errors, both intentional or unintentional to be reverted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if someone intentionally make errors as a point to revert...it is a valid strategy. Of course, in doing so you risk other players notice that error and use it before you can, thus messing up your plan.
