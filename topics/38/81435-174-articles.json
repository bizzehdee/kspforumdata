With some luck i can 2 shot the engine cluster off completely (as in no more ability to move unless there are some secret hidden engines inside the hull i havent noticed). I have yet been unable to neutralize it 100% with 4 shots from the SK-CRV-IA1. Still, as laggy as part counts of 800 are (its so painful to bring my measly 270 part ship near that), the cinematic appeal of seeing chunks shot off and not really destroying teh vessel entirely is amazing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/LCgtp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Still, considering its but a fraction of the size, weight, and more importantly part count, and that it usually takes all or most of the BASIL\u0027s firepower to actually kill one of my ships (A2 has backup engines up front so its not dead in the water if the rear is destriyed like this fight), its more then superior performance to mass/part count ratio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally the only killer problem is that its suceptible to this bug that allows a single long ibeam\u002B2 seps to delete the entire middle girder somehow. Its a very odd occurence (and i suspect most kills with ibeams are because of this bug), but past ~200m unguided stuff that you arent actually spectating to target will enable physics bugs and destroy stuff they should never be able to realistically. Try it yourselves, take a very basic ibeam with 2 seps, and fire from 400-500m away. if it doesnt phase through entirely which tends to happen alot, it has some chance of deleting parts of the craft and not actually knocking them off like the same ibeam at the same impact velocity would have done from point blank range (or if you are spectating it as it flies and impacts).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, 1.05 has FINALLY broken 100% my obsession with incredible dV fighters. Gone are the days where i have 40t fighters, since i really REALLY insisted on incredible dV (above 6000 minimum), with the new IRSU module that can fit on a fighter, i am more then content with 3000 dV and the ability to resupply on the majority of planets/locations (ofc EVE, Tylo, and a few other spots like Kerbin is still a waste of time for refueling on as you cant really SSTO from there well).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOhh, and capital ships are gonna be equipped with small fuel landers and internal IRSU support. I think a small aerospike powered lander thats under 10t will work nicely. Itll let be bring up a decent amount of ore that can then be used to refuel warships as needed, and it wont even be too many parts either! Heck, i might even get away with using fighters to refuel capital ships (since even now they have a generous amounf of fuel to get that 3000 dV i absolutely need to have to go to jool system from LKO directly, once there, i can land on laythe (or a moon) and refuel as desired.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe airplane stuff is meh as i was never into kerbin warfare (yeah its easy to get there and do stuff there, but its just gotten old whereas space/planetary combat is more fun for me. The IRSU is the BEST part in the entire game right now since it opens up the ability to actually refuel yourself on a semi or even extremely compact vessel. My HK-101A4 now has full IRSU support and still has a respectable 3000dV range, carrying 4 kinetic drones or 2 bombs and 2 drones.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium

I just developed a weapon that uses 2 recoilless aerospikes. The one in the front is set to like 95% thrust (so that it moves forward). This when fired (its 100% unguided) will come in nice and slow, and will just melt right through a ship\u0027s hull (assuming it doesnt outright instantly vaporize hull). Essentially its something that CANNOT be countered. Optimally used at ~50-150m range (for anything farther out and it will run out of fuel before melting through the target provided the velocity is low enough for it to not fly through target before hitting it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere needs to be a strict rule saying that using any form of engine thrust as an actual weapon is not allowed.

But if the thrust is close enough (and the weapon is going slow enough that it doesnt actually collide before it burns through), then you are looking at the hard counter to armor since its impossible to counter such a device (without actually evading it since it generally needs to be lowish velocity and even if igts fired from 200m out, same issue, you would have to actively evade it to counter it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least there is 1 good thing, stageable docking ports. Ive just lowered by part count for the most basic railgun (short ibeam \u002B 2 seps) from 4 to 3 parts by omitting the decoupler i usually had between the docking port and the weapon. This may not sound like a ig deal, but for those very few ships that are armed with liek 40 of those (alot of my pirate style warships use a massive and i mean massive high ammo count railgun battery onboard), 1 less part per missile can add up to ALOT of part count saved.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexanderTeaH","CreatedById":111209,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T17:15:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUpdated my profile pic\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, it\u0027s quite a bit less aggressive than my \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/37glaTS.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eprevious one\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E.

MK2 fuel tanks in particular are large and thus block alot of your ship, and their heat capacity is high enough that it takes time to burn through em. Pretty much anything that is heavy and has alot of heat capacity is good to have, and likewise, anything lightweight with low heat capacity is VERY bad, so avoid excessive spam of lightweight components such as the 1x1 structural panel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, you CANNOT and i mean CANNOT effectively defend against both flamethrower style weapons (like this), and also against kinetic weapons.

I know that multiplayer is most likely going to revolve around who can do better orbital maneuvers and has better thrust (actually with enough TWR you stand a good chance of dodging most guided weapons unless the shooter is crazy skilled and can lead a target moving in 3D (its not easy trust me, especially when the target can dynamically alter thrust, change direction of thrust, and angle themselves in various ways, ofc assuming they have enough TWR to work with here like 1.5 or higher), but regardless, i feel that ther eneeds to be a rule put in place prohibiting any form of \u0022flamethrowers\u0022 or other thruster based weapons.
