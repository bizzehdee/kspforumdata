It might lower the chances of critical damage, but if you are hit by a properly designed weapon as high enough velocity, not only will it most likely phase through and bypass your armor, but even if it doesnt its more likely then not going to transfer its kinetic energy and break the ship in half.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, there are still ways you can combat this, for example one thing ive started doing for most of my ships is making as much of the craft redundant. This means spread out your weapons hardpoints, engines, fuel tanks, probe cores, ect, so that the probability that even the most powerful missile can instantly destroy you is very low if not close to 0. The other option is making multiple layers of spaced armor that is thick enough to almost guaranteed shots wont phase through into your core. This is easier said then done, not to mention it requires MASSIVE amounts of parts, and is still not guaranteed to keep you from being 1 shot cut in half.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the double hull, ive been experimenting with the concept and ive come to a few conclusions. For one, against someone who knows where to aim, its still possible to get cut in half, and have the entire ship split into 2 or more pieces. There is simply no way nomatter what you do to guarantee you wont get 1 shotted. That said, strapping 2 ships together will give you the advantage (assuming each half is self sustaining) that you can always have at least half of the ship left alive after a catastrophic hit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethat said, ive found the ultimate tactic being disposeable ships that have above average firepower but weight very little, have useable but not insane dV, and most of all low part counts without making them useless in teh armor department. This is somewhat along the lines of a futuristic weapons program concept that was around a few years back, replacing the main battle tank with a high speed vehicle that had weakish armor, very powerful guns, and was much cheaper and lighter. the idea was that the most powerful weaponry could not be countered period regardless of armor schemes or tactics, so the idea was to make disposable vehicles that had the firepower to take down almost every enemy, were fast and thus hard to hit or outmaneuver, and worst case if they were lost the price tag wasnt a huge deal compared to conventional MBTs. ive pretty much started going this way with my own military gear, low part count, cheap, disposable, but still armed with enough weaponry to wipe out whatever the enemy brought into battle. that said, i do still armor my craft enough that they wont be wiped out by stuff liek Ibeams and smaller ordinance, as a capital ship shouldnt exactly be easy to kill with junk of that caliber.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe only real exception to the part count and simplicity rule are my tanks. for whatever reason i refuse to not have a turret on them, and a turret adds like 50 pats to an otherwise turret-less vehicle. Still, working on a tank destroyerish vehicle that should make more practical sense, lightweight, great firepower, and just armored enough to be somewhat tough to instakill.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Heckspress","CreatedById":8020,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T11:16:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022astecarmyman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022astecarmyman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Euploadin it today bruh.
