It can and will die to well placed RT-5\u002Bstructural panel but this is very rare, and usually the only way i can reliably kill it with weakish weapons is multiple shots that just overload the entire hull with subsequent hits. Its armor is more or less impossible to 1 shot vaporize with RT-5s or RT-10s that have just a basic impactor, more advcanced penetrators will destroy it, but with advanced penetrators the things become for all intents and purposes as effective as competitive weapons like poppers or my tripedoes (i made a RT-5 powered tripedo for part count, and it works pretty bloody well if you can actually aim in at someone properly (mk1 cockpit is used on every bloody one of my capitals as it lets me IVA aim properly (in unzoomed view shoot at the upper side of the entire crosshair assembly, crosshair itself is offcenter and too low, but the upper bar above it isnt).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, on a bit of an unrelated note, do you guys feel that weapons have gotten to the point that the only way to have a fair battle is to limit yourself to something prebuilt? Mass doesnt seem to play as much of an impact, as i have a 2t missile thatll wipe out anything reliably (uses XL-3 wheel), and part count either, as that missile is what, incredibly low part count at 7 or 8 with decoupler, not exactly an issue here. I think teh best way at least for future battles unbless someone comes up with some breakthrough armor is to have say a catalog of prebuilt weapons that eveyone deems fair, with say better ones being limited to smaller amounts on a ship or something of teh sort. I dont know if thisd work, but it would at least in my opinion make armor relevant, as currently the best way to play is a ship with firepower that can 1 shot or near 1 shot anything enemy has, and then just enough armor to protect from fighters and other weak crap.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-17T15:27:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETegu makes me cri everytim\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alphasus","CreatedById":147173,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-17T15:30:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EZekes or someone here, can you test my first ship that is more than 100 tons?

That, and the ship was actually not fully legit as i edited probe cores to have more electirc storage space so i didnt need 10 tons of batteries to run the thing (i hate solar panels as they are always useless when im trying to burn to outer planets as its always on dark side burns, i use em for smaller ships as they can always burn at a much higher orbit and they dont burn too long, but capitals are almost alweays RTG spam or fuel cells after those came out). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat id do for a ion engine that weighs 2.5t, and has 20kn thrust in the stock game.

I just checked its a hair over 2 tons, but its like 2.3 in current configuration (if you lowered its TWR and made it only useable from 2.5km away you can easily pull 2 tons). Its more or less a XL-3 wheel with a barebones propulsion system to get that XL-3 into a target at high velocity.

Im looking for a 0.6m system, with as short a projectile as possible, with teh ability to stack anywhere from 3-6 of the rounds in one stack (the stack has to have decouplers on each side to allow it to be reloaded, but once used individual shots do not need to have docking ability). Im wondering if anyone has such a weapon that i could use, as im kinda busy with armor development as dont have time to make weapons? Also, it has to be only effective vs fighters and unarmored vessels, so it should be able top take down unarmored fuel tanks, wings, exposed pods, and other low impact parts, if itll kill a capital then even better, but it doesnt have to.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alphasus","CreatedById":147173,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-17T20:08:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ejust use decouplers and stack them, you get good velocity but not control.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-17T20:12:29Z\u0022 title=\u002208/17/2015 08:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alphasus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-17T20:15:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alphasus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alphasus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ejust use decouplers and stack them, you get good velocity but not control.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcept those wont damage anything above solar panels.......\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue is they dont get enough velocity, terrible impact, and they are so light they just desintegrate on hit, and ive already tried decouler\u002Bsepatron combos, look cool, fly fast, dont do jack to anything let alone solar panels (which seem to break off from a sneeze anyways).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei was experimenting with engine\u002BoscarB, but those are much longer then id like, might try some clipping though, but even that prolly wont work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spartwo","CreatedById":58131,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-17T20:16:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Frozen_Heart\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Frozen_Heart\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat seems normal or even on the low side of the warships I see thrown around here these days.
