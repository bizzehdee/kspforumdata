The mass of the impactor is ~1.5t, that is MORE then half the entire missile, and it is quite good impact tolerance. Anyways, i think this weapon is the ULTIMATE weapon ever made if you take into account how lightweight and low part count it is. Last i checked, if you count the decoupler, it is 7 parts total, and it weighs under 2.7t. Im not claiming it is the best weapon out there, because it is not, but sofar i have yet to see anything that even approaches its firepower at the mass/part count. The only thing that kills it in my opinion is its weird shape that is just very hard to work around for anything but radial attachment on the outer hull, and that just looks horrible imo. You try mounting something that is ~1.25m tall, by ~2.5m wide, by ~3m long on a ship. Yes its possible like in my SK-FRG-III, but it just is hard to make look good not to mention these weapons kinda require a 2.5m bay unless you make a dedicated square hole for them to fit nicely inside. Btw, the shape is because the impactor is essentially sideways, ibve found that many weapons do more damage when impacting sideways or at angle, so i used this concept and made the Tripedo-S/H have a sideways impactor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, im gonna try a experimental ship using the Tripedo-S/H as armor, if it is so OP as a weapon, imaging how armored a ship would be if its made out of Tripedo-S/Hs!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are right that few things actually need high part counts besides capital ships. Really the only non-military situations the part count wall hit me was base building (modular bases, especially good looking elaborate ones) really adds to part count, especially when you start having lots of buildimngs in teh same general area. The other case was space stations, which can get laggy due to all the modules, not to mention craft you have docked. Aside from this, most players seem to do single missions (myself ive launched syncronized squadrons before which lag ALOT using burntogether mod), and tend to stick to more simple barebones vessels, as most efficienbt craft are barebones, and most for looks craft are usually unfit to do anything without inf fuel or no grav cheat enabled, making them not very appealing to players that want to go do something outside of staring at said ship in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, im actually thinking that the only way to have fun and enjoyeable space combat is to purposely limits weapons in some shape or form. I would start with a maximum mass per weapon rule, and id also throw in a maximum shots per turn as well, to make people who just bring excessive amounts of ammo into battle unable to use all of it on a single target guaranteeing its demise through sheer volume of fire.

Compounding this, its collision mesh is also incredibly odd, which means it can phase through the armor before the game realizes it has contacted the target, so it is probably impossible to actually armor against.

Feel free to participate if you wish, but you need to be one of the better craft designers in the game to make something decent, not to mention acquire a lot of experience in armoring methods.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-03T20:12:55Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2015 08:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Three1415\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T20:23:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022daemonCaptrix\u0022 data-cite=\u0022daemonCaptrix\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EExperimenting with replacing my usual LV-N thrusters with LV-909 thrusters. Seems to be working better. Still hard to bring them up to par without using k-drives.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me the only viable engimnes sofar (for serious games) are nukes and ions. The biggest issue is that you end up needing a much higher fuel fraction to use 909s, compared to nukes or even better ions (although ions tend to have their own downfalls which ill get into later). Basically, you are either upping the weight and changing the class of your vessel, throwing it into a whole other weight bracket so to speak, or you are thworing out armor or firepower. Ofc you can always elect to sacrifice dV, but ive found that unless its a low-gravity planet, you need to have at a bare minimum 2K to be competitive against a player that actually utilizes orbital maneuvers in the game and doesnt just give you nice easy targets to line up orbit with. In order to get anywhere near this level of dV with the fairly efficint 909s, you are looking at a very high amount of fuel, and even if you use droptanks, its still alot of sheer mass. The only major benefit ive seen from 909s is their ease of armoring and the fact that they are a inherently small thing to hit in the 1st place making loosing all engines a relatively uncommon occurence compared to a nuke ship, especially if you have engines spread out and not all clipped into each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, nukes are imo the only truly logical choice from a practical perspective. They have the bets dV for any given mass of fuel without requiring absurd part counts. As much as i like ions on paper, and the fact they can be made redundant thru sheer partr counts and spreading engines around, they just make the entire game lag too much, and make something liek a simple burn painfully painful. That, and the need to bring massive amounts of batteries and or solar panels makes it even laggier. Right now, to have a ~100t ship to a single burn from LKO to jool in one shot with ions without using solars, you are looking at an excess of 20 TONS of batteries, that is anywhere from 100 to over 1000 parts just for batteries alone. UIf you choose pure solars, you are limited to closer proximities to the sun, and battles on jool or beyond can be a pain to deal with, and you have issues with brurning to dres, jool, and eeloo since they require burning on dark side of planet. Then ofc all this hardware is extremely vulnurable to attack, and especially solars, and notorious for being unable to take even a glancing blow. Personally, the best way ive found to use ions is batter banks with enough power to let you 1 shot directly to the desired target, that or modding probe cores to act as super high capacity batteries (i do this right now to save part counts, and add dead weight to simulate equivalent batter mass, cheat yes, but considering the sheer annoyance of ion engines part count alone, i dont have much choice if i want 4\u002B ships spawned in teh same area at once and not lag). Ions are the best on paper, have the best dV, but without some cheaty craft editing, are just not practical at all for anything heavy such as capital ships, fighters they are the bets and only practical choice, but aside from fighters, ions are more problematic then beneficial.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dark Junior","CreatedById":102999,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T21:59:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027ll be my project for the next week.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do I edit them into a save file?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"daemonCaptrix","CreatedById":75178,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T22:52:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dark Junior\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dark Junior\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat\u0027ll be my project for the next week.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do I edit them into a save file?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a little poorly explained.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, you make some ships.
