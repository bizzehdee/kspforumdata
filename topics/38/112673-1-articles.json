So see if you can figure out below what that principle that I translated from wikipedia that I am referring to or to be more nerdy \u0022Solve for Bright Person\u0022\n\n**Bright Person\u0027s Fact**\n\n**Bright Person\u0027s fact can be used to figure out the lift force on a lift thing, if the what happens of the water stuff roll in the area of the lift thing is known.**\n\n**A case, if the air rolling past the top area of an air fly car lift thing is moving faster than the air rolling past the bottom area, then Bright Person\u0027s fact gives idea that the air force on the area of the lift thing will be lower above than down side. This air force not same makes an up lifting force.**\n\n**When the power of air move force past the top and bottom areas of a lift thing is known, the lift forces can be figured out (to a good almost figure) using Bright Person\u0027s fact.** \n\n[Link to My Solution](http://splasho.com/upgoer5?i=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)"},{"CreatedByName":"kStrout","CreatedById":116630,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T15:14:53Z","Content":"The Bernoulli Effect?"},{"CreatedByName":"Kilmeister","CreatedById":65062,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T15:34:40Z","Content":"Ding!

In Green People Space Group, you must build a space car, possible of flying its people out into space, without killing them. You can use a lot of parts, which you use to make a space car that won\u0027t die. Each part has its own use and will make the way a space car flies (or doesn\u0027t). So get ready, and get ready to try some Space Car Hard Stuff! The game has different game types, you can play the Business Type if you want to manage your own Space Business, taking on things to do and learning new things. Or you can play Anything Type if you\u0027re only interested in flying and looking at the Green People land without needing money to buy space cars. There is even a middle point between these two, Learning Things Type.\n\nAnd a shorter one which I just made without a guide:\n\nGreen People Space Group is a game where you send green people into space using large things that use fire to go FAST. You can send green people to places in space. They can put things on the space worlds. Or you can just fly things. It\u0027s up to you. Green People Space Group can be hard at times. However, the more you play Green People Space Group, you will be better."}]}
