So here I present a more \u0022serious\u0022 version of it. The rules I can think of are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. The number must be computable (by computable, I do not mean it has to actually be able to get calculated into a decimal form by a human being or a computer, your number can easily be not representable in exponents in the observable universe, I am saying it must be theoretically computable, unlike say Busy Beaver numbers).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. The number must be well defined (so you cannot write something like \u0022the largest number you can think of\u0022).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Do not use numbers of previous users with a trivial addition like \u0022\u002B1\u0022 or well known numbers like Graham\u0027s number without explaining the process how you get to them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. The number must be finite, so no transfinite numbers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. You should explain the process used to create the number so people less versed in large numbers are not immediately discouraged from the game by some genius who posts a complicated ordinal notation in the first 5 posts (you can use a notation like that if you explain it). You don\u0027t have to explain basic, well known functions like factorials or exponents through.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. This is not really a rule, but rather than filling pages with exponents, try to find more compact, smart ways to make larger numbers. If you don\u0027t know to do that, go ahead and do it the way you know it, but please don\u0027t make page filling posts like this\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/53404-my-number-is-bigger-than-yours/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=777536\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/53404-my-number-is-bigger-than-yours/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=777536\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEverybody can post multiple times and new numbers.
