In honor of the recently invented new snack, it is named the Pie-tanic. Its maiden voyage goes well until it is suddenly attacked by the ghost of Davy Kerman and his crew. Due to Davy Kerman\u0027s lisp (as a result of his tongue surviving), he ends up pronouncing the word so that it sounds more like \u0022pie-lets.\u0022 From that day forward, people who drive ships are jokingly referred to as pie-lets (which would later have its spelling changed to \u0022pilots\u0022)."},{"CreatedByName":"Spacetraindriver","CreatedById":149403,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-01T23:46:21Z","Content":"313: Second son of Jebediah (Name Lost) almost died in experimental flying train.
