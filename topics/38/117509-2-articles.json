After consulting Vernor about what had happened, he decides to write everything down and then devise a way to test his conclusions in a controlled fashion, thereby inventing Science.\n\n184: For his invention of Science, Rob Kerman is chased out of town by an angry mob. He settles down in the next town over and begins to collaborate with the brilliant Victor Frankerman on a new secret project: creating an artificial mechanical Kerbal he dubs the \u0022Rob-bot\u0022."},{"CreatedByName":"NeatCrown","CreatedById":101431,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-26T04:48:42Z","Content":"185: During the development of the Rob-bot, they accidentally created the first landing legs while creating bionic walking legs. The development of the bot was also the origin of the earliest version of the CLAW.\n\n186: The properties of the CLAW weren\u0027t looked in to further too much, and was sold as a knick-knack/toy for children, and became a huge success. Corporations soon took notice and it soon became an essential product in construction. The Rob-Bot was the first prototype for the soon-to-be probes (and MechJeb).\n\n186: After more Kerbals got their hands on the CLAW, the odd properties were found. After kerbals attatched to two CLAWs, they oddly disappeared. Only one survivor was recorded that survived the odd experience. S/he described falling into a Kerbin that wasn\u0027t there and then blacking out. This was not heard of for years afterwards.\n\n187: Rob-bot sparked the beginning of debate of whether AI should be considered as \u0022life\u0022 and if they should be treated as kerbals. This debate still continues to this day.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-26T04:51:53Z\u0022 title=\u002208/26/2015 04:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NeatCrown**"},{"CreatedByName":"megatiger78","CreatedById":114940,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-26T14:43:24Z","Content":"188: 2 KLAWS colliding is revealed to ahev the same affect as doing so with a kerbal\n\n189: gill kerman, ancestor of bill kerman, creates a new profession. it involves being near engines. they call it engine-nearing (ok so this is a old thing, but kerbals making the actual names based on a description was fun)"},{"CreatedByName":"UnionPacific1983WP","CreatedById":140982,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-26T22:00:14Z","Content":"199: Two RORW trains collide at a combined speed of 500 m/s.
