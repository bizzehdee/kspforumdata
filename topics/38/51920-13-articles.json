The whole idea of faith is a little shady and hazy, but it\u0027s existed in some form for, conceivably, all of human history (though yes, it does get a bit blurry when you start to ask questions like \u0027at what point in the evolutionary tree did we become conscious at all?\u0027). People all have slightly varied definitions of what faith is, and although you can apply a general definition to it, as I have here, a lot of people will argue with you on the finer points of it. \u0027Tis shrouded by the darkness and shadows cast by people\u0027s opinions.\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI endure unnoticed and o\u0027erlooked at\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeginning and end, but you know all that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EFaith has begun... an awful lot of things. Again, argue all you want. Opinions differ everywhere. Different kinds of faith are responsible for pretty much everything that goes on -- their beginnings. If it weren\u0027t for a form of faith, nobody would \u0027take chances\u0027 and do something they aren\u0027t sure of being able to finish. Business ventures, wars, building projects, coding projects, etc. The attitude is often \u0022let\u0027s just see how this goes.\u0022 There\u0027s always that little bit of faith that pushes people forward, past the doubt and lets them get on with it. As a result, not everything is certain to be completed, thus faith is also the end of some things also; after some failures, people simply aren\u0027t willing to try again, or don\u0027t see it worthwhile enough. Faith is a double edged sword, in that respect; sometimes it makes us jump the gun, go for things too early, and as a result never end up finishing them at all. It being overlooked is, at least to me, rather self-explanatory -- people restrict faith to things like gods and demons, heaven and hell, and a million variations thereof. It\u0027s entirely overlooked in the normal context of life, but still very much present, in my opinion.\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen at last the Sun ceases to rise beyond\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETired eyes, you\u0027ll find me as a clear cool pond;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoothing, easing, calming, \u0027till no voice\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf calm assertion will alter your final choice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EWhen the sun ceases to rise... it\u0027s a metaphor for the end of the end.

But basically, at the end of the road, faith is a calming thing. A lack of logic, but reassurance nonetheless that the choice was well made. This section is also saying that at the end of the end of your choice, when you\u0027ve thought it through all you want, faith is what keeps you from being dissuaded. Sometimes that\u0027s good, being certain in yourself and your logic without actually going and having to reevaluate it constantly, but sometimes it\u0027s also bad, especially when there was absolutely zero logic to begin with... and yeah, in such cases it might be better that the person could be dissuaded... but oftentimes not.

However, a lot of people aren\u0027t really aware of making that choice. Kids are impressionable, and a lot of them are brought up to just believe things, without them being properly explained. And no, before you say I\u0027m just hating on religion here, there are a lot of things that people accept on faith when they\u0027re young. For example, has anyone \u003Cem\u003Eever\u003C/em\u003E actually explained \u003Cem\u003Ewhy\u003C/em\u003E we give colours definite names, or why \u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E colour has to have \u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E name? Most likely not -- you\u0027ll probably be able to follow the logic now, but I doubt anyone\u0027s bothered to explain it to you. You were just taught that red is red, and green is green, and you accepted it. And I\u0027m getting somewhat philosophical here, (hey, what\u0027s new, right?) but faith is a very hard thing to think through once it\u0027s been accepted and integrated. As such, one of the best ways to fight it with something else that tends to defy cold logic in many cases -- emotion. Love is a representative of that, as it is often touted as perhaps the strongest, most complex or versatile emotion that humans are capable of feeling.\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMy power is no more than an illusory spell;\u003Cp\u003EThose that wield me as power so fell\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo not yet know that I am merely their own\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESavage might, living alone in a town\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf empty buildings, reaching for the sky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EThis is a bit of a more abstract thing. As I touched on before, faith is not power. It\u0027s merely a way to overcome doubt and things that hold one back from doing something which you may very well be capable of doing, even if you\u0027re not sure you are. There are people who consider faith to \u003Cem\u003Ebe\u003C/em\u003E a form of power. It kind of is, but it\u0027s a very hollow power -- because all the power it can hold can only come from you, in the end. The bit about a town of empty buildings reaching for the sky was actually a reference to a particular manga, and I doubt many of you caught that, but I don\u0027t think it was too important to the riddle itself. It wouldn\u0027t have kept you from getting the answer in the end, though it may have been somewhat confusing.\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWithin such a home I wait and grow\u003Cp\u003EFrom small seed of ember and snow\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo great inferno and blizzard of fire\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd ice, like one sung by bard on lyre.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EThe home being the mind (some might say the soul or the spirit). The smallest things taken on faith gradually make us more accustomed to using it, and though we oft overlook the fact that we utilise it at all, we never really leave it behind. Properly wielded, it lets us be \u003Cem\u003Eus\u003C/em\u003E, to our fullest potential, a veritable blizzard of fire and ice, as one might hear from a bard in some old half-forgotten legend.
