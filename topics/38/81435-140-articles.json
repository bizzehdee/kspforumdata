Please look at the previous posts where \u003Cstrong\u003EAlphasus\u003C/strong\u003E tested the ship and I have linked the craft file (you can see the picture of the ship). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe secret of the \u0027\u0027Ruman\u0022 ship hull are \u003Cstrong\u003EDOCKING PORTS\u003C/strong\u003E by putting docking ports in the core of your ships you will have additional contact joints for the ship. My hull flexes in a weird way after being hit and snaps back into position. So we don\u0027t have only one connection point on the ship anymore. By constructing the docking ports near each other they automatically dock when you play and serve as powerful joint (but not as strong as the core structural joint, maybe a little weaker).
