Higher wing loading tends to lend to better high-speed characteristics (particularly at low altitude), while lower wing loading lends itself to lower takeoff and landing speeds, better climb rate and cruise performance, and better sustained turning performance (in brief). My own self, I usually shoot for something in the 0.3-0.5 tonne per square meter range during my initial design calculations.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-17T19:21:27Z\u0022 title=\u002202/17/2017 07:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 17, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101**"},{"CreatedByName":"bzimac","CreatedById":144219,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-18T11:52:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 17 hours ago, Cratzz said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hey, can someone tell me why this is stuck to the runway?

The swept wings your design exhibits can also induce asymmetric stalls due to tip stalling.\n\nLike the user before me said, the wings are hitting the air at different speeds and different angles, causing different boundary layer behavior. Generally in aircraft without swept wings you will see the bases of the wings stall first, before the roots, causing the entire wing to quickly stall in succession.This is why too much \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E in planes like the fw190 (which has big square wings) will cause this sort of stalling problem.\n\nThis problem can be mitigated by adding wing rakes, fences or vortex generators, to ensure the whole wing stalls evenly but those will limit your performance a bit. \n\nYou might be able to eliminate this problem with a variable camber wing, as it is what most modern jet fighters use to reduce landing speeds. Play around with replacing both the leading and trailing edges with flaps/flaperons and experiment in using the %\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E function to activate them.\n\nYou can probably also significantly improve the aircraft\u0027s performance in a turn by tapering the wings.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-23T20:44:43Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2017 08:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Nixod321**"},{"CreatedByName":"Cratzz","CreatedById":157974,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-24T04:16:03Z","Content":"[![F14](https://pre07.deviantart.net/c08e/th/pre/f/2017/113/7/2/f14_by_cratzz-db6xjud.png)](http://cratzz.deviantart.com/art/F14-676770997)\n\nJebediah complained about too much positive AoI, making his arms hurt after hammering the stick to keep it from going nose up at certain speeds.
