More staging than just a linear method... we were told emergency staging would be coming like 8 versions ago. A more usable click-friendly UI frontend for ship control that all plugins can use as a common interface - plugins are getting more and more desperate for keyboard space and having, for example, carts using the same buttons all the time as the RCS system is inelegant. A \u0027ship control\u0027 interface common to the game with buttons you can push that plugins can integrate with (instead of the mishmash of dozens of windows you get now) would be ideal, so the Lazor system could add a button to the panel to activate the system, the cart system could stick on a button to turn on the wheels, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for docking, I must be missing why it\u0027s becoming such a ridiculous task, seeing as how we had 0.16 plugins (until 0.17 broke it) that were basically functional.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-27T15:06:50Z\u0022 title=\u002209/27/2012 03:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 27, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Frostiken\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LaydeeDem","CreatedById":5984,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-27T15:18:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot really 0.18 but:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022HarvestR\u0022 data-cite=\u0022HarvestR\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E0.17.1 Revision Update\u003Cp\u003EHi again,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that 0.17 is out, we\u0027re noticing a few issues that were sneaky enough to get past the testing process, or that we here simply overlooked for some reason or another.

Sure they could hack together something that would work, but then further on down the road they could add a feature or change something that would make the hack no longer work, or would require serious re-working of code they\u0027d already written, which would make things take longer to put out than they should. That\u0027s exactly why they are tackling IVA first: because a lot of what goes into the final implementation of docking is going to depend on what the implementation of features like IVA look like. They\u0027re waiting to do docking because they want to do it once, and do it RIGHT. If everyone stopped whining about it, it would make things a lot more pleasant for everyone.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jmcdaniel0","CreatedById":50522,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-27T21:14:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that after 17.1, we need to have just some simple house keeping.
