It seems that my dock was useless because I just wanted to transfer fuel from one station to another so I could send that to Mun. But when I ALT\u002BRight click it appears the option of fuel transfer but the IN and OUT buttons appear just for 1 milisecond and then stay blocked. (First the button look blue and then just like plain text). And even if I click there or something nothing happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI need your help or my mission would be stupid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you very much \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T03:09:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you playing in career mode?
