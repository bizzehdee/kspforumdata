However I have a slight problem. When ever I conduct an experiment, for example a mysterious goo experiment, my game lags and freezes up, until the action is done and the report screen appears. After that the game runs normally, until I do another experiment. It happens on most experiments, and on craft stationary (on pad and landed) and whilst flying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone have the same experience or know a fix?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
