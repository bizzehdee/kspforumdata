By the time you get up there it may be slightly in front or behind you. Don\u0027t expect to intercept it at launch though, you need to circle the planet. If you are behind the target, make your orbit smaller and you will \u0022catch up\u0022 as you orbit. If you are in front, make your orbit larger and the target can \u0022catch up\u0022. You need to try and get within 5 to 10km before you adjust your heading so your moving straight toward it. This is a pretty good tutorial right here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92480-Illustrated-Tutorial-for-Orbital-Rendezvous\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92480-Illustrated-Tutorial-for-Orbital-Rendezvous\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome tutorials will have you kill all relative motion once you arrive in the 5km range (one in particular from the games most beloved YouTuber gets posted often) but this is unnecessary and a waste of fuel. Instead follow the instructions to push and pull your relative marker in that tutorial. The only time you want to cancel relative velocity entirely is when you get to the target (within 200m)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-03T07:13:22Z\u0022 title=\u002201/03/2015 07:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mesons","CreatedById":76697,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T07:18:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI found \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x195uh1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis tutorial video by \u003Cstrong\u003Epebble_garden\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E a great help for my first attempts at orbital rendezvous.
