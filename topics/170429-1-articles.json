It has no custom models/textures for the parts, but they are localized(in English only for now, sorry) and they work(more or less) as intended. So, I present: the Jump Drive!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe parts right now:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBMS-01 \u0022Somewhere Else\u0022 Hyperdrive\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is currently a clone of the J-33 Wheesley jet engine, now with 100% less regular engine functionality! However, it is currently experiencing bugs that prevent it from loading.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022A small engine, useful for going somewhere else. Be careful, though, as this technology is experimental, and you have no idea where you\u0027ll go if you use this. It does, however, have a \u0022Back to Kerbin\u0022 feature, which allows you to go back home easily. There is also an error that will send you forward in time approximately 9 days. You are teleported to a flyby with the random celestial body chosen by the engine. Warranty void if used to teleport surface-to-surface.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBMS-02 \u0022Somewhere Else\u002B\u0022 Hyperdrive\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a clone of the LV-N, and it is slightly improved over the BMS-01...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This drive is the improved version of the BMS-01. Most issues are mostly fixed, although we still can\u0027t choose where to go. The forward-in-time issue is reduced to 2 seconds. You can also teleport directly to orbit around your chosen target, rather than that annoying flyby.
