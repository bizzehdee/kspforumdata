At least not with RCS, I can do it with reaction wheels but the larger my crafts get the more I have to abuse time warp to stop the rotation.\n\nI had this same issue. I figured my RCS blocks were just too close to the axis I was trying to rotate around (it was a Modular Girder Segment, and they were around the skinny circumference). But now that you\u0027ve posted this I think perhaps it IS a bug.\n\nI wonder if we can exploit it. I have long wanted to be able to leave RCS on for translation but not have it rotate. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T18:15:22Z","Content":"Do you have any RCS ports aft? If you do, I\u0027m not seeing them.\n\nIn any case, your ports are too close to the axis of rotation to generate a great deal of torque. I\u0027d suggest a set of linear ports (the ones that only fire out in one direction) out on the wingtips, one on the dorsal and one on the ventral. Those oughta help with your roll issues. Stowing a big ASAS module or two in your cargo bay will also help to generate some torque. \n\nIf you don\u0027t have it, I\u0027d suggest getting ahold of the [RCS Build Aid](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35996-0-90-RCS-Build-Aid-v0-6-1-engine-gimbals) mod. It\u0027s useful for RCS issues in general - and for spaceplanes, the dry center of mass indicator is also a very nice feature (lets you see how much and in what direction your CoM will shift as fuel drains, thus allowing you to predict stability issues later on in your flights). I\u0027d also recommend that when it comes to spaceplanes you should stick to linear ports (or even Vernors if you\u0027ve got something particularly massive), and that you rely on pod torque for attitudinal control primarily - use RCS for translation unless you just can\u0027t turn your craft on pod torque alone (and if this is the case, it\u0027s another place where the usefulness of RCS Build Aid should be obvious)."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T18:24:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E In any case, your ports are too close to the axis of rotation to generate a great deal of torque.\n\nI agree, but there is a difference between \u0022not a great deal of\u0022 and \u0022none.\u0022\n\nAnd that\u0027s what my RCS thrusters provided.

Kinda like how rapiers automatically switch modes instead of flaming out? \n\nBecause it isn\u0027t an issue of them not providing torque, it is an issue of them not firing at all.\n\nEdit- And yeah I did intend a few wingtip RCS ports as well as a few dozen other additions. This is more of a \u0022Does it fly\u0022 type thing than it is a finished product. Then I got distracted while in orbit by my inability to rotate.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T19:47:33Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 07:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by annallia**"}]}
