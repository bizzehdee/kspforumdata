I figured my RCS blocks were just too close to the axis I was trying to rotate around (it was a Modular Girder Segment, and they were around the skinny circumference). But now that you\u0027ve posted this I think perhaps it IS a bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wonder if we can exploit it. I have long wanted to be able to leave RCS on for translation but not have it rotate. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T18:15:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you have any RCS ports aft? If you do, I\u0027m not seeing them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, your ports are too close to the axis of rotation to generate a great deal of torque. I\u0027d suggest a set of linear ports (the ones that only fire out in one direction) out on the wingtips, one on the dorsal and one on the ventral. Those oughta help with your roll issues. Stowing a big ASAS module or two in your cargo bay will also help to generate some torque. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t have it, I\u0027d suggest getting ahold of the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35996-0-90-RCS-Build-Aid-v0-6-1-engine-gimbals\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERCS Build Aid\u003C/a\u003E mod. It\u0027s useful for RCS issues in general - and for spaceplanes, the dry center of mass indicator is also a very nice feature (lets you see how much and in what direction your CoM will shift as fuel drains, thus allowing you to predict stability issues later on in your flights). I\u0027d also recommend that when it comes to spaceplanes you should stick to linear ports (or even Vernors if you\u0027ve got something particularly massive), and that you rely on pod torque for attitudinal control primarily - use RCS for translation unless you just can\u0027t turn your craft on pod torque alone (and if this is the case, it\u0027s another place where the usefulness of RCS Build Aid should be obvious).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T18:24:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022capi3101\u0022 data-cite=\u0022capi3101\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn any case, your ports are too close to the axis of rotation to generate a great deal of torque.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree, but there is a difference between \u0022not a great deal of\u0022 and \u0022none.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s what my RCS thrusters provided.
