Built a Soyuz-like craft, sent it to Mun orbit. Had batteries, solar panels, and science experiments in the bay. Hid the panels, then did my science experiments. EVA\u0027d a kerbal to see if I could just collect them with the doors on, and see if the doors were hidden with the kerbal on EVA. They were not, and could not be collected. Brought kerbal back in, blew doors off (they may have still been hidden, not sure). Saw them fly away though. EVA\u0027d the kerbal to collect the experiments for return, and none of it was able to be interacted with. Switched back to the vessel.. now I can\u0027t click on anything in the bay, and none of it works. Solar panels aren\u0027t generating EC. It\u0027s as if none of it has any functionality or right click menu.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReloading the craft with the doors blown off also has them reappearing, though they\u0027re not -actually- there and all the same issues are still in effect. Completely unusable part, which entirely scrubbed my Mun mission.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit: It is possible to access the interior of this part without blowing the doors. On the vessel POV you can hide the doors, then pin their menus to the screen. When on EVA those menus are still available provided you fly close to the part.
