In general this is a problem because you can\u0027t reach an exact orbit without reaching it to a certain degree below 100% before, except with hyperedit. I can not think of a logic of the top of my hat that, is possible in mission builder and would solve this without a playerintervention that idicated that he is done with his orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrikeEagleCC","CreatedById":186941,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-19T13:47:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe indication that the player is done with their orbital maneuver is accomplished by setting the required stability time in the specified orbit.

I like this part of the challenge though, since you have to execute the launch or plan intercepts very carefully in order to set yourself up for an accurate circularization burn.
