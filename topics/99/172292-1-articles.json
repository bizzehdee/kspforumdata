But I want it that the next node only triggers when you are 5 km up and have 300 m/s speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Draradech","CreatedById":139656,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-15T20:17:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is surprisingly tricky. You need to snap height and speed together. When height is reached, the speed will be checked as well, and then one or the other output is activated. If it was height only, you need to direct control flow back to the height node, to be able to check again. Be sure to put a time delay in there, you can degrade performance really fast otherwise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this image, message alt is triggered, if you are above 1000m and above 100m/s. The message will repeat every 5s. Go below, and it will stop checking. Fly above 1000m and below 100m/s, message spd is triggered and mission ends with success.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/gBEewjt.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022gBEewjt.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRelevant settings on the nodes (other than directly visible in the image):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpawn Vessel has \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E as editor (don\u0027t try to build a plane if you started in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, it won\u0027t work, even if you switched editors)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActivate only once removed for \u0022Reach Altitude\u0022, \u0022Display alt\u0022 and \u0022Time Since\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Time Since\u0022 has \u0022Reach Altitude\u0022 as reference Node (\u0022Display alt\u0022 would also work)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Display spd\u0022 is end node with success.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
