And i was wondering why. I was using the RT-5 flea painted which was added in the expansios with all the other painted parts. And the contracts would only complete if the equipment was used from base game and not the expansion. I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s a bug or if it\u0027s in the game made that way but it was pretty anoying. It\u0027s not a mod or anything anfter all, it\u0027s officialy supported and developed content.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo is it a bug or just made that way?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-10T23:01:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Flea is not part of Making History.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Making_History_parts\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Making_History_parts\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-11T11:20:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum, \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/193896-psykologg/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022193896\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/193896-psykologg/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@PsykoloGG\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tested this in my stock install with the flea variants and the contract completed successfully for all 3.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PsykoloGG","CreatedById":193896,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-11T12:02:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny suggestions why would the painted versions of stock engines would not work?
