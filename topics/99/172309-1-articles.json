So i messed around with the install location and managed to get it so it would install into the directory. (the area where gamedata, plugin data, parts, ect are kept) However the content from the expansion did not appear in game so the location is incorrect. So now i basically need to find out where the files should go correctly, Does squad expansion go in the directory? or the gamedata folder? What about the making history expansion file inside of it?\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E If anyone could tell me where the correct install location for these would be, that would be great.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
