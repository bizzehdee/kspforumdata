We are running the PS4 version of KSP on a PS5 with no issue. We bought the History DLC pack, installed it, but nothing. There is no game data. We have gone through several tutorials to see where it is, but it is not working. We have uninstalled KSP and the DLC and then reinstalled, but again, nothing is there. Has anyone else found this problem? Many thanks for your support.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-02T16:43:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/support\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETry contact Support here. \u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood luck with it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
