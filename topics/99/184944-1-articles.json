It would load up to a certain point and just stop. I\u0027ve tried verifying the integrity of game files, but it always says one file was going to be acquired but it doesn\u0027t do anything. I\u0027ve tried uninstalling making history and reinstalling making history, but it still stops. I have yet to try backing up my saves and reinstalling KSP. If it helps, I play with mods and haven\u0027t had a problem playing with them until I got Making History.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0I\u0027ll also be posting this on r/KerbalSpaceProgram, If it is solved I\u0027ll mark this as solved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-06-01T22:51:34Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2019 10:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Conric005\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EI\u0026#039;ll also be posting this on r/KerbalSpaceProgram, If it is solved I\u0026#039;ll mark this as solved.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-01T19:03:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry that no-one has recognized this symptom.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe text file \u0027KSP.log\u0027 alongside the KSP executable might reveal the cause of the problem to you.\u00A0 (That\u00A0file is too big to post to this forum,\u00A0but sometimes users post it somewhere else and link to it, to get help debugging problems.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy only guess is that your\u00A0versions of KSP and making history do not match.\u00A0 For example Making History 1.7.0 will only work with KSP 1.7.0.\u00A0 \u00A0The versions are not obvious in the installed directories, but you can see them in the filenames of the downloaded packages (if you download from the KSPstore).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0027verifying integrity\u0027 step is something that Steam users talk about, so maybe a Steam user will recognize the symptom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Conric005","CreatedById":184810,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-01T22:50:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223609853\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022184944\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221559415801\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022162784\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022OHara\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, OHara said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry that no-one has recognized this symptom.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe text file \u0027KSP.log\u0027 alongside the KSP executable might reveal the cause of the problem to you.\u00A0 (That\u00A0file is too big to post to this forum,\u00A0but sometimes users post it somewhere else and link to it, to get help debugging problems.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy only guess is that your\u00A0versions of KSP and making history do not match.\u00A0 For example Making History 1.7.0 will only work with KSP 1.7.0.\u00A0 \u00A0The versions are not obvious in the installed directories, but you can see them in the filenames of the downloaded packages (if you download from the KSPstore).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0027verifying integrity\u0027 step is something that Steam users talk about, so maybe a Steam user will recognize the symptom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni had already tried verifying integrity, but i realized that some of my modd were still on 1.4, so i updated them and it ended up working.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
