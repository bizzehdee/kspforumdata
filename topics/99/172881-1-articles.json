Say they save a checkpoint for Jeb on EVA, and then go back and edit the kerbal to be Valentina. That checkpoint is now considered dirty. All checkpoints created after that one will also become invalid since, let\u0027s put it this way, they are pointing at something that is not happening in the future of the mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tomf","CreatedById":57809,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-23T17:51:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is in a mission that I am creating and the mission nodes that I am changing are significantly in the future of the checkpoints that are being invalidated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nE.g. my mission consists of 40 nodes. In a playthrough I get up to node 30 and notice that something has gone wrong. I go back to the editor. At this point I have checkpoints corresponding to nodes 10, 15 and 20. I make my change to node 30.
