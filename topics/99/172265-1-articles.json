Everything is checked as done, and i don\u0027t know what exactly to to with the second ship.

The \u0022Missions\u0022 thing did not update. I tried to follow the instructions from the dialog which almost worked.

The main logic ends in the 20d radiation fail condition after launching the second vessel, and the rest of the mission logic is triggered by a catch-all node activated by leaving kerbins \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E (into the muns\u0027, via distance check weirdly...).
