I had set up to where there would be a certain amount of points deducted if the Landing took place with getting into an orbit around the Mun prior to landing and no deduction if landing straight from kerbin . When I set up the nodes and achieved the drop in landing however the mission node would not progress even though I had set a branch off point saying that a Lunar landing could skip the orbit parameters of periapsis needing to be be 10m-Mun Soim. But is insisting that I have to be in the closed orbit before progressing to the next mission node. \u00A0screenshot0.png\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-29T02:52:33Z\u0022 title=\u002203/29/2018 02:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 29, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by ToneStack\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EIt does not appear am able to insert screenshot photos into forums anymore\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
