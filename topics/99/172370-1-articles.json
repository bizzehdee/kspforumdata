Will there be a portable version for Windows in the future?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince I use Linux and Windows, I also downloaded the linux package and it seems pretty much like a portable version. It contians an installer script but afaik it just checks the KSP version and extracts the (2nd) archive when version is valid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Are the different versions really platform-dependant?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.
