I don\u0027t know if this was purposeful or an oversight, but it\u0027s a funtionality that I think is missing. I\u0027ve found a way around it that somewhat accomplishes the same effect but, after doing it more than once in the same mission, it starts to look like exactly what it is; a contrivance. Of course, the Part Fail itself is a contrivance as well but, for storyline purposes during a mission, it works well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRecovery of a Kerbal, or even a ship, seems to be completely disabled for some reason. It says it\u0027s been disabled by the mission creator, but there doesn\u0027t seem to be any way to do that (or undo it). Since this is an easy way to signal the end of a mission, it definitely hurts not to have the ability. There are ways around this too, of course, but it makes things tougher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEVA\u0027s have some issues, as well. An EVA check doesn\u0027t seem to register in orbit or when flying. There\u0027s also no way to check if a Kerbal has popped his parachute without resorting to other methods. The Take Kerbal node could help, but it doesn\u0027t register unless the Kerbal is onboard a ship (Vessel is one of the parameters). This somewhat limits the usefulness of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, although there\u0027s an Activate Stage node, there isn\u0027t a node to activate a specific part or action group. This would be useful in certain circumstances, so I hope it\u0027ll be considered as an added function bat some point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese are some of the issues I\u0027ve run into and ideas I\u0027ve had while using the Mission Builder thus far. I\u0027m sure there were others than I\u0027m not thinking of, and so I\u0027ll post them if they come to mind. And, I was wondering if anyone had any ideas about any of this. For instance, if one of the issues here is just because I\u0027m doing something wrong, it would definitely be helpful to know that.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
