Additionally, my 1st vessel suddenly begins to move along the ground when the 2nd spawns in too.

You\u0027re not showing the info for the \u0022spawn vessel\u0022 node on the right, so I can only guess, but my issue was that, even though I said to spawn \u0022in orbit\u0022, between the \u0022in orbit\u0022 designation and the \u0022celestial body\u0022 designation, it said \u0022launch site\u0022; meaning one of the launch platforms. This made the game go nuts and my other ship to shoot across the surface for no reason. I think it\u0027s telling it to put it in orbit and on the ground at the same time, which makes it wig out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClick on the \u0022in orbit\u0022 and change it to \u0022landed\u0022 or something, then change it back to \u0022in orbit\u0022. That should get rid of the \u0022launch site\u0022 designation in the middle.
