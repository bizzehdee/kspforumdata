Why is the Event node setting not doing this? Upon start up, both nodes can be seen under the lightning bold flash of planting the flag. I understand that this lightning bolt\u00A0means it is an event node. When the flag is planted, the two boarding nodes gain a blue block next to them, which means they are now enabled. So why were they visible before they were enabled and before the flag was planted?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
