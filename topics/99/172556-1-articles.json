I can access Missions and Mission Builder in game but I cannot see any of the new parts and when I try to start a mission that uses the new KV-series pods I get an error message saying the files cannot be found. I looked for the files and found them but Squad has changed the folder organization in the DLC and it no longer resembles the vanilla install folders. Unfortunately I cannot make any changes to the DLC folders as they are write protected. This is frustrating because I have the files on my computer but cannot figure out how to get the game to see them...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbKerbson","CreatedById":186916,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-17T20:59:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried extracting the DLC zip instead of running the shell script and now it\u0027s working fine. The bad news is I cannot delete the write-protected folder created by the shell script. Current fix is renaming that folder to anything else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
