I didn\u0027t have any trouble docking at that time. Now... sheesh. The target marker in the nav-ball jumps around all over the place. I can\u0027t match velocity to save my life. It\u0027s like the effing ships have a mind of their own. SAS seems to be broken, especially if any RCS is in play. Sometimes the rate of closure approaches 0 meters per second, but it does not stay there and sometimes I swear the two vessels are actually accelerating away from one another with no imput.
