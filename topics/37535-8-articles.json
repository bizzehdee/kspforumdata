Better visibility and we can put all information on it, Altitude, AoA, KIAS (or true airspeed if the game simulates any of that). After a certain altitude, airspeed converts to meters per second, and altitude converts to meters (or it could all be switchable by the player).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe HSI would allow you to set nav-points (I know there is no VOR or ILS systems in KSP) on the ground around Kerbin. Maybe have it so you need to deploy one? You would use the HSI to glide back to specific spots you set. On inter-planetary missions perhaps the HSI could be used to set nav points in reference to that planet\u0027s magnetic north? You would need to be at a specific altitude over the planetary body for it to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to the HSI and ADI, there will be two MFDs in the center of the control panel. These can be used for all flight data (turning on and off lights, opening the cargo bay, flight information, RCS status, etcetera). Additionally these two MFD\u0027s can be used to display visual from the cargo bay and from the front lower portion of the cockpit (for ground and orbital operation clearance visibility).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou would also have the analog gauges (radar altimeter, magnetic compass, airspeed indicator, etc.).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll have an image of the flight deck a little later, I\u0027m still brick and mortaring the master.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did not know you were planning on a full glass cockpit. I was hoping that at some point the cockpit could be modified to have a decent interface, just not for the first release. This is quite ambitious, but in theory all of what you describe should be possible, as the requisite technical features, such as PiP and RTT, are demonstrated in other mods. Most of it is already on the list of features I have been planning for KCA. It really seems like we have a similar vision for KSP. I was also planning on making an external MFD interface that could run in a separate window or even a separate computer, linked over IP, but that would be a long way down the line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a vehicle such as this the forward vector is almost never pointing in the acceleration vector, so the ADI will need an extra marker to show this. As far as I know, the game does not have any notion of wind, so there will not be any deviation between the horizontal component of true airspeed and ground speed, though we can still have a go at coming up with a simulation of IAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make the IVA viable as a replacement for map view we will need a good selection of modes for the MFD, such as an orbit mode, map mode and a glideslope visualiser. A decent autopilot should be a target in the long term, as well as a proper ILS (these features are also on the KCA roadmap).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, this will probably be a lot of work, so you may want to release the first version without a cockpit (use the stock default IVA space), though I will be glad to try coding the glass cockpit once you have a prototype for it.

Also you may want to consider how they can reach all of the controls with their mittened hands on their little arms and their huge helmets in the way, though several other cockpits I have seen do not seem to worry about this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely plan for a HUD, which should ideally be visible from all viewpoints through the front windows. Real shuttles use them, so it would not be out of place. There will also probably be a separate HUD for the docking console.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInteriors are separate models that are not rendered in the exterior view except for the PiP views of the crew. Bear in mind that in IVA mode, everything else, including the exterior cockpit model, is still rendered, so make sure that your windows line up. I have not made an IVA space myself, so I could not tell you exactly how to set one up correctly. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/35714-Tutoria-Modifying-Exporting-Internals-in-20-Part-Tools\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis page\u003C/a\u003E might help regarding workflow, otherwise you may want to ask for help on the #KSPModders IRC channel.

Also, plugins only \u0022stick out like a sore thumb compared to the vanilla user interface\u0022 if they have an on-screen user interface.
