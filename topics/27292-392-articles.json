So basically, I lost the craft, all the equipment, all that xenon that I converted and my 95% ready for Jool ship. One more lander and it was done. I could hit all the moons, drop a probe into the atmosphere, and regenerate more fuel from an onboard karbonite mine/refinery while in orbit. On the other hand, I just recovered 15\u002B million funds worth of xenon, and this ship did have some design problems I figured out before the mission started...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mahnarch","CreatedById":114432,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-23T18:13:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Frank_G\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Frank_G\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4ve made me laugh out loud... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E I\u0027m lucky I didn\u0027t make it past Mun orbit before I saw your pics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-23T18:38:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E land on your engine, you just have to be more careful.
