All crewed capsules have built-in reaction wheel systems and so are enough to stabilize small rockets, though larger ones will need additional inline reaction wheel pieces. The reaction wheel pieces that say they have \u0022SAS\u0022 capability are only needed on ships that are using a robotic probe core as the control part instead of a crewed capsule, because crewed capsules also provide the SAS function by themselves. RCS doesn\u0027t work very well in atmosphere, and should be used primarily for maneuvering rather than stability, because otherwise it will run out of fuel too quickly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EControl surfaces only work in atmopsphere, and so will only help stabilize rockets during takeoff or landing, though aircraft need control surfaces at all times. Aircraft don\u0027t work very well with the current reaction wheel system, though, and so just aren\u0027t going to be very stable no matter what you do. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of these parts will need electrical power to work. That comes from solar panels, RTG generators, or engines (though there seems to be some glitchiness right now and not all engines do generate electrical power). All crewed capsules and probe cores start with a small electrical charge even without a generator, but it will quickly run out. It may be enough for very short missions, though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
