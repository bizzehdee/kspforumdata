I know this topic it mentioned a lot, but this list of mods is truly special.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Kerbal Reusability. Currently in the stock game, it it difficult to land boosters without completely destroying them. The mod Kerbal Reusability being added into the stock game would make reusing spacecraft\u00A0much easier.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Trajectories Mod. The trajectories mod is a great mod that adds atmospheric trajectory predictions to make landing easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. That one mod that adds boat parts. Sorry i forgot the name of this mod, but it would be useful in cooperation with Kerbal Reusability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E. This mod adds readouts and is very helpful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah. Thats the list of mods i want to become stock. Feel free to comment and suggest additional mods to be added.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh and also i think the MK4 part mod should be stock\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbalChamp2006","CreatedById":190555,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-20T18:43:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso stockalike station parts expansion\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-20T23:19:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could try some of the other threads on this very topic, there is a large on e floating around here somewhere, a common suggestions thread is even stickied.\u00A0 No reason to beat a dead reinvented wheel.\u00A0\u00A0 (Couldn\u0027t decide on an euphemism)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbalChamp2006","CreatedById":190555,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-21T15:01:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
