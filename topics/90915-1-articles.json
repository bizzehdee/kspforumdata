This beast of a stealth fighter can take out the enemy before they even realise it\u0027s there! It tops out at a max speed of 220m/s (at about 2km high) and is VERY VERY VERY VERY stable, You can fly under the bridge at KSC with this thing! (this isn\u0027t even a VTOL!) I myself prefer to fly this in first person (It is actually easier in my opinion) around KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/RGiQF\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
