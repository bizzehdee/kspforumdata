To handle that, they may have to be quite robust, and that means some added weight, and that means smaller cargo, and that means larger rockets for putting more cargo into orbit, and that means larger tube, and that means more power needed to launch, and so on and so forth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWich is also one fo the reasons Musk\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s proposal for the hyperloop is meant for relatively small units at a time. It will lend itself to only use the power needed when transporting, and keep as much capacity at standby as possible, and be more robust against downtime by service to the pods, due to the numnber of pods in the system. Smaller and lighter units means less friction to fight, less stress on materials and such, and that will help keep the cost down in the long run.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-15T12:02:57Z\u0022 title=\u002208/15/2013 12:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Thaniel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moon Goddess","CreatedById":57446,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T13:53:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jwenting\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jwenting\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I saw the video reports, my first impression was a guy having found a way to scam venture capitalists out of billions before making a run for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy would Elon Musk bother scamming venture capitalists out of money, and exactly where would he go that people wouldn\u0027t recognize him?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean sure, if I proposed this you\u0027d either say \u0022She\u0027s a scam artist\u0022 or \u0022She\u0027s plain nuts\u0022 But when the guy who did, PayPal, Tesla Motors and SpaceX proposes something big...
