The best thing to do is to make sure you place your base at or near the equator.

This helps around larger bodies (everything bigger than the Mun), but around small bodies (Minmus and smaller) the gain is pretty small since the gravity is so low. This really only helps if you\u0027re trying to transfer from between a station and a ground base.

Or at the very least close to the equator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMining bases are prime examples of this. When I look for a good spot I don\u0027t just look for the highest concentration of ore, but for the highest concentration of ore on or close to the equator. If you\u0027re doing the fuel runs manually, any forced inclination change is going to drive you nuts sooner or later, and even if you use MechJeb it\u0027s unlikely that a\u00A0higher concentration found far from the equator will be worth it, since you\u0027ll burn much more fuel each time you land to pick up ore/fuel for your orbital depot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStations that will mostly\u00A0get visitors from outside the SOI of the planetary body they are on is another matter.
