We started work last week on porting the game to the new Unity, and I do mean porting the game, because the move from U4 to U5 is by no means a simple automatic upgrade. I had said earlier that it was going to take some doing\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 I may have grossly understated the situation. U5 is a vastly improved platform, but it is a vastly modified platform as well. .As a result we are going over large swaths of game code and assets here, to make sure everything will run properly. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The game UI, which admittedly has suffered from the lack of a robust UI backend in the past, is now being completely revised, to use Unity\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s new (and awesome) native UI system. You can readily imagine just how large of a job that is. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re talking all of the game\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s UI. Every button, panel, dialog and icon will have to be revised. In the end though, we should see some really cool benefits, not least among which should be a hefty boost to performance.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Speaking of performance, Unity 5 now uses the much improved PhysX 3.5, compared to the really outdated 2.8 version we had until now. The new PhysX is optimized for multiple threads, is more accurate and more stable, and is generally better in every measurable way. However, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not without its own set of changes that are (you guessed it) also backward-incompatible. Wheel colliders for one are completely changed, which means we have to update our own\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 That should be hopefully straightforward. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;One thing I didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t expect would be a problem though, was a small but far-reaching change: Rigidbodies using Mesh colliders would previously collide just fine with other rigidbody mesh colliders, as long as one of them was a convex mesh. This is no longer the case. Now, if you have two rigidbody objects, both mesh colliders have to be convex. At first glance, this seemed fine, as all our parts are already convex, and the terrain isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t a rigidbody object, so it can still have a con-convex mesh. So all is good then\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 except asteroids. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Asteroids are the one exception to this new convex collider rule. They have to be able to collide with other parts (for obvious reasons), and they also have to have rigidbodies, otherwise they wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be maneuverable. That put us in a bit of a quandary, because using a single convex hull around an asteroid is just not accurate enough. Asteroids can be very large, compared to spacecraft and Kerbals, and we wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t want objects hitting (or grappling on to) invisible walls over and around the rock surface.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;We half expected we might run across problems like this, which is the reason why we couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t take this upgrade as a small job, or even estimate how long it would take. This one issue in particular did have a solution, which took two days to implement. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a piece of code I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m actually quite proud of, 700\u002B lines to procedurally generate solid collision geometry, and all it does is make asteroids behave no differently from before. It can be a thankless job sometimes\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 But it was a lot of fun to code, in a geeky, procedural-mesh-enthusiast kind of way.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;That aside, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re also going over shaders. U5 changed the way shaders are compiled, so several of our own shaders broke in various ways, from minor alpha blending issues, to straight up not compiling at all.. We have our work cut out for us now to go through all those problematic shaders, and convince them to work again.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Not all is woe and trouble though. Here\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s the good bits: The Unity Editor itself is now 64-bit, meaning we can now finally properly support 64-bit development. This doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t immediately translate itself to a 64-bit build coming out again, but the good news is that we caught some bugs in the new editor that were specific to previous KSP x64 builds. This means the Editor\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s internal player is very similar to the x64 unity player, and that means we can now look for (and hopefully fix) bugs which until now were impossible to even reproduce in a development environment. As for when x64 will be available again, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s way too early to tell yet, but we should be able to start targeting that platform once more, and run test builds on it again.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;And lastly, I reckon it turned out for the best that we couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t include the audio pass we had planned for the 1.0 release due to time constraints, because Unity5 has the most awesome audio toolset I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve ever seen in a game engine. Imagine tools you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d find in pro audio software like Audition or ProTools, inside the game engine. Multi-channel mixing, EQ control at runtime, the works! It would have been such a wasted opportunity had we managed to get the audio revision in on time for 1.0\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 Good things did come for those who waited in this case. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Well, that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s the news on my end for this week.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Alex (aLeXmOrA): \u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;After a week hanging out with the KSP team here in Mexico City, now it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s time to get back to work. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been helping doing the KerbalEDU builds that will have KSP 1.0 features, so all the schools that have purchased the educational version can enjoy them. Also, as you may know, our websites are in a provisional server solution. Since the release was close and we needed to move the sites, we found the best and temporary hosting for them, but now I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m working to set them up to their final home. All the issues you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been experiencing in the Wiki, such as image rendering and math calculations, will be solved after the migration. Sorry for the inconveniences that any of those are causing.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Marco (Samssonart):\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been a while, much has happened since the release, on the one side are the good times with all the guys, on our meetup week where we discussed future plans and had a very good time; on the other side I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been crying over not having Rsync access to the new server yet, which means no patcher and lots of confused people asking how to update, sob sob. This week I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been helping Alex out with the KerbalEdu builds and checking that the tutorial UI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s work as expected using the newer Unity system, of course they don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t out of the box, they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re going to take some work.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Daniel (danRosas): \u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;This past weeks have been for planning and having that slow time after the storm. On the devnotes side of the week, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve prepared two Shapeways models that are pending approval. I guess you know of which models I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m talking about, two Valentina Kerman prints. Also noticed some things that could be improved upon for the Kerbals, which I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll work on after the Unity 5 issues are resolved. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Jim (Romfarer):\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; Despite the 25 hour trip back and forth i had a really good time in Mexico, i even got to jump/fall out of a plane. The trip was not all fun and games though, little actual work was done but we had some good discussions about the future of KSP. The first thing that hit me is that we are going to replace the 3 previous gui systems with the new unity 5 gui system. As felipe mentioned it is a monumental task also considering i have to learn the new system beforehand. But i am in good spirits and am actually looking forward to overhauling everything.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Max (Maxmaps):\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; We jumped out of a plane, spent a lovely weekend relaxing and overeating in ludicrous manners. Now it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s back to work. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been organizing the update plan for the next few updates (yes, plural) while figuring out how to most effectively organize the team to speed up Multiplayer\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s development. Adding to that the fact that the U5 update is turning out to be a tremendous workload, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve got quite the busy schedule for the foreseeable future. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Ted (Ted):\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; Ted is currently busy with exams.
