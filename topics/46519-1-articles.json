For some reason in every place except the scenery view and internal views the camera slowly rotates down and to the right. This happens with both a purely stock or modded install. I have no idea what is causing this. I don\u0027t have a flight stick in and even if I unplug my keyboard and mouse it still does it. So does anyone else have this problem and is there any way to stop it? It makes precision construction difficult and also interferes with actually flying anything.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blue","CreatedById":1917,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-25T19:06:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAssuming you have a windows, go to your Control Panel and check your Device Manger for Mouse, Keyboard or other Human Interface devices and see if there are any inputs other than the ones you mean to use.
