Hear me out-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was sitting in the waiting room of a private clinic earlier today when I happened to glance outside. It is cold here in Wyoming, and so I saw the condensed water vapor from a nearby chimney floating away. This got me started thinking about reference points: from the right point, it looked like the clinic was flying, and moving at the same speed as the clouds way in the distance. Then this got me thinking: How does the air surrounding Earth keep up with it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought of it this way: If the Earth is rotating around an axis, and the air surrounding it is not directly connected \u003Cem\u003Eto\u003C/em\u003E the Earth, then how can there be \u0022still\u0022 air? Think of the situation as a small beach ball in a pool. If you grab that ball and spin it, the water (most of it, at any rate) stays right where it is, and the ball simply spins on top. The water is hardly affected by the ball, except in the case where the ball spins very fast and that little stream of water climbs up the ball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy this logic, shouldn\u0027t the wind have to move at the same speed as the Earth rotates in order to stay \u0022still\u0022? If the air were truly \u0022still\u0022, shouldn\u0027t we perceive it as wind moving at several thousand kilometers per hour opposite to the Earth\u0027s rotation? Or would the Earth\u0027s fairly large gravity (combined with the rotational effect) cause the air to stick to the surface much like the small amount of water if the beach ball spins too fast?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOFF TOPIC: Do you think that if the beach ball were spinning fast enough, the entire ball would gather a sheet of water all the way around?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AletzN1","CreatedById":65154,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T02:17:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewe will never know......\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eseriously i have no clue, but i think it will be something painfully obvious.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheGatesofLogic","CreatedById":58468,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T02:33:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyour statements are logically sound if your talking about plopping down a planet, setting it to spin, THEN adding placing \u0022stationary\u0022 atmosphere around it, but in reality the air does not move because it IS connected to the planet and upward movement of molecules over time give die to a system that maintains very similar speeds to the ground. there is a noticeable effect in this regard and it is commonly known as the Coriolis Effect which spins wind and cloud patterns away from the poles\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T02:37:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is a complex combination of viscosity effects, temperature/pressure variations throughout the atmosphere and coriolis effect.

First of all, air is generally moving - and a lot faster than we perceive. It is just that the lowest layer is moving quite slowly due to a lot of things being in the way. Those things are just the stuff you see around you, like trees, houses, hills, et cetera. If you get just a little big higher than that, wind usually picks up quite dramatically. It is something that pilots actually need to take into account when coming in for a landing, to prevent sudden stalling at a low altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething that is not entirely accurate with your water analogy it that air is not only a lot less dense than water, but it is also actually only a small layer compared to the rest of the planet. As a very rough comparison, the atmosphere is in reality about as thick as the skin of an apple compared to the earh being the whole apple. Even though it appears huge to us, it is really a small layer that sticks to the planet. When looking closely, a ball spinning in water might actually have a layer that is equally thick on it, as it will be wet all across the surface and also be pulling some water along due to friction and surface tension/viscosity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, earth roughly formed alongside its atmosphere, to it is only logical the the atmosphere is not static, but also moving roughly along. It is kind of the same thing as with the planets in the solar system rotating in the same direction with the asteroids and debris, although there are more factors involved than just the planet formation governing the wind patterns that we see.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wbcundiff","CreatedById":59031,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T03:24:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think the beach ball analogy works because the relative masses are so different between your analogy and reality. mass-of-air:mass-of-earth is not similar to mass-of-water:mass-of-inflatable-toy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T04:17:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Camacha\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Camacha\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESomething that is not entirely accurate with your water analogy it that air is not only a lot less dense than water, but it is also actually only a small layer compared to the rest of the planet.
