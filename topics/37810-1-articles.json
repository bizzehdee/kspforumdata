Sizing momentum exchange systems correctly is a difficult problem, one of the key aspects in spacecraft design. Additionally, large vehicles like many manned spacecraft (ex. all US systems except for the ISS) use RCS alone because the size, weight, and power required for reaction wheels or CMGs is more than the required propellant for the \u0027short\u0027 durations of the mission and the vehicle is large enough that the minimum thrust is small enough to prevent limit cycling and other non-linear effects that hamper precision pointing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I would like for squad to implement is the ability to add more non-RCS torque capability to the vehicle that consumes electricity and has a significant weight penalty. Thus for short missions RCS is a better choice, but for long missions a CMG / RW package may be better.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
