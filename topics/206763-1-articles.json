This will be the first thread I\u0027ve created in months, so please don\u0027t mind my rustiness!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI love the first KSP! But the thing is, I only love Sandbox mode specifically, and for what I see as good reason too. KSP\u0027s tech tree is a mess, it feels like it was jumbled together as quick as possible and as if there was minimal effort put into it, no offense to anyone that may have developed the tree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst of all, putting rocketry flight before aerodynamic flight with airplanes and drones and whatnot is just wrong, I am not talking from a historical perspective, but from a piloting perspective, nearly every astronaut ever has piloted a plane before having flown in a rocket powered vehicle on the way to space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond of all, crewed rocketry flight comes long before remotely controlled flight, this is wrong in many ways, as someone is looking to go into college for aerospace engineering as soon as I graduate high school, this is reckless! As we have seen, real rockets have to go through rigorous testing procedures alongside government approval before getting to fly. I think that in KSP 2, we should get probes and launch abort systems early on. (The hardcore players need more launch abort systems for the other sizes of capsules, I mean, we can get creative with the parts we have now, but it still takes up a large part count)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird of all, fairings are fairly far, which means that you have to launch satellites bare against the atmosphere or you have to make a weird looking satellite that doesn\u0027t even look like one that would be useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is not to complain, it is for suggestion, if anybody would like to share their opinions, I would love to hear them, the tech tree is what makes career and science mode challenging, so why not improve it to be better accustomed to the people that want the challenge. I do think though, that it should be something you select in the settings menu, (ex: Legacy Tech Tree or Improved Tech Tree) those settings would make it so people could continue the play style they had in the first game, or have a new play style in the new game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Thanks for all the comments everyone!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-02-07T04:58:47Z\u0022 title=\u002202/07/2022 04:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 7, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by BigStar Aerospace\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-05T08:45:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s start with the fact that we don\u0027t even know if the tech tree will exist.

I would push planes off to the second tier in part because flying and landing planes in KSP is actually more difficult than flying rockets, but also because this is Kerbal SPACE program and most of the emphasis is on getting out there, exploring other planets, and building colonies.

It is fine to use conventional rockets to do everything, but the fuel savings of rovers, the long range and cargo capacity of planes, the efficiency of deep space rockets are all things that players should be guided into instead of them having to work to engage with those systems.

I agree that planes are useful to transport stuff between surface bases and flying a plane can be much less time consuming than a sun-orbital hop for the player, especially because piloting a plane and landing it within a small area is much easier than landing something with much less aerodynamic control, thus allowing a player to progress more easily. Not a side hustle. Next, if players unlock all their plane parts quickly, they will only really be able to use them on Kerbin and then we get the problem of people using planes to fly around grinding for science. If the player already has the infrastructure to launch a plane to Duna when they get their plane tech, they are more likely to start using planes on other planets instead of using them as a side hustle. Basic plane parts should be unlocked sooner to allow players to get comfortable with the concept of flying one, but they should be severely limited to discourage biome grinding.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoeSchmuckatelli","CreatedById":154477,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-07T17:31:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224088177\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206763\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221644249627\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...unlock... basic plane parts \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eafter \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003Ethe second suborbital flight,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat mimics the current system - which, again, has always seemed odd to me.\u00A0 Like a \u0027gamification\u0027 or anachronism to the original game.\u00A0 The \u0027feel\u0027 I think most people have is that planes came \u003Cem\u003Ebefore \u003C/em\u003Erockets - so if you are playing a rocket game that has planes in it... \u003Cem\u003Enot \u003C/em\u003Ehaving planes at the start (and having to unlock planes only \u003Cem\u003Eafter \u003C/em\u003Eflying rockets) is weird.\u00A0 I \u0027get\u0027 why Squad did that: the focus was on rockets... but this is KSP2, and if we\u0027re looking to broaden the audience, we don\u0027t have to make the same choices they did.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d like to see basic plane parts (just barely enough to build a jet to explore the local area) available alongside the basic rocket stuff.\u00A0 And then parallel trees.\u00A0 Certainly have \u0027research\u0027 into advanced composites affect the availability of parts for both trees, but given that this is a spaceflight game, certainly the rocket tree has a lot more branches.\u00A0 Where the rocket tree might go 1--\u0026gt;23---\u0026gt;56---\u0026gt;78910----\u0026gt;12,13,14,15,16, etc. the plane tree might only go 1---------\u0026gt;4------------\u0026gt;11-----------\u0026gt;21 with it offering wings and aerodynamic surfaces and atmosphere breathing engines.\u00A0 Yeah, once you unlock a \u0027science\u0027 thing on the rocket tree you can certainly attach it to your plane - just like you can use basic plane parts on your rockets if you want to.\u00A0 That \u0027sandbox\u0027 crazy contraption feel is important to keep, IMO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224088228\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206763\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221644253252\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022113880\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022shdwlrd\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n32 minutes ago, shdwlrd said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpecifically unlocking plane, rover, and possibly boat parts, they will need to be unlocked much sooner in the progression.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid not think about this while writing the above: but rover (and boat???) parts should be sooner.\u00A0 We have had the wheel for a long time now!\u00A0 Personally, I\u0027d like to see those \u0027progression\u0027 steps be related to one another, as well.\u00A0 Not just throwing a weird \u0027rover wheel\u0027 into something on the \u0027Advanced Rocketry\u0027 Branch - but have it be its own branch;
