Though, my advice would be to have 2 command modules on the landing craft, so that you get 2 sets of experiments. One loaded into each command module. One set is used in the mobile processing plant and another is brought home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-08T14:19:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving to Gameplay

Duna.\u00A0 The lander goes down to the surface, then ascends and docks with the orbiter.\u00A0 Yes?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s a perfectly reasonable mission profile, and lots of

title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn terms of \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eengineering\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, going to Duna is not a lot harder than going to the Mun.\u00A0 It doesn\u0027t need a huge amount more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E overall.\u00A0 Duna has a higher escape velocity, which means you need more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to get off it than ascending from the Mun... but on the other hand, Duna has aerobraking available, so \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elanding\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E is cheaper, which helps to balance that out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy suggestion is to practice on the Mun first, get comfortable with it, make sure you can do the Mun easily and well.\u00A0 Once you can do that, you\u0027re definitely ready for Duna.\u00A0 Assuming that you\u0027re comfortable with the Mun already, things to know about going to Duna:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nNavigation is really important.\u00A0 \u0022Needs only a little more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E than going to the Mun\u0022 is true only if you hit a good launch window.\u00A0 So plan accordingly; my favorite tool for this is \u003Ca

accordingly.\u00A0 (Aerobraking is a lot easier at Duna than at Kerbin.)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLander should take advantage of Duna\u0027s atmosphere.\u00A0 There are various ways to handle Duna landing.\u00A0 My personal favorite:\u00A0 Put on drogue chutes (you\u0027ll almost definitely need them), then a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Esmall\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E number of parachutes (enough to slow you to a few dozen m/s, don\u0027t try to slow to a safe landing speed, you\u0027d have to spam them), and use a brief burst of thrust from your engines just before touchdown to cushion the landing.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBe aware that there\u0027s a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ebig\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E difference in atmosphere thickness with altitude.\u00A0 Specifically, if you\u0027re relying on atmosphere to slow you down for landing, it\u0027s a whole lot harder in the highlands than the lowlands.\u00A0 So you may find life easier if you try to land in the lowlands.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you\u0027re planning on including a mining vessel for refueling, plan on visiting Ike.\u00A0 It\u0027s a lot friendlier than Duna for this.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-08T16:43:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow are some rough numbers for your \u0394v budget.\u00A0 Note that these can vary depending on the specifics of the launch window and your skill at performing the maneuvers efficiently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaunch to Kerbin orbit:\u00A0 3400 m/s\u003Cbr\u003E\nTrans-Duna injection:\u00A0 1100 m/s\u003Cbr\u003E\nDuna orbit insertion:\u00A0 600

not zero either.\u00A0 Aerocapture will get you into some cockamamie orbit that will need to be refined to get\u00A0into a nice stable orbit from which you can perform your landing.\u00A0 You\u0027ll still need to budget something.\u00A0 Landing is performed mostly with parachutes, as Snark described.\u00A0 The 100 m/s budget is to perform a cushioning burn just before touchdown.\u00A0 The budget for rendezvous and docking may or may not be needed\u00A0depending on how the mission is designed.\u00A0\u00A0I\u0027ve budgeted nothing for your arrival back at Kerbin;\u00A0it is assumed you\u0027ll perform a direct reentry.\u00A0 If not, you\u0027ll have to budget something for either Kerbin orbit insertion, or refinement of your orbit following Kerbin aerocapture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s assume we have a disposable launch vehicle that gives you the 3400 m/s needed to get to orbit and no more.\u00A0 Therefore, your Duna vehicle must provide everything else, or about 4000 m/s.\u00A0 That can easily be divided up into two stages.\u00A0 I generally like to use one of two methods:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStage 1 = 1100 m/s for trans-Duna injection \u002B 600 m/s for Duna orbit insertion = 1700 m/s (less if aerocapture is performed)\u003Cbr\u003E\nStage 2 = 50 m/s for deorbit \u002B 100 m/s for landing \u002B 1400 m/s for launch \u002B 650 m/s for trans-Kerbin injection\u00A0= 2200 m/s\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nor\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStage 1 = 1100 m/s for trans-Duna injection \u002B 600 m/s for Duna orbit insertion \u002B 650 m/s for trans-Kerbin injection\u00A0= 2350 m/s (less if aerocapture is performed)\u003Cbr\u003E\nStage 2 = 50 m/s for deorbit \u002B 100 m/s for landing \u002B 1400 m/s for launch \u002B 150 m/s for rendezvous/docking\u00A0= 1700 m/s\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first method is good for something like a simple \u0027plag a flag\u0027 mission.\u00A0 You ditch stage 1 as soon as you reach Duna orbit and pack everything else you need into a single self-contained lander/return/reentry vehicle.\u00A0 It a simple method that doesn\u0027t require any orbital rendezvous and docking.\u00A0 Works well for a small-scale mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second method is as you described, where the lander includes only what is needed to land and get back up to an orbiting mother vehicle.\u00A0 This is good if you want to place some heavy components in orbit that don\u0027t need to go down to the surface,\u00A0such as a science lab.\u00A0 It is a bit more complex because of the need to perform a rendezvous and docking.\u00A0 One of the questions here is whether you have one pod or two.\u00A0 That is,\u00A0is the lander pod separate from the return/reentry pod?\u00A0 The Apollo moon missions used two pods, but you could do it with a single multi-function pod.\u00A0 Just beware that if you abandon the orbiting module during landing that you include a probe core to control it while it is unmanned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that in the second case, designing your vehicle to produce the correct \u0394v can be more challenging because of the complex staging.\u00A0 For example,\u00A0Stage 1 will perform TDI and DOI with a fully fuelled lander attached, while TKI will be performed with no lander, or a fuel-depleted lander.\u00A0 You can\u0027t always trust what the \u0394v readouts say (assuming you\u0027re using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr

staging steps, and it may be necessary to perform some of the \u0394v calculations by hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that it\u0027s possible to transfer some or all of the rendezvous/docking budget from the lander to the orbiter.\u00A0 It is common practice to make the orbiting ship the passive vehicle and the ascending ship the active vehicle, but you don\u0027t have to do it that way.\u00A0 For instance, if you don\u0027t want to pack \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr

come get it.\u00A0 Or you could have one ship perform rendezvous and docking, while the other performs any necessary plane change (assuming some launch error).\u00A0 My\u00A0budget includes 50 m/s (plus \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E) for rendezvous and docking, and 100 m/s for plane change (which is enough to perform up to about a 6-7 degree plane change).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also recommend adding some \u0394v margin to play it safe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset
