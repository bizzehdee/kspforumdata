I think this is what you\u0027re doing, but I\u0027m not quite sure how it works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can use explosive bolts. This is what I do. Here\u0027s an example of how:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Build a top stage or two of 1m parts; for example: Parachute \u002B Cmd MkI \u002B decoupler \u002B fuel tank \u002B liquid engine \u002B decoupler \u002B SAS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Attach a 3m (or whatever - I usually go 3m) fuel tank directly below the SAS. Finish out the stage with some engines or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Now you have an odd-looking rocket with a sharp diameter change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Switch to 2x symmetry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Choose the \u0027explosive bolt\u0027 part from structural. Attach them at the top edge of the 3m tank, on the left and right sides (assuming your default unrotated VAB view is the front) The position and symmetry are important, because the fairing themselves have an orientation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Choose the 3m (or whatever) fairing sides, still in 2x symmetry. Hold these above the bolts until they snap in green. If the orientation is off, go back and adjust the bolts to the correct position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Add more sides and the nose halves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Move the fairing and bolt parts to an appropriate stage, typically after you leave the atmosphere, and before you separate the 1m stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Launch!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have questions, and if these are indeed CaptainSlug\u0027s fairings, the thread is \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=2251.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shagg","CreatedById":6879,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-13T01:00:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been getting an interesting bug lately.
