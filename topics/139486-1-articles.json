So what you wanted to do was leave the drill strictly alone for 6 hours and do other things -- and then come back to the drill after 6 hours and it would have done lots of work while you were gone. If you came back to it too early, then the drill would revert to where it was when you left, and you would lose all that time. (Maybe the batching was done at 0:00 hours every day -- I never examined it to that amount of detail.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it seems different now. In fact, it seems to be about the opposite. If I leave the drill alone for 6 hours, then it stops, retroactively. If I visit it regularly, then it keeps going.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anybody checked this in more detail?
