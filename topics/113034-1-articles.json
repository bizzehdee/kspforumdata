To make a part to which heat flows easily and from which it is radiated easily, you just need ModuleManager. Up the part\u0027s heatConductivity a whole lot (default is 0.12, so try something like 0.60), and if you want to be truly silly, pretend it has bulkheadProfile = size2. Also set emissiveConstant = 1.00. This will yield you a part that is minimally better than a solar panel of the same size at rejecting heat, but which more easily takes heat into itself from the vessel than such a panel, provided the vessel is hotter. It would also be completely irrelevant whether or not the airbrake was deployed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) It would not change their survivability at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) As the airbrakes heat up from reentry heating while deployed into the airstream, they would use their crazy high conductivity to pour the heat into the spacecraft at an alarming rate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make a radiator that can cool its parent below its own temperature and avoids conductive backflow, or to make an airbrake which only works as a radiator while deployed, you need to write a plugin. At that point, you\u0027re probably better off with one of the existing radiator mods. There\u0027s at least two I can think of (Randazzo\u0027s Heat Management and Nertea\u0027s Heat Control / Near Future Electrical).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
