Now, the \u0022Patched\u0022 part means they are glued together as the ship exits SOI of one body and enters another - that\u0027s KSP\u0027s simplification vs real life where the other body still acts upon the ship, meaning the real orbits aren\u0027t pure ellipses or parabolas, but modelling n-body gravity would be far too much, so KSP uses the concept of \u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022 meaning if you\u0027re in Minmus orbit, Kerbin doesn\u0027t act upon you at all. So, patching (pasting end-to-end) the conic curves across multiple SOIs creates a \u0022patched conic\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA side result of this simplification is that KSP has no Lagrangian Points.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nightingale","CreatedById":119307,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T19:24:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBehold \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patched_conic_approximation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe great wiki\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, patched conics is how KSP models gravity calculations - by splitting up each body into a sphere of influence and making an N-body problem into a much simple two-body problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may also hear talk about the \u0022conic patch limit\u0022, which is a setting that says how many sphere of influence changes KSP will display/calculate your trajectory for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EIn-game you\u0027ll see that upgrading the tracking station unlocks \u0022patched conics\u0022, which is nonsense if you read the wiki article I linked to.
