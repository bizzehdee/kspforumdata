Things may break between releases. There will be bugs. Many things are unfinished and/or unoptimized.  \n\nThe test versions are for ironing out bugs in new features and for testing out prototype parts before they are finished; as such they will always have bugs, often severe, and there will often be unfinished parts (no textures, missing features, etc).  Please only use these versions if you wish to contribute to testing and are comfortable with the state of the releases.\n\n**Wiki (WIP)**:  \n[https://github.\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003Ecom\u003C/abbr\u003E/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/wiki](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/wiki)\n\n**Contribution:**  \n  \n**IVA Modeling**:  \n\nSSTU could greatly use someone with interest and experience in modeling IVAs.  If you think you are that person, please contact [Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/) through PM to work out the details.\n\n**Testing:**  \nIf you would like to contribute to pre-release testing (and get to try things out in their pre-release state), please follow the link above; the most recent test version will be at the top. Please submit issue reports for any problems you encounter via the GitHub issues tracker: [https://github.\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003Ecom\u003C/abbr\u003E/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/issues](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/issues) (If you do not report the issue there, it will not be resolved; issues posted in the thread or through PMs will be forgotten about and likely never fixed; so please, do the organized thing and use the bug-tracker).  \n  \n**Configs/Patches:**  \n\nI welcome pull requests and contributions for adding patches for mod compatibility, adding new part configs, or fixing issues in existing part configs.   \n  \n**Documentation:**  \n\nOne very major part of the mod that could greatly benefit from public contributions is the Wiki:  \n[https://github.\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003Ecom\u003C/abbr\u003E/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/wiki](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/wiki)  \n\nWhile this is the \u0027dev version\u0027 wiki, I will be using it to form the basis of the public release wiki; so any/all information and details that can be filled in now will be transferred over to the public release repository and wiki when it is created.  \n  \n**Feedback, suggestions, comments, etc:**  \nPlease feel free to post feedback, suggestions, questions, etc regarding development releases and/or any posted previews. Even if you are not on the testing team, I still value your feedback and suggestions.  Please use the issue tracker for any \u0027official\u0027 feature requests; it may be found at:  [https://github.\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003Ecom\u003C/abbr\u003E/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/issues](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/issues)  \n\n**Bug Reports:**  \nPlease submit issue reports for any problems you encounter via the GitHub issues tracker: [https://github.\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003Ecom\u003C/abbr\u003E/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/issues](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/issues).  No other method for submitting bugs will be supported; posts on the forum or through PM will be forgotten about before I can ever get to them.  Opening up a ticket ensures that your report does not get lost in the forum or forgotten about.  No ticket = no fix.\n\nEnough with the disclaimers, and onto the parts!\n\n**The Parts:**\n\nThe goal of SSTU is to provide low-part count, CPU-efficient parts for common uses. To this end many of the parts are designed with additional integrated functionality beyond the base functions, for instance integrating \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E ports and engine(s) into a fully fledged service module. I have tried to maintain a stock-compatible appearance, though as I am not an artist or modeler (at least not by training/profession), how well this has worked out is subject to opinion.\n\nMaster list of parts; current, planned, the whole lot:\n\n[https://github.\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003Ecom\u003C/abbr\u003E/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/wiki/Parts---Master-List](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/wiki/Parts---Master-List)\n\n**Ship Core: Engines**\n\nA set of engines in many varieties, including pre-built engine clusters. Many more engines, mounting options, and cluster designs will be added over time.\n\n\u003Ciframe data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?app=core\u0026module=system\u0026controller=embed\u0026url=http://imgur.com/a/4TRXu\u0022 style=\u0022height:486px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**Ship Core: Series A**\n\nA set of parts modeled after the Soyuz CSM stack.

Includes representations of SLS upper stack initial configuration, and lifter parts designed in the vein of the lower/core portions. The upper stack is designed to allow for a low-part-count manned orbiter setup, while the lower-stack parts are intended for super-heavy-lift capabilities. Command module and upper-stack are 3.75m, while the lower-stack lifter parts are 5m.\n\n\u003Ciframe data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?app=core\u0026module=system\u0026controller=embed\u0026url=http://imgur.com/a/Qpdar\u0022 style=\u0022height:469px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Ship Core: General**\n\nA line of generic / utility parts.

Also includes a full line of stand-alone solar panels and a \u0027welding\u0027 docking port.\n\n(Album not yet available)\n\n**Craft Files**\n\nNone currently available, will possibly start becoming available when the mod has reached a stable state (not for the foreseeable future).  \n\n**Additional Addon Compatibility and Integration**\n\n**RealPlume** -- Optional but highly recommended.  SSTU includes a set of patches for RealPlume for all engines as well as most other engine-enabled parts.  More will be added over time.  Stock effects are also included, but options and configuration for those are much more limited.  If you want pretty-looking exhaust effects, get RealPlume.\n\n**MechJeb** -- If MechJeb2 is installed, Command Pods (and some service modules) include a built-in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E module.  The tech-unlocks for these are based on the default \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E tech-settings.\n\n**Kerbal Joint Reinforcement** -- As of KSP 1.2\u002B, KRJ is no longer necessary, as the stock Auto-Struts can eliminate most of the wobbles.  Might still have utility on extremely large craft designs, but should no longer be nearly-mandatory.\n\n**\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS** -- Patches for most parts are included, and will be enabled when the requisite mods are installed.  These patches add a few days worth of life-support to each of the pods and some of the service modules. (WIP, needs updating)\n\n**TAC-LS** -- Some patches are included.  Not up to date, and not all parts are patched.\n\n**ConnectedLivingSpace** - A simple CLS patch is included to add CLS passability to all SSTU crewed parts.\n\n**\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E** - Unsupported.

Hopefully a day or two, and I will get you all links / instructions /etc. I\u0027ll see about sending out links to the current dev versions, but please keep in mind that there are a few known issues and that there will be many changes in the next update (save/part breaking changes).\n\nIVAs - as noted, only the Orion CM currently has a finished IVA. The lander pods have blank/unfinished/basic geometry only IVAs, and the Series-C stuff has no IVA at all at the moment. I will be finishing up the lander part IVAs once the rest of the lander parts are finished (textures/coding/configs). Series-C IVAs will likely come after the lander parts are done (don\u0027t even have basic Geo on those, so will take a bit, don\u0027t want to needlessly delay other things).\n\nOn the Orion and Series-C stuff; they are mostly needing config tweaking and another balancing pass before they can be released. As the lander stuff is going to take longer than I had originally anticipated, I will see about putting together releases for the other (finished) parts series later this week/weekend. No reason to hold that stuff back as it won\u0027t be seeing too many/any changes. I guess I should get off my butt and do some config updates instead of coding all night ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nLander parts - have some cool ideas in the works. Currently working on coding a plugin that allows for partmodule swapping (works along-side a mesh-switch module) that will allow for some very interesting part-variant setups for the lander fuel sections (and cleans up some attach-node issues with the current setup). The next testing release is waiting for this to be finished/cleaned up, as the parts in their current-state are kind of a PITA to use and assemble (they do work, but it is not very intuitive)."},{"CreatedByName":"VenomousRequiem","CreatedById":137373,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T16:40:51Z","Content":"Progress reigns on with the Orion CM\u0027s ablator balancing, but I\u0027m having trouble understanding the way the .cfgs are set up! ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nThese custom plug-ins are new to me, but I\u0027ll figure it out.
