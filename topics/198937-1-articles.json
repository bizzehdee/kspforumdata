The first mission was Kerpollo 1 with a Sarnus 5 rocket. (Get it?) That ended out with me not understanding what Delta V is, and didn\u0027t have enough fuel to slow myself down enough with enough fuel to get back to Kerbin. Kerpollo 2 with a Sarnus 5-1 rocket went slightly better. The only problem was that I didn\u0027t have any landing legs, which ended up smashing Jeb and his Mk1 Command Pod onto the Munar surface at 31 meters per second. Kerpollo 3 and the Sarnus 9 rocket didn\u0027t do too good, either. Kerpollo 3 landed sideways, and when I tried to just burn the engine and aim upwards, I accidentally aimed downwards, causing a major catastrophe. Kerpollo 4 and the Sarnus 9-1 was the best mission by far, but wasn\u0027t a success. At this point, I started using Maneuver Nodes. Boy, that helped A LOT. For Kerpollo 4, I chose to just go straight for the Mun and skipped orbiting Kerbin once. I successfully landed, took a Surface Sample, and planted a flag. I got back in my rocket and used Maneuver Nodes to bring myself back to Kerbin. The only problem was that I suck at managing my fuel and Delta V. So, Kerpollo 4 got stuck in an orbit around Kerbin. And finally, my first successful Munar landing, Kerpollo 5 with the Sarnus 9-2 rocket. This worked PERFECTLY. Everything worked as it should\u0027ve and I got to and from the Mu safely. Mission Successful!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theleg","CreatedById":208773,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-23T07:45:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you need to go through some tutorials, you will learn a lot.
