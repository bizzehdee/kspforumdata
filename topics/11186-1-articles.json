After trying it out, I think that three patches should be default, not 2. The two patches is basically like before patched conics, only with a pretty picture of what exactly it will look like."},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-24T07:17:57Z","Content":"Yeah, 3 is probably the best.
