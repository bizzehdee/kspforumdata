I\u0027m not sure if I\u0027ll make that actually part of the truss model or export it as a separate part. In the shots it\u0027s been all been exported (from Unity) as one mesh, but I\u0027m intending for it to be optionally function as a radiator when using Real Fuels cryogenic boiloff and currently radiators don\u0027t function properly unless they are a child part. Literally it only directly drains heat from its parent. Also the Real Fuels radiators are a bit bugged so I\u0027ve been playing with the code in there to figure out the best fix to propose to NathanKell. So I haven\u0027t got a lot done on fixing the texturing on the existing parts. Which I think is really the only thing holding me back at this point. The parts work decently. The truss is a bit poly heavy so I\u0027m looking at maybe trimming that down but I\u0027m not seeing a lot I can do as it\u0027s just a high resolution piece.

The picture below shows it attached to a 10 meter \u0027docking target\u0027. Again, that\u0027s just RSS scale. There will be a stock sized version but I\u0027m not sure what size that will be except that it would be larger than 2.5m tanks. Not sure if it would be large enough to require the multiple docking nodes that I\u0027m experimenting with. You can see in the picture there are four textured areas that represent docking latches. Each one is a separate docking port to make it easier to line the rings with each other. That\u0027s been done in other part packs though I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s been done with something 10 meters in diameter so it gets a bit touchy.

I\u0027m not sure if that will be an actual part I make or not. Currently I\u0027m trying to implement it entirely through Procedural Fairings combined with Deadly Re-entry\u0027s heat shields. So a couple of days have been trying to actually make something out of existing parts \u002B PF that could survive a Duna drop. So far I have not been successful. (fairings do NOT like being turned into heat shields and I\u0027m not even sure DRE is even accurately determining the contents of the fairing are even protected). Finally, radiators for Real Fuels, because hydrogen tanks want to boiloff. Real Fuels has radiators but they currently need to be a child part. They don\u0027t directly cool anything that is not their immediate parent.

(seeing as how one of Copernicus missions involved asteroid interception). Can\u0027t give a good ETA right now; I have to rework the scaling (see below) and go through and adjust masses for the rescaled parts. It\u0027s no fun trying to raise a 2.5m tank that has a dry mass of 22 tons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo recap, these are the parts I\u0027m currently working with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehab adapter, meant to allow attachment of things like inflatable habs or whatever you want to the trusses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esaddle truss: meant to have a drop tank mounted in it but could have other things mounted on the outside or inside. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehalf saddle truss. Half sized version of the above, but no mounting point for tanks. (could add one later if there\u0027s desire for it but it\u0027s meant as a storage area of garage for smaller craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edrop tank. Mounts directly to the full sized saddle truss. Both of them connect in the form of docking nodes. decoupling requires action groups. Will not stage unless you use a radial decoupler. Technically, it could be refilled and reconnected but that\u0027s up to individual imagination. (KAS grappling would be a good fit here)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking rings to be mounted either at the ends of the trusses or in the truss adapter ring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETruss Adapter ring allows connecting a docking ring to a fuel tank but also contains batteries and avionics so parts with this. If you\u0027ve seen the Copernicus or Constellation videos then you may have seen fuel tanks with nuclear engines and solar panels launched for later rendezvous with trusses or other parts. The adapter ring is meant to help facilitate that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELatest on these parts is I now have everything rescaled (from the default 10m) to 5m, 3.75m and 2.5m. Some use MODEL{} nodes and because of the rescale bug involved with that had to do some rescaleFactor trickery. This is the first time I\u0027ve done this on such a scale so was unaware of the rescale bug that happens IFF the part is root and you revert to launch pad. (scales back up to its original sizeI guess). So I have to go back through them and rescale everything the old fashioned way, but that means rescaling all attachment nodes by hand, which is sucky tedium.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat else.... multiple textures will be available for the drop tank but it will have foil normal map#4 by default. It is also configured to make use of the reflective shader plugin if you have it installed, and I recommend the build I released, which has the option of non-realtime reflections, or procedural environment mapping: That\u0027s the term I prefer for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, screenshot of the hab adapter with some texture reworking: (actually it\u0027s four half trusses, 10m, 5m, 3.75m and 2.5m with matching hab adapters)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/ug4lKg1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ug4lKg1l.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ug4lKg1l.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deathsoul097","CreatedById":77396,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-26T07:12:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you done the propulsion block?
