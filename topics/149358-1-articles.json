I had learned that someone had taken an old mod and edited its file or something along that line to make it compataible with the current version of the game. Sadly the Creator of The Stanford Tourses ( Michealhester07) is no longer maintaing the mod, which is a shame beacuse he/she was had very intriguing ideas for mods. \u00A0I was wondering if anyone would educate me in how to edit a file so a mod would be compatible with the game\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is a Fourm I found of a person updating ZZZ parts collection mod.
