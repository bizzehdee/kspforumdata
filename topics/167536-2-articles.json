Round 2 of 8: Port Vargo, Tekkia\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CWhat\u2019s going to happen with the weather?\u201D A reporter asked me. I gritted my teeth and resisted saying \u201COh, gee, get your phone out and \u003Cem\u003ECHECK\u003C/em\u003E!\u201D, thinking that would put a \u003Cem\u003Eslight\u003C/em\u003E damper on my reputation of being an open, reporter-friendly guy to be around. \u201CWe don\u2019t really know,\u201D I replied, telling the truth. \u201CIf our reports are correct, the rain could hit anywhere from 20 minutes ago to next week. The RADAR\u0027s not really telling the guys back in River City what\u2019s happening, so we really can\u2019t get accurate readings. My personal guess would be anywhere from the 25% mark all the way out to after the race. All depends on the wind, though.\u201D The reporter thanked me, and I went on my way.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Port Vargo, Tekkia is pretty close to the equator. It\u2019s normally pretty warm, but the coastal winds tended to dial down the heat factor a tad. The nice, salty fresh spray getting blown in tended to make things bearable, as opposed to say\u2026. The Temple, where it felt like your face was melting. Today though, the weather was freakishly cold.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0The wind was still here, but dark grey clouds had rolled in before Practice 1 started, and they\u2019d stayed. They completely blanked out the sun, and it was so dark that the officials were considering turning on the lights for the second half of the race. I looked out at the ocean, which was looking choppier by the minute. In the skies, it was clouds as far as the eye could see. I saw some rain bands way off in the distance, where the clouds were even darker. Through the clouds, I saw some flashes of lightning waaaaaaaaaaaaay off.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CMight want to get ready,\u201D Andy put his hand on my shoulder as he walked up, scaring the living daylights out of me. I stifled a yelp, and turned to him. \u201CYeah.. Yeah, I guess.\u201D I started walking, and I heard some thunder way off. Uh oh\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0I hit the gas again and felt the rears skitter a bit as I launched out of Turn 14 on the formation lap. The clouds looked more and more dicy as the time went on, and I knew everyone else was equally nervous. Before I\u2019d set off, I had seen at least 5 drivers and a massive amount of crew members staring up into the clouds. The crowd cheered me on, and I responded by wiggling the rear for them. Then, we went down the backstraight.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0I went into the final corner, and I saw a bright flashing off in the distance. \u003Cem\u003EWas it getting closer?\u003C/em\u003E The final cars slotted into the grid space, and I got ready.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0One Light turned on. \u003Cem\u003ENo pressure.\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Two. \u003Cem\u003EJust a normal day at the office.\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Three. \u003Cem\u003EIt\u2019s just a bit cold, that\u2019s all.\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Four. \u003Cem\u003EWhy are you worrying about this?\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Five. \u003Cem\u003EOH CRAP! THE RACE!!!\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0I had forgotten to get Rich revs ready, and as soon as the lights went out I was a sitting duck on the grid. Max, Sammy, Lolli, and Nico all blasted past me on the grid before I had gotten up to speed. I had gone from 1st to 5th in the space of 100 feet! I shook my head and beard down, preparing to enter the corners. I went into Turn 1, and slid past Nico, who had to brake from Lolli slamming on the brakes ahead.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Then into Turn 2, I had caught up to the tail end of Lolli, but she was \u003Cem\u003Ejust\u003C/em\u003E able to keep me from slipping around on the outside. The cars snaked through Turns 3 and 4, but now we were onto the backstraight. I blasted past Lolli with ease, and Nico followed me past. Into the 6/7 chicane, I held back and a large chunk of debris flew across the track. I shot down to the inside of the track to avoid it, but I heard a loud crack as the right side of my wing clouted the thing. In 8, Sammy went way wide, and I took the advantage- slipping up the inside to P2. Max was already way ahead, and by Turn 9 he was almost a full second ahead.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CCome on\u2026.\u201D I weaved the car through the City Section, and through 14, disaster struck Max. When I went through the turn, I saw a huge streak of smoke, dirt and grass flying across the track. Max had spun out and had clear cut the track, and he was facing backwards in Turn 15. From my angle, I saw chunks of rubber strewn across the outside portion of the braking zone, and Max\u2019s right rear tire was in pieces. I easily went past, and as I clipped the apex for 14 I got rewarded with a mud clod to the face visor. Still turning at about 70 miles an hour, I ripped the tear-off from the visor and threw it out the side area of the cockpit.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Now, I was clear ahead with nothing to stop me from taking this easy win. Onto Lap 5, I saw a droplet smash into my visor. \u003Cem\u003EWtheck\u003C/em\u003E? I went through the city section, and there it was again- another splash. Then another. \u201CIt\u2019s sprinkling in Sector 2,\u201D I radioed in, letting the team know. Entering Turn 16, it happened\u003Cem\u003E again\u003C/em\u003E! By the time I was out of Turn 19, it was a steady rain. Still not bad enough for any stoppage, though. \u201CIs the grip bad?\u201D Andy asked. \u201CIt\u2019s fine for now, but the slicks are going to go off in a bit. When do you think we should get the wets?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CI\u2019d say in about 2, maybe 3 laps. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wet enough for the full wets though- maybe Inters?\u201D As soon as he said that, I had a heart-attack moment out of Turn 3. The car lost all grip through the corner, and I sawed the wheel to regain control. I managed to hold onto it, thou only just.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CBoxing this lap,\u201D I said quickly. As soon as I turned in for 4, the car again lost it, but this time I couldn\u2019t save it. The car spun around once, twice, and then a third time, before it half-spun into the runoff road\u2019s grass patch. The car rumbled over the grass with a monstrously loud \u003Cem\u003EBUMPBUMPBUMPBUMP\u003C/em\u003E, before it slid to a stop on the actual access road. Even though I was running slick tires, water splashed up into the cockpit. \u003Cem\u003EGOOD GRAVY THAT\u2019S COLD!\u003C/em\u003E My leg shouted at me as I got back onto the track. That lap was utter torture, and I had only completed 4 corners. I got back onto the racing line, and in my mirror I saw a flash of orange. Nico had done the same thing I had- backing into the Turn 4 runoff road at huge speed. I tried not to laugh, realizing that I too had looked that stupid about 10 seconds ago. I cautiously turned into Turn 5- going about 20 miles per hour slower than I would have, when my steering wheel lights turned scarlet red. \u003Cem\u003EWell then\u2026\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CAlright Jeb, Red Flag. Field is frozen; come into the pits. Please don\u2019t tear up the car on the way in.\u201D I pulled off to the right side of the road and turned off Rich Revs; instead opting for Ultra-Lean, a mixture which used about 1/8th of the torque of Standard Revs. Nico was right behind me, and his car looked muddier than a pig exiting 5.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0After much cursing, sliding, and going around the track at almost 25 miles per hour, I finally slid my way into the pit lane. The team had an umbrella set up for me, and I got out as they lifted the car up onto a jack. I hopped off of the car, took the umbrella, and walked back along the lane to talk with Nico.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201C4\u2019s a right \u003Cem\u003EB Wor\u003C/em\u003Et, eh?\u201D Nico asked as he too got out. \u201CYeah, I-\u201C I tried to reply, before I busted out laughing. \u201C\u003Cem\u003EWas?\u003C/em\u003E\u201D Nico asked, before I pointed at his car\u2019s rear. \u201CLook at your car!\u201D He went to the back and shouted, \u201C\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWAS IN DER WELT GESCHIEHT ZU MEINEM AUTO?!?!?!?!?!?!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u201D And he put his hands on his head in shock. His once bright-orange, juice-sponsored Flavormobile (As we all joked with him about) was covered in a hideous brown smear covering the bottom half of the car. I was bent over laughing, trying to catch my breath. Then, he pointed at \u003Cem\u003Emy\u003C/em\u003E car, and started laughing.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0I turned and saw my once beautiful matte-finished Blue and White speed demon was covered in ugly dark brown streaks all over the rear, front, and sides of the entire surface. \u201CWhat the cr-\u201C I was interrupted by a slow noise coming over the intercom. It sounded a bit too quiet to be the intercom though.. I turned around and saw Max holding one of those portable speakers, which he set on the ground. \u201CCome on, Jeb!\u201D He challenged me. \u201CDance-off!\u201D By now all the crews were out in the pit lane, and were watching. I popped my collar out and walked over, making the OTech crew guys cheer for me.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Immediately I twisted down and planted my hand and spun around on it. I stayed like that for a while- transferring the weight between my left and right hand. Finally, I pushed off my hands and braced my feet below. I leaped up, and the team cheered me on.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Max was about to go, but then Lolli put her hand on Max\u2019s chest and nodded, as if to say \u201CHang on- I got this.\u201D She took Max\u2019s phone and played some different music. The music felt really happy- I\u2019d guess Kirish, maybe Keltic. We all clapped in time to the beat, and then she smiled. Lolli clapped twice, in time to the music, and she began hopping around. I looked down at her feet, and they were a bouncing flurry of clicks and clacks. She went on for a couple minutes, before finally stopping. She was panting for air, and gave a curtsy. We all cheered and clapped, and she gave one final bow before joining everyone else on the side. Max shook his head, and stepped out of the ring. Everyone cheered, and I held Lolli\u2019s fist up- like those wrestlers on TV.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CThe Winner!\u201D I shouted, and the entire Redwind Team clapped and applauded. Max fiddled with his phone, and played some slow music. \u201CPick a partner!\u201D He shouted. Suddenly, I swear to you, Alexis just materialized right next to me. She tapped my shoulder, and I smiled. \u201CMay I have this dance?\u201D I asked. Alexis extended her hand. \u201COf course,\u201D She said. I took her hand and we led ourselves to the center. It was a nice slow dance- a waltz by the sound of it. We spun and danced around, and the other crews were also dancing around. Finally, the song ended, and my face was literally like an inch from Alexis\u2019s. Some rain hit down on us, but I didn\u2019t notice it. I felt an electric feeling in the air, and a huge, crackling boom, and a brilliant flash of light blinded me for a brief second. The boom almost deafened me as it crackled and rumbled. As soon as the light stopped, a huge crack split the air, and everyone dove to the ground. Just about 500 feet in front of me, a lightning rod sparked, and a couple bricks fell off of the roof of an apartment building across the road.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CWhooooaaahhhohoho!!!!\u201D I said, staring at the building. We split apart in surprise, and a couple people slowly got up. \u201CThat was close!\u201D Max shouted as we started running to cover. \u201CToo close,\u201D Alexis agreed. \u201CWho\u2019s up for a round of Kadden?\u201D I asked. Immediately, at least 15 hands shot up. At least we\u2019d have something to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E2 Hours into the Rain Delay\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CThird down and a mile,\u201D The commentator said. \u201CFans\u201D cheered through the speakers, and I looked up.

Then, I saw a wide-open hole on the left- right between the tackle and guard. I jammed Right Trigger, and Dak sprinted through the pocket. First down was at the 26. He sprinted through, and went straight along the right sideline. \u201CNo!\u201D Max shouted, switching characters to get Dak. He kept on running. A Corner was coming up on me. I waited until the last moment, and juked left, sending Max\u2019s character shooting past me. I grinned. 20! 15! 10! 5! TOUCH-\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0A linebacker flew out of nowhere and slammed into Dak at maximum velocity, and he went flying out of bounds. \u201CGAH DANGIT!\u201D I shouted, throwing the controller down on the couch. I called a timeout with 1 second left on the game clock. \u201CHaha!!\u201D Max cheered. \u201C1st and Goal from the 1!\u201D I shook my head and gritted my teeth.

The car\u2019s shadow repeated over and over again as it went past the spotlights- the sky so dark we couldn\u2019t see anything without them. I slowed the pack down and watched the car retreat off down the long Turn 18-19 stretch, and it turned right off the track about 10 seconds later. The engine quietly hummed, waiting to be unleashed. I warmed it up, and looked at the light boards next to the track. A green light flashed, telling me it was okay to go. I held back just a bit, and kept the field backed up. Then, on exit of Turn 19, I unleashed. Full throttle, Rich Revs, EPB- all going as I shot out of the corner. I flung forward and left everyone else struggling through the corner- trying to figure out how to get up to speed. I slowed easy into Turn 20, and then blasted through the 21/22 chicane.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0On lap 18, I pulled into the pits. The rain reflected the bright lights, and I watched as the car got partially refueled. The jack dropped and I powered out of the pit stall with ease. Re-entering the track was\u2026 weird. Port Vargo\u2019s got an interesting pit lane, where you make a 90 degree turn into the pit lane, and go around a building. Then, you exit out of that area, and make \u003Cem\u003Eanother\u003C/em\u003E 90 degree turn. It\u2019s all really confusing, but with practice I was able to make it work kind of okay. Now, I had a smooth open gap to extend. The rain had all-but stopped now, and the \u201CRooster Tail\u201D formed by the tires and the aerodynamics was slowly going away. However, the car still had a lot of grip. On lap 23 the car had it\u2019s first little oversteer moment- the rear slipping just a bit when I tried to flat-line Turn 20. It didn\u2019t matter though, and I muscled my way out of it. And, because I\u0027m feeling generous, I\u2019m going to give you a track lap, describing what a lap around Port Vargo, Tekkia looks like.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0It\u2019s a really short front straight- about 5 or 6 hundred meters. The actual finish line is halfway between the chicane, but we still call it Turn 22. Into Turn 1, brake nice and late into the corner. You\u2019ve got to be really confident going in, because the corner tightens up immensely through the braking zone. Turn 1 itself is wide. It\u2019s a long, sweeping turn that has a lot of grip. On the exit, hold as right as possible. Of course you want to carry over the momentum from mid-corner, but you\u2019ve got to set yourself up for Turn 2. Turn 2 is tighter than 1. Grass on the inside and the outside mean that you\u2019ve got to slow down for the corner. If you are unfortunate enough to hit the grass or curbing, you could end up spinning off into the wall or the outside grass. Turn 3 is a lot like Turn 1. Make sure not to get too greedy with the curbing, though, as clipping just a bit too much could snap off your Right Front. 4 is eerily similar to 2. Ultra tight entry and exit are compounded by a simple grassy runoff (The same place I spun out earlier). Then you head down a moderately long straight, which is surrounded by buildings that echo the car noises around. Then, you head into Turn 5. A scarily tight corner, 5 is a straight 90. Run too far inside and you\u2019ll hit a building. Run too far outside and you\u2019ll get eaten by a sand trap, which is naturally formed by the desert. The second-longest straight on the track is between 5 and 6. It\u2019s fairly open, but the desert\u0027s sand trap can cause troubles if you spin.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Now the 6/7 Chicane. Try to be moderate with the curbing- too much and you\u2019ll either spin or at least get up on 2 wheels. Next you head through Turn 8. A 90 degree right-hander takes you around the \u201CFrying Pan\u201D of the track. Then you\u2019re into 9, which is just like 8- a tight 90 degree righty.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A010 and 11 is a double-apex turn that starts the City Section. The corner drastically tightens up through Turn 11, and has little room for a runoff. Turn 12 is the start of the \u201COfficial\u201D City Section, which is almost a carbon-copy of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u2019s R\u0026amp;D section. A short straight takes you under a bridge, and then it\u2019s onto 13 and 14. 13 starts out ultra wide, but drastically closes up in 14- a left-handed hairpin. 15 is right after 14, and you should try to straight-line the two corners as best you can. 15 is another tight turn, and then you head into the almost straight Turn 16.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Turn 17 starts the Uber-fast final few turns. 17 is a tight right-hander, with a slight grass runoff to the side. Then you go onto another medium-length straight, and go into 18. Turn 18 is a hard left-hander that will absolutely eat your lunch if you aren\u2019t careful. You go down the longest straight on the circuit. The straight is surrounded by buildings on either side, and the noise is incredible. Turn 19 is a massive long sweeper, which you can try to take flat-out if you\u2019re feeling like it. Next is Turn 20. The straight for Turn 20 is really thin, so you\u2019re going from almost 75 meters per second down to almost 35. Then it\u2019s the Chicane. The two are incredibly fast, and it\u2019s pretty normal to see drivers take it flat-out.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0I blasted out of 22 and punched my fist up into the air. \u201CWOOOHHHOOOOOOOO!!!\u201D I shouted as I passed the flag stand. Some flares popped up into the air, and I weaved down the straight as the team cheered me on. \u201CGet in!!\u201D Andy exclaimed. \u201CExcellent job, mate- absolute masterclass.\u201D I went into Turn 2 and did some celebratory doughnuts on the outside portion of the track. Definitely an improvement over last year.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DarkOwl57","CreatedById":161624,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-14T20:25:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[I dun goofed] Enjoy Chapter 9 (And 9.5)!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter 9: Going Up\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E2 Weeks Later.

The Owlian National Anthem (Hail to Owlia- a really happy and inspiring piece. Except for that little bit where it says people are going to die for their country) played over the speakers, and I sang along to it. When it ended, I grabbed the champagne at my feet and popped the cork open.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Bubbly liquid sprayed out of the bottle, and confetti fell down.

Responding like any normal kerbal would to getting shot in the ear with a cold liquid substance, and he bent his neck to cover the ear before turning and aiming it at me.

I laughed. \u201CSure, buddy.\u201D Alexis and I walked out and over to Alexis\u2019s new office.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Her office was just a little bit larger, and was beautifully lit. Another massive window illuminated everything in the room. There was a nice little sitting area, a tiny counter with a coffee machine, and her desk had a modern phone, the latest computer, and it was all laid out in a perfectly organized system. \u201COh. My. God. This is unbelievable!! Look at this space!! And the lounge! Andthedeskandthechairandthewindowandthebalconyandthecoffeemachineand-\u201C I carefully walked out and quietly closed the door behind myself, walking out to my new office. Down the hall aways, the hallway ended, and there was a single door. \u003Cem\u003EA corner office\u2026\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0I carefully opened up the door, and peeked in. There was a massive window, which illuminated the entire office regardless of the light switch. Lights ringed the upper outside part of the wall- It\u2019s called trim, my editor tells me- and the floor was a brilliant marble tile. I had a great couch, with a flatscreen that was at least a 50 inch. On my desk, there was a large computer, and next to the computer there was a laptop that glowed blue. I saw the ITech logo on the back, and I smiled. I got my bag (Filled with my 2034 Formula K trophy, all my race winners trophies (Including my seconds and thirds), my helmet, and my lucky gloves), and stepped in. As soon as my right foot entered the room, I saw a kerbal pop up from behind the desk. His hair was a mess, he looked slightly crazy, there were coffee stains on his shirt, and there was a red mark that looked suspiciously like a hand on his left cheek. I tried to keep from laughing as I waved.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CI can see why you liked it so much,\u201D I said, ignoring the fact that he was probably not all that sane. \u201CBeautiful view.\u201D I could see out at the parking lot and over towards Greater Baskay Bay. If I squinted, I could just \u003Cem\u003Ebarely\u003C/em\u003E see the plains of Baskay Island. Some coastal towns below bustled with life. \u201CWhat are you doing here?\u201D Ricklen asked, sounding both angry and terrified at the same time. \u201CDidn\u2019t they tell you?\u201D I asked, setting my helmet on the stand. \u201CThis is my office now!\u201D He made a quiet, squeaking whimper that sounded like a squeaky toy getting run over by a dump truck. \u201CY-\u2026. \u003Cem\u003EYou?!\u003C/em\u003E\u201D He whispered. I nodded, and extended my hand for a shake.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CBetter kerb won?\u201D I asked, just like he had a year and a half ago. His eyes bugged out to the size of about a dinner plate, and he stormed out of the room. I held my arm out for another second, before running over to the couch and falling down on it. \u003Cem\u003EOh yeah\u003C/em\u003E, I thought to myself. \u003Cem\u003EThis is the life!\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0I laid down on the couch and sighed. Then, a knock sounded at the door. \u201CAnyone in here?\u201D A familiar muffled voice asked from behind the door. \u201CShoot.\u201D I leaped up and sprinted to my desk, attempting to look like I was doing \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E.

He was wearing a zip-up jacket and some jeans, boots, and a massive cowboy hat. I was his biggest fan when I was like 13. \u201COh\u2026. Uh\u2026..

The fans roared their approval, and some flares shot up into the air. The show in K1 was so much bigger than it was in Formula, and it seemed like you couldn\u2019t move without someone taking your photo. It was the true underdog story: the little 19-year-old kid, demoted to Formula and in to pair the senior driver, a 4-time champion. The reporters were falling over themselves to interview me, and I just kept on giving the answers. Now, I walked to my car. I was lined up 3rd on the grid, behind Phil and Danny. I strapped into the car and felt the wheel. There was a lot more buttons and dials and switches on the wheel, and instead of being behind the wheel, the tach was now on the wheel. The 3F engine was humming behind me, and the top half of the mirrors was obscured by the huge rear wing.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CAlright Jeb, first race. Remember, don\u2019t be aggressive. We don\u2019t want to wreck out on the opening lap.\u201D I nodded and gave Andy a thumbs-up. The team took the tire blankets off the car, and I felt the car set down. The suspension resisted just a bit, and the fifth red light turned on. Then, the inner two lights switched to green, and we set off on the formation lap.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0I went into the first two corners and weaved around. The sky was perfectly clear, the fans had sold out the grandstands, and I saw at least 4 or 5 fans waving poster boards cheering me on. I went into the S section of Turns 5 and 6, and I felt the car hold the grip perfectly. I rumbled over the curbing and emerged at the top of the hill. I heard a rumbling, and turned the engine down. It was singing.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0I looked out over to the fans, who were waving their hands in time to the music, which was being pumped out through the massive speakers. I smiled and started singing along as I went down the outer straight. \u201CHeeeeey, oh, heyoo. Hooooo, oh ehoooo!\u201D I joined, moving my hand to the music as well. The fans loved it. I think I could get used to this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0One light came on, and the engines fired to life.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Two. \u003Cem\u003EI.

It was a long run into Turn 1, and I managed to fly past Danny long before the braking boards showed up. I peeked down to the inside, but I went back up, holding position behind Phil through Turns 1 and 2. The engine was so powerful that I was a bit quick in getting back on the gas, and that really messed up my momentum through Turn 2. I jammed the gas out of the exit, but Phil had gotten a good gap out- about half a second.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Quick word on the cars. They\u2019re super different from the Formulas. Difference One: The engine. In Formula, OTech had a E6-2F engine. 6 Batteries, 2 Engine units that produced around 40 kN of thrust, not including the EPB. In K1, OTech has an E8-3F engine. 8 Batteries, 3 Engine units producing up to 60kN, depending on the altitude of the track (Tracks like Eradica and Halco, which was farther north, would result in less engine power, while tracks like Port Vargo, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, and other low altitude tracks would mean more power). Second is the size. In K1, the cars are much wider. Also, the rear wings are much lower- almost half a meter depending on the team. In Formula, teams ran with the pillars going straight up into the air- vertical. This resulted in a lot less wake coming off the car in front, allowing for better chasing, a bit more grip at the rear, and lower speeds. In K1, the rear wing is drastically lowered, and there are a lot more aero bits on the rear, allowing for more grip. Third is that at the front of the car, K1 cars have 2 front wings. In Formula, you were limited to only the bottom deck wing. In K1, teams ran one front wing on top of the other, which increased grip even more. Fourth, and finally was the wonderful addition of DRS. DRS, the Drag Reduction System (Go back to Chapter 2 to know what I\u2019m talking about), is placed on the longest straights. In practice, you can run DRS wherever you want. In the race, however, you can only use DRS on the longest straights of the track. Most tracks have 2 DRS zones, but some have more. Example: Owlia has 3 zones. The Outer Straight, the Back Straight, and the Front Straight. Anyways, now that I\u2019m done describing K1 cars to you, back to the race.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0I held behind Phil, and looked back in my mirror. Fortunately for me, the huge rear plate created a load of wake, keeping Danny behind me. Unfortunately, Phil also had the rear plate, which was creating bad wake for me. I almost oversteered through Turn 4, and decided to hold myself back through the S. Up out of Turn 6, I felt my stomach bottom out as the car had the least amount of grip. The car was flying up at about a massive 15\u00BA, and now it leveled out. My car went back down, but I had felt myself lift up a bit. \u003Cem\u003E24 More times of that,\u003C/em\u003E I thought as I went into 7 and 8, a double right-hander. Phil had slowed down a bit for 8, but I kept my foot in it, mounting a curb and gaining a ton of time. Then there was a fast Left-Right-Left twist, and we all slowed down for it. There was another short straight (About 500 meters) before we hit the widest and fastest corner on the track- Turn 12. It was just like OTech\u2019s Turn 5- massive banking, flat-out, and exhilarating. Phil tilted for the banking first, sparks flying off the under tray of his car as it bottomed out. I hit it next and felt the aero come alive, shoving the car down and giving me all the grip I needed. I glanced down at the tach for the first time all race and my eyes bugged out. I was hitting almost 190 miles per hour. I held in the slipstream of Phil, gaining just a little bit. Then we all hit the brakes for the right-handed hairpin, which would lead us onto the backstraight. I was thrown forward against my belts as I went from 198 mph down to about 30. I locked up a bit, but kept myself in check through the corner. I rumbled over the tiny curbing on the inside of the track, and used as much power as I could out of the turn. I had gained time on Phil through the high-speed section, and now it was on to the 1.1 kilometer long back straight. I opened up DRS, and the car rocketed forward with all the drag basically gone. I held just behind Phil for as long as I dared, before cutting to the outside of the straight. The fans roared as I made the overtake. Phil slipped in behind me, trying to get a piece of my slipstream.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Into the Turn 14 Hairpin, I braked a bit early. Phil followed suit, and we flowed through the corner. The fans cheered as I came through the corner, and crossed the line for another lap.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CAlright, good job. Let\u2019s try to get a gap out now,\u201D Andy said from the pit box as I passed.\u003Cem\u003E I can do this.

In an instant, the car had been lifted up, and the tires changed. Fuel was finally added, and now I waited. Finally, the green light came on and I flew out of the spot, tires squealing as I left. A car engine screamed past, and I felt to P4. I was the first car to pit, so of course I would fall down a few places. I got out of the pit lane and rejoined the track, before slowing for Turn 1. I was about 2 seconds behind the nearest car, but now that I had fresh tires I could charge. As the laps dwindled down, everyone hit the pits. 3rd. 2nd. On Lap 19, an astonishingly long first stint ended for Phil as he came into the pit. I slowed for Turn 14 and came out, running as wide as possible on exit. Phil completed the stop, and he popped out of the pit lane almost exactly tied with me. He had the inside for the first turn and got a gap out to me. \u003Cem\u003EGosh dangit.\u003C/em\u003E I was a kerbal on a mission, running after Phil as hard as I could.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0I shot past the finish line to start lap 25- the final lap. Phil had fallen back a bit, and now I was within half a second from him. \u201CCome on\u2026\u201D I flew down the straight, and braked hard into Turn 1. \u201CJeb..\u201D Andy said in a warning tone. \u201CDon\u2019t do anything stupid..\u201D I went into Turn 2 and rumbled over the apex curbing. \u201CJust leave me alone,\u201D I said as I powered out of the turn. \u201CI know what I\u2019m doing.\u201D Into Turn 3, I held my pace with Phil, and slowly gained. \u003Cem\u003ECome on baby, don\u2019t fail me now.\u003C/em\u003E I hit the brakes for Turn 4 and locked up a tad. The right front spat smoke into my face, but I didn\u2019t care. I turned into the corner and clipped the center beautifully, gaining on Phil just a little bit. Then we came to the S section. For whatever reason, I gained on Phil rapidly through the middle of Turn 5, and now I was right on his tail. I lifted up a ton out of 6, and the car slammed down onto the ground, jarring me and making my teeth slam together.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Into 7 and 8, I mounted the curbing so hard I almost got up on 2 wheels- desperation building. 9, 10, and 11. My right wheel clipped the grass on the inside at over 140 miles an hour, and I gained like\u2026 5 feet. \u003Cem\u003EI am not going to lose this race.\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0I activated Rich revs and went through 12. I was again gaining time.. The tach climbed past 170. 180. 185. 190. 195. 198\u2026 The speed burst past 200 moments before the braking zone came up. I slammed the brakes and the rear end slammed down as the aero pushed me down, regaining grip. I flew around the outside of Phil and almost missed the corner. Phil went up my inside through the hairpin, but I didn\u2019t see him there. I turned down and felt a huge crash, and in my mirror I saw pieces of my right-side push board fly into the air. I turned the wheel hard left and corrected, but Phil was still up my inside. Now, I used EPB, Rich Revs, DRS, and shoved myself down into the seat in an attempt to pass Phil. I was on the left and Phil was literally inches from me. He was trying to shove me down into the grass, but I kept in it. Rubber marbles shot up into the air and pelted my visor. I saw the boards and the game of chicken began. Who would brake first?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0The 300 board shot past.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0250.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0200.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0150.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0100. At the 50, I slammed the brakes, slowing drastically from 196 mph. Phil flew past me and almost went into the pit lane, and I clipped the apex through the turn. I went out of the turn and Phil was right behind me. I was 300 meters from glory. 250. 200. The team was out on the wall, fist pumping and cheering. 100. The crowd roared as I passed them. 0. The checkered flag swished down above me, and the crowd cheered as fireworks went off above me. \u201C\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYES!!!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u201D I screamed into the radio. \u201C\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EYESYESYES!!!!!

I partially unstrapped my belts and raised myself up to wave to the crowd. Phil lined up next to me and waved. I fiddled with my radio for a brief second and got the channel up. \u201CGreat job, kiddo,\u201D He said to me as we rounded Turn 2. Can we just take a moment to thank the person who decided that driver-to-driver radios should be a thing?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CTh-\u2026 Thanks man!\u201D I said, getting a bit choked up.

It sounded like\u2026 Oh for the love of kerb. \u201CAh, hang on a second,\u201D I said, pulling off to the side of the road. \u201CGotta do something real quick.\u201D I got onto a nice wide stretch of pavement well off the racing line. There, I stopped. The crowd was silent, and when I looked back, Phil and the rest of the 22-car grid was waiting, curious. I exhaled. \u201CPlease have fuel..\u201D I muttered as I flipped the dials. Finally, it was all done. The crowd remained silent, and I hit the gas.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0The engine screamed like a tortured animal- it\u2019s F3 engine yowling louder than a fighter jet during takeoff. I twisted the wheel as far left as it would go, and the rears broke traction. I spun a full 180, and momentarily saw only white smoke, before the car lurched forward and began spinning left again. \u201CYeah!!\u201D I punched my fist up into the air, and the crowd coved it.

It\u2019s sharp features hadn\u2019t been dulled with age one bit. It was in a beautiful snow-white paint, but some trim features were accented in a sky-blue paint. It was the M Version too- M for Modified. At the rear, there was a sharp rear spoiler, which looked very similar to the K1 cars. It had a shark fin (Just like the K1 car), and I saw that it was partially opened up at the rear. Another picture was dedicated 100% to the engine. V12, Stage 2 turbocharger, 6.4 Liters, 8-gear transmission, over 15,000 RPM, and over 680 Kermpower. It had been updated from the 2029 engine from 670 to 680, aided by a new carburetor head.

I was about to give her a scathing retort, a particularly perky receptionist chirped, \u201CHi there,\u201D cutting me off. \u201CYou\u2019re Jebediah Kerman, right?\u201D She pointed to a door that said \u201CSTUDIOS 1A-4C\u201D on the top of the doorsill. \u201C3D- 6th door on the right.\u201D She couldn\u2019t have been more than 17- probably working a summer internship job. \u201CThanks,\u201D I said, walking to the door.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0I walked into the studio and saw a bunch of workers just\u2026 well\u2026 Working.

She had been absolutely ruthless in the \u201CNegotiations,\u201D which was basically Alexis making demands while Jim struggled to keep up. \u201CWell that was fun,\u201D I said truthfully as we walked. Not only was I getting paid a really huge amount of money (Not that I really needed it), but I also got to drink soda for like 30 minutes.

Alexis\u2019s hair blew a bit in the breeze, and it caught just right along the sunset. I could see just a bit of the warm glowing sun, and I looked at it. The ball formed a look above Alexis similar to a halo above her head. \u201CSome sunset, huh?\u201D Alexis asked, staring up at the sky. \u003Cem\u003EUuuuuuuuhhhhaskdghfvadjkfdgayuskrhfasdblublbublbuuahfasdfg\u003C/em\u003E, my brain said, completely shutting down. \u201CJeb?\u201D Alexis asked again, turning to luck at me. \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u2022\u2022 ERROR.

You were saying?\u201D Alexis opened her mouth and looked like she was about to repeat herself, but she was interrupted by a happy jingle. She held her finger up and rummaged around in her purse for a brief bit, before pulling out her phone. \u003Cem\u003E\u201CWill you go out with me?\u201D No, too up-front. \u201CDo you want to go to dinner with me?\u201D Maybe..\u003C/em\u003E I debated questions in my head as she answered the phone.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CHey, hon..

On request from Andy, I checked all 8 gears, and primed the Electrics. I swear, getting these cars ready was like warming up a rocket ship. We entered the little mini-canyon area, which was in between two buildings. The sunset was blocked out, and it took only a second or two for my eyes to adjust. It didn\u2019t take long, though. Thankfully, the NMC Grand Prix was held in the sunset-night time transition, similar to Tekkia.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CEverything\u2019s fine on the telemetry.

Absolutely perfect.\u201D Into the hairpin, I went down into a stupidly slow 25 miles per hour, and the tightest corner in K1. Then it was down a short hill, and into the tunnel. After we ran through the straight, I went into the bus stop section- commonly named the Swimming Pool Section (Because there\u2019s a pool there). \u201CAlright, get ready. Mode 5, Transmission up to 80%. Good luck.\u201D I pulled around the final two corners, and now it was time to get this thing started. I got into the spot and got the engine ready for launch. Everyone filed into the spot. I was starting out on pole, and behind me were the two Monster cars of Jordan and Kyle, then Phil, and somehow, miraculously, against all odds, a LakeFront car.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0In the backfield, a green flag waved. \u003Cem\u003ELet\u2019s go\u2026\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0One light came on, and I went to Rich Revs.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Two now.

Clutch in.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Five.

EPB, Traction Assist, and the powerful OTech engine grabbed traction, and I stormed off the grid. Jordan had gotten a great start, and was determined to hold up my inside through 1. We went into the turn side-by-side, and out of 1 we were still right there together. I pushed the car as hard as I could, and gained a couple inches on him. Thankfully, I had the inside for 3. Into the canyon, I passed clean up the inside. \u201CNice overtake there. Let\u2019s stretch our legs a bit here- get a gap.\u201D Beneath my helmet, I grinned. \u003Cem\u003EGladly.\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0I crossed the line to end Lap 1, and looked in the mirror. Phil had passed the two Monster cars, but he was well back- around 1 and a half, maybe 2 seconds. I got out of Rich, and slowed myself down. No sense wrecking out on lap 1 of 40 after all. On lap 5, my wheel lit up in a flurry of red, yellow and black. \u003Cem\u003EUgh goshdangit what happened?\u003C/em\u003E \u201CSafety Car\u2019s out, Safety Car. Slow on down to the delta, please.\u201D I hit the brakes and the red turned to green. \u201CSo what happened?\u201D I asked Andy as I rolled through the Casino Square. \u201CNot quite sure. From what we\u2019re seeing on the TV feed, it\u2019s looking like someone dropped a fairly substantial amount of debris heading into the Swimming Pool section. Be careful through there.\u201D I slowed into the hairpin, and clipped the curbing nicely. Then, I slammed the brake, halting the car. \u201CI found the problem,\u201D I said, looking in front of me. \u201CIt\u2019s definitely not the Swimming Pool Section, either.\u201D\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Stuck just a few feet in front of me was the biggest traffic jam I\u2019d seen in recent memory. 3 cars, all carrying some form of damage, were blocking the entire track, which wasn\u2019t that much of an accomplishment considering the fact the track was only about 2 cars wide. They were trying to get back going, and finally, after much reversing and engine yowling, they did. As soon as I hit the gas, however, I heard a huge \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ETHUD\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E come from the rear of the car, and I jolted forward about an inch. \u003Cem\u003EI.

Gogogo!!!\u201D I hit the gas hard as I got out of the final turn, releasing as much power as I could to try to get away from the rest of the pack. It turns out I hadn\u2019t gotten any damage from Phil deciding to ram me, so I was on a mission. On Lap 15 (The restart lap), I threw the car into Turn 1 and felt the grip literally flow through the car. You know that feeling when you do something so perfect that you can feel it in your bones? Like when you throw a football with just that right spin, or shoot a 3 that as soon as you release, you know it\u2019s a swish? Yeah. That\u2019s the feeling I got from that turn alone. Almost like a golden fountain just trickled over m- wait, this isn\u2019t a poetry book! Gah, curse me getting sidetracked. Anyways.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0I went down the straight and looked left. I saw a\u00A0SAFR barrier (Steel And Foam Retaining barrier), and my shadow was going over it repeatedly. I didn\u2019t dare look left, because otherwise I would have been blinded by the spotlights on course. I went into 2, bumping over a lump in the road before heading into the long left-hander of Turn 3, and into the Casino Square. The sunset had all-but vanished, but if you looked just right you could still see hints of tiger orange on the horizon. Out of 4, I again felt that beautiful moment of grip as the car seemed to come alive. \u003Cem\u003EDid Phil \u003Cu\u003Efix\u003C/u\u003E the car?!\u003C/em\u003E I thought incredulously as I went into Turn 5. \u003Cem\u003EDid he knock the diffuser around?\u003C/em\u003E I thought. \u003Cem\u003EMaybe changed a wing angle or two??\u003C/em\u003E Either way, the car felt as happy as I had ever felt it. If of course cars can feel happy. I really loved this!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0On Lap 25, I pulled into the pits for my second stop of the race. I could have stayed out, but we had decided to go for no fuel or tires on the stop during the Safety Car period. Instead, it was just a damage checkup. I wheeled into the stall and stopped right on the mark. The team responded right on cue, and I felt myself lift up as they went to work. 4 tires off, 4 on. Fuel in. I looked back in the mirror and saw the fuel flowing down the tube. I hit the Balance switch on a little board next to my leg, and all the fuel balanced itself out as it entered the car. A bit to the front aux tank, a bit to the rear mains\u2026 The tube popped out and the jack dipped as I stormed out of the stall.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CCome on\u2026\u201D I heard Phil heading down the little straight. He could not pass me, or else I\u2019d be finished. See, in the New Baskay race, overtaking is nigh on impossible. You need either a stellar qualifying, or the best strategy ever to pull out a win. I knew that if Phil got the lead, he wouldn\u2019t dare to let me past, making that car as wide as possible. I hit the gas as soon as I left the pit lane, and I saw Phil gaining in my mirrors. \u201CCome on!!!\u201D I dove into Turn 1 and kept it within the lines, and flew out of the exit lane at max speed. I ended up about half a second ahead of Phil. \u201CYes!\u201D Andy shouted, unaware that he was supposed to remain unbiased to me or Phil at any given time. \u201CEr.. Good job there.

Jackson cannonballed into the pool right next to me, grinning like a maniac and popping up out of the water. I grinned and whipped my head around, spraying water all over the crew and everyone who was within 5 feet. Then, Phil came in and did the same thing I had- backflipping into the pool. \u201CWelcome to K1 kid!\u201D He laughed as the rest of the crew jumped in- a sea of pool water, jet black, emerald green, snow white, and navy blue.

Don\u2019t worry; I won\u2019t forget.\u201D Andy sighed. \u201CI know, I know.\u201D We got to the car, and I started strapping up. \u201CThen why are you so nervous?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CYou know \u003Cem\u003Eexactly\u003C/em\u003E why I\u2019m nervous. Now remember, if a Safety Car comes out-\u201C I interrupted. \u201C\u2018Stay out and keep to the strategy,\u2019 I know!\u201D I knew why Andy was so nervous. Firstly, it was Claire\u2019s first race back on the pit box since Grestin, where her team had finished 17th, so nerves were high on the pit box. Second, though, was making \u003Cem\u003Eeveryone\u003C/em\u003E in OTech stressed out. The OTech company, the Board of Directors, the team heads- everyone down from the highest CEO to the lowest janitor- were all stressed out. If both me and Phil finished in the top 5 or one of us won the race with the other coming in the Top 10, we\u2019d win the 2035 K1 constructors championship, and making history as the only team in K1 history to win five constructors titles back-to-back-to-back-to-back-to-back. This, however, was a big moment for me. If I won this race, I would knock out Danny from the drivers fight, and make it between Phil and I. If Phil won, he\u2019d extend his points gap from 78 to at least 103, and make it mathematically impossible to catch him on points for the title, meaning he would win the Drivers championship. So\u2026 no pressure or anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0I fired up the new engine and grinned as we set off on the formation lap.

I flowed through the fast and long 90\u00BA Turn 1, before braking for the tight hairpin complex of 2, 3, and 4. \u201CEverything feeling good?\u201D Claire asked over the radio.

Make sure the brake balance is fine.\u201D I flipped the correct levers and dials, setting the car up for the start.

Thankfully, I had gotten a better start than the rest of the grid, and both me and Phil were alone at the front of the pack. Entering Turn 1, I felt Phil\u2019s dirty air wash over the front of my car, and I had to slow a bit to keep from getting thrown into the gravel trap on the outside of the corner before we both broke into the corner. I ended up braking much later than Phil, and I ended up flying up his inside. I missed the apex and ended up going wide, and Phil went back up the inside on exit. Then it was a double apex of Turns 3 and 4, which rocketed us onto the back straight. Fans cheered as we blasted past at almost 170 miles an hour before I slammed the brakes into 5. It was a tight 90\u00BA turn right before another 90\u00BA left. A tiny kink at Turn 7 led us into the Esses. I grimaced as I was slammed, left, riiiiiight, leftrightleft, right, and then hit the brakes again for the final four turns, a tricky chicane followed by a long loop back around to the front straight.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CSomething\u2019s way off with the car guys,\u201D I said as we went down the straight again. \u201CIt\u2019s really plowing int the corners, especially the fast ones.\u201D Of course, as soon as I said that, I made a massive move up the inside of Turn 1, sliding right up the track and into first place. \u201CNever mind, just going crazy,\u201D I said as I slowed down for 2. Through that corner, Phil did the exact same thing as I did on Lap 1, and plowed into 2. I let him go and perfectly performed the switchback. Onto the back straight I gained enormously as Phil had to go over the runoff rumble strips, limiting his speed to keep from damaging the car too much. \u201COnly if Phil gets close,\u201D I heard Andy say from far away. \u201CClaire, you left your mic open,\u201D I said as I broke for Turns 5 and 6. \u201CSorry about that,\u201D She said before the background noise cut off. \u201CHey, great overtaking there Jeb.

Awesome job up there on the box, Claire! Pass on my thanks to the crew- couldn\u2019t have won it without them.\u201D The crowd cheered me on as Phil hit the finish line, sending up a second display of pyrotechnics.

I looked at the car, blasting through the corners, seemingly able to hit every corner as if on a rail. \u201CHoly cow,\u201D I breathed as the driver went through \u003Cem\u003EVelocidad\u003C/em\u003E.

Again, let\u2019s give a high-five to the guy who thought Driver-to-Driver radios were a good idea. \u201CWhat are you doing here?\u201D Max laughed, and I heard the car in the background. \u201CThe team let me log a couple laps before next season. Getting me prepared for \u201936 I guess.\u201D I set off, going for max pace. Max\u2019s contract had been announced about a week ago, along with the retirement of David.

With the sun setting on this season, a champion will rise. Will this be the perfect Swan Song for a legend? Or the under dog story to make history? No matter what, this season has been exciting down to the very end. And now, it\u2019s time to begin the final race.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThis.

Me vs Phil. It was the biggest battle of the season, and millions were tuning in on the TV, and thousands were here at the track itself. I was chilling out in the hospitality suite, listening to the crowd noise building as the race drew closer and closer. Then, I was interrupted by some loud music going through the walls. It had a deep country twang, and I sighed. As much as I like country, it was \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E distracting. Then, I realized it was on purpose. He was trying to psych me out. I smiled and turned on my stereo. Loud, deep, inner-city type rap music began pounding out of the speakers. I had the psychology advantage, after wining the last 3 races. He had crashed out of the Temple, retired in Halco, and had a dismal race in Basil with a 9th place finish. I had cut the gap down to 0 points. Basically, whoever beat who would win. My phone buzzed in my pocket, and Phil texted me an emoji of a thumbs up, and the words \u201CNice job.\u201D I heard the country click off, and I turned down the music. A knock on the door told me that Andy was here for the pre-race briefing. \u201CIt\u2019s open,\u201D I shouted, laying down on the couch. Instead of Andy, Alexis was the one who walked in the doorway. \u201CIt\u2019s time,\u201D She said, waving as she walked in. I got up and went to the door. A barrage of camera flashes almost blinded me, but I kept a smile on my face.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CJeb! Chances of winning today?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CJeb!

I could still hear the reporters, but they sounded far off, which helped me to concentrate. I kept on walking to the garage, keeping focused on the task at hand- winning. I got into the garage and closed the door, cutting out most of the sound from the reporters. I slipped off the headphones and all the noise rushed at me. The crowd was rumbling, like a stadium pre-match. Helicopter blades sounded hundreds of feet above as they got beauty shots of the track with the setting sun, and I could hear thousands of drills, saws, and hammers going to work on various cars.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0In front of me, the crew was tinkering with some bits on the wheel wells, and I saw Andy with Claire pointing at some graphs and numbers as they came in from the car. In a corner, Tim, our tire expert, was checking pressures and markings on the numerous sets of tires, attempting to check wear on old sets to get a handle on the strategy. Andy spotted me and walked over, while Claire continued looking at the graphs.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CHey man,\u201D I gave him a high five as I walked over to him. \u201CYou feeling ready?\u201D I nodded and picked my helmet up off the table. \u201CI\u2019m feeling good.. A bit jittery, but alright.\u201D A propeller plane buzzed overhead as part of an air-show, sending up a cheer from the fans. \u201CTo be expected, of course,\u201D Andy said, and I nodded. Right then, Phil walked in to my right side, and to the other half of the garage. Reporter\u2019s cameras flashed, and cries of \u201CPhil!\u201D filtered through the open doorway. It shut, and Phil sighed, and shook his head. Then, he walked over to me. \u201CMind if Jeb and I have a talk, real quick?\u201D He asked Andy. Andy looked a bit taken aback, and I mentally felt the team tense up, almost like they were readying for a fight, like \u003Cem\u003EThis is \u003Cu\u003Eour\u003C/u\u003E driver.\u003C/em\u003E \u201CUh.. sure,\u201D Andy said, stepping back to Claire and looking over the graphs.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CAre you okay?\u201D Phil asked quietly, trying not to be heard. \u201CYeah..\u201D I replied in a whisper for whatever reason. \u201CI\u2019m going to go straight to the point.

Do you know the number one key to speed?\u201D I shook my head. \u201CBe confident. Know your abilities, and stick to your guns. Don\u2019t try to be someone or something you\u2019re not. Got it?\u201D I nodded, and Phil smiled warmly. \u201CGreat. Now, best of luck,\u201D He extended his hand. \u201CAnd may the best driver win.\u201D I smirked, and shook his hand. \u201CSame to you,\u201D I called after him, waving as Phil walked over to his car. He turned, and he gave me a tip of an imaginary cowkerb hat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0The sky above was clear as could be. Only a couple clouds, far off in the distance out to the Sea of Kerbin, and to the west, the mountains seemed to sparkle in the yellowing sunset. A cool, slightly wet ocean breeze blew in from the east, and even though I couldn\u2019t feel the wetness, I could definitely feel the cooler air as the day turned to night.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0A set of 9 jets (An F/A-18, 4 Owlian F-14\u2019s, 2 F-22\u2019s, and 2 SF-29\u2019s) blasted overhead- their engines shrieking and echoing off the numerous walls of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. White smoke trailed out of each of the plane\u2019s tails, and as soon as they got past us they shot straight up into the air, going vertical and looping around for the fans. Fans cheered and I waved to the plane\u2019s retreating smoke trail. Then, on the front-straight, fireworks went off, sending up balls of fire and trails of smoke- it\u2019s loud booming echoing around the track. Phil nodded at me, and I nodded back, as if to say \u003Cem\u003ELet\u2019s go\u003C/em\u003E. Hundreds of reporters lined the front-straight, but even though there were 20 drivers in the grid, all but a few cared only about 2 drivers.

My breath echoed, and I felt like a kerbonaut on EVA. \u201CGood luck.\u201D I gave Andy a thumbs-up and a high-five, before Andy hit the top of my helmet. The team lined up, forming a channel for me to go through. Now, the engine roared to life, and I experimentally blipped the gas. The engine quickly yelped, and I grinned, feeling the car pop forward a bit. I went forward and gave high-fives to the entire crew as I passed. Then, I set off on the formation lap.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0I wiggled the car through Turn 1, and looked in my mirror, seeing Phil behind. \u201CJust stay quiet for the first couple laps,\u201D I told Andy as I slowed for Turn 2. \u201CI\u2019ll let you know when I\u2019m okay.\u201D I hit the gas and the rears bit into the pavement of Turn 3. Into a tiny, bumpy straight, I broke for the Tunnel Turns- 4 and 5. Out of 4 and through 5, 6, and 7, I saw tinges of orange on the horizon, as the sun began to set. \u003Cem\u003EThat\u2019s beautiful,\u003C/em\u003E I thought, thinking of Baskay. \u003Cem\u003EGah, FOCUS!\u003C/em\u003E Lights came on through 6, and I could feel the fans cheering as I passed.

A short straight passed me by a legion of fans, all cheering and screaming. Some waved country flags, some waved flags with driver numbers on them, and others just flat-out screamed for attention. I resisted the urge to wave as I passed. In \u003Cem\u003ETempesta\u003C/em\u003E (Turns 11 and 12), I clipped the curbing crisply- feeling the suspension bounce as I went over the rumble strips. Then I headed down the backstraight- hundreds, if not \u003Cem\u003Ethousands\u003C/em\u003E more fans cheering us on. On the ground, passing beneath the car, I could see the circular marks of a car doing doughnuts from long ago, and I smiled, remembering last year.

On the right, Phil\u2019s picture was there. And between us sat a massive trophy. Next to Phil, there showed 4 pictures of him in his car, representing 4 championship titles. The top left showed him doing burnouts on the main straight of Basil. Top right showed him sticking his arms up out of the car as he crossed the line- his finger pointed to the sky. Bottom left showed him out of the car and jumping with the crew here at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, 3 years ago. And the bottom right showed Phil holding a trophy the size of his head- lifting it up over his head with an eternal triumphant scream planted on his face- confetti floating back down from the sky and champagne flying into the air behind him.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Around my picture were 4 photos as well. My first race, with me celebrating with the team in Owlia. My second win, in Baskay- me permanently frozen mid-back-flip, and a massive smile on my face. Then below it was my first race in Formula- Me blasting through qualifying at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. And then, it was me, kissing the Formula K Championship Trophy, already 1 year ago now. \u003Cem\u003EAmazing how much can happen in one year..\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Then, into Turn 15 I took the hard 90\u00BA turn. \u003Cem\u003ETo think, this all started just 2 years ago\u2026\u003C/em\u003E I went into the small straight and the fan section dedicated to Phil seemed to shoot negative vibes at me. Like no joke- if you were there, you could \u003Cem\u003Efeel\u003C/em\u003E the evil just flowing out of those stands. Then it was another 90-ish degree left-hander for 17a and 17b- \u003Cem\u003Etechnically\u003C/em\u003E a double apex turn, but the speeds and the fact it was really easy to overshoot the turns meant that it was a single apex on the track.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CLaunch mode on. Electrics primed. All\u2019s looking good up here in the box. Best of luck, mate.\u201D I shifted down to first gear and my heart pounded as adrenaline ramped up. I went into Turn 18, 19, 20, and looped around the final turn of 21. This was it. Phil lined up to my right and behind me. The engine behind me hummed and rattled- its 900\u002B horses chomping at the bit. The rest of the grid filed into line, and I twisted some knobs to set the pre-launch systems (Again- getting these things ready is like warming up a fighter jet, or a rocket ship).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0A green flag waved in the distance, and I heard clapping from the crowd. I looked in my mirror and saw Phil\u2019s helmet- spotlights glinting off the tinted visor. Behind me, I heard engines yelping as drivers popped the gas, testing the engine before go-time. \u003Cem\u003EInhale\u2026 exhale\u2026\u003C/em\u003E I remembered Phil\u2019s advice. \u003Cem\u003EBe confident, know your limits.\u003C/em\u003E His voice echoed in my ears. A single light went on above me- it\u2019s amber glow washing over me. I heard the engines revving up- screaming and howling as the RPMs climbed.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Two lights came on. Rich Revs, clutch in.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Three. I hit the gas pedal- my car vibrating as the engine shook- ready to begin.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Four. I put my thumb over the EPB button. My breaths echoed, momentarily cutting out all sound.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Five. I tensed up, waiting to release the clutch- my eyes locked on the lights above me. My heart was pounding fast and hard, like I had just run a race.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0The light went out and I \u201Cdumped\u201D the clutch. The rear wheels bit into the tarmac, and I was slammed back against my seat as the wheels grabbed traction. I pressed down the EPB button and the added boost allowed me to get up to speed. It was a fast run into Turn 1, but because of the immense speed of the car I was already up to around 70 miles per hour. Through the corner I held the inside of Phil, who had slotted in behind me by the end of the turn. It was single-file for the Top 5 or 6 through the first couple of corners, but further back I saw a cloud of smoke and the crowd roared. Small lights on my steering wheel screen lit up in yellow. I slowed down for Turn 2, and as I touched the apex, the marshals around the track began waving yellow flags around the track. I could see past the stands, and on the big screen in front of the backstraight fans I saw the board flashing the words \u201CSAFETY CAR\u201D in big yellow block letters- 2 little flashing lights above the words. I clipped Turn 3\u2019s apex and went to Lean engine mode to preserve fuel.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CSomeone screwed up?\u201D I asked as I wheeled under the tunnel, using the EEP and AEP to go instead of wasting precious, precious fuel. See, in K1, you can refuel the car. And normally, fuel is the number one determination for when to make the pit stop. Tires are important (duh), but not as important as fuel. If you can stretch out that load, you can keep from having to make an early stop and blowing the entire load early in the race. Basically, early fuel burning = early stop, early stop = older tires at the end of the race, older tires at the end of the race = slow, and finally, (I bet you could guess this one) Slow = Bad.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CYeah, an AKR car pile drove the rear out of a SM car. I think they also collected a RWR.\u201D I felt bad for the RedWing Racing cars. They were generally towards the back of the field and lately they just couldn\u2019t get any luck with anything. \u201CGot it. How\u2019s the car looking from all 3 seconds of full-pace running?\u201D The only thing I hated about Safety Cars (Besides the fact that there was just a crash where someone could have been hurt) was the fact that they were so boring! Honestly, it\u2019s so awful- traveling along at a snails pace, weaving the car around for tire heat in some vain attempt to entertain oneself for 5 or 10 minutes. During some of the exceptionally long Safety Car periods, Andy and I liked to play \u003Cem\u003EI Spy\u003C/em\u003E to pass the time (In case you were wondering, I win almost every time).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CEverything\u2019s good on our end,\u201D Andy replied as I went through the R\u0026amp;D section. \u201CTire temps are good, engine\u2019s good, transmission\u2019s good, electrics are good, brakes are-\u201C I decided to jam the brakes, and Andy gave me a sigh. \u201CBrakes about 300 degrees above what they should be going 70 miles an hour, on the coast, at night, under Safety Car, and in clear air.\u201D I chuckled as I steered through Turn 8, before speeding back up to about 75% racing speed in an attempt to both warm the tires and catch up to the Safety Car. \u201CSorry,\u201D I said, still chuckling as the car responded with all the grip in the world through 9.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A03 laps later (Lap 4 for those who don\u2019t want to math), the green flag waved, and the sound of 17 E8-3F engines roared to life as we restarted the race. I hit the gas hard and got off to a good gap early, leading by a good second or so as I crossed the line. I threw the car into Turn 1 and felt the car grip perfectly as I went through. The tires were still a bit cold (Comparatively speaking, for tires at least), and through 2 the rear end skidded a bit- the left rear just barely touching the dirt on exit. Phil capitalized on that one simple mistake and caught right up to my rear diffuser, and I could see the open mouth of that K1 car almost sneering, like a predator looking at its prey. We both dove down into Turn 3, the two of us just inches from each other.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0I went down the short straight and hit the brakes- the car decelerating like it had just opened up a parachute. Over the rumble strips, I shot into Turn 4, and took up as much of the course as I could. I weaved up the track to get the Turn 5 entrance perfect, and Phil followed suit- our two cars dancing through the course in perfect tune. In Turn 6, Phil dropped back, and so I guessed the car was doing its job of creating dirty air. Once again, the brakes got a huge workout into 7 and the hairpin of 8- the front left momentarily sending up a puff of white smoke as it locked up briefly. I used as much speed as I possibly could, pushing the car to the max. Throughout the course of the next couple of laps, I continued to extend my gap out on Phil, until on Lap 12, the call was made.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CPit this lap, Jeb, pit this lap.\u201D We had decided on a 2-stop strategy, and we decided to pit right on the 1/3 mark. I activated Rich Revs and the car accelerated up- it\u2019s 3rd engine activated to push more fuel into the thirsty engine. In 19 and 20, I shut off the fuel drive and activated the Pit Limiter, using EDS (The Electric Drive System) to take me down the pit lane. I went into Lane 2 (The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E has one pit lane- one on top of the other) and got straight into the stall perfect. The jack lifted me up, and I waited for fuel to fill in. I waited as it came on, and watched the fluid motion of the crew at work. 4 on\u2026 4 off\u2026 Static adjustment.. The green light came on above me and I squealed out of the stall- florescent spotlights illuminating the white smoke of the rears wheel-spinning out of the stall. In the mirror I saw the crew high-fiving each other as I left, congratulating themselves on a perfect stop.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CPush, push!\u201D Phil had driven clear past me during the stop, and I had to push as hard as I could to perfect the undercut. I was a speed demon throughout the lap. Fresh tires, full load of fuel- I pushed as hard as I could on the entire lap, and ended up keeping an advantage over Phil. On Lap 23, the process was repeated, with me remaining on top at the end of the lap. I was on top of my game, through the \u003Cem\u003Eentire\u003C/em\u003E race. On Lap 30, I was getting ready for victory. My first title, in my first season. A record achievement. I was going to win!! And then, the Safety Car came out.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u2026\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u2026\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u2026\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CYou\u2019re freaking kidding me\u2026\u201D I slowed the car down, allowing the Safety Car to pass me on the Outside to pick up the rest of the pack. \u003Cem\u003EWhy\u2026\u003C/em\u003E This was cruel. Horrible. A 15-second gap erased in a matter of seconds. \u201CWe can do this, Jeb,\u201D Andy said as I weaved around. \u201CWe can do this.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CGreen!\u201D I was already on top of the gas, attempting to gap Phil. He was also on top of it. My heart was racing almost as fast as the cars, and I knew it was all or nothing. 1 Laps to go. Just. 1. I went into Turn 1 with every last milliliter of confidence I had in my body, sticking the car to the apex as if it was glued to the course. Phil was hanging right behind, looking desperately for a hole- a gap- a whiff or a whisper of weakness on my part; anything that could let him past. I remembered Phil\u2019s advice. \u003Cem\u003EBe confident. Know your abilities.\u003C/em\u003E I blazed into 4 and felt the rear give up a sliver of grip- the left rear sparking off the outside wall and sending up a bright flash of yellow-orange light. I dove to the right to cut Phil off, but he held it to the left- trying to go up the inside. I went as wide as possible on entrance, and mid-corner, something amazing happened.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0I heard a huge thud and crash from the inside, followed by the squealing of tires. A chunk of metal flew over the nose of my car, and in my mirror I saw Phil, facing backwards on the track. \u201COhmy-\u201C I was cut off when a bright, neon Canary yellow car slammed into Phil, making Phil spin around hard and lifting the yellow cars nose up into the air, before it pounded the outside wall a second later. The wheel went yellow immediately, and fortunately, Phil had spun out of the way. Before he disappeared behind a wall, I saw him moving his arms around inside the car. \u201CHoly crap, that was massive,\u201D I muttered, before I was assaulted by a massive, piercing shriek that almost damaged my hearing.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201C\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYOU DID IT!!!

Congratulations mate, you\u2019ve earned it! 2035 K1 World Champion!!!\u201D I went through the corners at a slow pace, with the crowd cheering my name. I was silent as I went around the course at 70 miles per hour. Out of the final corner, the checkered flag was waving. To my right, the crew was leaning out of the pit wall- pumping their fists and cheering me onward. 100 feet. I felt some tears welling up in my eyes. 75. The crowd was silent, waiting for me to finish. 50. I could feel the joy from everyone on the box- mom, Alexis, Andy. 25. Tears began streaming down my eyes, and I kept going straight down the road- no weaving, no celebration. 0. The explosion of noise was as loud as a bomb going off, and fireworks flew up into the sky. I just cried. No celebration, no cheering.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CThis\u2026.. This is the greatest moment of my life..\u201D I tried to form the words through the tears. \u201CThank you\u2026\u2026 so much.\u201D I just pulled off to the side of Turn 1, and tried to collect myself. Drivers came up to the side of my car and waved- congratulating me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Jebediah Kerman, your 2035 K1 World Champion.

Amazing. Thank you all so much.\u201D I waved to the crowd and they cheered. \u201CThis is the greatest moment of my life\u2026 Oh my god\u2026\u201D I opened up the visor and wiped some tears off my face, trying to get myself together. I got back going, and because the air, which was cool, made me feel like my face was going to freeze off. I went under the tunnel and I saw Phil, standing off on the side of the track. His car was resting off to the outside of the track- the rear and demolished. The front had a massive hole in it, and I could see there was some kind of coolant fluid leaking out of the sides. I turned to the outside and stopped right next to him. I undid my belts and opened up my visor. Sound assaulted my ears, and a blast of cool air hit my face. I went over to Phil, who was looking up at the sky and pacing- his eyes looking watery. Phil saw me, and wrapped me in a massive hug. \u201CYou did good, kid,\u201D He shouted, trying to be heard over the crowd. \u201CI\u2019m sorry,\u201D I cried as the other cars went past. Phil looked me in the eye, and shook his head. \u201CYou earned it,\u201D He said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0I nodded and hopped in the car. Phil, deciding to capitalize on a ride back to the pits, hopped on the side of the car and sat down right next to the right wing mirror, situating himself between the mirror and the top of the sidepod. I started going, and he grabbed onto the side of the cockpit pod for grip. We were both waving to the fans, and when we got to \u003Cem\u003ETempesta\u003C/em\u003E, Phil did something I\u2019ll never forget.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0I was about to turn right to go into the Victory Circle, but Phil grabbed the wheel and turned me dead left. I looked at him and he shook his head. We went down the straight to the cheers of thousands of fans- camera flashes mixing with the lights. I was still crying a bit, but fortunately it had slowed down a bit. We got onto the Hangar Straight, and Phil motioned for me to stop. I complied, and he hopped off. I looked at him, and he pointed up to the sky, before waving his arm around in a circular motion. \u003Cem\u003ECelebrate,\u003C/em\u003E he mouthed at me, smiling. I twisted the dials and locked the wheel. Then, I pointed to the sky and stood on the gas.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0The engine wailed and the tires started smoking as they lost traction. The camera flashes intensified- journalists and fans alike trying to snap the most iconic photo. Phil grinned as I spun around and around. Smoke obscured my vision and the engine drowned out everything.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CCongratulations, kiddo. I knew you could do it.\u201D My face brightened up when I recognized the voice. \u201CGranddad! What\u2019re you doing here?!\u201D Last I had heard, Granddad was back in Owlia. \u201CI couldn\u2019t miss my grandsons big race! What kind of grandparent would I be if I did that?\u201D I smiled. \u201CI\u2019m really glad you made it.\u201D Granddad was one of the most famous racers in the early 1990\u2019s, and was around for some of the first K1 races. It felt amazing that he had seen me win the title he had won twice.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0I stopped doing the burnouts, and picked Phil up, on the way to the podium.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Tears fell down my face as I got out of the car. Emotion hit me like a garbage truck. I\u2019d been dreaming about this moment my entire life, and now it was finally coming true. The crew congratulated me as I got out, and the other drivers- Jackson and David- were helping me up. \u201CGreat job, kid!\u201D David was saying as we went up to the podium. We got up onto the trophy and I tried to sue it in as the anthem played. I couldn\u2019t help but laugh as the race trophies were handed out, and the champagne handed to me. Then, out came the big trophy.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Fireworks and confetti flew up into the air as I picked up the trophy. I held the massive trophy in my hand. It was like a large vase, just with handles near the top to hold onto it. On the base, my name was stamped onto it- forever etched into history. Around the entire surface of the cup, there were shiny jewels and elaborate engravings, with a large, loopy K1 logo on the face. I was about to kiss it, but I was interrupted by the other podium finishers and my team spraying champagne straight into the side of my face. I grinned and aimed my bottle at them, shooting them back. I took the Owlian flag sitting on the podium next to me, and I put it behind me head, acting as a kind of shield.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Photographers went wild as the champagne hit- my face opened wide in a triumphant yell. I had finally done it. I was a World Champion. And I was ready to go at it again.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CJeb!\u201D I turned and saw reporters coming up to me, and I stepped down off the podium. \u00A0I tried to wipe the wetness off my face, but the smile was going to stay for the next week or two. Maybe three. \u201CHere I am with Jebediah Kerman, your 2035 World Champion! Jeb! You\u2019ve won, how awesome is that?!\u201D I laughed and held the baseball cap over my head, which said, very inconspicuously, \u201C\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2035 WORLD CHAMPION\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u201D on the top.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CAh, it\u2019s freaking amazing. We worked so hard all season long, never giving up.. Somehow, even with all our work, we had to get some luck and that\u2019s just what we had today. I mean I couldn\u2019t do it without the team. They\u2019re probably the best group of guys a driver could ask for, and.. They\u2019re the real champions here.\u201D The reporter nodded and took the mic back. \u201CHow much emotion was going through your mind as you crossed that line on the last lap?\u201D I sighed.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CA lot,\u201D I laughed, my eyes watering up for no reason. \u201CI mean\u2026 I\u2019ve been dreaming of this moment since I was like Five, and now, to come out here and actually win the title with my hero.. It\u2019s awesome.\u201D My voice broke a bit and I chuckled. \u201CSorry for looking like such a crybaby holy cow.\u201D I wiped my eyes and the reporter laughed. \u201CWe\u2019ll let you get back with your team now.
