Welcome back then, Shadow!\n\nAh, the hype for an EUS has been on for a while!

Shortly after that picture was taken, the interstage containing the lander was jettisoned, and the two fuel tanks of the lander split apart. I\u0027m not sure how, they just did. And upon time accelerating as they were split, the top half shot back to the bottom half, and then started to drift again. Maybe this is a big with KJR? I think I\u0027ve seen something like this before."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T16:25:50Z","Content":"KJR can cause its share of problems; very odd ones when they do pop up. However I have found it is generally more helpful than not, at least on the scale that I build things (hundreds of tons). If it is a repeatable issue, please let me know and I\u0027ll do some further investigation w/KJR installed (currently do not have it in my dev setup).\n\nWill also be reworking the balance on the ICPS and CM/SM a bit, mass/resources wise. Will be rebalancing the ICPS towards a LH2/LOX fuel distribution - so you should see overall less weight, higher ISP, and slightly higher overall delta-v. The new HUS is already using these stats for balancing. The CM will have its dry mass reduced to compensate for the now-included ablator/heat shield (previously it had an extra weight factor fudged in to simulate it... but this extra weight was never removed when the ablator module was added). Might be rebalancing the SM a bit as well (mass wise), to make it all come in line with the vision that I have for these parts. \n\nOn the plugin end of things - currently cleaning up the \u0027NodeFairing\u0027 plugin (responsible for engine fairings, side fairings on the SC-B-SM) to more cleanly support complex fairing setups such as those on the bottom of the SM, and more cleanly handle the jettison/detach functionality.\n\nWill also be looking into what it would take to allow more granular control over the tweakables for the fairings (radius, height), but not sure if I\u0027ll be able to do those without too much GUI work (would rather wait on the GUI stuff until next KSP update with the unified Unity 5 gui system).\n\nCurrent plans are for a final private testing release this weekend/later this week, and hopefully first public release sometime next week."},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T17:35:02Z","Content":"I\u0027m just excited for the landers.

But the textures look really good."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-26T17:44:14Z","Content":"Few questions:\n\nWith regards to decouplers - should I maintain them as integrated into the pods and/or fuel tanks, or separate them into distinct parts?\n\nIntegrated - Pros:\n\n1.) Lower Part Count\n\n2.) Less floppy rockets/landers - single-part decouplers seem to have a lot of joint flex and compression for some reason (might be solvable through config or plugin)\n\n3.) Solves some strange node-connection issues with the LanderParts, where non-aligned nodes in the same position would prevent properly aligned nodes from connecting (e.g. the top and bottom nodes on a fuel tank would prevent the middle node from snapping into position).\n\nIntegrated - Cons:\n\n1.) Can cause issues with MJ / KER delta-v calculations and auto-staging - they do not handle decouplers with fuel/engines very gracefully - have not been able to find any solution in the MJ code, but I\u0027m admittedly unfamiliar with the code setup.\n\n2.) Staging icon issues with other modules activated through staging - e.g. ModuleEngines. Can partially be alleviated by removing the decoupler from spacebar staging and mandating manual staging through right-click/action groups.\n\nSome of the MJ/KER problems may be solved by swapping where the decouplers are located; e.g. put them on the top of the fuel tanks rather than the bottom of the pods. Have not yet fully investigated this yet; will likely be experimenting soon. Some of this would run afoul of staging problems -- a part may only have a single staging icon. So, not sure how to solve this for stuff with integrated engines (SC-B-SM, ICPS, HUS) other than to force manual right-click/action group staging. \n\nSecond question - I am thinking about creating a \u0027Welding Docking Port\u0027 part. This would be intended for space-station construction. It would function as a standard docking port, but have an additional right-click option on it to \u0027weld\u0027 the connected parts. What this would do is to remove two connected (matching/welding) docking ports from a vessel and move the remainder of the parts into position where the docking ports were removed - Essentially welding the two station sections together. This could save part-count on large multi-segment (constructed in-orbit) stations while still allowing for in-orbit construction (and all the fun/difficulty that comes with it). Any thoughts on this functionality? Should I investigate it a bit to see if it could be done?\n\nThird question - Again, in regard to stations, I am contemplating making a multi-docking-node part. This would be a single part with multiple docking ports on it. Possibly with docking lights as well. This is all in the aims to reduce station part count. My current stations are ~40 parts, with ~10 of those being docking ports that could be combined into 2 discrete parts (so 40-\u003E32 parts, and with the above welded nodes 32-\u003E26 parts). Thoughts on the usefulness of this part?\n\nIf you can\u0027t tell, I\u0027m trying to solve some current problems popping up in my career game - mostly running into part-count limits when trying to dock vessels at stations - starts lagging at ~150 parts or so; which is both headache and rage inducing for me. For the welded dock and multi-dock, these parts would probably be developed after the initial public release (so.. v1.1 or so) - they would form the initial pieces of the as-yet-unstarted \u0027Station Core\u0027 part series.\n\nAnyhow, got quite a few plugin things cleaned up in the past couple of days. Just need to clean up the decoupler stuff mentioned above (e.g. figure out how to best handle it...), do a couple good passes over config stuff, and I think things will be ready for public release."},{"CreatedByName":"VenomousRequiem","CreatedById":137373,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-26T17:52:11Z","Content":"The welding docking port honestly sounds like a good idea.

Mostly it involves moving the decouplers into the lower part; so the pod-included decouplers would instead be included on the fuel tank below. Still thinking through how this would effect the rest of the parts, and it is likely that I\u0027ll still run into issues with this setup. I suppose I\u0027ll find out tonight ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI\u0027m about half-okay with letting them go with MJ/KER not doing the dV calc. Would really like it to work, but not sure I want to add extra part-count just to get it working. I\u0027m also investigating what I could submit as a patch/PR to MJ/KER to fix things on their end, but quite lost on their code.\n\nStill in very early concept phase on the other stuff, just working through ideas. I -think- I know how the multi-docking port stuff should work; already have a module written out for testing, but have not yet created any models. Yes, the docking ports would have specific names in the right-click menu which would correspond to textured labels on the ports/part itself to denote which options and ports correspond.\n\nOn the welding stuff - was just an idea I came up. No clue how it would work yet either. I\u0027m 90% certain it is possible (moving/reparenting parts), and 80% certain that the code to do it would be a mess and take a bit to figure out ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Fun stuff to look forward to.\n\nI have ideas for a few other part-count-reducing station/base parts, but will save the discussion on those for later when I am closer to starting development on them.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ^\n\u003E \u0022You must spread some reputation around before giving it to Shadowmage again\u0022\n\nThanks ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-27T21:51:44Z","Content":"Well, decoupler experiments last night showed that changing the node the decoupler is triggered on does nothing for fixing the dV display for KER/MJ. It actually made the parts harder to use as decoupling had to happen through manual right-click instead of spacebar staging. Having the decoupler on the bottom node doesn\u0027t work properly either; still no dV calculations.\n\nOhwell, back to brainstorming on those.\n\nAn alternative that I might be able to implement is a \u0027physicsless\u0027 decoupler part. It appears that they do not use standard joint mechanics and are \u0027skipped\u0027 for joints, rather they are parented directly to the parent part. Unsure how this would play out for decouplers with multiple attach nodes as compared to small radially attached parts. Going to create a couple crazy experiments tonight to figure out the performance difference between physics-less and physics-enabled parts. As the joints and collision handling are a huge part of the performance hit associated with part count this may or may not turn out to be a workable/acceptable compromise solution.\n\nMostly finished with the plugin cleanup end of things, at least what I can solve currently (lots of stuff waiting on Unity5 gui update). So.. as soon as I get this decoupler stuff figured out I should have an updated (and hopefully final) private test release in the next couple of days. Will try and update later with more info if I have it.\n\nEDIT:\n\nPhysics-less decouplers may indeed be the answer. Initial testing has revealed little/no performance degradation from physics-less parts.\n\nTest1 - physics enabled parts:\n\n7x short 3.75m tank (base stand)\n\n180x rockomax decoupler\n\ntotal parts: 187\n\nFPS: 25-42\n\nTest2 - physics-less parts:\n\n7x short 3.75m tank (base stand)\n\n180x physics-less SSTU test decoupler\n\ntotal parts: 187\n\nFPS: 59 \u002B (vsync capped)\n\nFurther testing, through rather crude methods, showed that the performance hit from the physics-enabled decouplers was present with or without the joint-attachments (by decoupling all of the decouplers so that they were single-part vessels). So, the performance problems may stem from the general rigid-body updating on Unity\u0027s end of things rather than the joints between them as I had previously thought. In essence, more rigidbodies = lower FPS, regardless if they are attached to each other via joints or not (though the joints probably do have some additional computation penalty, my crude testing methods were not able to tell the difference/delta).\n\nSo... I will likely be creating specific physics-less decoupler parts for use for both SC-B and LC part series in order to solve the decoupler/dV calc issues.\n\nWill probably just create a procedural decoupler using my existing procedural mesh-generation for the round decoupler shapes, and utilize the existing meshes for the LC sleeve style decouplers. The LC decouplers will be removed from the fuel/cargo mesh-switch variants as I make this change (there were some really weird issues that popped up because of these). The pod-integrated decouplers will likely also be removed at this point in favor of discrete physicsl-less part-based decouplers.\n\nAm also considering creating an \u0027auto decoupler\u0027 module that automatically inserts a (physics-less) decoupler part into the stack below certain pieces. Still thinking on the logistics of this one. It would be only be a separate part as far as the game-engine is concerned for staging and fuel-flow operations; it would not be directly clickable or interactive, would have no model, no physical dimensions, and would be activated through right-click on the parent part or through space-bar staging. Would probably also make it disable-able for instances where users did -not- want a decoupler (or want to use a specific decoupler). Will likely investigate this route -after- the initial public releases as this feature may take some time to implement properly, and the parts should work fine without it. Need to think on it a bit/investigate if this would be breaking change for existing saves (that will be the deciding factor of -when- it is implemented).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-27T23:20:02Z\u0022 title=\u002208/27/2015 11:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"I.O.M.","CreatedById":88342,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-28T00:49:06Z","Content":"This mod sounds super cool!
