Will be rebalancing the ICPS towards a LH2/LOX fuel distribution - so you should see overall less weight, higher ISP, and slightly higher overall delta-v. The new HUS is already using these stats for balancing. The CM will have its dry mass reduced to compensate for the now-included ablator/heat shield (previously it had an extra weight factor fudged in to simulate it... but this extra weight was never removed when the ablator module was added). Might be rebalancing the SM a bit as well (mass wise), to make it all come in line with the vision that I have for these parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the plugin end of things - currently cleaning up the \u0027NodeFairing\u0027 plugin (responsible for engine fairings, side fairings on the SC-B-SM) to more cleanly support complex fairing setups such as those on the bottom of the SM, and more cleanly handle the jettison/detach functionality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill also be looking into what it would take to allow more granular control over the tweakables for the fairings (radius, height), but not sure if I\u0027ll be able to do those without too much GUI work (would rather wait on the GUI stuff until next KSP update with the unified Unity 5 gui system).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrent plans are for a final private testing release this weekend/later this week, and hopefully first public release sometime next week.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T17:35:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m just excited for the landers.

Solves some strange node-connection issues with the LanderParts, where non-aligned nodes in the same position would prevent properly aligned nodes from connecting (e.g. the top and bottom nodes on a fuel tank would prevent the middle node from snapping into position).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntegrated - Cons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.)

Staging icon issues with other modules activated through staging - e.g. ModuleEngines. Can partially be alleviated by removing the decoupler from spacebar staging and mandating manual staging through right-click/action groups.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of the MJ/KER problems may be solved by swapping where the decouplers are located; e.g. put them on the top of the fuel tanks rather than the bottom of the pods. Have not yet fully investigated this yet; will likely be experimenting soon. Some of this would run afoul of staging problems -- a part may only have a single staging icon. So, not sure how to solve this for stuff with integrated engines (SC-B-SM, ICPS, HUS) other than to force manual right-click/action group staging. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond question - I am thinking about creating a \u0027Welding Docking Port\u0027 part. This would be intended for space-station construction. It would function as a standard docking port, but have an additional right-click option on it to \u0027weld\u0027 the connected parts. What this would do is to remove two connected (matching/welding) docking ports from a vessel and move the remainder of the parts into position where the docking ports were removed - Essentially welding the two station sections together. This could save part-count on large multi-segment (constructed in-orbit) stations while still allowing for in-orbit construction (and all the fun/difficulty that comes with it). Any thoughts on this functionality? Should I investigate it a bit to see if it could be done?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird question - Again, in regard to stations, I am contemplating making a multi-docking-node part. This would be a single part with multiple docking ports on it. Possibly with docking lights as well. This is all in the aims to reduce station part count. My current stations are ~40 parts, with ~10 of those being docking ports that could be combined into 2 discrete parts (so 40-\u0026gt;32 parts, and with the above welded nodes 32-\u0026gt;26 parts). Thoughts on the usefulness of this part?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can\u0027t tell, I\u0027m trying to solve some current problems popping up in my career game - mostly running into part-count limits when trying to dock vessels at stations - starts lagging at ~150 parts or so; which is both headache and rage inducing for me. For the welded dock and multi-dock, these parts would probably be developed after the initial public release (so.. v1.1 or so) - they would form the initial pieces of the as-yet-unstarted \u0027Station Core\u0027 part series.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, got quite a few plugin things cleaned up in the past couple of days. Just need to clean up the decoupler stuff mentioned above (e.g. figure out how to best handle it...), do a couple good passes over config stuff, and I think things will be ready for public release.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VenomousRequiem","CreatedById":137373,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-26T17:52:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe welding docking port honestly sounds like a good idea.

It appears that they do not use standard joint mechanics and are \u0027skipped\u0027 for joints, rather they are parented directly to the parent part. Unsure how this would play out for decouplers with multiple attach nodes as compared to small radially attached parts. Going to create a couple crazy experiments tonight to figure out the performance difference between physics-less and physics-enabled parts. As the joints and collision handling are a huge part of the performance hit associated with part count this may or may not turn out to be a workable/acceptable compromise solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMostly finished with the plugin cleanup end of things, at least what I can solve currently (lots of stuff waiting on Unity5 gui update). So.. as soon as I get this decoupler stuff figured out I should have an updated (and hopefully final) private test release in the next couple of days.

So, the performance problems may stem from the general rigid-body updating on Unity\u0027s end of things rather than the joints between them as I had previously thought. In essence, more rigidbodies = lower FPS, regardless if they are attached to each other via joints or not (though the joints probably do have some additional computation penalty, my crude testing methods were not able to tell the difference/delta).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo... I will likely be creating specific physics-less decoupler parts for use for both SC-B and LC part series in order to solve the decoupler/dV calc issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill probably just create a procedural decoupler using my existing procedural mesh-generation for the round decoupler shapes, and utilize the existing meshes for the LC sleeve style decouplers. The LC decouplers will be removed from the fuel/cargo mesh-switch variants as I make this change (there were some really weird issues that popped up because of these). The pod-integrated decouplers will likely also be removed at this point in favor of discrete physicsl-less part-based decouplers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm also considering creating an \u0027auto decoupler\u0027 module that automatically inserts a (physics-less) decoupler part into the stack below certain pieces. Still thinking on the logistics of this one. It would be only be a separate part as far as the game-engine is concerned for staging and fuel-flow operations; it would not be directly clickable or interactive, would have no model, no physical dimensions, and would be activated through right-click on the parent part or through space-bar staging. Would probably also make it disable-able for instances where users did -not- want a decoupler (or want to use a specific decoupler). Will likely investigate this route -after- the initial public releases as this feature may take some time to implement properly, and the parts should work fine without it. Need to think on it a bit/investigate if this would be breaking change for existing saves (that will be the deciding factor of -when- it is implemented).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-27T23:20:02Z\u0022 title=\u002208/27/2015 11:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"I.O.M.","CreatedById":88342,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-28T00:49:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis mod sounds super cool!

So for example one could create a standard part with rigidbody/colliders (i.e. habitation module\u0027) that have i.e. 2 \u0027holes\u0027 for physicless docking ports that you can attach in editor. Then when launched those 3 parts would count as 1 part with 2 docking ports (performancewise). That could be partial solution to the performance problem.
