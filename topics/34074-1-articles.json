When all of the sudden my port side engine decides to blow up, And to make matters worse I was on my return burn and fell short. To the point that my ship was going to break free from the Mun and head out to who knows where. Afraid of losing another kerbal after poor Jeb crashed into Minmus, I decided to try a retro grade push with Bill on E.V.A. to see if I could get back into orbit, And low and behold it actually worked. I had to go back into the capsule to refuel over a dozen times but I managed to achieve a highly elliptical orbit by pushing my ship on E.V.A.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould not be more proud of myself. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnybody ever tried landing on the Mun on E.V.A. from orbit?
