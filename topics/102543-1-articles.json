While this in itself is fine, it turned out that it also gives me the full science points for all of these reports. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this a bug, or did i miss something? It would be preferable (and less cheaty/more realistic) if the pod discarded duplicates, or at least saw to it that the reward wasn\u0027t duplicated as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the linux version, but I\u0027m willing to bet this is related to the mod itself, and not the platform. I tried posting in the release thread for the mod, but without any results so far. I\u0027m wondering if someone else is experiencing this, and if there\u0027s a workaround for it, or if i missed something entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
