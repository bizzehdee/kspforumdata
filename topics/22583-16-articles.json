I am working on a component Huygens system. I model in Blender, and export to KSP via Unity, as usual. I think you may be able to know how to fix this, as you made this mod, and I am sure you encountered the problem where the part would be sideways in the VAB. Any ideas how to fix this? I got this problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thrust position issue was because I had two instances of a thrustTransform object in the unity file, on out on the edge of the propeller, so it used an average position between them. I guess I duplicated it at some point to check some coordinates and didn\u0027t remove it afterwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you change the axis in the cfg it might help with the rotation. E.g from node_attach = 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, \u003Cstrong\u003E-1.0\u003C/strong\u003E, 0.0, 0.0 to node_attach = 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, \u003Cstrong\u003E1.0\u003C/strong\u003E, 0.0, 0.0, or something like that. Otherwise, you might have to rotate the thing in Unity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember that thing should point upwards in Unity as if they were on a rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor positioning thing correctly on the global axis I have my rule of thumb for the coloured axis as they relate to the craft directions.
