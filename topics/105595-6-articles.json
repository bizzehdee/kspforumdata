Used to be, crewed ships didn\u0027t need any, just probes. Then when crewed ships started needing it, you had to slap on a few OX-STATs and radial batteries and that was that. All of which has zero positive effect on gameplay and results only in higher part counts and reduced computer efficiency thanks to one pointless module consuming and another pointless module creating EC in the background.

Same applies to heat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, no offense, but your idea of heat varying with the resource concentration is seriously bad. First off, the heat mechanic is already bass-ackwards to reality. Now you want to make its accuracy even worse? There is no real-world justification for this, and heat is supposed to be (but utterly fails at being) a \u0022realism\u0022 factor. There is no way to make this \u0022meaningful\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDrilling heat comes from friction. Friction comes from downforce. So there are MUCH better grounds for making heat vary with experience of the operator, who knows not to force the machinery but let it work at its own pace. But OTOH, everybody knows that from drilling holes in wood around the house., so less heat from more experience isn\u0027t really a good idea, either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd besides, the drill is obviously based on oilfield equipment. Oilfield drills have a built-in cooling mechanism (drilling mud) and can\u0027t function without it, because the circulating mud is also what brings the cutting up out of the hole so the bit can make forward progress. Further, the pressure of the circulating mud is what keeps the hole from caving in above the bit. So you can\u0027t have a functioning drill without its built-in cooling mechanism, so there\u0027s no realistic need to add cooling parts OR to worry about heat at all when drilling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, no drill in KSP (stock or mod) goes very far below the surface--they simply don\u0027t have anywhere near the amount of drill pipe necessary. So when you\u0027re \u0022drilling\u0022 in the game, the actual drilling only lasts a few seconds---all the rest of the time is pumping out product or, more likely letting it flow into the tanks by itself due to the inherent pressure of the reservoir, as the rockets don\u0027t carry oilfield pumping units. Thus, no energy expenditure, no heat accumulation, for the vast bulk of the time it takes to fill your tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, to be \u0022realistic\u0022 and \u0022meaningful\u0022, heat should not be a factor in acquiring ore. Adding heat to this isn\u0027t realistic because a functioning drill wouldn\u0027t have that problem in real life, and nothing blatantly unrealistic can every be \u0022meaningful\u0022 except as a needless aggravation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, heat for refining ore into fuel, maybe. This could well be an exothermic reaction and exothermic reactions cause many disasters in real life chemical plants (check out the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXIkr0SRTnZO4_QpZozvCCA\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EUSCSB channel on YouTube\u003C/a\u003E for some great examples). But what you learn from such studies is that the plants were designed to deal with the heat they produce and the explosions only happened due to lack of maintenance, lack of training, or deliberately improper operation, or some combination of all of these. Still, here is a place where maybe having to do heat management could be both \u0022realistic\u0022 and \u0022meaningful\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut even then, somebody will make a mod that solves the problem and we\u0027re back to a rocket with more parts and the computer wasting resources while providing exactly nothing that enhances gameplay. People want to fly rockets, after all, not stare at gauges and tweak valves to keep everything in the green. So again, the bottom line is, not a great game design decision to force players to worry about heat.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MacroNova","CreatedById":126611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T17:28:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlenty of things require more than token amounts of electricity - drilling, resource conversion, science lab research, ion engines, not to mention dozens of applications that exist in mods.

It would incentivize players to find high concentrations with the scanners instead of just time skipping.
