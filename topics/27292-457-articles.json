Then I spent another 400 m/s for course corrections to get an encounter with Tylo. Approaching Tylo from retrograde, I entered its SoI at 4.6 km/s, which was quite promising. It turned out that I needed only 3.3 km/s to circularize to a 65 km orbit around Tylo. Overall, I had spent 10474 m/s to reach Tylo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://jltsiren.kapsi.fi/ksp/0.25/tylo_probe_3.jpeg\u0022 alt=\u0022tylo_probe_3.jpeg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe surface speed of the probe was around 5.4 km/s at a 65 km orbit. Landing on Tylo is going to be scary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter playing with maneuver nodes for half an hour, I ended up with a 3.1 km/s burn that would put the Sun periapsis to the same level as Kerbin\u0027s orbit. When I started executing it, I found that I had made a mistake. This was the 6.4x Kerbol System, and the solar panels were incredibly inefficient at Jool. Once the batteries ran out, the panels could only sustain around 10% thrust from the ion engine. I had to split the burn over multiple orbits, wait for Tylo to complete an orbit around Jool to continue, and finish the burns outside Tylo\u0027s SoI. In the end, I had spent 4.4 km/s instead of 3.1 km/s for the escape burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rest of the return trip was uneventful. The plane change took 0.35 km/s, and then I burned 0.65 km/s retrograde at the periapsis to get an encounter with Kerbin after one orbit. The probe entered Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere at 11.8 km/s and was destroyed a few moments later, when I couldn\u0027t keep the heatshield facing the right direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy earlier estimate was that the manned mission would require 12 km/s to reach Tylo and 5 km/s to get back.

This is essential if you really want to have fun exploring places like the Jool system, with small vessels capable of doing fun stuff on Laythe and such.

It\u0027s the latest edition of my general-purpose long-range spaceplane, primarily designed for Laythe trips; in theory it can do the entire trip to Laythe and back in one hop, thanks to the ion engines on the wingtips, but I test it using Minmus sans ions to see if the basic design is solid for vacuum work. On airless moons it lands on its tail (well, on the deployable legs, obviously) and Jeb climbs down the spinal ladder; that was actually the point of today\u0027s test, since I\u0027d made enough structural changes since the 7d version that I needed to make sure it could still land safely without breaking anything. Plus, it looks darn cool; I tried blending the control/lift surfaces into the body in ways that didn\u0027t stand out once it was in orbit and no longer needed them, and I refuse to put a tail on the design. The wing is actually a triple wing, with the inner wing acting as the load-bearing entity and control surfaces, while the upper and lower wing surfaces add more lift and prevent the inner wing from shearing under stress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to enter it in the spaceplane design contest, mainly the interplanetary explorer category, as soon as I make a less mod-intensive variant.

I can cut that down to two mods (B9, Ion Hybrid Electric) and no custom parts with a little work; unfortunately the ion mod hasn\u0027t been updated since 0.22, but I don\u0027t really have an alternative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, a trip to Minmus\u0027 surface used up most of its fuel, since I was doing the trip without the ions, so I put the two tests together and tested the docking:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yEHNDvn.png\u0022 alt=\u0022yEHNDvn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep, the Mk2 inline docking port worked just fine. While the Sleazy Weasel is a bit large for a 1-man spaceplane (33 tons), it barely made a dent in the Valdez\u0027s Kethane supply, let alone its fuel tanks. Now I\u0027m in the process of flying the Weasel to Ike for another test, and once Jeb is back home I\u0027ll launch the remaining four or five Valdez depots I need to complete my fuel network. Then, it\u0027s time for my REALLY big launches (my 1500-ton megastations, my 600-ton rovers...) and maybe a repeat of my 0.22 Grand Tour.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-03T09:25:49Z\u0022 title=\u002211/03/2014 09:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Spatzimaus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kowgan","CreatedById":116874,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-03T09:35:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, I recreated the Curiosity Rover mission.
