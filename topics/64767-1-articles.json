Ive put hours of work into it. Everything worked perfect until I realized my return ship has no reaction wheel or RCS.. a design flaw. So I added a reaction wheel module to the pod .cfg. That worked, but it deleted all of the stored data and I cant even perform a crew report... what happened? Is there a way to revert this and keep the reaction wheel?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Tried removing the reaction wheel. I can take Crew Reports again, but the data is gone. So before I scrap this mission is there a way I can atleast get the data back?

Thanks anyway for trying to help Horseman I appreciate it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.. Im just gonna cheat. I had that data ready to go. All I had to do was make the burn back home.. so instead the return craft is going to have infinite fuel. land, get the data again, take off and THEN go back. Shame.. I busted so much balls to try and do this WITHOUT cheats.. and I did. So..bah, screw it..\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
