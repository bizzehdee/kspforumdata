So now I\u0027m curious, does Squad(/Take2/whoever actually owns it now), store payment info in house, or do they use a 3rd party payment platform?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-17T20:42:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe proper people have been notified and they\u0027re seeing what they can do.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
