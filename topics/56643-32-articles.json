Does it go by the internal names for the professions or by what is displayed?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve recently discovered there is a compatibility issue with KerbalStats, and other mods that add \u0022non standard\u0022 or custom professions. I discovered this as I\u0027ve begun work on Roster Manager. These mods actively manage the profession of a kerbal by separately persisting extra data for a kerbal and using it upon load. Kerbal stats, and other mods that use active Profession management \u0022require\u0022 you to continue using their mods to retain changes made to kerbal professions. If you were to discontinue use of their mods, then your kerbals revert to the profession automatically assigned by KSP, based on the name.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wanted to provide a means of persisting the profession and name WITHOUT locking you into using SM \u0022forever more\u0022 with that particular game save. With my method, if you later decided to discontinue using SM, the altered professions remain. SO, Ship manifest uses a \u0022hack\u0022, if you will, by adding a series of Ascii \u00221\u0022s appended to the name to alter the hash generated by KSP to get the desired profession. This also means that SM does NOT support custom professions when you use the renaming options.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are using mods that use active profession management, I highly recommend you disable Kerbal Renaming and profession management in SM (it is disabled by default). If you already have some kerbals renamed using SM, you can remove the extra characters in the game save and you should be able to continue using the other mods. Iirc, they appear as \u0022smiley faces\u0022 in a normal text editor. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m looking into providing both methods in a later update, so as to maintain compatibility with these mods, and still provide you the user choice in how you want to persist profession changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this does NOT describe your issue, then I will need more information.
