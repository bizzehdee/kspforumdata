The (relatively) new hydrodynamic model got me thinking of putting it in the oceans. Has anyone ever landed a floating base in the oceans of Eve?\u00A0I\u0027m wondering if the surface of the ocean counts as the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome thoughts:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nHow would one go about assembly without rovers, maybe with RCS? Lining up the docking ports would be easier.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWould ISRU work there? Do the oceans contain ore? I know there was a rumor going around for a while that the oceans were made of rocket fuel...\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nFeel free to take this as a challenge and post pictures of your own floating Eve base!

However, if you land in the oceans, the game treats the vessel as \u0022splashed,\u0022 not \u0022landed.\u0022 This may have changed with the update, but I\u0027m not sure. You might want to send a cheap probe there to see if it checks off the \u0022landed\u0022 requirement in the contracts menu. As far as mining goes, it doesn\u0027t work in the oceans, last time I checked. However, there\u0027s nothing stopping you from doing it in sandbox.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, I might do this sometime, but I\u0027m pretty busy...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Mostly just annoyed that youtube is taking 2 hours to upload a 3 minute video when other videos of similar length upload in 20 minutes.
