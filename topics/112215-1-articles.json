The planet is called Tenorra, and while the star system it resides in has no effect on the gameplay, I would like to make it believable. The planet itself is 1.2 Earth Radii, but less dense, and thus has close to 1G of surface gravity, and is currently under siege by an armada of alien murder-bots from outer space programmed to seek out and destroy technological civilizations. Gone slightly awry. There are 2 major superpowers on Tenorra - the Tenorran Defense Union and the Coalition of Populist Socialist Nations, both are still recovering from a short-lasted dark age after the troublesome settlement of the planet, but are already I guess 40-50 years more advanced than us, much more than that in some areas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe star system consists of two Stars - an Orange K2V class main sequence star somewhat heavier than the Sun orbited by 3 asteroid belts and 14 planets, and an M8 class Brown Dwarf companion orbiting at about 120 AU from the main star, orbited by 5 planets/moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe K2V star has an inner asteroid belt, then 2 small rocky planets - Roasted and Toasted, that are well \u0022inside\u0022 of the Habitable Zone, and are exactly as their names imply, roasted and toasted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFollowed by a \u0022gas dwarf\u0022 - a gas planet about 8-9 times the size of Earth, made mostly of Hydrogen, Helium and Methane. It orbits well inside of the habitable zone. It\u0027s used by the Tenorrans as a source of Anti-protons via orbiting magnetic traps. No exceptional moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen comes Tenorra as 4th planet. Tenorra is as described above, has 9 continents that are all much smaller than Earth\u0027s, also it has a Moon about as big as Mars with a relatively thick Argon atmosphere, which is was used as a fuel source prior to the invasion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also has 3 moons - Thor, Ares and Prometheus, all of them about as big as Charon, except Ares, which is half as big. There are laser cannons built onto the surface of each of them, in addition to smaller laser satellites orbiting Tenorra itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen comes another asteroid belt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 5th planet is an Ammonia planet, with Ammonia based animal-plant hybrid life on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next 9 planets I haven\u0027t really worked on yet. There are 3 Gas Giants, 4 Ice Giants and 2 rocky planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe M8 Dwarf has a small rocky companion not bigger than Pluto, but with an unusually strong mangetic field and a tenuous hydrogen atmosphere \u0022siphoned\u0022 off from the star\u0027s outer atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next one is a semi-habitable planet about as big as Earth, tidally locked to the Dwarf that formed at the inner edge of the habitable zone, which has since moved inwards, with primitive microbial life on it, as well as a space station and some surface outposts established recently. These were the first things to be destroyed by the ICES armada - Interstellar Civilization Eradication System is what they were called by their creators, obviously in their language. And yes, that is an ISIS pun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other 3 companions of the dwarf are fairly boring rocks with equally boring rocks orbiting them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the question is: How physically viable - not probable - is this system?
