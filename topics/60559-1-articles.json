If you transmit the data you no longer have that data to return. However, only the Goo Can and Material Bay are inoperable after transmission. Also there is a 40% cap on the amount of science you can gain by transmission (Unless the transmission value is greater than that, in which case you get the amount from one transmission, but no more) It is best to return them if you can.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-21T18:11:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome experiments, like crew reports or the magnetometer and Radio Plasma Wave Sensor experiments from the DMagic science pack, will give you full value for transmission.
