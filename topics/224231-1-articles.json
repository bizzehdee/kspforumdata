I understand some elements of the maneuver node are forthcoming\u00A0 such as the precise maneuver tool featured in the first game, but it is still incredibly difficult to carry out a long form mission with the current tool. The hud element displayed after creating a maneuver node, although charming in design, lacks information that was present in the first game---This should not be the case. Interacting with the map in Ksp 2 is in a word, frustrating, as trying to click on what you wish is hard. Interacting with your conic line in another sphere of influence is not an option which whether a bug or not should be altered. One specific frustration when interacting with the map is the various iconography that can appear such as: \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E markers, An Dn nodes, names of bodies/ships, etc. It simply never works as a fluid and cohesive experience. That\u0027s not to say these icons don\u0027t look good but rather it is difficult when they are not where they are supposed to be (literally appearing separate from my orbit line) or unrequested(I had the ap and pe indicators show up for a ship I wasn\u0027t controlling. If you click on a body its name will pin; I don\u0027t think this should be a feature. There have been countless times where I\u0027ve accidentally clicked on a body and its nametag has cluttered my screen. There are just a lot of UI quirks and bugs and the UI needs to be revised functionally. My final point of feedback is the parts manager. As much as I think I understand its intent, it is just inferior to the system found in Ksp 1. The parts manager is, for whatever reason, slow and clunky and I would feel much better with individual tabs for parts I pick. One possible solution would be to have tabs more similar to the ones in Ksp 1 but have it additionally offer other parts in the same category in drop down menus like the current parts manager. I feel like the parts manager created more issues than solutions as it necessitates the kerbal manager and the resource manager which are just bulk. The resource manager is actually a great concept and it should absolutely remain in the game but I wonder if it could be integrated into the parts manager system or whatever it becomes. I went down this rabbit hole of thought become I had fuel tanks I needed to monitor the fuel level of and I went to the parts manager which had no information. Why have parts that offer no information or options in the parts manager? I want apologize if any of these seems harsh. None of my criticism is directed at the dev team, whom I know are absolutely passionate about this project. I think this project is a behemoth of an undertaking and I admire all of the hard work done so far. I look forward to the future of Ksp 2 because I know it\u0027s bright.
