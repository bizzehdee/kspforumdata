What i do (i am still learning with ssto spaceplanes) is trial and error : fly my ship to orbit, look at the remaining dV, fly back to kerbin (validates this design can get back and land), then do some adjustment (always with a new name !!!), then restart sequence.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mastikator","CreatedById":135309,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-30T15:14:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve noticed the same, it also has trouble calculating delta-v for rockets directly connected to a tank with only oxidiser (and liquid fuel in another)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattssheep4","CreatedById":146984,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-30T15:15:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you change the order of the staging in the SPH or VAB so that the rocket engines are first, KER will give the rocket dV you would have if you were still full of liquid fuel. You\u0027ll actually have more dV than that, because some or maybe most of the liquid fuel will be burned off while in atmo. You can also empty the liquid fuel tanks that will be used up in atmo to simulate what the mass of the craft will be in space.
