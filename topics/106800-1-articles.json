Used up all my cash as I didn\u0027t realise what I was doing. Reloaded last official save by pressing esc-\u0026gt;load save-\u0026gt;\u0027careersavefile\u0027. Game that loaded still didn\u0027t have any cash and building upgrades have disappeared. The upgrades were done about 5 hours ago and 3 saves. I am unable to see any other saves other than the last one so have no idea how to repair it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
