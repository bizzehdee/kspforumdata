That\u0027s what we get here. We have situations where you solve a problem with vessel architecture and a ton of heat rejection equipment, and we have situations where you solve a problem by changing your mission. The latter is pretty wide, but that includes things like flying skimming reentries to bleed off speed so you don\u0027t need a heatshield, or building your colony near a water body so you have access to easy water cooling.

For spacecraft, honestly, even with a more simulated approach, heat management will oftentimes just become \u0022add more radiators\u0022. While I think there\u0027s potential for interesting design space regarding thermodynamics for spacecraft, a lot of that stuff is impractical to implement I think. For an example here, liquid metal droplets are very effective, but they have a high minimum operating tempature, so you\u0027d want to use those for your engines, but use traditional radiators for your crew areas. This could lead to some interesting vehicle design, but not only would this system be much more difficult to implement and optimize, it would also be harder to teach, there\u0027s definitely be advantages to this approach, but I dont think the downsides outweigh it at least in the short term. So for spacecraft, heating is basically just a mass tax, it means that if you want to use your super engines, you need to sacrifice a bit of performance. Its not the most complex thing, but it helps with engine design as it means super engines benefit more from economies of scale.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nColonies is where stuff gets interesting. For craft, you can\u0027t realistically design around all three forms of heat, your primary thing dictating how much touches the ground isn\u0027t thermal in nature, its getting this thing to stay straight up in a variety of conditions. For colonies, you can much more easily design around the methods of thermodynamic transfer. For example, let\u0027s say you have a very hot planet close to the sun. You will want to minimize heat transfer as much as possible. So you may make something like this to minimize\u00A0 thermal conduct. If you have high gravity, you\u0027d probably need closer to a pyramid shape so your thing doesnt fold over, but yeah. There also could be some fun stuff when it comes to minimizing heat transfer from the sun too, for example if youre in a tidally locked planet, all you really care about is one face of your colony, meaning your colony may end up being basically a straight line to minimize transfer from the heat. I could go on and on with examples, but colonies to me is the much more promising place for thermodynamics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022image.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022103.60\u0022 height=\u0022461\u0022 width=\u0022445\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418965221630017537/1132071105352437912/image.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketRockington","CreatedById":223189,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-21T22:20:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224304586\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022218512\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221689976178\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002283952\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nertea\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n35 minutes ago, Nertea said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConduction \u0027resolves\u0027 effectively instantly on any significant timewarp unless you are using a thermally isolating piece of kit.
