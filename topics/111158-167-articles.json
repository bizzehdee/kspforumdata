Right now, you have to use a lot of bookmarks or always go back to the frontpage if you want to navigate through different sub-forums which can be pretty annyoning on it\u0027s own but even more if you got a weak connection or if you have to keep an eye on your data usage.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I thought about something like this:\n\u003E \n\nI think that\u0027s just how the forum software works-- note that Squad doesn\u0027t write that software.  I think the software auto-switches to a different format based on screen size, and is just showing the mobile-friendly-formatted version of the \u0022Activity\u0022 tab that shows up on the main page.\n\nEven if it\u0027s possible for Squad to change what\u0027s configured to show up, I might be a little leery of trying to add too much there-- mobile devices are *\u003Cu\u003Elittle\u003C/u\u003E*, and they\u0027re not all the same size, and I\u0027d be a little concerned about the potential to cause inconvenience to folks who might have smaller phones if we add more stuff there.  A \u0022don\u0027t fix it if it ain\u0027t broke\u0022 thing.\n\nAdmittedly I\u0027m not an expert in the forum software or the configuration thereof, but that\u0027s my impression of the situation."},{"CreatedByName":"Deddly","CreatedById":62955,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-11T10:03:27Z","Content":"I think it was a good idea, but I don\u0027t think we have the ability to change that ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif \u0022:(\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"4x4cheesecake","CreatedById":187982,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-11T11:02:03Z","Content":"Aww ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif \u0022:(\u0022)\n\nThank you anyway ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"TriggeredSnake","CreatedById":186851,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-11T12:51:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 20 hours ago, Red Iron Crown said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Why would they want to pretend that?
