I was inspired by Kurt Jmac and Scott Manley to post some of my KSP adventures on my own YouTube channel. All I had on my channel was KSP and one Simcity video. YouTube banned my account with no warning or strikes against my account. Why would they do this??? The developers said they love having people make let\u0027s plays of the game because it spreads the word about their game. I heard them say it in the dev stream. I used no illegal music in my videos. I really don\u0027t understand why YouTube are being such dicks. Any thoughts of what I can do? I feel helpless and infuriated.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rryy","CreatedById":57357,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-09T20:24:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt could just be the Simcity video.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"macbernick","CreatedById":57485,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-09T20:24:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should write to them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are plenty other video hosting services, I wouldn\u0027t use Youtube anyway.
