But, with Kethane being improved, I decided it was pointless trying to compete on this front, and frankly, I did not have a good idea what to do next. This scoring system is a great idea! I shall enter it on the github tracker. I totally agree with scoring points based on grabbing samples from dispersed areas, as it fits perfectly with using unmanned rovers (and potentially EVA) sample collection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdea added to github tracker: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/tek604/tekIndustriesScience/issues/39\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EScience Points tracking\u003C/a\u003E: feel free to add comments.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-25T11:07:15Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2013 11:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by tek_604\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded github link\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moon Goddess","CreatedById":57446,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-25T11:54:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo for KAS, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could do something like a sample bay, I\u0027m seeing a concave box with an open front.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would include \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EMODULE\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E\tname = KASModulePartBay\u003Cbr\u003E\tbayType = sampleBay\t\t\t\t// Restrict grabbed part with the same bayType name. if not set, all grabbable parts will be compatible.\u003Cbr\u003E\tattachNode = top\t\t\t\t// Name of the attach node\u003Cbr\u003E\tsndStorePath = KAS/Sounds/hookBayStore\t\t// Path of the store sound\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen we\u0027d have a sample box.
