They each have two directional antennas with 50Mm range. I set one dish to point at \u0022mission control\u0022 and the other to point at \u0022active vessel\u0022. Are these the correct two options to make sure they can relay a signal from any vessel? Because the third satellite, the one with no direct view of mission control, won\u0027t relay it\u0027s signal through one of the other satellites unless I specifically tell it to point one of it\u0027s dishes at one of the other two satellites.\u003Cp\u003EShouldn\u0027t pointing it at \u0022mission control\u0022 be enough for it to figure out to route the signal through one of the other satellites? After all, they both have a dish pointed at \u0022active vessel\u0022 as well as a second pointed at mission control... at the moment I have to specifically select one of the other satellites as the target for RemoteTech to connect to mission control. Is this just how the mod works, or have I set up my dishes wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink of it as plugging phone lines, you have to do the routing all by yourself, pack two more dishes to point two neighbouring satellites at each other\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr place satellites with omni-directional antennas in sufficient number/altitude that they can always connect to at least there next neighbour, keep their common orbit low enough so that the sides of the triangle/square are not longer than the range of the omni-directional antenna in use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will not need a synchronous orbit, they will just alternately link to KSC and distribute the signal through the network.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are playing career, the best available omni-directional antenna (2.5Mm?) at start will let you get away with four satellites at a low orbit so they are not to far away from each other. (Use a bit of Pythagoras here and do not forget to add the radius of Kerbin to the altitude of your orbit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will cover most of the planet and connect your probe rockets at anytime during their launch and circularisation phase to KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn such a configuration the most important thing is an equal orbital period for your satellites staying at the same spot relative to each other. You may want to install VOID or KER which display periods to the fraction of a second and pack RCS in fine tuning mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that \u0022target active vessel\u0022 will do just that. So if you have a ship at say Duna and deploy probes there and used active vessel to control said ship, you will loose connection when switching to the probe, because it is the active vessel but will most likely not have a big dish targeting Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JDCollie","CreatedById":103176,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-12T22:31:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerbMav\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KerbMav\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that \u0022target active vessel\u0022 will do just that.
