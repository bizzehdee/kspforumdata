Either way, I (think) I found a way to make the SSMEs even more efficient using plug nozzles. How difficult would it be to integrate them into the SLS, and would it be economical to add them in a SSME-f upgrade, and would it be worth it?"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T05:44:04Z","Content":"They\u0027re gonna be dumped though, so better to make them cheaper.

The existing ones have been refurbished to remove the regenerative cooling nozzles and other reusability features. Then they will be thrown away on the SLS. If there are more than 3 SLS launches, Aerojet Rocketdyne will have to build new ones.\n\nThey are pretty efficient engines. I\u0027m not sure what you would achieve by improving their efficiency. As with most aspects of engineering, the laws of diminishing returns apply here. A poorly optimized designed only requires a small effort to make a spectacular improvement. A highly optimized designed (like the RS-25) requires a huge effort for litte improvement. Effort is money, so it\u0027s not worth it."},{"CreatedByName":"shynung","CreatedById":101096,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T07:40:30Z","Content":"Typical RS-25s burn hydrogen-oxygen propellant. Replace the oxygen with fluorine, up goes your specific impulse.\n\nSure, you\u0027ll have to deal with the stream of HF going out your nozzle afterwards. But, by replacing the aluminium in the SRBs fired alongside (which typically burn aluminium-ammonium perchlorate) with beryllium, the HF and BeO (along with chlorine leftovers) react into BeF2 and HCl, which is less dangerous, in addition to giving a boost to SRB specific impulse.\n\nYes, this is all stupidly dangerous (and expensive) stuff that even the DoD probably wouldn\u0027t even bother. But the performance gains are there.![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
