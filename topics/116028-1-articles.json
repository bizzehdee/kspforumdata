The existing ones have been refurbished to remove the regenerative cooling nozzles and other reusability features. Then they will be thrown away on the SLS.

I\u0027m not sure what you would achieve by improving their efficiency. As with most aspects of engineering, the laws of diminishing returns apply here. A poorly optimized designed only requires a small effort to make a spectacular improvement. A highly optimized designed (like the RS-25) requires a huge effort for litte improvement.
