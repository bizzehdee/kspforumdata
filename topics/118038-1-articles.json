Objects attached to the main body start detaching, and seem to rotate slower than the main body. To make matters more odd, is that some objects move at different speeds than others. I made a video: [https://youtu.be/O0yc78fNskc](https://youtu.be/O0yc78fNskc)\n\nTo reproduce:\n\ncreate simple space craft, add some radial chutes and air intakes. Launch, and rotate at 4x speed. \n\nMy graphic\u0027s setting: \n\n- Render quality level: fantastic\n- Texture quality: full res\n- Fallback part shaders: false\n- Aero FX quality: normal\n- PPFX: yes\n- Surface FX: yes\n- 1280x720\n- Full screen\n- Anti-Aliasing: 2x\n- Vsync: every Vblank\n- Frame limit: 120 fps\n- Pixel light count: 8\n- Shadow: 4"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T15:07:06Z","Content":"The very first time you play the game and attempt to time warp, it spits out a little message informing you that time warping has to potential to destroy your ship.
