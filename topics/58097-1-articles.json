Which ever is placed first gets its air first, whichever was placed last starves first. if you place them with symmetry, then the one you placed is the first and the one symmetry added is next and will starve first. There isn\u0027t much you can do to avoid that that i know of, short of not having your engines away from the center of mass to reduce their kick when one flames out, or to shut them down a tad early to avoid the issue entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, a little redesign might make the off center thrust a useful thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, if you stack them one on top of the other, then you get a pitch instead of a yaw when one flames out, and i\u0027ve found the pitching is often easier to recover from when it occurs. If its a spaceplane, placing the upper engine second will make it flame out first, so you get a sudden upward pitching motion when the upper engine flames out, which is a good time to trigger your rocket engine too since you\u0027ll get that helpful upward kick to get you pointed right.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-29T04:37:36Z\u0022 title=\u002212/29/2013 04:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Amram\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scorched","CreatedById":84320,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-29T04:34:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI guess you could try setting up an action group to close the intakes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-29T05:23:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo solutions: first, don\u0027t flame out.
