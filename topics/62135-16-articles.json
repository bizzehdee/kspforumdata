Might be worth looking at for example.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHrm, I should have thought about that one. I think it has something to do with FAR\u0027s drag model getting applied, as in the logs the part has \u003Cstrong\u003Eno\u003C/strong\u003E drag model at all. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E It \u003Cem\u003Emight\u003C/em\u003E just need someone to define a drag model within the cfg for it and all might be fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Boamere the B9 cargo bays were what I compared it to. They use Firespitter for the animations and end up shielding with FAR, just like the mod in the quote. That\u0027s why I\u0027ve been scratching my head. My guess is that FAR assumes only two nodes (stack top, stack bottom) or at least everything inline, and this cargo bay has two stack nodes, one internal node for payload/airlock, and two side nodes for wing attachments. It might just be confusing the crap out of FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERE: OMS engines. I\u0027ve found if you set the pitch trim on those to 10, it flies straight almost without any input. Now if only MechJeb could take the hint and place the nose 10 degrees off the maneuver node...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
