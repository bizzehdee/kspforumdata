I have the Making History Expansion, and the mods I have installed are KK\u0027s SpaceX\u00A0Pack,\u00A0 Module Manager, and SpaceX Launcher Towers. Basically, after I launched my rocket it exploded mid-air. After I reverted the flight to launch, the screen was stuck on the loading screen. However, when I pressed escape, it opened up the pause menu! When I unpaused, it was missing a bunch of parts, including the SRBs. Plus, the camera was stuck in a rotated position and all of the engines and stuff were on one stage. I did the same launch again and the same thing happened. Does anyone know how to fix this glitch? Have you experienced it before? Please let me know.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also made a video about this, which i posted on my yt:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/9erwMxee210?start=1\u0026amp;feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-03-31T00:43:46Z\u0022 title=\u002203/31/2021 12:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 31, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by paKSP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-01T19:50:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre those 30 parachutes on the left?!
