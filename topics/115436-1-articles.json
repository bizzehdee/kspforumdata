Nasty lines kept getting generated where the parts joined. I\u0027m attempting to create seamless models which I know is somewhat insane but... boats don\u0027t have seams.

I see this in seams in my parts, sometimes internally to the parts if it has separate mesh objects. Some of the seams though have been due to not having enough of a \u0022margin\u0022 in the texture (that is, drawing widely outside the polygon in the UV map). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the things I did in SpaceY to try to make the seams less visible between fuel tanks is to have diagonally intersecting rims.

I was kinda on that track, I just didn\u0027t know the technical answer. I use Wings and it has a habit of putting the unwraps right at the edge of the image. I learned to move the unwraps a few pixels away from the edge. What I didn\u0027t realize was that where parts join, the image, well in my untechnical language, the edges bleed over. The pics above are from a .png with an alpha transparent background (saved from Unity in .mbm). When I changed the background to black, all of the lines turned black. When I went back to an alpha background set the image to alpha transparent in Unity, the lines became multi-colored. After reading your explanation, I realized what I needed to do. I stretched out the brown texture that represents the \u0027deck\u0027 and... amazing, the lines vanished. I was overlapping the unwrap by 5-10 pixels. Apparently, that\u0027s not nearly enough.
