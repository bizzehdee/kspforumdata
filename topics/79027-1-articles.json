When you connect them, you attach them from the tank they are transferring fuel FROM first, then connect to the tank they are transferring fuel TO. The above arrangement will ensure that the central tank is completely full when the outside tanks are empty, since it will draw from the outside tanks first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I agree with the others on this thread - your vehicle is seriously over-engineered for a simple Mun lander - and it will get you into trouble as-is. The problem with it is that since it has been so over-engineered, it masses a ton (or rather many, many tons) - and will be difficult to land on the Mun intact for an inexperienced pilot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is to take the core (only) and practice landing on Minmus a dozen times - it is a little more difficult to get to orbit around Minmus (you need to match planes, and costs more dV) but it is ten times easier to learn to do a powered landing on Minmus as opposed to the Mun. Once you can land anywhere you want on Minmus surely and quickly with no mistakes, you are ready for the Mun (until I started practicing on Minmus I was hopeless at Munlanding)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdvantages of Minmus vs. the Mun:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) the \u0022Flats\u0022 are ideal locations to learn the basics of landing. Perfectly flat and at 0m elevation. All you have to worry about is learning to kill horizontal velocity properly and manage your descent speed. You will be very hard pressed to find anywhere on the Mun that is flat or at 0 elevation, and none at all that are both and easy to target to land at from orbit. This makes it easy to practice the basics of landing before getting into more complex stuff like trying to aim for a \u0022nice\u0022 spot while doing a powered descent, and dealing with trying to eyeball (or check in the cockpit) your \u0022real altitude\u0022 while still managing your descent speed and horizontal velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Much lower surface gravity. The practical effect of which is that everything happens at about one fifth the speed it happens on the Mun - giving you much more time to think about what you are doing, and much more leeway for error. A misstep that would be absolutely fatal on the Mun is much more likely to be recoverable on Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Because of 2 - much lower dV requirements for landing, and once landed, taking off again - making Minmus much more fuel economical even though it takes more fuel just to get there - while it may take 15% more fuel to get there and achieve orbit, it requires about one quarter the fuel to land and take off again.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-23T20:53:44Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2014 08:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SDEngineer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Idrryl","CreatedById":115209,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-23T21:24:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SDEngineer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SDEngineer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAdvantages of Minmus vs. the Mun:\u003Cp\u003E1) the \u0022Flats\u0022 are ideal locations to learn the basics of landing.
