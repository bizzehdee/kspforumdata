This is purely for the sake of humor, and mostly built off \\*my\\* experiences early on in KSP. No offense intended. If you have examples to add, feel free, but NO MENTIONING ANY NAMES. Most of these can be fixed by some reading up on the forums, wiki articles, and just trial and error.\n\nYou Might Be A Scrub In KSP If....\n\n1 Terms like Periapsis and Apoapsis confuse you.\n\n2 You mix up Periapsis and Apoapsis on a regular basis.\n\n3 You take the \u0022Moar Boosters\u0022 thing literally.\n\n4 Parachute deployment happens during launch quite often.\n\n5 Half your part count is devoted to struts, because \u0022Moar Struts\u0022 must be good advice.\n\n6 Bigger = Better, right?\n\n7 Units of speed and distance are frequently stated to be Imperial units, like feet, miles and so on.\n\n8 Mun landings are nigh-impossible without heavy use of HUGE rocket parts, most of which are from mods.\n\n9 The phrase \u0022Rocket Equation\u0022 means nothing to you.\n\n10 It doesn\u0027t matter if our spacecraft only draws a little bit of power for SAS usage, we need a TON of solar panels - they look good.\n\n11 Career mode? Only if it\u0027s set to Easy and then tweaked to give me a huge amount of funds, rep and science to start.\n\n12 Going to land on the Mun? Get into a 100km orbit (or was that 100 miles?) and then burn backwards until you stop. Fall all the way down for a landing - which usually needs a rescue mission.\n\n13 You are in awe over folks that can pull off Mun landings without any mods at all.\n\n14 You cannot fathom the act of pulling off a rendezvous or landing without Mechanical Jebediah.\n\n15 The most complex rocket you made was specifically built to destroy the entire KSC facility in one launch, but you somehow can\u0027t manage a trip to Duna.\n\n16 Spaceplanes and SSTO\u0027s run off of distilled witchcraft and arcane arts, and are to be avoided at all times.\n\n17 Ooo, that makes a nice pic. (whips out cellphone)\n\n18 \u0022Guys, why can\u0027t my game run on [insert ten-year-old system here]?\u0022\n\n19 \u0022Cool rocket, can I get the craft file?\u0022\n\n20 \u0022Yeah, I\u0027ve been to Duna once, so you could say that I\u0027m somewhat of a KSP expert now.\u0022\n\n21 \u0022Check out my youtube vid that I recorded with a potato!\u0022\n\n22 (bonus) \u0022Hey guys, check out this offer for some Raybans for 90% off!\u0022\n\nAgain, this is in jest and for a laugh.
