This game has inspired me to take on math and science in school, learn more about space and rockets, and overall has inspired me. The game is so interesting it\u0027s become part of my daily routine, and my youtube and browser history. I have a feeling this game will become the new minecraft soon, (but it\u0027s much better) and deserves soo much attention. Again, I just want to thank you guys for being so inspiring and interesting, thanks! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E -Master\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
