When I heard \u0022Hold Me Now,\u0022 I knew *exactly* what I wanted to do with it.  \n  \nAs of this post, I\u0027m still in the process of writing up the actual story-segment for ATS pt 6, so... spoilers. Read at your own discretion.  \n\n\u003E   \n\u003E Initially, the KSV-X3 rocket was slated for a simple orbital test. KSC had to know if the drone-operated transfer stage could make it back safe \u0026 sound. Jeb had other ideas.  \n\u003E The capsule segment however, did not actually hold enough dV to attain a stable Mun orbit and return, resulting in a dead-weight trajectory that shot him around the Mun and right back at Kerbin.  \n\u003E Now since KSC is still in the process of rebuilding after Hurricane Beta, they lack the infrastructure to recover pilots \u0026 craft from \u0022anywhere on Kerbin.\u0022 Unless it\u0027s within view distance of KSC, the \u0022Recover Vessel\u0022 button is forbidden, which leaves Jeb in need of a pickup. Enter the KAV-12 \u0022Slider\u0022 VTOL. While never designed to be autonomous, the OCTO drone core mounted to its spine allows remote piloting, and Burhat flies it out with an empty cockpit to collect our wayward Kerman.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E On a personal note, those final VTOL shots were some of the trickiest flying I\u0027ve ever attempted, and required a whole lot of reloading to get both the timing and the camera work where I needed them. VTOLs are hard enough to land *with* a visible throttle, trying to set them down without is nerve-wracking."},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T22:43:22Z","Content":"That was a really well edited video, congrats.

You-tube always gives me all these warnings if I try and use any music by recent artists.\n\nI check Youtube first to see if the music is \u0022available\u0022 - that is, if videos using it have remained up and accessible. If they have, that generally means my use of it will be \u0022allowed,\u0022 but with ads inserted from the copyright holders who monetize that content.\n\nSince I run adblock, and don\u0027t monetize any of my own videos, it\u0027s never bothered me that much. However, I should also add that it *is* blocked in Germany on copyright grounds.\n\nSo no, not worried about it being taken down.
