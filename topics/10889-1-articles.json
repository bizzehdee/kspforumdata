Its only about 150m/s free boost, but the delta-v expended for 75km orbit with the carrier ship ends up being ~3200m/s depending on your timing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETakeoff for the carrier ship remains... challenging. After takeoff and dropping the first stage (rear landing gear) the thing is FREAKISHLY stable until you hit the ramjet at 5k.
