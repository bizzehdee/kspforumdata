In other words the flaps just go crazy trying to keep the plane in balanced flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not use to the new interfaces with the updating versions so I may not have the correct selections for Tail vs wings or that is what I assume, however I have attempted to tweak various settings to no avail. I have also confirmed with using FAR stock craft that they fly correctly so obviously a setting or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand yes compared the settings of the stock FAR craft to self-made and regardless of the simplistic designs I am employing and setting very similar/same to FAR stock craft no success is being had \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would post a pic however I have no success in doing so as steam seems problematic for this.
