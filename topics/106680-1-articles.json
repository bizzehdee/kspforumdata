[Like this](http://i.imgur.com/pBp3FTH.png)\n\nSo naturally I tried the others, eg. .down, .left, .right etc. but they did not seem to be in 90 deg rotations.\n\nfor example Vector3(0,0,1) was at a 45 deg angle.\n\nThe only vector that seems to point straight up is (-1.46,0,1) but I don\u0027t want to use a combination of value I just want 2 zero values and then a positive value (eg. 0,0,1) as using a combination creates oscillations.\n\nThis has probably been quite difficult to follow and I can give more info if needed but hopefully someone can help. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T21:59:24Z","Content":"You\u0027re forgetting that you need to apply the force in world coordinates, not in local coordinates.
