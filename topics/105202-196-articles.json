For example, with the containment area having an estimated radius of 1.25m and a measured height of 90cm (measured against the 26.6cm cubic family strut), the 2.5m Life Support Tank has a capacity of ~4.91m^3 and holds 4.5t of supplies, giving a density of 916 kg/m^3, not too far off from the density of water, and pretty darn close to the density of typical foodstuffs afik.* But if we assume that supplies also contain the kerbals\u0027 supply of oxygen, the density could be much lower. O2\u0027s density at NTP is 1.331 kg/m^3. Of course, it would be pressurized in storage; keeping temperature constant and raising the pressure to 200atm (2939.19psia),** we get up to 266.2 kg/m^3. According to the above source, an astronaut\u0027s food/water/oxygen supply is 16.7% oxygen by mass, so 1t of supplies contains 167kg-\u0026gt;0.627m3 of O2 and 833kg-\u0026gt;0.833m^3 of food/water, for a total density of approximately 685 kg/m3.*** (And lord I just spent WAY too much of my day working that out!)

In either case 10.8 supplies/day would fall somewhere between consumption at a brand-new base and a moderately mature one. I think the tight rations short missions can use are fairly well-approximated by the grace-period mechanic, no problems there; but unfortunately the difference between conservative and comfortable lifestyles on an interplanetary transfers versus a stable base is so huge, I\u0027m not sure a middle-ground value does either of them justice. Maybe it would be interesting if, beyond a certain vessel habitation rating, kerbals started scaling up their resource consumption? Using a Mars (read: Duna) mission as a reference point, it might start at four years; this would allow for there-and-back-again trips to the inner planets on a Spartan supply ration, but if the Kerbals feel any more comfortable in their vessel they might be tempted to settle into a more comfortable lifestyle and splurge on water. Supply use could continue to increase with habitation rating until maybe the ten-year mark; this would make Jool or Eeloo trips interesting to plan for, since the Kerbals would be using a lot more supplies and thus require a more sustainable life support system.
