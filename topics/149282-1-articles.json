When rolling, the rotation speed is also wrong (probably from using a wrong wheel radius). This behavior broke with the switch to unity 5 and the new wheel modules.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen using the config value \u0022rescaleFactor\u0022 for scaling, KSP seems to do these things right. The fields mentioned in the part.cfg are all unchanged for such a wheel, and I couldn\u0027t get the physical behavior right by tweaking them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan anyone tell what needs to be done to bring those wheels to the right scale?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS: poking around I found that ModuleWheelBase::Wheel seems to always be null (checked OnLoad and OnStart), isn\u0027t this meant to lead to the inner workings of the wheel system?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
