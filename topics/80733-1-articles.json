But, being who and what I am, I did not communicate it in a very constructive way. Thus, I am rewriting this first post to more accurately describe what I am attempting to get out of this thread and in a (hopefully) much more agreeable manner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEveryone \u002Bdog comes in here and says what everyone already knows: The modding community has many shortcomings. However when they pitch their idea of a solution it is almost always \u0022get the modder to do X\u0022. This is not my goal\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to start a dialog with the active mod Authors in the community. I want to know their processes. I want to know anything that could make their side of the coin smoother. And then, with that information, I want to find a solution that does not change what the mod Authors do at all, but how the community interacts with the finished product (mod)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets talk\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am keeping my original post for context of the posts that followed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs you can see on the post count I am sort of new here. I saw the SpacePort all but twice. Did not own the game back then, just looking and wishing and dreaming.\u003Cp\u003EBut then I did finally get KSP and immediately started looking for mods so I could build the spaceplane I had in my head. What I found was utter chaos. Squad had changed their modding site to Curse, mod authors resisted this change even going as far as creating their own hosting site, Kerbal Stuff. But for most, the KSP Forum was their showcase and the cloud was their host. No easy way to browse, search or even check for updates. Not being new to this sort of thing (I work with developers, after all) I decided I wanted to help. I found many that thought like I did, trying to make tools and meta-repositories that could bring order to chaos. But there are so many, which was the problem in the first place. Too many options. I had my own idea, a dev tool for modders that would package their mod in a standardized way and send it to all current hosting locations. That went over so well that no one posted to that thread. So did my idea of picking a single host point. The mod authors complained so badly for a \u0022don\u0027t care\u0022 option that one of the Moderators had to add it to the poll. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been over this so many times in my head, thinking of a standardized way to get mod from author to user without trying to force the authors to do anything out of their normal process. And then I think back to the \u0022I don\u0027t care\u0022 attitude and get just a tad pissed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of the Mod Authors here. You. I am angry at you. YOU ARE GEN 1. You are the masters. You are the originals that all KSP modders will emulate years from now. Your actions now will have a drastic impact on the KSP mod community of the future! And right now you are doing NOTHING* to put this community together. Everyone has got their own way of doing things and they don\u0027t care about what others do. BUT YOU SHOULD CARE! When KSP goes 1.00.0 is THIS how you want YOUR modding community to work?! Just a bunch of announcements on a forum pointing to github or dropbox or mediafire or [putyourhosthere]? Right now the \u003Cstrong\u003EAdd-on Releases and Projects Showcase\u003C/strong\u003E has 1100\u002B threads. Do you think the forum could handle 2000 more and still be the slightest bit useful? How would someone find your mod? How would someone even browse though all that if they are just looking at what you guys have to offer? Especially those of you that do not update often cause there is no need to. Your mod would be all the way back on page 40-something. Is this what you want? No? THEN TALK ABOUT IT!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo one wants to tell you guys what to do. You guys do an awesome job making mods. But you all need to come together as the leaders of this community and have a nice long chat about the direction you all want to take moving into the future. You don\u0027t have to pick a single hosting site or even package your mods a specific way.

Devs, for instance, spent some time adding hooks for the new contract features, but [thread=86588]it\u0027s only been documented[/thread] by a modder, who had to do a bunch of trial and error testing to figure out how to use them. Part of this is because KSP is a work in progress and devs are focused on adding new features, rightly noting that the modding community seems to be able to help itself. KSP\u0027s license prohibits decompilation so debugging and code tracing are tedious and difficult and frustrating. (Compare to Minecraft, where its permissive license has fomented the creation of the MCP and other standardized mod development packages.)

Chatterer is a great example of this. It\u0027s a goofy little plugin that adds background jibberish. There is no flipping way I would have found that via search as I would never search for background noise.

Spaceport sucked. Anyone who used is as an author should tell you that. No API, the stats were bogus, and the service itself worked only some of the time. The replacement was supposed to be feature-rich and custom built with what we needed. Squad decided it wasn\u0027t worth the expenditure and outsourced it to Curse. Even if it remains stable it won\u0027t provide the functionality you\u0027re looking for. Nonetheless it is the THE official source and there is not likely to be support for another from Squad.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E Almost everyone is upset with the move curse.
