More thrust, less wobble!","CreatedByName":"mrtauntaun","CreatedById":91014,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T16:15:49Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"mrtauntaun","CreatedById":91014,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T16:15:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo my biggest issue with capturing an asteroid has been the one claw limitation. You can\u0027t use more than one and still get your CoT behind your CoM. You can get it very very close, but it\u0027s incredibly tedious. Using a single claw results in a lot of wobble at higher thrust. This would make moving some roids take just shy of forever. So, I built this craft, the RoidMover-WS Mk I (Wobble Stabilization). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/k8ZpGg3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022k8ZpGg3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/70Cplwq.png\u0022 alt=\u002270Cplwq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a heavy, um, pusher(?) that can handle up to Class C asteroids, though is less efficient with smaller asteroids; the more surface area the better. Just grab your roid, align your CoM/CoT, lock yer pivot and deploy the stabilization arms!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Hz1P8OJ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Hz1P8OJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce deployed, you need only lock the pistons and it will significantly (in my testing) reduce the amount of wobble under thrust with SAS engaged. I was able to get a Class C into LKO with fuel to spare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ypeQMT4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ypeQMT4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that I have a proof of concept, I am working on a MK II super heavy version which I hope can push Class E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cattasraafe","CreatedById":109025,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-21T22:56:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat looks nice.
