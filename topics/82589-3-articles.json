But the efficiency of a NERVA is a inverse function of the molecular mass of the propelant ( better said, it is proportional to the average speed of the molecules of the propeller, that for a certain fixed temperature is a inverse function of the square root of the molecular mass of it ( IIRC ) ) , thus using LO2 is probably more than a order of magnitude worse than using LH2 ( depends of exaust temp and some other stuff ) and it is even worse with other ( heavier ) oxidizing agents.
