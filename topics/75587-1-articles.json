Actually I started on the demo version which at the time was pre 0.14 but within an few hours I decided that I had to have the full version which was mainly because of Mods. Stopped playing for a while and recently picked it up again and it\u0027s taking over my spare time, which is fine when you are away from home working. I use quite a few mods though mainly those that provide aesthetic improvements, extra information. I don\u0027t use anything that is too overpowered or cheats though Mechjeb is good for working out your DV and planning interplanetary manoeuvre nodes. So far I\u0027m working my way up the 0.24 tech tree, Landed on the Mun and Minmus manually and made it home with fuel to spare. My landings on Minmus was the best I\u0027ve done so far as I landed almost exactly where I wanted, though I suppose the lack of atmosphere and low gravity helped a lot. In V0.22 I made 2 landings on Minmus, one on the Mun and also made it to Eve and landed a couple of robotic probes, but I\u0027ve since started again with V0.23.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeen working on a lander \u0026amp; Rover combination for Duna, the lander with the Rover attached can almost make Low Kerbin orbit on it\u0027s own so it should be good to get me back from Duna. Built a space tug, launched the lander, docked another bigger space tug in orbit and can\u0027t get it on an escape trajectory because the docked lander is too wobbly. Planning to rectify this with a repair mission using KAS to add struts and some missing fuel lines and then Jeb and Bob will be on their way to the red planet. This is such a fun game and much better than simply killing things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy flying folks and may the Kraken never get you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers HV.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T22:48:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the community!

I love the excellent models with full IVA that Bobcat has made. It\u0027s really small and adding a few solar panels, a battery and an Antenna is all I had to do to it. I figured it\u0027s only cheating \u0022a bit\u0022 because I plan on manually getting the lander to Duna and returning it to Kerbin. I like the rover you have built But I wanted something that I could fit a Kerbal on rather than a robotic rover which is why I used the Ant.

I would like to upload some shots but I\u0027m away from home working and only have internet on my work computer. My laptop doesn\u0027t have internet access but I suppose I could transfer some of the shots with a memory stick. My Duna Lander is large, has a lot of science modules that are recoverable and enough fuel and power to almost make it into Kerbin Orbit. I went for a wide setup with 4 tanks around a central fat one and 8 landing legs to give it lots of stability. It handles well and as I said above has the Ant rover strapped to the bottom. I have launched it and landed it successfully on Kerbin, did a simulated mission in the desert, re launched and landed the small \u0022top\u0022 capsule in the mountains for more science. The only problem is building a launch vehicle powerful enough to get it into orbit with enough fuel to get to Duna with a bit to spare to get back in case of problems. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HavelockVetinari","CreatedById":90729,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-22T23:22:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey Supernovy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a question for you about rover design. I took your advice and decided to make a very small rover it was basically and octo a frame a couple of batteries, a solar panel, a few small science sensors and 4 of the smallest stock wheels. I did what you did and mounted them at an angle to get more stability but I found that even going down the launch ramp when the thing hit the bottom it flipped over almost every time. Now I understand if I go fast it will flip if it hits a bump but this is a violent flip and it does it on almost every bump even when going slow. This does not bode well for any missions I use the thing on. Is this normal with those wheels of is my rover just a bit too unstable? I have given it a low centre of gravity and as wide a wheel base as possible. Oh I did use some infernal robotics motorised hinges so I could fold the legs when attached to my ship as well as a camera but the rest is stock. I will try and upload a picture of it tomorrow. Thanks for any advice. If I can\u0027t get it to work then I will probably go with the ANT.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HavelockVetinari","CreatedById":90729,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-23T20:31:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs requested here are some of my recent endeavours with V0.23\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding on the Mun; \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/w2pPc#2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/w2pPc#2\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/w2pPc#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/w2pPc#0\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/w2pPc#1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/w2pPc#1\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/w2pPc#21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/w2pPc#21\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding on Minmus; \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/w2pPc#18\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/w2pPc#18\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna Lander and Bobcat MkV-Ant rover.
