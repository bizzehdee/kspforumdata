First homo sapien that either rubbed two sticks together to discover fire or hit a rock really hard and made a spark (Pun intended). Unfortunately, we don\u0027t know his name, so I\u0027ll call him \u0022Grreukkk Strong Big\u0022. So Grreukkk Strong Big is the most important person in human history.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Wernher Von Braun. He spearheaded space exploration efforts in the early years of NASA. Many believe without him, the United States would\u0027ve either never reached the moon or have delayed its first landing by a massive difference in time from the original 1969 landing date.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Newton. Defined physics, made a huge impact by using methods that even scientists use today. Even the top minds like Einstein admired him for his genius. He also highly advanced mathematics; in short, his contributions to math and science are almost priceless\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Everyone. At this time and moment, we are defining our species interplanetary future. We are defining the boundaries of science, working through with robotics, and even playing with physics itself. Everyone on Earth at this era is important - because even though we don\u0027t have one defined frontier that everyone can access easily, the frontiers that we do have (Robotics, Space, Physics, Medicine, Technology in general), will define us for millienia to come.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll start the list off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob, Tom, Tim....
