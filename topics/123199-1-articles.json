The first stage needs to get an arc that either reaches or almost goes out of the atmosphere, whilst at the same time sets it up for a landing at the peninsula east of KSC. This allows it to be recovered at about a 80% rate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1J7dk9Il.png\u0022 alt=\u00221J7dk9Il.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/s0CK0Wtl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022s0CK0Wtl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe booster has air-brakes, and should always have a sliver of fuel left for course corrections and touchdown. There are five chutes, as well as the probe core and reaction wheels inside the cargo bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/f0bD0Zfl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022f0bD0Zfl.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ac3lNQ1l.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Ac3lNQ1l.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bYPTlF9l.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bYPTlF9l.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen second stage kicks in. With a 20 ton payload, the second stage has a little over 900 m/s of delta-v, which is enough to put it into orbit and allow it to deorbit for reuse. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0Npwwqql.png\u0022 alt=\u00220Npwwqql.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VLaoG46l.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VLaoG46l.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter putting the cargo into orbit, the second stage deorbits, and land with parachutes. with good aim, I\u0027d be able to recover an even greater portion of the cost from this stage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xhCRZ99l.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xhCRZ99l.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/euoNUOzl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022euoNUOzl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FishInferno","CreatedById":106219,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-17T11:26:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery cool indeed!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
