How do I get to a certain inclination without having any target to set to?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I have no idea what Longitude of Ascending Node means, or how to change it.

That is to say that the orbit will be in approximately the opposite direction of a standard prograde orbit. In map view, the target orbit is shown with small beads of light moving around. These indicate the correct direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t need to worry about the longitude of the ascending node. If you match Ap, Pe, and inclination, that will complete the contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T18:34:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInclination is the angle with Kerbin\u0027s equator. To get it set the Mun as target, as it has 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 inclination, then look at ascending/descending nodes in map view. To modify it simply burn normal or anti-normal (purple triangles on the navball) at these nodes (this get more complicated for high angles), this will modify your inclination but not the position of the nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELongitude of ascending node is the position of the ascending node on the orbit. It is hard to find as stock KSP doesn\u0027t show you your coordinates unless you\u0027re landed; but as Starhawk said if you match all the other requirements, it will be at the right place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENormally you should see the required orbit in map view which makes it easier to get to the orbit. First get an approximately round orbit, then match the inclination (and longitude of ascending node if you manipulates your inclination at the right place), then match apoapsis and periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptLobster","CreatedById":144201,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T19:17:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help!
