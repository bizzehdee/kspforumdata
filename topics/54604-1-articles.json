This won\u0027t work, but on Kerban this doesn\u0027t happen. I swapped out the landing gear with the smallest version of the landing legs which should be the most stable because they have less room that they can move before the girders hit the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter I made this one with the landing legs I was looking at the I beams.
