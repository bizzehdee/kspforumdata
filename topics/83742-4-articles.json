The result was a pain to handle, because the attachment system hated any and every collision system i tried with it. The result was tanks not wanting to sit in the truss system or being a real pain the butt to get anything to look even semi-coherant to the actual ship it was meaning to represent. Detatching the truss system altogether also would encourage people to use it for unintended purposes.
