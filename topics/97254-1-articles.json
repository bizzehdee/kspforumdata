At least, i\u0027m among those who would like a middle ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUntil now, i revert all my test flights at no cost, for the following reasons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I do not want to land over and over and over again, just to test a minor change\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Since the game offers little tools to \u0022simulate\u0022 things pre-launch, you have to compensate with more test flights. A deficit of the game should not be the player\u0027s burden - hence, i\u0027m unwilling to pay the full vehicle costs. Heck, i could land and recover most of them, but just cannot be bothered to do it over and over again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBUT, i do not expect development to be free. I could fully understand and might even consider it interesting, if a test-flight costs a percentage of the vehicle cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHence, my proposal for plugin to do this: Just have a configfile in which you can set a percentage, and the plugin then on revert checks the vessel cost, and deduct the funds that are not covered by the set percentage. No GUI neccessary or other complex stuff neccessary - just automatically deduct on revert, and that\u0027s it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this is technically possible (that is, ability to detect revert, and get the vehicle costs), then this probably would be a \u0026lt;10 minutes coding job.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-20T17:15:59Z\u0022 title=\u002201/20/2015 05:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rynak\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eremoved request-tag, since a solution was posted\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Malah","CreatedById":96644,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-20T14:37:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can do this with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43645\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMission Controller 2\u003C/a\u003E and to simulate, you can do this with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93722\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESRL\u003C/a\u003E or with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92377\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKCT\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I will look if I can easly add a revert cost to my QuickRevert mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-20T14:43:05Z\u0022 title=\u002201/20/2015 02:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Malah\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rynak","CreatedById":115092,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-20T15:03:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for the hints!
