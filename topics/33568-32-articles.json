I kept all the fields default for the Kerbin orbit and just used the drop-down to select Mun\u0027s orbital parameters. Then I entered in 1y 293d 10h to the Search Initial Epoch and hit the button to compute. It gave me a burn time of 1y 295d! So I tried entering into the Kerbin orbit Epoch a time an hour before the search epoch. Better, but still like 5 hours into the flight. I\u0027m in a circular 100km orbit I should be able to burn towards Mun way earlier than 5 hours. So I changed the final orbit epoch from 0 to 9 hours after the Initial Search epoch to hopefully constrain the rendezvous but then I got a burn time to Mun on day 295 again. What am I doing wrong here? I realize the burn itself is essentially the same but I was hoping not to have to do trial and error in Mission Architect to use the burn dV info to get the Mun intercept shortly after establishing orbit (between 9 and 10 am)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: duh, nevermind.

It should be identical for the Initial Elliptical Orbit with a Transfer and for the Initial State with Mission Architect; using the Initial Elliptical Orbit (and checking the Use? checkmark with Mean Anom. and Epoch) the result will actually show the burn time for the manuever changes when changing those parameters, so reflecting the different initial position of the vessel along its orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-26T02:01:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the additional insight, Diomeda.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrowStar is on break so I don\u0027t wanna bug him with what is hopefully a simple issue others have already come across.

This is planned for about 2.5 weeks ahead of the current game time. I used the rendezvous plotter to get my initial Mun burn time and info, circularized and plane-changed to match the orbit of a vessel I want to rendezvous with. From there I went back to the rendezvous plotter with the Final State information from Mission Architect and imported the current orbital information of the target vessel from KSP. However, the red orbit of my kerbed Mun craft seems to be inclined opposite the target vessel. The only thing I notice different in the parameters between the MA and RP is that one has True Anomaly and the other calls for Mean Anomaly.
