I think I recall it\u0027s under $100. It took a little getting used to, but it\u0027s actually pretty great, at least based on the time I used it for. Trial ran out of course. A lot of other people reccomend it too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve looked for a good freeware editor for ages. They were all utter garbage, almost completely unusable. There were a few that were semi-usable, but still very annoying to use and barely more capable than movie maker (when it still had the timeline). Finally I was reccomended one called lightworks which has a free version. It has an ugly and somewhat irritating interface but would seem to be quite capable and has a lot of good features. Only problem is that (despite having a 1080p monitor) my coputer refuses to let me go to 1080p and the main toolbar gets stuck in the middle of the screen sticking up through the top and it won\u0027t let me move it so I can\u0027t use all the features (It did go to the left ONCE, so that\u0027s how I know I was missing important features that were only found on the toolbar), including some fairly basic ones. If I could fix up the toolbar, then it seems like this would be the best program to use. It has, apparently, a very good timeline system, can control output settings, has some effects and all those sort of things. Look into it at least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m planning on buying Sony movie studio when I get a new computer, which will be later in the year most likely.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"joppiesaus","CreatedById":57698,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-05T06:01:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWindows movie maker is good for simple stuff, such as comments, but it isn\u0027t quite advanced.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbface","CreatedById":58573,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-05T07:07:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022joppiesaus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022joppiesaus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWindows movie maker is good for simple stuff, such as comments, but it isn\u0027t quite advanced.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWMM is a glorified slideshow maker.
