I use it for SCANsat stuff because thats how I can ballence it easily.

I use a bit of cheating to get it all \u0022hidden\u0022 so the onlythings that are visable, are the solar panels, the antenna, the thruster, and whatever SCANsat part I\u0027m using.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause I like playing in Science Sandbox mode, It takes me a bit to get everything, so I have only tested the design with the Low-Res scanner, and the Multispectral scanner.
