It tells me to place a maneuver node so I do, I also then find where I need to plane the node to get to the Mun, I do. Then it says my burn time will be about 2 minutes and 30 seconds, so I start my burn at 1 minute 15 seconds. The thing is, my Delta V barely goes down and I end up passing the node because my Delta V didn\u0027t finish, this is also happening on a science save file I have were im trying to get to Minmus but the maneuver node and Delta V aren\u0027t cooperating with me. How do I fix this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-19T16:01:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/206870-imakerbal/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022206870\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/206870-imakerbal/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@ImAKerbal\u003C/a\u003E, are you using any mods?
