As you get close to them they slide around to the dark side of the nav ball of doom... so unless I am \u0022Not going to space today\u0022 then I cant tell. So doing a fine approach means that I need to do acrobatics and flip the vehicle to find the marker. Is there a way to free spin the navball and see its far side? or maybe a transparency of some kind (with tinting to tell its on the far side!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
