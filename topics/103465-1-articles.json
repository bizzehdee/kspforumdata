I suspect this is much of the cause of the difficulties you have in getting the craft to rotate off the runway. Those back wheels need to be as close to the CoM as they can get while remaining behind it (so that the craft doesnt pop a wheelie when loaded). Otherwise, if you think about physics, specifically levers and moments, then it requires a lot of force to nose the aircraft up since its pivoting around the rear wheels. Obviously lift is doing part of the work, but if its sluggish to rotate, this may well be the culprit. (actually your CoL is behind the back wheels, so lift is actually punishing you by lifting the back-end and preventing rotation and the craft will theoretically lift easier at low speeds, very odd)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it comes to tweaking the CoM and CoL. I know people say the CoM should be ahead of CoL, and this is true, but it should never be \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E far apart. I usually like the two indicators to be slightly overlapping. Since much of the front of your craft is drymass (the tanks are at the back) then the CoM is going to shift very little during flight and this issue is going to come back and bite you every step of the road to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the amount of pitch authority you have is partly (largely) dependant on the distance from the CoM to the pitch control surfaces. With your CoM so far back you lose effective pitch from these. This is physics levers again. Id want to shunt the CoM forward a chunk, and the CoL forward significantly (canards up-front will accomplish a lot of this). That way you have a nice long lever for the pitch control surfaces to work with. If you look at historical real world designs you might spot some odd-looking things with really long tails, this is specifically to lengthen that lever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince its FAR there are some more fun issues for you down the road such as mach tuck (CoL moves backward as you go supersonic), this means you dont want to nestle the two centres too closely together, but still, much closer than they are now.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-07T17:51:15Z\u0022 title=\u002204/07/2015 05:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by celem\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Efix\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T13:06:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFAR eh?

Take that advice with a grain of salt as I\u0027m still learning; generally the pitching surfaces will have less effectiveness if they\u0027re placed in-line with the main wing.

There\u0027s some pretty hellacious Q right there at take-off; more than once I pulled up too hard and ripped the plane apart from the dynamic forces...and the plane has a very high takeoff speed, around 150 m/s. Level flight AoA for takeoff was 12 degrees. That\u0027s assuming I built the clone correctly. I did get it off the ground a few times - I just had to nurse it a bit to keep the Q survivable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStability analyses showed a number in the red - M\u003Csub\u003Ew\u003C/sub\u003E - at 20k / Mach 3, and the simulation studies showed the system to be unstable at that point. M\u003Csub\u003Ew\u003C/sub\u003E in the red means pitch-up behavior, and it\u0027s been established the plane has poor pitch authority. That\u0027s why you were going into the stall.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T10:07:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESalehRam: Rapiers are not the most efficient engines of themselves, but when you allow for the mass of carrying seperate rocket engines around then they become more attractive. You can get a craft that size to orbit ok with just one Rapier - if you look at the bottom of the first page of the thread that was my version of your initial craft, with canards, without the extra two engines, and that was in orbit stupidly fast. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/r4b6Zk\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7713/16444839953_cbfa4ff1ef_c.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002216444839953_cbfa4ff1ef_c.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERear wheels are under the vertical fins, pulls off the runway fine - that\u0027s another advantage of canards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIrrespective of how many engines you end up with, there\u0027s a couple of guidelines to follow:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Keep CoM and CoL in reasonable proximity - CoL is basically a force pushing up, and CoM is a force pushing down, so the further apart they are the bigger the leverage you have to counter with pitch controls. CoL moves rearwards when you go supersonic - how much depends on the chord length of your wings, it\u0027s quite a bit for deltas. You can move CoM in flight once you\u0027ve burned some fuel by moving what\u0027s left of the fuel around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The further either are from your control surfaces the better, in general - this is forces \u0026amp; levers again. Force is the area of the surface in this case; that\u0027s a bit simplistic because it depends on the current Q figure as well, but in broad terms that will do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Unless they\u0027re close together I\u0027d use partially fixed canards ( or a partially fixed tail ) - this is just for stability \u0026amp; it\u0027s quite easy to stall fully moving canards trying to pull up, and you\u0027re in trouble if they stall when you\u0027re struggling to fly level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* TWR in jet mode of \u0026gt;0.35 is enough.
