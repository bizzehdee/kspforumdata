MKS/OKS, LS and remote tech. So that will take a bit longer, but it actually doesn\u0027t seem to be that bad, I am pretty close to establishing my mun and minimus bases After that I will probably setup a more long-term craft to hit gilly \u0026gt; moho \u0026gt; Ike. Probably might need to send a solar upgrade to meet for the ike stage, might need a crew replacement or something as well. But by then I should already have something on duna and be working on an Eve base. I wouldn\u0027t be totally surprised if that took me a while to complete, but grinding out the mun and minimus have been the biggest effort before, because of their numerous biomes. I\u0027m probably a better pilot and base planner by now though.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think that unless you are using life support MKS doesn\u0027t have any hostile effects on your gameplay and you can virtually ignore it for just picking up all the samples. You should do what I was talking about and build a single low-g/no-atmos lander to hit gilley, moho, ike and dres. Not sure if you could move it into jool without problems (probably need alt power like nuke or fuel cell after that) but all you really need for that run is a stock refueling/tugboat setup and a small resource scanner satellite. Eve you might as well leave it till later cause you will need to fire a rover down with some sort of way to return. Rovering around eve has to be one of the most tedious things but if you leave it till you have the good wheels you will probably have more fun.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI can\u0027t really offer good advice on the outer system though. Haven\u0027t been past duna, before I installed these mods and did a career restart.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kermanzooming","CreatedById":162393,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-25T08:02:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222690009\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022144439\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221469424445\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022158174\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SpaceCommunism\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, SpaceCommunism said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that unless you are using life support MKS doesn\u0027t have any hostile effects on your gameplay and you can virtually ignore it .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nForgot to add I\u0027m playing with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Life Support, so bases will be an extra challenge.
