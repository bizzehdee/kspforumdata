Math I\u0027ve seen says we can get about 8 metric tons to martian surface using fully propulsive landing and modified Dragon Capsules. Assume we can send at most say two landers per launch window (about every two years).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince we want to establish a permanent base and have limited means, it seems to me that it would be far far cheaper to find an astronaut that is willing to live on mars for the rest of their life than it would be to waste a launch on the earth return/ mars ascent vehicle. Not bringing that means we don\u0027t need to figure out how to bring several tons of cryogenic hydrogen along with us. Instead for isru water and air we can likely get along with the much slower method of collecting what little water is in the air. Of course for most real industry we will need lots of water, which means either wait a long time and recycle well, or go out and find some ice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore tomorrow.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rpayne88","CreatedById":58336,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-23T04:43:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo basically Mars One?
