Try building rockets similar to that example craft and flying them in a similar manner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a problem with a rocket, go into the VAB, turn on the CoM and CoL indicators, post a picture and explain at what altitude, stage and speed things fall apart: transonic effects can make fins less effective, dense air can make aerodynamic forces stronger than control authority and staging can cause an otherwise stable vehicle to become an unstable nightmare. If it tumbles near ~330 m/s, that\u0027s transonic effects; you\u0027ll need either more control authority or to go slower. If it tumbles high up in the atmosphere, your ascent path is too low / your rocket is unstable after staging; you\u0027ll need to either take a taller ascent path or redesign the upper stages. If it tumbles soon after launch, that probably means that your payload is far, far too bulky and unaerodynamic to launch in it\u0027s current state; you\u0027ll have to redesign it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you do decide that FAR isn\u0027t for you, uninstall it, but feel free to come back and try it again after a few more updates; the aerodynamics can change quite dramatically as I add more effects / adjust current effects to be realistic / simplify things for gameplay purposes. If and when you decide to come back, I and all the other people who use FAR will be more than happy to try to help you out. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zarakon","CreatedById":5160,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-20T05:53:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NonWonderDog\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NonWonderDog\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022zarakon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022zarakon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESorry if this has been answered already somewhere in these 37 pages\u003Cp\u003EI just installed FAR, and it comes with a ridiculously huge plane called FAR Dark Hammer II.

I am ashamed to admit I am an ICT technician -.-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay I\u0027ve finally designed and successfully flown my first space shuttle! However, the design it self is far from perfect, there are a few issues with the design that make the craft rather unstable at certain parts of the flight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay firstly before launch I activate SAS, this allows for a perfectly straight lift at 100% throttle for a few seconds then I power down to stop the overheat counter from clocking up as you don\u0027t need full throttle at this stage its not worth it and I\u0027ll explain why. Okay if you\u0027ve launched from the runway the top of the shuttle itself will be set so the shuttle is facing 90degrees and the fuel tank the direct opposite so as you gradually make the turn the shuttle will be upside-down. Okay I deactivate sas and move 5-10 degrees towards 90 then reactivate SAS, then basically using throttle only I correct and control the angle. The higher it gets the shuttle will automatically start to tilt towards the 90 degrees line (actually I should explain that when I mean 90 degrees I mean the direction of travel actually hovering over the 90 number on the directional orb at the bottom, its explained better in the pictures), as soon as the shuttle tilts too fast I activate the second pair of engines on the shuttle and throttle down slightly, this will keep the ship from tilting too much. As the shuttle gains altitude I slowly increase throttle to control the tilt as best I can and as soon as I get to where I need I max throttle and engage RCS to keep it on target. Things are going smoothly until the SRB runs out, as soon as this happens and I detach the shuttle starts to spin. I quickly cut power and regain control before I can continue and thus overcoming the first design flaw that I need help with. After this it is smooth sailing into a orbit of about 100k I can go higher but my space station is located at this height so I don\u0027t need to go any higher. After a complete circular orbit is achieved I transfer all the fuel and RCS resources I need to the shuttle and detach, using the hidden probe and solar panel I control the tank into a decent to burn up in the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking is a little tricky I need to relocate a few RCS to gain more side strafing controls but I eventually dock with no problems........okay here is the second and biggest problem. The shuttle itself is a flying brick, as soon as I try and reenter the atmosphere the thing points its nose down into the path of flight. I cannot control or lift the nose at all and if you look at the craft you\u0027ll see parachutes located in various places, this is basically an abort feature that will rip the shuttle apart and keep the cockpit intact to save the crew from a tragic death. I\u0027m in need of help to try and make the shuttle that more stable on flight, the SRB problem I can deal with but the flightless shuttle is a real pain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for the crappy links before but hopefully if you follow the link below you\u0027ll find pictures and a link to the .craft file if you want to try it out for yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPictures and .craft file:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://sdrv.ms/18ap0b3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://sdrv.ms/18ap0b3\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S: Jsut realised the flipping out of control might actually be because I still have SAS technically pointing virtically even though physics have dragged the rocket at an angle.........hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-20T09:55:41Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2013 09:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Laphtiya\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Itsdavyjones","CreatedById":57605,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-20T16:54:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just got FAR and haven\u0027t used it yet, but I am wondering how much it effects aero breaking in respect to mechjebs aero breaking predictor.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
