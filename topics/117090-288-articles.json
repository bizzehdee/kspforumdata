At the same time I doubt\u00A0think the difference is a big enough improvement to consider redoing previous models.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBesides appearance improvements, going HP/LP\u00A0also makes your models much more efficient,\u00A0allowing\u00A0you to use very few polygons in places to really cut down the overall poly count. Like if you\u0027re doing an engine that has all sorts of small lines routing the fuel and oxidizer around, your HP should use\u00A032-sided cylinders, the LP can easily use just 6 sides or in many cases just 4 sides, and yet from anything but very close distances and certain angles, you can\u0027t tell the difference in game-\u00A0both the environment and standard\u00A0specular reflections on the LP will act as if the underlying geometry is a very smooth 32-sided cylinder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe process shouldn\u0027t be creating a very high poly base model and then spending three days welding vertices on a copy to generate the LP. You\u0027ll have to experiment a bit and I suggest you look for an article or two on HP/LP modeling strategies, but as with SP, once you get it, it goes very quickly;\u00A0HP/LP done correctly can be very nearly as quick as modeling just one LoD. Most concise explanation is you have to build your full model in your head first and look for places where you might get stuck welding-\u00A0with a bit of thought, many\u00A0of those can be eliminated or made easier. Don\u0027t get me wrong you do\u00A0end up welding vertices to make the LP versions of certain elements, but you want to avoid it as much as possible as it\u0027s so slow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, besides the benefits to overall rendered appearance due to everything\u00A0being calculated based on HP smooth curves and lines, there\u0027s another thing I do where I really like the effect. As you know, one of the subtle features of CG that makes people go \u0022oh that\u0027s CG\u0022 without knowing exactly why\u00A0is the infinitely-sharp edges everywhere. Neither nature nor humans like sharp edges, they don\u0027t exist without specific work to make them sharp and even then they\u0027re never as sharp as a modeler makes them. Your brain notices immediately when edge reflections are missing as it relies\u00A0heavily on rounded reflective edges to establish the 3d shape of things it sees.\u00A0That\u0027s always bugged me, but just recently you see real attempts to address it, both SP and Mental Ray have some parameters\u00A0for edge rounding now\u00A0but (IMO) neither work really well yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I do is after I have my HP/LP pair, I copy the HP and hide one to maintain as the original HP. Then I take my HP copy and spin through the elements and chamfer as many edges as possible, this is one place where MAX still has bugs that I remember being in their 1994 release.\u00A0Hopefully that\u0027s one thing Blender does better. As long as I\u0027m not hitting MAX bugs, this only takes maybe 15-30min on models of the complexity you\u0027re dealing with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I use the chamfered-edge version as the HP when I bake the normal and other maps in SP. All of those now nicely and subtly-rounded edges\u00A0will be captured correctly in the baked maps and when you render your model and see it\u00A0you\u0027ll definitely make some sort of happy sound, you will notice the effect immediately.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E(I just know I\u0027ll check back in three days and he\u0027ll have invented his own Blender scriptlet macro thingy, redone all his models, and will be adding that to his shader distro)\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-11-04T07:42:06Z\u0022 title=\u002211/04/2017 07:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 4, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by vossiewulf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"T-10a","CreatedById":176203,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-04T08:12:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223210653\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022117090\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221509780768\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022179033\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vossiewulf\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n37 minutes ago, vossiewulf said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n~snip~\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither that, or he\u0027ll somehow work out how to git push realtime changes in his models w/ said blender addon. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vossiewulf","CreatedById":179033,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-04T21:55:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuick bug (maybe) report, recoloring UI doesn\u0027t seem to work for the SSTU - SC-GEN - PDC - Custom Decoupler.

As in fact does the heatshield, very sweet capturing the metal mesh. I was just watching a couple shows on the Apollo CM, what I saw was a bit redder, a bit more saturated, and the finished product was maybe 35 on the roughness scale if 0 is perfect shiny. There was also visible roughness variation in circular patterns, looked like they did the final smoothing steps by turning the whole thing on a lathe and the result was visible circular stripes.

Seriously, they couldn\u0027t take an oversize/overthickness piece of the metal mesh and completely embed it in the resin with zero voids\u00A0and then machine the whole thing to shape/size? Or use fiberglass layers between thick layers of resin stretched over a form, make it over-thick, bake it, then machine down the outside.
