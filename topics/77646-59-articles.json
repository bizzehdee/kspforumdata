So what we need overhead for is to reduce time between operations. Transmitter might require 200W\u002B, for example, which will be the biggest drain. But taking pictures and even getting sensor data will also require extra power. And the baud rate will be pretty bad. I\u0027m thinking 50k-100k, which means that even a single JPEG might take a minute to send, which is about a full pass. If we wish to catch it again on the next pass, which will be about 100min later, it will need at least 2W of average overhead to recharge. If we wish to have it try and communicate with several stations along the way, that\u0027s even more power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo 20W I\u0027m confident about with fixed panels is enough, but it\u0027s a bit less breathing room than I\u0027d like to have. If we don\u0027t end up having any other power-hungry systems, I would probably lean to call it sufficient in the name of simplicity. If something else comes up, we\u0027ll have to think it through.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022oarum\u0022 data-cite=\u0022oarum\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECan we get the google doc link in the description K^2?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think I have a working version of that link?
