Orbital scan showed large hotspot on Mun using 80% cut off. Landed in the middle of the hotspot and did a surface scan. A circle with a diameter almost as large as the hotspot went black. The overlay still appears around the edges but It looks like a giant hole was punched in the hotspot. It gradually lights up again if I lower the cut off.

So forget this \u002280% cutoff\u0022 nonsense--the most you will ever find anywhere except an asteroid is in the neighborhood of 15%, usually rather less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOre concentration is defined per biome. A \u0022hot-spot\u0022 on the overlay is just an area where most of the surface is composed of 1 or more biomes with relatively high concentrations. The actual biomes on the ground there will have WAY less ore than the cut-off value of the overlay, but they will be amongst the best biomes on the planet. Not necessarily the best overall, but at least better than average. And note that because ore is defined per biome, and the orbital scanner averages biome surface area over large regions, small patches of the best biome on the planet can be swamped by large surrounding areas of low-value biomes, and NOT produce hot-spots on the overlay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what you do is use the debug menu to display the biome map and compare that to the orbital scan overlay. This will tell you what biomes are in the apparent \u0022hot-spots\u0022. Then go suss out the actual value of those biomes with the ground scanner and/or NBS. Note that the ground scanner isn\u0027t 100% accurate but is close enough for government work. Anyway, once you know which biomes are better than others, you can then pick the best biome and set up shop in it. Be sure to check every biome you can because, as mentioned above, good biomes can hide in the orbital scan overlay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe important thing is this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe orbital scan points out general areas where you can find some of the best biomes on the planet. It\u0027s up to you to determine which biomes those are and how good they really are. And because the value of a biome is constant no matter where on the planet you find that biome, there is no requirement to drill anywhere near a \u0022hot-spot\u0022 as long as the good biome is found elsewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T18:42:56Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 06:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Geschosskopf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
