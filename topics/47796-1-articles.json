I wanted to test some ideas for ship, probe, and lander design. The last time I tried something big like this I gave up because the part count brought my computer to a crawl and it was too frustrating. To avoid a repeat, I downloaded NovaPunch for the purpose of reducing part count. I figured I could make some savings in fuel tanks and related structures by using some of the 3.75 meter parts and larger engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe primary goals for the mission were:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Land 2 manned landers on Laythe and rendezvous on the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Land an unmanned probe on Pol and Bop\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondary goals were:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Land an unmanned probe on Vall\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Put an unmanned probe in suicide orbit around Tylo (how low can *you* go?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the first auxillary drop tank and the propulsion module early in the build. Those two NovaPunch LV-Ns put out as much thrust as 10 stock LV-Ns, and using them represents an 80% savings in part count over the stock engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jOcaiAR.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jOcaiAR.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used Procedural Fairings for aesthetic effect, and it worked well until I needed to send up a fuel tank with 4 probes mounted radially. Any number of jokes could be made here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uWxxutE.png\u0022 alt=\u0022uWxxutE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here is what was hidden underneath that bulbous catastrophe:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WLWuE7U.png\u0022 alt=\u0022WLWuE7U.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe final ship required 9 launches and 8 dockings, plus a couple of refueling trips, so the actual number was higher. It is crewed by 7, weighs some 500 tons, carries 4 probes and 4 atmospheric landers (which were themselves another experimental design). I ended up having to send a separate interplanetary ship for the 4 lander pilots because the part count was getting too high. I was looking at something like 2 fps. I figured that it would be easier to rendezvous in Jool orbit for crew transfer after I ditched the 4 probes (each with about 25 parts or so). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELadies and Gentlemen, I give you the Rothbard:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tNuSJpw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tNuSJpw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPreparing for Jool Transfer:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jDKQqi1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jDKQqi1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd burning. It took a couple of trips around Kerbin to complete the burn, at something like 0.15m/s^2 to start. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1ijBu9W.png\u0022 alt=\u00221ijBu9W.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first auxillary tank was dropped after the Rothbard reached Kerbin escape velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ehz33SE.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Ehz33SE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrival at Jool:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/N3QbW4l.png\u0022 alt=\u0022N3QbW4l.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAerobraking:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hE4iJRM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022hE4iJRM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Rothbard had enough fuel to do an unassisted circularization burn, but gravity assists were used for efficiency\u0027s sake. On one particular Vall flyby, Jeb decided he needed some excitement and so dropped the entire ship down to 10km (less than 5km true altitude and the lowest point) at nearly 2km per second. Bill doesn\u0027t seem to mind (maybe he didn\u0027t notice), but Bob does not look happy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LfmN8o9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LfmN8o9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJool is such a beautiful place.
