All fusion is simply extracting energy from stuff that holds nucleus together, but real energy comes from converting normal matter to antimatter and then annihilating it. If you can create a fusion reactor that converts neutrons into anti-matter by some step-wise process then you really have a power source.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe problem with fusion, and in particular unlimited fusion power in space is this as I see it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIn space limitless energy is not exactly unlimited unless it is distributed over \u003Cu\u003Etime\u003C/u\u003E, mass and space \u003C/strong\u003Eor to phase properly we soft fleshy things like to keep our body parts together and so we don\u0027t generally take kindly to power conversions of great power in small spaces over brief periods and small heat sink mass. And this is the power problem. The famous example is the big bang, at the beginning there was infinite energy in a point, as soon as you have space-time, energy density becomes finite, and entorpy that ensues sees energy all but disappear the only thing that is less is the non-zero vacuum energy of space. Pretty much the same thing happens with space craft energy. Power is the transformation of energy per unit of time into something that eventually all becomes waste heat. Its not exactly true but basically true. Some of you will say \u0027yes it becomes heat, but not in a relevant context\u0027. I would argue maybe but we sure don\u0027t want unlimited waste energy in our living quarters the food storage coolers. Thus we need to control energy flow very carefully in a space craft, it just can\u0027t go anywhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is why.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen traveling in space the primary outlay of energy is phase transitions from high-energy space-time isoquants to low-energy isoquants and back to high-energy isoquants. The conversions require PE-\u0026gt;KE. This is denoted as SKE. unlimited energy - SKE = unlimited energy until you add mass. Unlimited energy - SKE * mass = you\u0027re screwed. Here is the proof, suppose we have a 1 TW reactor (10\u003Csup\u003E12\u003C/sup\u003E Watts). Now suppose we have a [reaction]mass-less drive system. Ok it has mass we just accelerate the hell out of the mass. N = 2 * P / V\u003Csub\u003Ee\u003C/sub\u003E. So that close to the speed of light the equations becomes N = P/c (i.e the u-r-f-d-and-bad equation) which means you get 3,333N of power, you jump up and down with joy, except . . . . . . . wait that 3 kn of thrust, thats like the tiniest thruster in KSP. Hmm and that TW reactor weighs a \u0026gt;KT (we wont worry about its weight at the moment, the biggest problem is latent heat). In this particular solution we generated pure light - somewhere a billions of light years away some race will see a blip in the MW background energy, i.e. heat. And what you got out of it was 0.00333 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E. Hmmm, something forgotten, thrusters . . . . . .thrusters that use energy also waste energy, in space they cannot dissipate energy except by radiation. An ION drive is essentially a mass that conducts fuel-mass and heat at the expenditure of power. The heat limit of the device determines the power per unit area (something like 70kw per meter at 80% efficiency means 14 KW per meter is about 10 time more energy than ensolance energy on Earth, some of that goes into the xenon the rest is radiant heat) and the mass. So that you end up with somewhere between 29 and 58 kg of drive per 70 kw per meter. If you have a TW of power you need to get rid of equates to 415 kt of mass. That translates to an acceleration of 0.00008 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E (\u003Cem\u003Ea\u003C/em\u003E) of acceleration. When you are talking about interplanetary travel and acceleration, once you get below about 0.01 \u003Cem\u003Ea\u003C/em\u003E your oberth effects are lousy inefficient, in addition you can waste almost half your power trying to spiral out of planetary orbits in order to escape. This can be corrected by raw material ships by kicking and wasting time doing nothing, which for fusion is great because it does not require critical mass like fission reactors. But its very difficult to capture the oberth-like effect for planetary transfer orbits you get from combined burns at low planetary orbits. The savings are almost half of what an infinitely slow ION drive craft would spend. I don\u0027t know if this is apparent but let me make it clear, a chemical thruster puts the bomb (the energy conversion over short time and space) into a combustion chamber and expels most of the waste heat as exhaust. A fusion reactor has (for reactor and humans to survive) place most of the energy conversion inside or near the reactor, about 1/3rd is in the thruster and 2/3rds approximately has to be dissipated over a 2-dimensional surface around the reactor into space. The latent heat is an inherant problem with larger amounts of energy (addressed below).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo correcting the problem of the u-r-f-d equation is to add mass to it in the form of lower exhaust velocity. So if we cut the V\u003Csub\u003Eexhaust\u003C/sub\u003E by 625 fold\u00A0 we bring acceleration up to 0.01 but we add fuel mass. This is an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E of approximately 50,000 which means we could travel to places in the solar system, carry landers ect. But in handwaving that thrust power into existence I have failed to reveal one tiny detail, yes the thrust is possible, its effects are not. Above we said we are not going to worry about a 1 TW reactors weight, the problem is now we do have to worry, the heat expulsion is heat is expelled through infrastructure mass. In this case we have a reactor, the reactor does not produce high potential electrons that then flow into ION drives, it produces radiation that is converted to heat, hopefully by some state-phase-transition power generator which drops the energy potential by at least half, and maybe another potential that drops it again and so on . . eventually you have reactor waste heat. But in addition you have pesky waste and reactor erosion (very very hot stuff) that will be ejected or accelerated into space. Neutrons could be absorbed by sacrificial boron and ejected along the way however you have heat generated and alot that is expensive to capture. So now we have the big problem. Lets say we had 300 GW of waste heat, now lets say we had a very black transfer foil and we can evolve heat at 1 kg per one meter, the thermal limit is 50 degrees and into the black of 5 kelvin space. Your differential is 293 kelvin. The bottom line is that you need to all but double the mass of your ship, meaning that to maintiain\u00A0 \u003Cem\u003Ea, \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E will need to drop by 25000 to about 25000. Im saying this in a future thinking that fusion will be a thing and we will have better ion drives yada, yada. At the moment 10,000 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E is the practical limit. (because energy density of solar panels is alot less than fusion reactors and cooling mass).\u00A0 To restate, there is no limit to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E of an ION drive like system, the limits lie in its practical application.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo here is what happened. Fusion power = unlimited energy but not perfect efficiency energy. Thrust conversion is also not perfectly efficient. Thrust\u00A0 efficiency has a dependency on mass.\u003Cbr\u003E\na = (Unlimited energy - Power conversion losses - Thrust conversion losses)/ (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E * thruster mass \u002B reactor mass \u002B converter mass \u002B radiator mass \u002B PL mass \u002B fuel mass/2) = you\u0027re screwed.\u003Cbr\u003E\nheat = Unlmiited energy*(power conversion inefficiency \u002B thrust conversion inefficiency \u002B PL waste) = ........\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo this is the reason unlimited energy is self limiting, the problem is if we look at space we can think of it as a 2 dimensional manifold that captures heat from whatever 2-dimensional radiators are present.\u003Cbr\u003E\nLets say we can dissipate power over 1 meter of space, but at most we can fold the surface and double heat dissipation. This means that our effective heat loss is roughly 8* pi * r\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E. For the nay-sayers lets say its 100 * pi * r\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEqually generous lets say the we can dissipate 100 times ensolance (reality is that this would mean glowing orange hot). OK so lets dissipate fusion reactors. (IOW we have some ungodly means of dumping heat in the future)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1 watt reactor generating 0.3 waste heat would require a \u0027rough\u0027 sphere of radiators of r\u00A0 = 0.00008\u003Cbr\u003E\n10 watt, r\u00A0 = 0.00026\u003Cbr\u003E\n100 watt, r = 0.0008\u003Cbr\u003E\n1000 watt, r = 0.0026\u003Cbr\u003E\n10000 watts, r = 0.008\u003Cbr\u003E\n100000 watts, r = 0.026\u003Cbr\u003E\n1000000 watts, r = 0.08\u003Cbr\u003E\n10000000 watts, r = 0.26\u003Cbr\u003E\n100,000,000 watts, r = 0.8\u003Cbr\u003E\n1,000,000,000 watts r = 2.6 (yes, I am very generous with the radiative heaters)\u003Cbr\u003E\n10,000,000,000 watts r = 8 meters (the radiators would be visible at many places on the ship)\u003Cbr\u003E\n100,000,000,000 watts r = 26.6 meters (the radiators now completely surround the ship except the radiators\u003Cbr\u003E\n1,000,000,000,000 watts r = 80 meters. (the PL is now buried inside a large manifold of radiators, finding\u00A0 difficulty to keep cool).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo lets tinker with this lets say the rate of dissipation is 3 times ensolance at best, and we can oscillate the manifold 3 fold.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe equation for 1 TW of power is now 1306 meter in radius. Up to this point for each point in which power presented a problem we have provided a work around that cost mass, but not space.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow we have a work around that cost space, and the cost of space is mass. So that at some point mass as a function of\u00A0 heat has a second hyperbolic term. IOW the heat eqaution eventually mutates into this type of thing\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nradiator mass \u002B structure = k*( KW\u003Csub\u003Eheat \u003C/sub\u003E\u002B 0.00001 KW\u003Csub\u003Eheat\u003C/sub\u003E\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhere k is the radiative heat capacity per radiator mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFundamentally, this drafts the question when we look at Universal events, (big bangs, intergalactic speeds, intra galactic orbital velocities) we can examine these in the context of very high energy events that occur over relatively short periods of time (the accretions of a solar system, a super nova, the initiation of fusion of a star). The speeds that we see are often the result of catastrophic events, for example the momentum created by inflation that is fed into expansion, the particle formation energies and the resulting momentums. IF you want to generate huge relative velocities you have tolerate rather erosive power conversions. IN the case above we might want a 1 TW fusion reactor in a ship, we just would not want to use it much of the time, and we are more mass efficient by having a 1 GW fusion reactor, we can easily scale down the ION drives and heaters. But lets say the smallest fusion reactor is 1GW, then what, you have a reactor that can only be used for a few seconds a minute and the other 57 seconds are devoted to dumping heat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy bottom line \u003Cstrong\u003Eon Space fusion\u003C/strong\u003E (not ground based fusion) is that it has to be able to generate power, convert power and do so in a specified power range, say 10 MW to 100 MW. The alternatives are\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ewe have to create power transformation fundamentally more advanced in technology than fusion\u003C/strong\u003E reactor or abandon space fusion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want to make this point, we had a 2 year argument about the Cannae drive and how it would answer all the space problems, it lowers the space problems only about a factor of 3. The problem with the massless drives primarily is a time constraint that travel has, to make the point, if you are on the moon and you need to orbit there are no intrinsic electric propulsion system, extrinsic maybe. If you are in GSO transporting underwear and two-by-fours\u00A0 to Martian GSO, its not a problem, but to transfer from LEO to proxima centauri is the same problem as launching from the moon, except that for the moon chemical propulsion would work, for proxima Centauri your acceleration to 100 years and deceleration another 100 years and of course nobody lived. To utilize Cannae for manned space flight would require many things that would be extremely difficult to do or currently impossible even if there was unlimited power to do those things. Unllimited power, as we see above, limits itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mayer","CreatedById":183156,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-09T00:49:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFusion power is not unlimited energy, it\u0027s constrained by fuel and efficiency(how much D, T or He\u00B3 actually undergoes fusion).

There are a ton of tradeoffs with fusion powered interstellar, ultimately I decided it would be unlikely that any fusion ship would push higher than 0.005c. The major problem we discussed in the group was risk avoidance (a speck of dust is a nuclear warhead at near light speeds). The shape above is designed to deflect most of the impact energies. The other problem was providing the crew a lifelong livable ship, which means the reactors at the back could be discharged in the even of an emergency (much discussion of fusion instability). The reason for the lower \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E is that power had to be diverted to other ship systems such as life support, food production, waste recycling, cooling. Every bit of power used for these reduces the power that can be devoted to the very hot fuel you needed to get rid of and fast. So pretty much you don\u0027t get 0.1c\u00A0 \u0026gt; members of the group concluded that if 0.005c was as high as could be obtained then interstellar travel would never be possible.
