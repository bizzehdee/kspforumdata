I\u0027ve repeatedly revalidaded my install files on steam and everything seems fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the game breaking problem. When I choose a ship to launch that has the standard stock 3 man command pod.. the orbital velocity while sitting on the pad reads 176 m/s and then the rocket starts to drift upwards, defying gravity. Around 2000m it slowly comes back down to ground and crashes, sometimes spinning. Parachutes have no effect. Rockets have no effect. It just floats upwards. I\u0027ve even removed parts that are modded, but the problem was found to be the actual command pod. Sometimes it sinks into the launchpad. After it \u0027crashes\u0027 back down.. the parachutes are still fully deployed and the program thinks it is still moving. Sometimes it CTD when I try to revert either to the VAB or the space center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a list of all my mods. I have not touched the command pods configs in any way.
