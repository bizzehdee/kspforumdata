Mayhaps someone knows, and before i make too many circles in the sky ...."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T15:59:59Z","Content":"It is possible.

I was never good at jump\u0026run games, and not being able to set the claw as target almost made me throw the mouse @ the wall when i razed the solar panels, pushed the station into evasive rotation or passed the thing at a few meters distance.\n\nReally, i never miss when docking, but in this case the masses are just too high and the whole cartload is too inert for me to fly it to a point with am acceptable accuracy ...\n\nOk, no more excuses, plan B, but thanx :-)\n\nk"}]}
