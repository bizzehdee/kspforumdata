What\u0027s likely happening in KSP/Unity is that Unity loads the texture file and converts it to a format which it can give to DirectX/OpenGL. That format could be .dds for DirectX, I don\u0027t know how OpenGL handles textures, but it likely has it\u0027s prefered format analog to .dds. Bottom line is, no matter what file format you choose for the texture, KSP likely uses the same data format for all textures with the same renderer, so any difference in RAM usage result from differing conversion artifacts and/or bugs in the converter. Actually, I\u0027m not sure if KSP even needs to keep the texture in RAM after it\u0027s loaded into the graphic cards own memory...but I\u0027m no game developer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m4v","CreatedById":67965,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-05T15:12:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PolecatEZ\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PolecatEZ\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou can test this if you can see your RAM usage.

I\u0027ve tried reinstalling KW from both the Spaceport and MEGA lnks, any idea what\u0027s going on?\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: In all my installations, I\u0027ve left the auto-shroud config folder next to the parts folder, and the config folder has the engines inside of the file structure as well, could this cause some weird conflicts? Testing it now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT2: Actually, I\u0027ve found a more likely culprit than the alternative part.cfgs, I still have the Sonambulic Aerospace pack from a few KW versions ago.
