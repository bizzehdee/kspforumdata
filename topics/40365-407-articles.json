Good thing I sent the white suit to the surface instead of Bill, because guess who died of air toxicity floating over Moho, while attached to a fully functional fusion reactor? At least this one won\u0027t show up on the \u0022missing in action\u0022 list. Before decoupling the ascent stage I plucked the solar panels off and put them on the main ship, just as a little insurance against TAC. But I\u0027m scared because I have to leave the ship in orbit around Moho to do other things until the window opens up, and I\u0027m worried next time I go to it I\u0027ll get word again that another kerbal died. Just to be sure I have the DT Vista completely shutdown, the reactor on and making tritium, and the ship oriented N/S so as long as its on the sun side it will get light to a panel. All I can do now is hope this is enough to keep these glitches away. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy other DT Vista vessel coming from Dres is doing fine, because it has solar panels attached to it.

How much of a reactor\u0027s daily output of tritium do I lose to boil off? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also wondering how exactly deuterium and tritium flow around a ship. Do they depend on proper cross feed connections like LFO, or are they accessible everywhere as long as its attached to the ship like xenon and monopropellant? I have my cryostats on the other end of this big truss, not attached to the generator directly. It seems like they receive bred tritium, but do not pump-back tritium to be used for the reactor.

Ironically, I\u0027ve been having a ball with the fusion reactors and awesome engines and everything else (best models ever, fit right in with the game), but I can\u0027t seem to figure out how to mine any resources without attaching a 3-meter 2-ton refinery building to the top of my lander so it looks like a ping pong paddle. Am I missing something? Surely you don\u0027t need something that big just to melt ice on Vall.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe release from WaveFunction has an inline 3.75 meter refinery (i.e it attaches normally like any fuel tank) \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/WaveFunctionP/KSPInterstellar\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/WaveFunctionP/KSPInterstellar\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif you just want that one part \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/WaveFunctionP/KSPInterstellar/tree/master/GameData/WarpPlugin/Parts/Utility/LargeRefinery\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/WaveFunctionP/KSPInterstellar/tree/master/GameData/WarpPlugin/Parts/Utility/LargeRefinery\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso for the non-mining 2.5 meter inline refinery (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/WaveFunctionP/KSPInterstellar/tree/master/GameData/WarpPlugin/Parts/Utility/InlineRefinery\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/WaveFunctionP/KSPInterstellar/tree/master/GameData/WarpPlugin/Parts/Utility/InlineRefinery\u003C/a\u003E I think that this is in the main release too) you can just copy and paste the mining modules from the large refineries.

It just seemed a bit odd to me that the only resource extractors in the whole mod are gigantic. Sure, I understand that mining for uranium or thorium is gonna need a big facility, but I don\u0027t see how you\u0027d need that for collecting water or sifting regolith for aluminum or making methaLOx from CO2 (Robert Zubrin\u0027s Mars Direct mission plan involves that last one being done by a relatively small box aboard a slightly less-small Earth-return vehicle).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m always wary of doing cfg edits because I lose the transferability of my designs among other mod users, but I may make an exception in this case.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
