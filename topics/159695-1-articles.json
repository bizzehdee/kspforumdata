Let\u0027s assume open water, that makes it easy. In a canal or a narrow things get complicated. Also a boat that leaves it\u0027s wave-system (gliding/surfing etc.) is a different thing. So, the clear answer is: it depends (where you fall in) !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave a look at the waterline of a moving boat: there is overpressure at the bow, shown by a wave the boat pushes in front it. Water then accelerates along the hull, and according to Bernoulli (or so) the pressure sinks, as shown by a long 1/2 lambda \u0022negative\u0022 wave along the waterline. At the stern there is underpressure and turbulence, \u0022sucking\u0022 the boat backwards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally there is the propulsion, usually a (or more) propeller that shoves water from front to back thus pushing the hull through the water. So if you happen to drop in the first third of hull of a long boat you are probably pushed away by the water. If you happen to drop in the under pressure area where maybe the suction of the propeller helps you have a good chance of having fun in the Great Roundabout. If you hop off near the stern you\u0027ll probably just hit the hull and then be left behind, reflecting over the future and your family having fun with your life insurance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMe as a hobby sailor tells you: falling overboard is almost sure death, because if no IMMEDIATE (seconds) action is taken you will not be found again.

There was always a lot of rubbish and debris in the harbour, and none of it seemed to get chewed up by the props of the ferries passing through, or the impeller on the fast catamaran that replaced them.

A maneuvering or slow moving ferry or a small sailing boat does not have an expressed wave system. The small sailing boat because is too small and usually doesn\u0027t move at its hull speed under engine and the hull is normally very effectively streamlined. A small motorboat usually leaves it\u0027s wave system and pushes itself on the bow wave. Also the small to tiny propeller eventually might hurt you (even badly) if you get in contact with it but it will not kill you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPeople falling overboard on the open waters usually are not found any more. These are more than might think, quite few every year, more from recreational boats than huge ships. People falling overboard in harbour areas have a tiny chance, if it is not by night.
