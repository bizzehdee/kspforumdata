Then I\u0027d think about lights around the station. Do you plan to have a science lab or several, then your power requirements on the dark side just sky rocketed. I assemble stations in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and then figure out where to cut it into modules for shipping to orbit.

It was assembled over a dozen or so launches in Kerbin orbit and moved under it\u0027s own power out to Minmus. It arrived with at about 5% of it\u0027s total \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E capacity and I\u0027ve spent the last two weeks shipping ore up to it between other missions to only get the tanks up to 45%. It uses a Near Future Nuke power plant, so no solar panels. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E is offset just a hair from the thrust line, but I\u0027ve got enough reaction wheels to keep it pointed in the right direction. After assembly all the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters were stripped off during EVA (about 80) and\u00A0recovered back to Kerbin to keep the parts count down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022J5fqhiF.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/J5fqhiF.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSame save, this is an older station around the Mun launched quite early in the game mainly as a transfer point for Mun surface missions and to service landers.

The biggest problem now is it doesn\u0027t really have nearly enough fuel capacity to keep\u00A0up with all the Mun landing missions I\u0027ve done, so I have a ship go retrieve\u00A0debris with fuel to keep topping off the tanks. I added a science lab parts pack mid way through this game so expansion was pretty haphazard. It needs all the panels to keep the science experiments running in daylight. I added a second engine late to adjust the thrust line for the station expansion below it\u0027s original thrust line.

Autostruts are a \u0022temporary\u0022 gift kludge from the devs that give you a way to rigidify your vessels in flight. You get them at the same time as you get regular struts on the tech tree, as long as you have \u0022advanced tweakables\u0022 enabled in the settings. However, certain kinds of autostruts can be dangerous if misused -- especially if you use a lot of them. An autostrut is just a massless, dragless, zero cost\u00A0regular strut that you can add in flight. From a selected part they can extend to one of several selectable endpoints. Grandparent autostruts are safest. Root and \u0022heaviest\u0022 autostruts can change their endpoints automatically if the vessel\u0027s stats change -- like during a docking. Having an autostrut change its endpoint suddenly can be a violent process. Having many dozen autostruts do it simultaneously can easily destroy your ship. So it\u0027s best to keep the number of autostruts low, and sometimes it can be a good idea to disable them before doing a docking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223443016\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022177956\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221535745028\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022189407\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MisterKerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, MisterKerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso is there a point to putting Reaction Wheels anywhere but the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you do the physics calculation\u00A0and assume a perfectly rigid vessel -- then it turns out that the answer is that you can put them anywhere and the results are the same.
