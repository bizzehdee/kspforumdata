I\u0027ve already had a few probes where I forgot the antenna \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you start out with the basic parts the only way you have to produce electric charge is by burning your main engine(s). So one strategy to maximize your SCIENCE points per mission (Sci p/M), is to do as much as you can on the pad (crew report, EVA report), transmit them, then lift off to regenerate your electric charge, (another thing you could do is make capsule only launch, do a crew report, eva report and take a sample of the launchpad, then recover). On the way up you can continue to take crew reports and transmit those that gain you SCIENCE points. If you happen to make it to orbit, take a crew and and EVA report, then return to kerbin and recover, you\u0027ll get a few extra points of SCIENCE by letting your engineers study the spacecraft that made it to SPACE! (My personal strategy was to launch just a pod with an antenna on it, transmit a crew report, get out and do EVA report and surface sample, get in and do a crew report and then recover. That gains you enough science to unlock the next node of the tech tree and get a decoupler!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter you get the Goo Tank, you start adding that to the mix. Several streamers added more than one goo tank to their vessels. This has been dubbed \u0022goo ball\u0022 or \u0022goo balling\u0022. Remember that bringing multiple experiences back with you has the same effects on your science points as if you had transmitted them all along. IE: If you bring back 10 goo containers you\u0027ll get full points for the first processed and then the diminishing returns kick in. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother viable strategy (it would appear) involves not leaving for the mun for a while. Instead, send missions off the pad pointed at the various biomes on Kerbin, pop your chute over one, land, and then do your reports and samples and recover quickly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOther Information: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EData Penalty - \u003C/strong\u003E Also known as diminishing returns. Once you conduct an experiment in a given biome you are free to repeat that same thing, but you will not get the full amount of science points for it. However, it is still worth while to repeat the experiment until you\u0027re not gaining much by doing so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETips:\u003C/strong\u003E You can get science by doing flyby\u0027s, take a crew report (don\u0027t forget you can get out of the capsule on EVA and take an \u0022EVA Report\u0022 as well!). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI watched Scott Manley\u0027s interview with Harvester video (it\u0027s on youtube, check it out), and in there Manley talks about Yargnit doing 4 missions to unlock the entire Tech Tree. Manley thinks he can do it in 3 missions. Now before you get all bent out of shape, Harvester had a REALLY good point. Advanced players shouldn\u0027t have to \u0022grind\u0022 to get all the parts. If you can figure out ways to collect that much data in 3 missions, that\u0027s \u0022super awesome\u0022.

That paid out almost 1600 points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext probe, simple one, Two small goo canisters for symmetry and one 1m science bay and 3 antennas because, small fuel tank and a 909 engine for orbital manoeuvring. With more antennas I can send more data faster when one or more antennas are busy there is at least on free so more then on is actually faster from a practical point of view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis probe went to the Jool System, I collected data from Jool, all of it from outer most SOI and then all the data my batteries could manage from the aerobreaking on the dark side of Jool when I was in the Atmosphere I got some points from that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll planets/moons seems to have a zone closer to the surface that offers more points. Hight of this seems to vary between 200km and 10km. Smaller the lower you need to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I did another aerobreak around Laythe collecting all the data on the outer SOI and some but not all data offered closer to Laythe until my batteries was drained again. I also went To Vall, Collected all data from outer SOI, Some offered in lower orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also went to Tylo and collect all data in the outer SOI and some in a lower orbit. Pol I went by twice collecting all data in both a high and low orbit. I also went by Bop and collected all the data in a high orbit and some in a low orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne will be doing a lot of clicking sending all this date thats for sure. Repetitive to say the least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I reentered Laythes atmosphere and collected more of the data there until the batteries where almost flat. Then I deployed a chute and landed the pod in the waters of Laythe and collected all the data offered there and recharged the batteries to transmit it back, about 420 points I got for sampling the water alone. In the end I ended up with 4600 points on the second probe so a total of 6200 points in a days wort of playing with two probes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI so fare have not found a real advantage to the better antennas, seems to use more power only, even the small basic once works fine in the Jool system and the game picks them by default to for me at least even if the craft has more exotic models.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut any way its very easy to collect a ton of points. I have unlocked all but 7 techs in the tree and I need only 2800 more points and all that from just 2 days of playing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have not landed on any other body then the Mun so there is tons of points left and I still have 4 planets/moons to do flybys off so thats at lest 1200\u002B points alone I would think probably twice that if I collect it all by going in to low orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo sure you can get bonus for a return trip but well going with probes makes the most sense. Its easy and requires small rockets and once you have the point for the big parts, jumbo tank, mainsail then it makes sense to land and get those points and return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example I brought 6 basic canisters of goo to the mun and brought them back. Got 282 points for that but sure it took only 40 minutes or so. Maybe 1h total in building a rocket and getting back to kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut still returning samples is not that efficient when your fare out. Better save that for last I would say and probe first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut my tip so fare based on two days off playing is. 3 antennas, two goo pods for symmetry (if you can overcome the unbalance in other ways one could be fine), one 1m science bay, 800 worth of battery charge or more. All the solar panels you can carry, the small once can take a earobreak so thats good if sun is available they will recharge the battery. A mid sized 1m fuel tank and a 909 engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my best probe so fare in career measured in number of points collected. 4600 in a single trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img593.imageshack.us/img593/5894/3i78.png\u0022 alt=\u00223i78.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm a lousy pilot and I dont build rockets a lot so well one could defiantly do better but that probe worked just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit uses a fare bit off more advanced parts but they are not realy needed. Basic antenna will do, basic 909 engine will do, basic solar panels will do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo a problem to get a pod like that out in the Kerbal solar system with most of the basic 1m parts. Just do some science on the launchpad, on Kerbin in general, do a LKO mission, Lunar flyby etc and you will have unlocked enough to go deeper and get a ton of points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a Spaceplane geek I am I tryed to unlock those stuff first but the tech tree dont realy make sense so in retrospect probes seems to require the least effort and give the most gain.
