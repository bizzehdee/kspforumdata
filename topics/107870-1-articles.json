There are several reasons I say this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that if SpaceX gets too far ahead of NASA and where it looks like SpaceX is cost effective AND generates interest in commercial flights to Mars, the U.S. government (as we have people who are playing KSP that are not Americans) will begin to legislate to the point it is no longer appealing or financially feasible for private industry. I believe it will be the same thing with lunar development. As an historian and someone who does a lot of research into foreign and domestic policy, one of the things the U.S. is growing increasingly paranoid about is an exodus from the nation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is also true of the nations in western Europe, Russia, and China. For most of human history, humans have been able to migrate from one place to another with fairly little resistance. The modern \u0022nation-state\u0022 since the middle of the 16th Century (C. E.) has limited man\u0027s ability until colonization of the Americas began. Even during that time, the European nation-states did their best to limit its citizenry that were able to immigrate to the New World; in the case of England/Great Britain, even limiting the ability of those possessing certain trades and skills from leaving their homeland. With the settlement of the American continents and the formation of new nation-states, there has been nowhere for migration to occur without developing into an international crisis. Space and space colonization would change that if it were economically feasible, which is what commercial space exploration would do. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf either Mars or the Moon were to become commercially developed with colonies, I will be willing to bet that the number of Americans wanting to emigrate would astound (I, for one, would leave in a heartbeat!). Even the United Nations has debated the \u0022sovereignty\u0022 of exo-Earth settlement and has tried to state that any settlement on such bodies would fall under the direct guidance and governance of the U.N. Yeah, right - as how are you going to make that stick once a colony develops the abilities to become self-reliant? Is commercial space exploration possible - yes. Is it preferred - yes, as the more profitable it becomes, the more we will learn. However, I do not see any government allowing the commercial development of space to go beyond any government\u0027s ability to control.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-06T13:01:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2015 01:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by adsii1970\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EDidn\u0026#039;t answer the original question\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reddragon","CreatedById":66937,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T12:58:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESpaceX has a plan to \u0027kick start\u0027 a colony on Mars.
