I\u0027ve set the control surfaces on my design to quite a bit lower than the pilot could handle, just because if it turns at a high rate for too long it ended up dying due to the EM disadvantage. I think the jet competition takes a little more tactical thinking than at least the monoprop contest - I haven\u0027t tried a biplane yet.\n\nI like the designs.
