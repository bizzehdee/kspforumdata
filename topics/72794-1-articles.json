There are several hydrocarbons that would still be liquid at these temperatures (heavy fuel, or even tar basically), you could also use liquid metal, or solids like graphite. The oxydizer, on the other hand, will be a problem. Potassium perchlorate melts at 525\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C and decomposes at 600\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C, so it could work, although it\u0027s not very good for a rocket.
