Any space power is going to be watching everyone everywhere, they will always know where your going and generally what you are. Even doing a burn behind a planet won\u0027t help a warship once it comes back out behind the planet, due to vector changes.

I think in space everything is pretty much hidden by default. Space is just so ridiculously big that small things at long ranges disappear in it very easily. Deploying enough sensors to actually provide good eyes would be a major objective for any space power, but I think expecting to have good observation of anything more than the lower layers of orbit around planets and moons is overly optimistic.

It was developing a tunable pulsed laser.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, get a group of sub-microsecond pulsed lasers that fall at the various absorbtion/emission wavelengths of a particular gaseous medium. Get them set up to all pulse in (relative) sync and along the same axis. I think he was using an IR laser, a few visible-light ones, and a UV one or 2. The point was, they blanketed 7 excitation \u0026amp; emission states of the target medium, with about equal power (low power in the lab but it would work at higher energies.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeed them into the gaseous medium, let\u0027s call it the \u0022dial-a-laser\u0022. It\u0027s going to basically let them through in slightly altered state since it absorbed and re-emitted them, some at different wavelengths than they came in at due to cascaded emissions or excitations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe built an adaptive feedback genetic algorithm and gave it control to alter the incoming synchronization. Tell it which output frequency you wanted and it would quickly tweak the phase relationships to get as much of the output as possible there. While there were losses in the system, it was pretty impressive to see 7 various wavelength lasers going in... and over 50% of that energy come out as UV with small remaining amounts of the others coming out. And then switch the software and a few dozen pulses later - less than tenth a second - have 60% of green laser coming out. (the losses were lower at the middle emissions options, because it could optimize better for possible emission scenarios there.) This only worked on the wavelengths that gas was capable of emitting, and took advantage of quantum effects from the interaction of femtosecond synchronized pulses with the gas\u0027 electron\u0027s excitation states.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course for anything weapons-grade this would have a whole slew of new challenges and you could get better results from using 4 separate high-powered lasers at different frequencies. I just found it very interesting that, if light emission is electrons dancing among their various energy states, they\u0027d found a way to call the tune, so to speak. Much of his other doctoral work was on a team that got pulses short enough and in-phase with each other enough to take advantage of those electron state interactions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rickenbacker","CreatedById":2349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-17T17:44:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022falofonos\u0022 data-cite=\u0022falofonos\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESand...\u003Cp\u003EIf your combat is taking place at high closing velocity, the sand becomes a weapon as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure which scifi book i read it in but using lasers to ablate kinetic kill weapons, altering their trajectory was used.
