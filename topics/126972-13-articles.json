The P-3 was slightly different than its predecessors, in that the orbital stage included a reaction-control system to assist with\u00A0attitude control. This was largely done in response to the oscillations observed with the previous launch (just in case the weirdness wasn\u0027t due to the errant K-Box controller), and ultimately burned up almost all of its monopropellant early in the flight.

Everything I send to The M\u00FCn (or the Moon) that has a living crew needs to be able to return to Kerbin (or Earth) without an additional burn.
