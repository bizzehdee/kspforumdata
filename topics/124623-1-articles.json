Today I made on of my favourite fighter/cruiser\u0027s ever in ksp. Its called the Omega and it is influenced by Macey Deans different crafts. It is completely stock and has functioning weaponry. I sadly cannot give a craft file as I still have to run on proper 1.0 because I am unable to update the game BUT I have a small gif showing how it runs and the small different aesthetics of the craft. All parts on the craft are removable and reloadable with the little tug that is attached to the center missiles. The craft can fly with or without and of the weapon parts and is fully defended. It can withstand multiple shots from all the weaponry I have tested (Except 1m solid fuel rockets as they are hard to work) and the wings protect it from several shots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.gyazo.com/8b03a6e70d34e642d844cc782e9e923f.gif\u0022 alt=\u00228b03a6e70d34e642d844cc782e9e923f.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have spent lots of work on this craft trying to balance it out and all. Once 1.0.5 comes out I should be able to update and I will provide a craft file. If you wanna see a previous build of mine check out this video that Guard13007 made reviewing my craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/HoDsuyU-QMo?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E My craft review starts at 8:27\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading and I hope you all Like my planes!
