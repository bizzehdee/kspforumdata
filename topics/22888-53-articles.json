I extended the landing gear, and they lifted the capsule off of the ground, until they reached full extension. Then the ship fell to the ground like the gear were gone. When I retracted them, it launched the pod into the air a few meters, and it fell down and blew up the BigG (which hit the ground first).

I have been working in the professional games industry for about 10 years now. I know what parts of a model I need to spend time on, what parts no one will notice, that I can skim over, and what parts I can reuse for other things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Explorer parts for instance, small, not a lot of detail, only took about 8 hours to complete. Half of it was getting it set up and working in game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as my process, first and most important is reference, lots and lots of reference. If I cant find a picture of what I want I find something similar I can grab ideas from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, it\u0027s important to remember that it\u0027s more important that it LOOKS and FEELS correct than it actually IS correct. As many of you have pointed out there are more than a few minor inconsistencies between my models and real life. Most of those are on purpose so it works better with stock parts, but some are choices I made to save time. The point is they are so small that most do not notice or care, and they saved me a significant amount of time. Most new people when modeling get so caught up in the minor details, spending hours getting one spot just right. That they completely miss how the whole thing ties together and that you don\u0027t even see the part they just spent hours on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn example of this is if you look at the tops and bottoms of my fuel tanks you will see that they all use the same texture. You only see this part while your placing the tank, so why would I try to create new textures for each one when its already made and looks good? Do you care that they are all the same? Most people do not and it saved a lot of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird, tools. Tools do not make you a better artist. They only make better art easier and faster. I have 13 years of experience using modeling and texturing tools. I know which ones let me UV faster (3d Coat). Which scripts let me bake better light maps (TextTools).
