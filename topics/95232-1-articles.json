I just got a contract to deploy a base with 5 kerbals to Ike, and in this game I haven\u0027t been outside the Kerbin system yet. I took the contract anyway because it pays very well, but I feel the contract system shouldn\u0027t generate missions like this until after you complete the explore missions for a planet/system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Heimdall5008","CreatedById":114990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-01T09:27:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo you have do a mission to Ike before you can get a further mission to Ike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think at the moment you have to accept the \u0022Explore \u0026lt;body\u0026gt;\u0022 mission before you get contracts for this body.
