While technically both would produce the same amount of drag, the bottom example will generate lift as well, making you lose velocity to gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"quietghost","CreatedById":117566,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T21:59:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it depends only on the drag cubes involved, so the result would be the same in either situation. However the forward facing airbrake may also add a downward force component, or vice versa with the backwards. Regardless, any aerodynamic lift generated does not absorb velocity unless altitude is gained. Deflection drag does, but that is not lift.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T23:16:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been having some frustrating problems with re-entry at Eve and most of it relates to air brakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Air Brakes seem to be bugged with respect to using them in action groups. I added some to a couple action groups in the VAB, but they do not work once launched. I can only activate them using the brake key, but that toggles ALL of my air brakes, which I don\u0027t want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Why don\u0027t I want all of my air brakes to open together you ask? I have to use them to keep my ship pointed retrograde during the descent into Eve\u0027s atmosphere, but they can\u0027t take the heat from that and break off. I wanted to use one set of air brakes until they broke away and then turn on a second set, but that doesn\u0027t work without action groups. I\u0027m not sure how else I can keep my ship pointed retrograde as every time I get below about 60km it starts to tilt about 20-30 degrees off retrograde and no amount of reaction wheels can correct it, but air brakes in the back far from the CoM will hold the craft straight (lawn dart effect).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m beginning to think that Squad hasn\u0027t tested any of the new aero stuff with Eve at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"11of10","CreatedById":90592,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T00:33:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAirbrakes don\u0027t react to \u0022Toggle\u0022 setting in action groups.
