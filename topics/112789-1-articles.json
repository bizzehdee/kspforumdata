While technically both would produce the same amount of drag, the bottom example will generate lift as well, making you lose velocity to gravity."},{"CreatedByName":"quietghost","CreatedById":117566,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T21:59:50Z","Content":"I think it depends only on the drag cubes involved, so the result would be the same in either situation. However the forward facing airbrake may also add a downward force component, or vice versa with the backwards. Regardless, any aerodynamic lift generated does not absorb velocity unless altitude is gained. Deflection drag does, but that is not lift."},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T23:16:13Z","Content":"Thanks guys.\n\nI\u0027ve been having some frustrating problems with re-entry at Eve and most of it relates to air brakes.\n\n1. Air Brakes seem to be bugged with respect to using them in action groups. I added some to a couple action groups in the VAB, but they do not work once launched. I can only activate them using the brake key, but that toggles ALL of my air brakes, which I don\u0027t want.\n\n2. Why don\u0027t I want all of my air brakes to open together you ask? I have to use them to keep my ship pointed retrograde during the descent into Eve\u0027s atmosphere, but they can\u0027t take the heat from that and break off. I wanted to use one set of air brakes until they broke away and then turn on a second set, but that doesn\u0027t work without action groups. I\u0027m not sure how else I can keep my ship pointed retrograde as every time I get below about 60km it starts to tilt about 20-30 degrees off retrograde and no amount of reaction wheels can correct it, but air brakes in the back far from the CoM will hold the craft straight (lawn dart effect).\n\nI\u0027m beginning to think that Squad hasn\u0027t tested any of the new aero stuff with Eve at all."},{"CreatedByName":"11of10","CreatedById":90592,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T00:33:23Z","Content":"Airbrakes don\u0027t react to \u0022Toggle\u0022 setting in action groups.

But I didn\u0027t notice a difference, at least nothing I could tell in-game. Is there actually a small difference in position?"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T04:04:35Z","Content":"I think Claw has fixed the airbrakes and action groups problem in his Stock Bug Fixes mod, if that would help you."}]}
