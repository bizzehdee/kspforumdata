I\u0026#39;ve been a lurker for a while, but I\u0026#39;ve finally decided that having a forum account and asking questions on my own will help to clarify some things I just can\u0026#39;t find, even with search. Although my username is ProgradeInProgress, it\u0026#39;s a variation on my regular username. That being said, abbreviate it how you like, I\u0026#39;m sure it\u0026#39;ll stick.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;ve always been fascinated by any kind of engineering, but aerospace has always been something I gravitate to. I\u0026#39;m also a fan of cutting-edge tech, and love videogames-especially flight sims and fighter arcade sims. For those reasons, I\u0026#39;m a big fan of fighter jets and SSTOs. I always use FAR, as the challenge it presents makes success that much more satisfying. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;m currently working on mk2 tailless fighter aircraft using BDArmory, which I\u0026#39;ve dubbed the KDFx-15 \u0022Flying Reaper\u0022. My builds can take days to get right- I currently have a cross-sectional area below .25, wave-drag below 1.1, and critical mach above 0.7, with some supermaneuverability. I may or may not make a bomber variant due to fuel constraints.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI look forward to honing my KSP skills by learning from everyone here!\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-18T15:59:53Z\u0022 title=\u002211/18/2015 03:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ProgradeInProgress\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFixed numbers- If I had critical mach if 1.7 I\u0026#039;d be reporting it to Ferram...\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MachTurtle","CreatedById":153223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T17:52:38Z","Content":"\nWelcome, Prograde!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;m a former lurker and joined the forum just last week.

It\u0026#39;s a very simple design, and has less than 20 parts when armed only with a Vulcan. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBeing a fighter, it\u0026#39;s Panther-based, and can take off below 75 m/s (srf). Canards are something I\u0026#39;m looking into as well, though, but I\u0026#39;m trying to make it as sleek as possible and canards would interfere with the look. It\u0026#39;s vaguely based on the Boeing F/A-XX concepts, especially in wing shape.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-18T20:09:25Z\u0022 title=\u002211/18/2015 08:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ProgradeInProgress\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ESpelling.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
