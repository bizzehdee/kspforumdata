Love seeing things burn up into Kerbin\u0027s Atmosphere? Or jool\u0027s? Maybe Duna or Eve? No matter what your flavor is this is for you! I am currently uploading a video that is the beginning of this series and it is a small refueling station in Kerbin\u0027s orbit. We deorbit the station and watch it burn and tear apart as it crashes to the ground! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you may be thinking, \u0022Oh watching a station go to the ground is boring!\u0022 Well let me give you this thought. I\u0027m not only going to be doing stations, space planes, probes, and anything else that has a escape pod for a Kerbal to have a chance at surviving. Hence the name, \u0022will it survive?\u0022 And the next video will consist of a space plane that is stock to KSP. I have far installed which improves aerodynamics and makes it more challening to fly a plane. So in this scenario where there is no escape pod we must land safely. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow some pictures. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/j0Hw6/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/j0Hw6/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst video:\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/AUFhufTPC9k?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E \u003Cp\u003Esecond video:\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/awFamf77-Wo?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow with that you may be thinking, \u0022this seems like a cool idea, I wish he would take my epic 700 part station and slam it into the ground!\u0022 Well if that is the case than I will! I will take your incrediably demanding station and slam it into the ground with pleasure! Just a few guidelines that I ask any \u0022donations\u0022 to follow. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Picture of craft:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow all these stations must have an escape system where a escape pod or escape vessel LEAVES the main part of the station it self. Of course if you don\u0027t have any escape systems and just have a giant pile driver that is fine too. Just add a single MK1 pod with a chute and a decouple!\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes I am kindly asking (depending) on people to add their space planes and stations to make an enjoyable series.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-15T11:33:02Z\u0022 title=\u002211/15/2013 11:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by 7499275\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T05:56:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally set aside a little time to take a look, and I have to say: Not bad.

Yes background noise, I can get some free (legal) music to throw in the back! I realized after I uploaded the noise from the fan and mouse were high. Usually I am able to speak louder so the mic is farther away (Build in pc mic). That being said I had to be quieter because my dad was asleep in the other room so pc was closer.
