Here is what I have done so far:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDownload 1.1.3 via Steam. KSP will not launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nrun \u0060ln -s /dev/null libpulse-simple.so.0\u0060 in the KSP directory, and set \u0060LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH %command%_64\u0060 as launch options.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP now launches, but menus are empty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI then added \u0060-force-glcore\u0060 to the launch options.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP launches and menus are readable, but bad shadow glitches occur. Everywhere this is mentioned online it states to mess with the graphics settings. I tried to fix the shadows via the settings, but have had no luck so far.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also can\u0027t click \u0060apply\u0060 in the settings, it does nothing. Besides the shadows, everything seems to be working fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Setting Shadow Cascade to 2 (via the in-game pause menu) fixed the shadows, but the main menu settings is still broken.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-06T01:25:32Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2016 01:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Zekario\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
