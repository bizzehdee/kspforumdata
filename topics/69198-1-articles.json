This transfer could replace conventional all-nuclear systems on extremely light or heavy payloads, or during extremely long voyages, because the ion engines generate so much delta-V from so little fuel and engine mass that the hybrid transfer is much more efficient, solar orbit provides solar panels unblocked and reliably-oriented charging, and the non-ionic boost makes burn times tolerable. Recent advancements in ion-thruster technology have quadrupled thrust, further improving this option. If I can make KER display ion drive dV, then I will post some screenshots of possible configurations. Until then, discuss the transfer\u0027s utility and possible applications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Duxwing\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-13T03:49:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou have to balance out the extra delta-V per unit mass obtained with ion engines against the delta-V lost from not taking full advantage of the Oberth effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then throw in player time issue from potential long burns and part count issues from the lack of a big ion engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore efficient, I believe, would be to do things the other way round.
