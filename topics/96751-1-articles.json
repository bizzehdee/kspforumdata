Attachment nodes in the VAB are supposed to be directional, but they snap and connect both forwards, and 180 degrees opposite of the intended direction. This makes placing thin pieces with nodes on each side, such as docking ports, difficult because it frequently snaps to the wrong node and one model winds up inside the other. It gets even worse if you start working with mod parts that are any thinner than the docking ports. I think this is a bug... but if it\u0027s an intended \u0027feature\u0027, could you please add a key to disable it, similar to how alt disables surface attachment in the VAB? Holding down control while placing to make sure it only snaps to the correctly facing node?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd another note... It would be VERY helpful as a mod maker to be able to make nodes that only attach to certain other nodes. Something like the docking port ID system, but for assembly nodes in the VAB. It could be the existing size parameter, where any setting other than 0,1 or 2 would only snap to similarly sized nodes... or it could be a new parameter \u0027id\u0027 and each node could have a property \u0027requireid\u0027 that defaults to false and controls whether that node will attach to any node... or only to others of the same id. This would be handy for situations like my Dreamchaser mod, where it doesn\u0027t make sense to put anything but the landing gear in the landing gear bay... and it would be nice if they didn\u0027t snap all over and the nodes didn\u0027t get in the way of attaching other things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
