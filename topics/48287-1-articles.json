It\u0027s a quirky game with realism thrown in, not a NASA simulator after all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerbals themselves give the game more meaning. The first time you build your rocket, you see Jeb there on the bottom right, yelling, looking around. You\u0027ll get attached, not just to him but the game itself. It makes everything less sterile, less just about numbers, etc. I think it\u0027s one of those aspects that Squad has in mind to make sure it always comes across that this is a \u003Cstrong\u003Egame.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-15T08:07:37Z\u0022 title=\u002210/15/2013 08:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Nostromo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"softweir","CreatedById":2795,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T08:12:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf people want to keep the Kerbal-factor for probes, how about having a view of mission control during probe operations: instead of one or three suited Kerbals in a ship, how about three shirtsleeve Kerbals in mission control reacting to their telemetry?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess it would be fairly easy to implement: instead of having an internal space in the capsule have an internal space in some dislocated volume (behind the camera?) and remember to turn off camera shake and \u0022death\u0022!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dlrk","CreatedById":60033,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T08:21:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E^good idea!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
