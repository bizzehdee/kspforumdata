On ebay, there seems to be quite a few lots of \u0022yellow 7 segment LED\u0022 displays to be found. Me personally, I went with green for an Apollo look, but I dig going for amber for the aviation look too. My keyboard is 100% custom, with blue and grey \u0022aviation\u0022 themed keys (It\u0027s the \u0022Danger Zone\u0022 key cap set), and amber LED sublighting. I actually did spend the extra on legit amber LEDs, vs yellows, so I know what you mean with he price difference. These days, amber is something of a \u0022specialty color\u0022. It doesn\u0027t feature the same level of mass manufacturing red, yellow, green and blue have, thus the slightly higher costs.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, I was the one that posted the idea for a homemade T-Bar lever, using a slide potentiometer. I\u0027ll drop the diagram below. It\u0027s pretty straight forward. the one non obvious element is the bottom is two horizontal segments, with he t-bar lever sandwiched between. Tightening the bolt at the pivot adds resistance to the lever.

For rotary, you just mount the handle to the potentiometer shaft, but you must take care to support the shaft, or the pot will be stressed if\u00A0you apply lateral forces to the lever. This home made t-bar below is not mine, but was posted on my build thread, and I really like the design, mainly cause it\u0027s SIIIIIMPLE!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s just a piece of angle stock with a slot cut for the lever, a few mounting holes drilled into the top for actual mounting to the panel, and a mere three drill holes (4 if your pot has an indexing pin) in the bottom angle for mounting the pot and the t-bar pivot support. The pivot support consists of two parts. One part has slots for adjustment and mounting to the angle stock, and holes to clamp down the other part, which serves as the top half of a clamp. This adds resistance to the lever, giving it a better feel.\u00A0A nylon ring serves as the friction bearing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022tbar1.JPG\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.lefflerpost.com.au/~lefflerp/OBUnit1/tbar1.JPG\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022tbar2.JPG\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.lefflerpost.com.au/~lefflerp/OBUnit1/tbar2.JPG\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI also concur with the suggestion to go big from the start... Don\u0027t even bother with the Uno, go for the Mega. I\u0027m already at the point where I know I\u0027ll have multiple Arduinos, each working their own subsystems. A Mega will be at the heart of it all.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI like the idea of your terrain alarm. I\u0027m doing something a slight bit different on my build, though I\u0027m not against implementing an idea not unlike yours as well. On my instrument panel\u0027s \u0022DSKY\u0022, there will be different LED readouts for things like Apoapsis, Periapsis, Time To Event, etc... I have some nice rectangular annunciator LEDs that will serve as indicators for different functions, states, and alarms. You can actually snag some very nice ones off ebay. To be honest, I have a pile of yellow ones I\u0027ll never use... Salvaged \u0027em from surplus medical equipment... Not a green one in the lot!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u00A0I\u0027ve literally been drilling out the leads and LED dies from the back and epoxying other colored LEDs in place of the original LEDs... Anyway, kinda went on a tangent there... What I\u0027d like to do is keep a set of constants for each body in the Kerbal system (plus any planet packs I install, such as OPM) stored in the Arduino handling the digital LED readouts and annunciator LEDs. The stored constant will be either A: the edge of the atmosphere, or\u00A0B: the highest point of the terrain (for bodies with no atmosphere), or C: The lowest altitude where thermals are survivable. Any time Periapsis is lower than one of these values, I want a chime or tone to ping, and a red \u0022LOW\u0022 annunciator LED will light next to the Periapsis indicator. It simply means that your orbit is no longer stable, and could become sub-orbital, either due to the potential for terrain collision, aerobraking reducing your periapsis even further, or eminent thermal destruction. It simply indicates that you had better intend to either land or burn if you don\u0027t take action.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOther annunciators I want to support would include Chutes Unsafe/Risky/Safe indicators. I\u0027m not certain if that\u0027ll make it into the packet, or how hard it would be to actually add it, if it\u0027s not.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAn actual terrain alarm is relatively basic enough. You need a variable to represent wether you have silenced the alarm or not. Pressing silence with no alarm active should do nothing.\u00A0Just monitor your radar altimeter value and your vertical velocity value. If your vertical velocity is greater than a set downward amount, and the radar altimeter drops below a set point, and\u00A0the silenced value is not set,\u00A0then you activate your alarm and indicator outputs. Pressing a silence button would set the silence flag to true, silencing the alarm, and keeping it from being retriggered. The LED indicator would stay lit as long as the vertical velocity and radar altimeter both exceed safe limits. If you go into safe limits, the indicator should extinguish, and the silence flag be reset.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think...\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HighFructose","CreatedById":180349,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-08T03:47:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow, I\u0027ll definitely look into yellow displays.

You could even use something like the Max7219 control boards to do it.

A single Max7219 can drive eight separate 8-segment bargraph displays, or four separate meters made of 16 segments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the better option, especially if you\u0027re using multiples of 10 segments of LEDs, is to use an LM3914\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12694\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.sparkfun.com/products/12694\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0(the bulk link above is cheaper in quantity, by\u003Cem\u003E A LOT\u003C/em\u003E)\u00A0to convert an analog output to drive the LEDs. Since the Arduino code for the analog metered values actually makes sense to output as an actual analog value, you can get those chips, and just send the value to each of the Aurduino\u0027s\u00A0PWM/Analog out lines. The Mega already supports 15 analog PWM outputs, so you\u0027re covered, wether you decide to do 3 meters, or all 10 analog readouts.\u00A0You\u0027ll need a simple resistor and capacitor to smooth the PWM from the Arduino into a genuine\u00A0analog signal, and the chip can handle the LEDs from there! There is a way to chain the chips, to get\u00A020 or 30 segments, or even more if you wanted it. You set your analog range with the R_lo\u00A0and R_hi\u00A0inputs. All you need are resistors to set those. The first chip, you set R_lo\u00A0to 0 volts, and then whatever value gets to the top segment\u00A0of the first display, you set that value as R_hi\u00A0for the first display\u0027s chip, and as R_lo\u00A0for the second display\u0027s chip, and you continue that, till the last chip\u0027s R_hi\u00A0is the max voltage. Sounds complicated, but it\u0027s not that bad. In the case of the 12 segment displays i suggested, rather than buy an extra chip just to cover a measly two LEDs, it might be better to have the max and min LEDs be manually set with I/O pins, or to even rig something else to handle it. You could even wire the top and bottom LEDs to stay on as \u0022end markers\u0022 for the 12 segment LEDs I showed, and then only change the middle 10 LEDs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-10T02:01:06Z\u0022 title=\u002208/10/2017 02:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 10, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by richfiles\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
