Searched the forums, but didn\u0027t find anything relating to it.\n\nI put my lander down on Minmus, south of the Greater Flats, in the Highlands. Even though I\u0027ve landed (altitude 5003m), it still says I\u0027m orbiting at 4.4m/s ... huh? Is there something wrong with this (a bug) or that just the way life is?\n\n![lFnzXct.png](http://i.imgur.com/lFnzXct.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-09T02:37:34Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2015 02:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LordFerret**"},{"CreatedByName":"Destroyer713","CreatedById":136956,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T01:14:52Z","Content":"If I had to guess, I\u0027d say you\u0027re getting an orbital velocity because of what mode your speedometer is in. The way you have it right now, it\u0027s likely taking Minmus\u0027s rotation into account, and giving you an orbital velocity.\n\nJust click on the speedometer so it says Surface, and that should make it say you\u0027re not moving anymore."},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T01:28:37Z","Content":"The navball doesn\u0027t automatically switch from orbit mode to surface mode until (I think) 4500 m datum altitude on Minmus.\n\nSince you\u0027ve landed at a point where ground level is higher than this, it\u0027s still in orbit mode and showing your speed relative to the center of Minmus. The speed is, therefore, the rotational speed of Minmus at your latitude and altitude.\n\nYou can change this, as Destroyer713 says, by clicking on the speed readout of the navball to change the mode to surface manually."},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T02:37:14Z","Content":"I\u0027ve already lifted-off back to my Minmus station to process the science, but I\u0027ll return to the same spot and try that.\n\nThank you both for responding. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
