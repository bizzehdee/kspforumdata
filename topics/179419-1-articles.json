I can\u0027t answer the mass question, but as to the speed of the light beam that you project in front of yourself, I believe that this is countered by time dilation. Basically, you will see the light moving at the speed of light away from you, but the Earth would see time slow down for you and the emitted photons, and that would mean that the photons move at the speed of light relative to earth as well.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTLDR: Time dilation!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Green Baron","CreatedById":107381,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-31T09:20:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst: I am not a physicist and my understanding is probably not much better than yours.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat i think is that you see earth (or one of the frames) as an absolute reference frame. But that is not the case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo transform one frame to another you must apply the Lorentz transformation to time dilation, relativistic mass, relativistic length and relativistic speed. The closer you get to c as a relative speed when transforming between two frames, the faster the term grows until it produces a division by 0 when c is reached. So, if you observe the dinghi that starts from a ship moving at 0.99c relative to earth (which makes the ship almost stand still when seen from earth due to time dilation) and the dinghi accelerates away from the ship to 0.9c relative to the mothership, it only accelerates 0.999c (or so) relative to earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope that wasn\u0027t totally nonsensical.

Easiest example is if you emit two photons in opposite direction. What you will not be able to observe is a speed greater than 1c relative to *yourself*.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond example:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis one is more interesting. Time dilation and length contractions are the items that are important here. For an observer outside the spaceship (observing the spaceship at 0.99 c) the smaller ship will expend a lot of energy to move just slightly faster. But much less time will seem to pass for the smaller ship than for the larger ship. So for the observer the ships will arrive at some distant target at almost the same time, but the crew of the smaller ship will have aged much less.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor an observer inside the spaceship, the smaller ship will have a larger relative speed but the difference in perceived time will be smaller. So for the larger ship the smaller ship seems to reach the target much faster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo putting it in a simplified matter, in one frame (from inside the larger ship) the crew of the smaller space ship arrives at a younger age because they just got there a lot faster in the classical manner (assuming the relative speed is still small in relativistic terms). For the outside observer the ships arrive at roughly the same time, but the crew of the smaller space ship is still younger, but this time due to time dilation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, this is a bit simplified as I do not define the target and the speed of this would need to be taken into account.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xd the great","CreatedById":188222,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-01T09:33:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/181527-heliosph0enix/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022181527\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/181527-heliosph0enix/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@HeliosPh0enix\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0i made a mistake answering the 2nd question.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince the spaceship is acceleratong, it will feel that it is moving at\u00A0speeds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth the cargo ship and earth will find it true that the ship is accelerating, and all physics laws (relativity) applies to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-11-01T09:34:07Z\u0022 title=\u002211/01/2018 09:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 1, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Xd the great\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KG3","CreatedById":182951,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-01T12:55:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not a physicist either but I have put some thought into this.\u00A0 Anyone else can feel free to jump in and help me out!
