When extracting experiment results from a Science Jr or a Mystery Goo, the notification pops up every dang time asking for confirmation due to the lack of ability to reuse the module without a scientist. This is especially annoying when extracting said module using a scientist. Just wondering if there is a way to disable this notification, as I could not find any methods through a Google search.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fourfa","CreatedById":151713,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-18T16:28:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNope.
