They claim that we are not thorough in our testing before Kerbal use, and here they cite the following grievances: Space station critical fuel levels, the station-shuttle collision, the five attempts at an SSTO, and most importantly, the Duna return Catastrophe. This has put us at the losses of eleven kerbals by their reckoning, not including the tests they have no idea about, like the Mun Landers, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://scontent-b-ord.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc1/375642_292987157507737_1185597875_n.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022375642_292987157507737_1185597875_n.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://scontent-a-ord.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/9897_266077323532054_963965571_n.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229897_266077323532054_963965571_n.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe ships that have depressurized and sent the kerbal into the atmosphere,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://scontent-a-ord.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/189543_289494117857041_1065288993_n.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022189543_289494117857041_1065288993_n.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E and the launch failures due to the lack of Duck Tape on holding the ships together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://scontent-a-ord.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/942512_265155763624210_2029806708_n.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://scontent-a-ord.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/942512_265155763624210_2029806708_n.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E By my reckoning, that puts us back 51 kerbals.

However, other than these assets, we do not have enough funds to maintain our fleet of spacecraft in orbit. Yesterday, we committed folly. Today we destroy, the depressurized crafts, the capsules, everything. Tomorrow we rebuild. We will find survivors of the station with our battle cruisers, Launch a new station core and refuel it, and begin to reach for the moons, and then the planets, and then the stars. We will gain the public\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s trust and will regain our former glory.

So Rodrey, Quin, get working on a reusable launch system, and may I suggest some parts from my scrapyard, like an SRB or two, or ten. Philney, you take a team to design a new station with a few compatible payloads of fuel. Bill, I want you to take control up in the skies. oversee the deorbiting of all the excess space junk. Elkrie, actually research the aerobraking heights this time. Bob, get in the simulator, we\u0027re going to be on the first payload to the space station.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"briansun1","CreatedById":67451,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-08T03:43:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u002B rep from me\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ekim98","CreatedById":82180,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-12T19:38:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBill: Hey Jeb, I have an issue here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: What is it? don\u0027t tell me the battle destroyers are dead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill, nope, in fact quite the contrary...the battle cruiser found the station, alive and kicking. he tried to destroy it, but then realized what it was, so it transferred it\u0027s fuel to it and is now providing support. the docking port however was too small so he could not fill the station all the way up, but its a little over half full.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: hm... I guess that means that the shuttle just spontaneously combusted. How are the crew members?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: they\u0027re fine, a little creeped out that they had been given up for dead., and pretty sad that KASA is unfunded. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: I would think so. How are the other assets?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: well we deorbited all the space junk. confirmed crashes and destruction on all assets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Including the manned missions, well mission. the spaceplane that was there. what about that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: Well it was deorbited, pilated excelently, stalled on the final approach, and then crashed. Jerney Kerman survived. we\u0027ve recovered him too!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: great! How have the other plans gone?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: well we launched a miner unit into space and it refueled at the mun and then it refueled the station so it is almost full again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: and the miner?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: well the pilot went for a stay in the station, and the vehicle is about to crash into the ocean\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: great! see you soon. I need to talk to Philney, then Quin. And finally Bob We have a training run to the moon!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E....In the Astronaut complex break room....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Hey Bob, we have it confirmed, in 30 days you and I are going to the moon for a test run!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: great, why the delay?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: we need to wait for the reusable launch vehicle to be assembled and then we need to wait for our lander and another crew cabin on the station to be put up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: oh... okay then, see you.

Quin and Rodney, you can go. Philney, I need to tell you that the station has been found. Now we need another crew module and fuel tank with some solar panels. Also, it may be good to actually put some communications on that so we can actually communicate with the station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhinlney: On it Jeb! and good luck on the mun next munth.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
