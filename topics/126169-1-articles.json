In Mexico, UK,US, Australia, China and about half the countries in Africa use the point (according to Wikipedia), while Russia, Europe, South America and the other half of countries in Africa use the comma. For half the people this will not even be wrong. I hope it didn\u0026#39;t have very drastic consequences for you.\u003Cbr\u003E\n(Disclaimer: I generalized it a bit, so there are some exceptions)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTaking that into account using words would be the least confusing option.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pellinor","CreatedById":85299,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T17:48:31Z","Content":"\nDo we really need so many significant digits on a conversion factor?
