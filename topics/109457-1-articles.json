The only mod I have installed is Mechjeb. I recently built a space station and put it into orbit around Minmus. It contained a processing lab, ISRU converter, a large fuel storage tank, etc. Shortly after completing my station, I docked a mining ship with ore from Minmus to the station and began processing the ore. While it was processing I exited the game. When I returned the space station had vanished. It cannot be seen from the Tracking Station or in map view (while piloting another ship.) There were two Kerbonauts on board (in the mining ship) that still show up as active in the Astronaut Complex. It still shows them as being aboard the Minmus Space Station although the station seems to be lost. \n\nHas anyone else experienced a problem like this? Any help will be greatly appreciated as it took quite a while to train these Kerbonauts and to construct this station.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T19:27:14Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 07:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Schutte**"},{"CreatedByName":"Schutte","CreatedById":144139,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T04:56:55Z","Content":"Please disregard this post.
