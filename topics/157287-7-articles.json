The community has literally no idea what Squad intends to do. I\u0027m not talking about release dates. I\u0027m not talking about when features are implemented. I\u0027m talking about a broad idea of what Squad can see happening before it calls KSP complete. We used to have at least that, but since KSP has reached that mark where does Squad see it going? Do they have any actual direction or is it just a bunch of loose ideas with no real focus. Are there even any ideas?

I think most people who care about the work they do want others to recognize and like all the hard work that\u0027s been done. I\u0027m do believe the localization work will be good. Apart from that I have no idea what Squad is still work for. It would make since they have some kind of plan, but right now they are a video game one-hit wonder. There\u0027s no reason to believe that KSP will go farther or other projects will be successful.
