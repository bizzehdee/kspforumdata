Collected all the science in 30 minutes and visited atleast 20 sites for crew reports which was my mission. (I know 50k was a bit op. Ended up using 15k for everything on Minmus) The Lander works as a refueling station for the 4 ion engines at the bottom of the jeep \u002B its the way back home leaving the jeep at minmus. As you can see the minmus bus is not symetrycal and this causes alot of problems with drag. I have to force it to stay straight because of the uneven drag forces. Mechjeb provides me with the easy solution to this = Precision which is humanly impossible. You can set the angle of attack against the prograde so that it never turns more degrees then you set before the prograde. In my case i use 3 degrees. I noticed most rocket flips happen when the rocket wants to turn more than 5 degrees infront of the prograde and then the atmosphere drag hits the side so hard it creates a chain reaction that flips the rocket. If i wanted to launch the Minmus Bus manually im guessing i would go for 25km straight up and then start the turn which would cost me alot of dV.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArchGaden","CreatedById":116362,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T15:00:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the new aerodynamics, nobody can really give you accurate numbers without actually flying your particular vessel through different launch profiles. I\u0027ve played a lot of launch profiles on some pretty shady vessel designs I\u0027ve resorted to before the right parts were available. I generally plan for 600 d/v extra if I\u0027m doing a late gravity turn to avoid aerodynamic issues. I always circularize before travelling elsewhere as I find it simpler than trying to time my launch precisely. I expect the d/v cost of a late turn is about the same though, as you\u0027ll have to gain the orbital velocity eventually.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Requia","CreatedById":112924,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T15:15:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaaaaybe. For ~5500dv, which isn\u0027t too insane. The problem here is the efficiency of that initial launch to a high AP. The faster you come up, the lower the dv, it might be possible with a really aero friendly rocket, but with heavy non aerodynamic load you\u0027re gonna have more drag, not much stability issues, just force straight down. terminal velocity is still in fact a thing... and low to the ground its about 400m/s for my relatively aero-friendly rockets. You need to hit something around 1600m/s as quickly as possible. Trying to bust through TV will just add dv, same as the soup always did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s possible you need to burn as hard as possible off the launchpad. All this nonsense FAR players have been spreading about TWRs of 1.3 to 1.7 in nustock will KILL this ascent profile. Burn to supersonic then drop your TWR to about 2.2 (I\u0027d not try this without Kerball Engineer Redux to actually tell you) and hold, when you hit 20km throttle up to maximum (in design, remember every second you shave with higher TWR is less fuel you need) till your AP is in place. The orbital burn is nominally 1960 (at 150km), but pack more because that\u0027ll be inefficient for how sharp the angle is gonna be, the faster you can execute it the closer it\u0027ll be to 1960, so TWR continues to be a serious need right until the end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor all that, your PE velocity is gonna be fairly low I\u0027m afraid, you really are throwing away 2000 dv on this, it might be better to burn to 20km straight up then gravity turn once aero forces aren\u0027t as big a deal, less efficient than normal for sure, but a good middle ground.

I always look at vacuum d/v and judge my costs by that number. Burning fuel earlier results in a greater vac d/v cost of course. It is just one of the many conditions at play though. While in the atmosphere, you experience drag that also eats d/v, which goes at odds with lower engine efficiency. Additionally, burning straight up is wasteful as you really need orbital velocity, which is towards the horizon during launch and prograde when in orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe overall result is exactly what others have told you, turn soon after launch. Obviously turning is difficult with unwieldy vessels. In the worst cases, you\u0027ll have to shoot straight up and then turn fast around 35km (rough point at which aerodynamics don\u0027t matter much). This costs d/v though as your fuel has been spent sending you straight up instead of contributing to orbital velocity. I\u0027ve found that I waste as much as 600 d/v in my worst cast 35km turn profiles, so I\u0027ve tend to budget that in right from the start when I know my vessel will be unwieldy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far not circularizing goes. It is more efficient to launch directly into the plane of your target right at the launch window and do the full burn with circularizing. It doesn\u0027t save much fuel and requires some more precise piloting. Go for it if you want though. A perfect launch is a beautiful thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T18:28:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor unwieldy payloads, it\u0027s advisable to clear the worst atmosphere quickly.
