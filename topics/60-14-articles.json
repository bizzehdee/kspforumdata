Stick some boosters or something down there.[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]Don\u0027t put the RCS too close to the center of mass. It\u0027s more effective out toward the end. I only use RCS on medium sized or larger rockets, but I\u0027ve never needed more than one.[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]I sometimes use extra SAS modules, but I\u0027ll do something like put them on boosters which I jettison - as the rocket gets lighter, I don\u0027t need them or the mass they represent. I have a 17,500 m/s rocket which uses only 7 of them - one just like the sample rocket I gave, and 6 on boosters which I drop around 30 km up.[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]Make your rocket rigid with sparing use of struts. If your upper stage tends to fold around a certain engine or decoupler, turn on 3-way symmetry and tie the upper tank to the one below the engine.[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]Many SAS modules on parts that are wobbly compared to each other often fight or overcorrect repeatedly, effectively paralyzing their effectiveness. Use as few as you can.[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]More often than not, the uncontrollable tipping is due to one engine in you cluster being broken - try turning your engines off, shifting the camera and looking to see if that\u0027s the case.[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]Particularly floppy assemblies may twist under the stress of thrust and skew one way or the other. If this is uneven, it will uncontrollably steer your rocket. This happens a lot with SRBs on radial decouplers.[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]If your thrust to mass is super high, the rocket becomes hard to control - this often happens just before booster burnout, when lots of fuel is gone.
