The Managers of the Bug Tracker are Experimental and QA members - Geschosskopf is the former -, so they do tend to have a very good idea on the finer points of the difference between a bug, feature and feedback. Geschosskopf was correct in marking it as a Feature Request, as vexx32 pointed out it\u0027s not unintended behaviour and thus can\u0027t really be deemed a Bug. The reasoning behind why it is that way is separated from the issue report itself and the type of issue report it is, that was just him adding in his two cents as to why it \u003Cem\u003Emight\u003C/em\u003E be that way.
