Variables like light levels (plants will have a hard time out by Jool) and darkness times (while orbiting a body) will make it less useful. Rather than make them overly complex, you could differentiate between tech levels with the efficiency. 100% efficient is rather \u0027magic tech\u0027 land as such systems will always produce some waste which is vented outboard.

Any mission where a greenhouse weighs more than 9kg x Kerbals x length of mission in days is less efficient. So lets plug numbers in for a 2 man Duna return visit with a reasonably close window and call the round trip 500 days - 9 tonnes of supplies. Now the big question is, how much mass does the equivalent journey in TACLS need - that will tell you how light your part *must* be before anyone who actually thinks when designing will take it along.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was looking these things up lately as I was considering having a go at extending TACLS myself but I\u0027m a terrible modeller, hence why this stuff is fresh in my mind.

(I\u0027m also making the simplifying assumption that it cycles all the time, pretty much, and that the waste going in and resources coming out represent amounts over-and-above it just keeping itself ticking over.) They\u0027re also tied together such that you need all three to make it work: without CO2, fr\u0027example, all the nitrogenous Waste in the world isn\u0027t going to help you make plants grow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have some notions for complications to the resource cycle I might add in the future, but they\u0027re all by way of optional features: on the output side, being able to get some sort of Biomass resource instead of Food which you could then reprocess into other resources to make use of spare capacity; or on the input side, being able to use in situ resources, processed or not, in place of the usual inputs to generate more life support resources. But I don\u0027t see that as changing the simplicity of the basic greenhouse, and it\u0027s a ways down the line anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESize variations are definitely on the roadmap, coming soon. Efficiency variations I\u0027m not so sure about (the existing recyclers in TAC Life Support for CarbonDioxide and WasteWater are already 90% efficient, so there\u0027s not all that much room to play with, there), but I\u0027ll have a think about possible variants for further down the tree increasing their mass-efficiency somewhat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the light-level question: light levels are pretty much the next thing on the list to handle. At the moment in 0.1-beta, it shamelessly ignores the issue, but that\u0027s never been the plan, belike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m thinking of in this respect is that the greenhouse comes with both windows and internal illumination. The first part of the lighting plan, thus, is to implement a change in the ElectricCharge used depending on the access to sunlight the greenhouse has (and whether or not the shutters are open), between a baseline level to reflect the cost of running the pumps, etc., that it uses all the time, and a higher level reflecting how hard the lights have to work to make up the \u0027light debt\u0027. Putting a scaling factor on there for distance from Kerbol that makes the greenhouse more expensive to run in ElectricCharge terms, therefore, as available light intensities drop also seems rather appropriate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(And I\u0027ll freely admit that the nominal 100% efficiency - or at least 99-point-lost-in-the-statistical-noise-percent efficiency - is very much \u0022magic tech\u0022.

Math time!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking through the report, it mentions an earlier study showing that if approximately 50% or more of the required food (by dry mass) is grown on-site, the plants used will be capable of providing all of your air and water regeneration. Since we\u0027re going for 100% of food grown on-site, that means we just need to figure out how much growing area we need to support a Kerbal with food, and that should be more than enough to also provide water and oxygen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome relevant values I\u0027ve pulled out of it are the system mass and volume per growing area, which come out to be 101.5 kg/m\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E and 1.03 m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E/m\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E. These round nicely to 100 kg (0.1 t, in the typical Kerbal mass unit of metric tons) and 1 m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9 per square meter of growing area. Note: these values do include mass and volume for artificial lighting, in addition to the structure and the crops themselves, but do not include extra volume for crew members to actually walk around in the greenhouse and collect the crops. An increase of 25%-50% of the growing area is suggested for crew access, although the extra volume won\u0027t mass as much due to not including all the plant-growing equipment. Perhaps 0.125 t and 1.5 m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E per square meter of growing area for a properly accessible greenhouse. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at the definitions for the TAC-LS resources, one Kerbal uses 0.0003166535 t of food per day, or 0.317 kg (317 g)/day. This looks like it\u0027s meant to represent dehydrated food for minimum shipping weight (the NASA document\u0027s values for the dry weight of one day of food for a human on IVA is 0.67 kg; presumably Kerbals use less food because they are smaller). The NASA document has a table of dry weight productivity (grams/day per m\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9) for various crops. Using those values, for a diet of 30% beans, 30% rice, 30% salad (tomatoes/carrots/cabbage/green onions/lettuce/radishes/spinach), and 10% strawberries (percentages by growing area) we get an overall yield of 8.78 grams of dry weight per day per square meter. That puts us at just over 36 square meters to support one Kerbal; using the above figures for mass and volume, that\u0027s 4.5 tons and 54 cubic meters. If we size it to fit with 2.5m diameter parts, the cylinder will be 11 meters long. How big is that compared to stock parts? Orange-tank sized*? Quite bulky for one Kerbal, although that helps push you towards packaged goods for any non-permanent installation, which may be desirable. Higher-tech versions with advanced automation and better packing could increase the density (you don\u0027t need room for Kerbals to walk around picking the vegetables if you have little robots to do it), say up to a maximum of 6x less volume than that initial module. That would leave the module at 4.5 tons / 9 cubic meters for an overall density of 0.5 t/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E, which seems about right for a maximum (plants and substrate are mostly water and have a density around ~1, but you need some airspace as well, so that pushes the density lower). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPower requirements are listed as 2.6 kW/m\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E, mostly for the grow lights and a little for ventilation, which with our figure of 36 square meters means we need 93.6 kW per Kerbal. I often go by KSP Interstellar\u0027s definition of 1 Electric Charge/s = 1 kW; rounding leaves us at 90 EC/s per Kerbal. That would leave the module very power-hungry compared to most stock parts, and even the stock TAC-LS converters (they use 1000 EC per conversion, but only do 8 conversions per day, or 8.4 on the large converters). If you\u0027re actually using KSPI, it\u0027s not a problem, as the reactors in that mod produce more than enough power, but we might need to tone it down a little for people who aren\u0027t. Using filtered sunlight instead of grow lights would also substantially reduce the power requirements. It appears to be that 2.2 kW out of the 2.6 kW are for the lights, so the remnant is 0.4 kW per square meter, or 14.4 kW per Kerbal, so long as sufficiently intense sunlight is available. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow does it sound so far?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*A check shows that the height of a Jumbo-64 tank is just about 3 times the diameter of other 2.5m parts, so it\u0027s about 7.5m tall. This is supported by the part.cfg, which has the stack nodes at \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B13.75. Therefore this 11m long module is actually just under 50% longer than an orange tank, or just about the size of three Rockomax X200-32 tanks. Using the 6x density version would let you have a greenhouse the size of a X200-32 tank, which looks to be about the size of your current model, massing 9 tons and capable of supporting two Kerbals indefinitely. Natural sunlight plus two Gigantor solar panels would supply its energy needs in Kerbin orbit or closer to the sun. Trips further out are going to need a non-solar power source, preferably something heftier than the stock RTGs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor comparison, using the 2.5m TAC-LS parts, 1x Carbon Extractor/1x Water Purifier/1x Life Support Container/3x Food Containers provides 6400 24-hour days of life support at a bit less volume than a X200-32 tank and a mass of 4.7 tons. This is enough to support two Kerbals for 8.8 Earth years, at about the same volume, half the mass and with far less power usage.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-11T20:35:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2014 08:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ArcFurnace\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Helix935","CreatedById":71312,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-11T19:44:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edear lord how long did you guys type?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArcFurnace","CreatedById":109240,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-11T20:20:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Helix935\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Helix935\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Edear lord how long did you guys type?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe typing doesn\u0027t take nearly as long as poking around to find all the numbers, heh heh heh.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ratzap","CreatedById":75982,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-11T21:14:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood to see people thinking about it.

They are definitely using a hydroponic design as their base, not aeroponics. Perhaps they simply didn\u0027t have as much information on aeroponics at the time it was written? Just from looking at the Wikipedia article it seems that aeroponics might indeed be better, and has specifically been researched for space use (including the inflatable system you mention). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for inflatable structures, they definitely cover inflatable habitation modules in the report, but don\u0027t seem to discuss it in the biomass section, which is what we\u0027re dealing with here. I\u0027m not particularly sure why. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a slight aversion to using inflatable modules, but that\u0027s mostly difficulty-based. Specifically, we\u0027d need animation code and modeling to cover inflating the modules once they\u0027re launched. If someone can do that, well, that\u0027s not a problem then, but I know I couldn\u0027t. I\u0027m still imagining these as stack-mounted, in which case you might not want the animation to change the length of the cylinder, either (I suspect it might cause problems, although InfernalRobotics says it\u0027s workable if you\u0027re good enough at coding). I suppose you could have a 2.5m diameter initial module that inflates to a 3.75m (or larger) diameter cylinder without changing length, TransHab style. You\u0027d have to be careful if you wanted it to land sideways on a planet, though; it would probably brush the ground if you built it to interface with other 2.5m parts on wheels due to the extra diameter. Landing it vertically would still work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm ... what would the reference design look like updated with these technologies? The page you linked says that aeroponics can grow crops in half the time of hydroponic systems (is that true? I dunno, but we\u0027re going to roll with it because I want a module that\u0027s not stupid-huge), so double the number of Kerbals the system can support. Inflating from 2.5m to 3.75m diameter increases our available volume by 2.25x, so that\u0027s 4.5x total (although mass also increases by, hmm, let\u0027s say 2x to cover the extra plants, with the inflatable structure being a little lighter per volume). Last, a bit more than a third of the mass of the hydroponic system is in the \u0022root zone and nutrients\u0022, which would be mostly the mass of the hydroponic nutrient fluid, so cut the mass by 33%. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasing it on the highest-density design I detailed above, we now have a 2.5m diameter / 3.75m height cylinder (Rockomax X200-32 tank dimensions) that inflates to a 3.75m diameter/3.75m height cylinder. It masses 12 tons, and can support 9 Kerbals indefinitely provided you have sufficient power. Nice! The power usage goes up just as fast, though ... if we scale it by number of Kerbals, at 90 kW per Kerbal we end up at 810 kW for the greenhouse unit. If you stay stock, and inside of Kerbin\u0027s orbit, that\u0027s 45 Gigantor solar panels, or worse, 1080 RTGs for further out than Kerbin. Yikes! Even with full sunlight instead of grow lights it would require 130 kW just for the ventilation (and that\u0027s even more important with aeroponics- got to keep that nutrient solution mist moving), which is still 8 Gigantors- doable, but still a fair few panels. We can get lower power consumption numbers if we only increase the power usage by 2.25x for the extra volume, although with the plants growing twice as fast I\u0027m not sure if that violates thermodynamics or not. That would be 405 kW for grow lights or 65 kW for sunlight\u002Bmaintenance. Still pretty much need some sort of modded electricity source to handle that much power- KSPI\u0027s reactors can do it easily, but I\u0027m not sure how many other things can. I personally use KSPI, so I\u0027d be totally okay with that, but others might not be so happy (it IS a pretty big mod, and the necessary rearrangement of the tech tree makes it incompatible with other tech tree adjustment mods). Plus, now you have a reactor that\u0027ll run out of fuel eventually, although if you include one of the extractor refineries most planets have deposits of uranium or thorium that\u0027ll keep you running. Of course, if you prioritize reasonable gameplay over strict or semi-strict realism, you could always just tweak the power use numbers around however you like. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA noninflatable version of the above would be a 2.5m dia x 3.75m high cylinder that masses 6 tons and could support 4 Kerbals indefinitely with sufficient power (360 kW for artificial lighting / 60 kW for natural lighting, both at max realism, less if you want to tweak the power values downwards). This version masses 1.5 tons/Kerbal supported, the inflatable version 1.33 tons/Kerbal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComparing again to packaged life support, 4.7 tons of that in 2.5m parts gets you 6400 days of life support to spread across all crewmembers. You can also add extra packs of 1 Life Support/3 Food Containers for another 6400 days each, which add 4 tons per pack. The crossover point where a greenhouse module is less mass than prepackaged supplies is between 1600 and 3200 days for 4-Kerbal voyages and the noninflatable module, or between 1600 and 2400 days for 8-Kerbal voyages and the inflatable module. The greenhouse modules always use vastly more power than prepackaged supplies with the current TAC-LS converters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor reference, the longest Kerbin \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; elsewhere Hohmann transfer orbit is to Eeloo, at 396 Earth days each way, plus however long you have to wait for a transfer window. This is well within the range of prepackaged supplies if you\u0027re not planning on hanging around for a really long time. It\u0027s looking the like greenhouses mostly make sense for seriously long-duration voyages or (semi)permanent bases, which might be just fine given that said bases were what this was intended for in the first place. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you guys think?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-12T02:52:56Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2014 02:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ArcFurnace\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hattivat","CreatedById":110255,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-12T11:10:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for a well-thought-out reply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ArcFurnace\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ArcFurnace\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have a slight aversion to using inflatable modules, but that\u0027s mostly difficulty-based.

Those produce uric acid when metabolized, and if you get too much of that in your blood it crystallizes out into your tissues and causes kidney stones and gout. Very unpleasant. Interestingly, humans and other great apes are one of the very few animals on Earth that lack a functioning gene for the enzyme that breaks down uric acid (we actually still have the gene, but it doesn\u0027t work).

They tested the effects of different light intensities, different light-path lengths (basically different depths of tank), different culture densities, and different levels of agitation (by having the CO2-enriched air bubbled through the reactor at an increased rate). The key to high production per mass is to have lots of algae in very little water, and the key for that turns out to be using very thin bioreactors. With that many suspended particles in the water, light can only penetrate a little way into the solution, so having a foot-deep pond or tank isn\u0027t very efficient in terms of production per volume of water. The unit used for light intensity was \u0022photon flux density\u0022 or PFD, the number of photons striking a square meter per second. At the highest light intensity with optimal photosynthetic efficiency (2000 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B5mol photons per m\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E per s, about the intensity of summer sunlight at noon on Earth\u0027s surface), using a 14mm thick flat reactor (two flat plates of glass 14mm apart) continuously illuminated on both sides, at the optimal-for-that-light-level culture density of ~20 grams of biomass per liter of culture, they reached a volumetric dry biomass production rate of \u003Cstrong\u003E21.6 grams per day per liter\u003C/strong\u003E.

At that rate, using the 85% edible fraction from above, you\u0027d need 1.25 square meters of reactor to provide food for one Kerbal, and the reactor itself is quite thin, although you\u0027ll need some extra space for the lights.

I\u0027ve been thinking about my ongoing development game plan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, I have in mind three greenhouse models, introduced at different points along the tech tree. The first of them, the \u0022Basic Greenhouse\u0022, I propose to introduce from a new node, call it \u0022\u0027Ponics\u0022 (not to be specific as to which), attached after Large Electrics, about the time stations are starting to be practical. It\u0027s the lower-efficiency (i.e., not closed-cycle) greenhouse for beginners.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELater on, at \u0022Advanced Science Tech\u0022 you get the actual \u0022CELSS Greenhouse\u0022, the one in which (with associated mass and power tradeoffs) enough of that Advanced Science Tech has been crammed into the thing to reduce its inefficiencies down into the statistical noise level and it will carry on supporting life indefinitely. (Which stretches plausibility a bit, I know, but for the sake of playability/convenience I am just assuming that the topping-up has been reduced to a level which can be ignored in the same way as all rest of the routine maintenance that our kerbonauts keep busy with when we\u0027re not watching.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd as a development alternative, either under \u0022Large Scale \u0027Ponics\u0022 attached after Very Heavy Rocketry or simply under Very Heavy Rocketry itself - although, really, you shouldn\u0027t get this without also getting \u0027Ponics, hence the suggestion of a dependent node - the \u0022Agricultural Greenhouse\u0022, which is similar to the Basic Greenhouse, but is much, much bigger (a tall 3.75m part or better yet an inflatable) for use on those stations that plan on growing more food than they need and resupplying other ships. Presumably in exchange for their CarbonDioxide, WasteWater and Waste, although I\u0027m also thinking about ways to get those from primary sources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, continuing, then, I did some thinking along these lines using ArcFurnace\u0027s numbers:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to avoid multiplying models too much, especially since I don\u0027t _have_ any more models, so while I might ideally like the Basic Greenhouse to be somewhat bulkier, let\u0027s say both it and the CELSS greenhouse are the 6x density version (the former just having a _really_ cramped layout. The Basic masses 9 tons. The CELSS can support two kerbals indefinitely due to all that Advanced Science Tech they crammed into it reducing its inefficiencies to statistical noise; the Basic runs at the same 90% efficiency as the TAC converters. (But it doesn\u0027t produce its wastage as Waste; we disappear it, assuming that the 10% lossage is outgassing, leakage, and as-yet-unrecyclable waste products dumped over the side.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tradeoff for using the CELSS, once you have it, is that with all that AST in there, it masses a bit more (call it, say, 11 tons) and has a higher basic power budget to run the automation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasic power budget is that 14.4 kW (call it 15 EC/s per Kerbal; 30.0 EC/s all-in); we\u0027ll go so far as to x1.5 it for the CELSS greenhouse to represent the cost of all its fancy automation, so 22 EC/s per, 44 EC/s all in. But that\u0027s just to run the pumps, etc. And that\u0027s also all you need to provide it with (a) with the shutters open, and (\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E in Kerbin orbit or sunwards of there. With the shutters closed or in the far outer system (past Jool, say - haven\u0027t run those numbers yet), you need to cough up up to another 79.2 kW (call it 79 EC/s per Kerbal; 158 EC/s all-in). In between, it has to be topped up proportionately. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s see. IIRC TAC uses 24-hour days right now, so that\u0027s: hm, yes. With both TAC converters running, you\u0027re paying 250 EC/day for 0.9 units each 277 EC for a Kerbal-day of Oxygen and Water. With the CELSS you\u0027re paying 1,900,800 EC for the same plus a Kerbal-day of food, so call it 1,267,200 EC/day equivalent.

As far as conversion efficiency is concerned, that depends first and foremost on the efficiency of your bioreactor (waste treatment), which I guess we assume is integrated into the greenhouse, much more than on the greenhouse itself. Basically the more toxic/resistant waste your bacteria/fungi/algae/whatever can decompose, the less \u0022leakage\u0022 your system has. Right now it is assumed that part of the human feces and all the things like used clothes and food packaging are non-recyclable in space, so they are assumed to be either stored indefinitely or airlocked, hence the mass conversion losses. If you could achieve 100% recycle-bility (probably by developing some heavily genetically modified organisms and having all of your kerbals use biodegradable materials whenever possible (toothpaste, clothes, etc.)), then efficiency of close to 100% for the whole system is not that difficult to imagine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are concerned about power consumption, you should definitely consider the spirulina option, ArcFurnace\u0027s calulations suggest it would be much more energy-efficient. If on the other hand you wanted some sort of a luxury option, one of the papers I linked (the Chinese one) discusses raising silkworms for food in space, and it seems reasonably efficient.

The Basic would have 90% efficiency and slowly run down, which is something you could cure by shipping in more Oxygen/Water/Food from outside, or by finding somehow some CarbonDioxide/WasteWater/Waste to add to the system.
