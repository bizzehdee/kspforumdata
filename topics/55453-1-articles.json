For larger rockets make sure your external stuts are placed in a strait line, as having even a little bit of offset to them can cause issues if there is any flex at all during assent.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-07T20:11:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe larger KW parts have issues, but they are easily solvable by \u0022stitch-strutting\u0022 with the heavier struts KW provides.

As a result the springs simulating the joints do not scale with part diameter (unless you use the KJR addon) and thus bigger parts wobble. It\u0027s just one of those programming relics that worked fine at the time but is outdated nowadays. But since it is rarely an issue unless you play with mods that add 3.75 or even 5m parts it isn\u0027t high on squads priority list.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
