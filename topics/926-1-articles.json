I know that it works. But I want to know more than that - WHAT exactly does it do?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have worked out that when you are in orbit, SAS keeps you pointing whichever way you\u0027re going, and that you have to switch it off to change your heading. But details. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei.e. Is it a rocket pack? A gyroscope? What? Does its position in the stack matter, and if so, what is best?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darrknox","CreatedById":2513,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-23T11:16:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe it stabilizes anything below itself.
