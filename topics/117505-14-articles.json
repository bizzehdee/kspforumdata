I turned the whole thing into a single part, down from the original 23 parts.\n\nThe Comms Tower you already know about.. a reduction of 34 parts.\n\nThe Hab gave me some trouble.. I was hoping to be able to lose another 20 or so parts by welding the underlying frame and the frame of the Solar Array, but even with the \u0027special\u0027 parts stripped off, those bits just would not weld correctly.. the part .cfg files were full of NaN, and they wouldn\u0027t display. However, I was able to turn the entire interior of the Hab into a single part, and rebuild the rest of the Hab around it, so that it looks and functions exactly the same as before, but instead of being 132 parts, its\u0027 now just 73 parts!\n\nAll told, those three items result in a combined reduction of 115 parts. ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\nThe part-reduced craft can be downloaded [**here**](https://app.box.com/s/4rk6rxlnwbqc7zrk07cpehqwe086xvc8).\n\nI would have done the debris from the Ares 3 Duna Ascent Vehicle as well, but I\u0027m having some trouble getting the welded parts re-attached to the core ship, so they can be dumped on the ground realistically.. if I can get that sorted out, it will result in another 40-45 less parts onsite.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E have you made the MAV yet?\n\nYes..
