I personally love the series. Darkest Hour is my favorite. Played a combined total of 1000 hours on all games, but I sure hope to be able to play more over the weekend. What about you. What\u0027s your favorite game, how long have you played?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CAKE99","CreatedById":150099,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-29T22:03:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve played 43 hours of HoI4, but I haven\u0027t played any other HoI games, I have a LP of HoI4 as the Soviet Union on my YouTube channel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
