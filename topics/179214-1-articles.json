I know of one youtuber who built\u00A0a cool fan boat, but his design required stage separating the propeller assembly and controlling it as a separate craft. I\u0027m looking for a way to propel an amphibious base on Eve\u0027s bodies of explodium, so jet engines are out of the question, and rockets would be extremely inefficient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lunardog15","CreatedById":192528,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-25T13:14:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nit is possible but the craft its self must rotate\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Not Sure","CreatedById":165210,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-25T16:16:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, sort of. It requires some very complex mechanics with claws and i hardly understand it, but I\u2019ve seen it done by one person.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut there is another way and\u00A0that requires a standard separate electric prop, but you can re connect it to the craft via a claw. I\u2019ve done something similar to this for a solar powered plane and it was not too hard. Beware about its reliability, they like to spontaneously explode. A bonus about it being able to re connect is being able to quicksave often.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-29T08:27:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve made stock propellers that work on Duna and Eve, in the atmosphere... but they don\u0027t work in the ocean (so much for an Eve submarine without mod parts). They seem to just create drag vectors in the water without any lift vector. The atmospheric forces should still be present though, maybe if I did two counter rotating ones, the water drag would cancel out and I\u0027d have very weak aerodynamic thrust...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.

You could undock from the front, fly around, then stop the prop and use air resistance (or put it in reverse on the ground) to have it slide back and dock at the back. (a quick save and load helped here as I sometimes had problems with the docking ports resetting).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also made a design with 2x structural fuselages instead of a fairing: \u003Cimg alt=\u0022gnqA2BE.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/gnqA2BE.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo try and improve its usability with physics warp (but mostly: nope, going over 2x physics warp still broke it).
