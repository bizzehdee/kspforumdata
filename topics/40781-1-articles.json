But KSP seems to be much more fun to play with. I tested the demo version and am about to buy this game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I have some questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to build an unmanned rocket to get a station up to the orbit for refueling. I watched some youtube videos and am amazed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I also want to build a reusable ship like the XR5 Vanguard (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.alteaaerospace.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ealteaaerospace\u003C/a\u003E) maybe with Vertical launch Rockets to get it up. But my question is: is this possible to build such large deltawings so that I can build an moon-ship (with refueling)? Also is it possible to attach \u0022hover\u0022-Engines to it so I can land like an aircraft (See this so you see what I mean:\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/5xMMDu9Z-fg?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E. \u003Cp\u003EThanks for your answers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scorpi15","CreatedById":34189,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T10:07:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAssuming you use mods, you could use PWings (Procedural Wings) for the delta wings.
