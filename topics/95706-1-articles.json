Just as one would expect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Skywhale is pretty durable and can withstand heavy inputs. However the Rotors generate more lift the faster the helicopter goes horizontally, making it less responsive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Guppy is just as responsive at just about any speed. It however has a rotor assembly built much lighter and as a result is also less reliable. Some heavy maneuvers with it can totally destroy the bearing and results in the rotors declaring independence.
