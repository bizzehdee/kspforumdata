Add approach guidance for the runway. Why not a Visual Approach Slope Indicator next to the runway. Maybe ILS guidance on the nav ball like mechjeb, I don\u0027t care. No autopilot needed, just something to show if you\u0027re on the glideslope. Most any absurdly long runway would have this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Give Kerbals the ability to track a survey target when on foot. Maybe a close up of a handheld tracker in the corner like a minimap, something unlocked by a facility or tech upgrade. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. If a survey target happens to be on the other side of the planet, the target needs to be visible without pointing the aircraft at the ground. Or if you\u0027re flying a VTOL to get a survey point in-between two mountains, that target needs to be visible at all times. For in atmosphere flying, we need a Horizontal Situation Indicator with targets listed on their true heading. Maybe apply this to rovers too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Drag devices for spaceplanes so they can actually slow down. Even if just the landing gear get a deployed drag value, that would be a vast improvement. Speedbrakes and flaps would help greatly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-06T06:45:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith #4, you could use parachutes for that purpose -- drogue chutes might be the best bet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zakhep","CreatedById":134448,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-06T08:52:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor #4 landing gear have breaks, you just have to hold B to activate them.

While stock would certainly be nice, there are 2 mods for this. One is called NavUtilities which adds a PAPI as a GUI.

Yep, agree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Without real aerodynamics, spoilers and flaps have no purpose. Wait until the next release and see what is coming. (or use FAR) The RealChute mod can be used to create actual Drag Chutes that deploy properly behind the plane and slow you down on the runway (not to be confused with drogue chutes which slow you down in the mid atmosphere, RealChutes does that too though).
