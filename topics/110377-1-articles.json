And to balance the profit of it the part can be big, heavy, power consuming (but for now it is not a big deal since the power consumption calculates only for the active vessel, but the same thing is happening with the lab itself..) or whatever I couldn\u0027t think of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am a programmer myself but now I have a big project for my job so I don\u0027t have enough time to study KSP API and develop and maintain a mod (but really would like to, the game is amazing and I have lots of ideas). I don\u0027t think that such mod could be hard to make but I don\u0027t know if it is possible to manage lab\u0027s data in code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if such mod already exists: please, let me now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TJ179","CreatedById":147898,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T09:39:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehey maybe you can use parts of this mod \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/222276-tarsier-space-technology\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/222276-tarsier-space-technology\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T17:07:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would love to hear your ideas.
