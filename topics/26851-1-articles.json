Instead of using wheels, they are essentially a wheel -- the rover rolls on it\u0027s outer surface by turning inertial control wheels inside itself. Neither of the two saw actual use -- Phobos 2 got lost, Hayabusa actually completed it\u0027s mission but lost the rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, today I set out to determine if the method works in KSP, because that would be just the thing to drop on Gilly or Bop. Turns out making a micro-rover like this from stock parts is not a problem. It rolls just fine even on Kerbin, as long as you don\u0027t make it heavier than about 0.25t. Just get it to fall on the side, hold down the roll button, and off it goes. Amusingly, while keeping the core on consumes power, rolling itself does not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most annoying problem was making it stop busting the solar panels against the ground -- while the panels look fine, after just a few touches they report as broken, so you can\u0027t exactly roll on them. Eventually, I ended up with this thing, which weighs 0.06t without a scientific payload, gets up to 1.5m/s on Kerbin, up to 2.6m/s on the Mun, and I suspect that with skillful rolling on Gilly, one could get it to escape velocity. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E You need to turn off clipping to squish the solar panels inside the cage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i40.tinypic.com/2m5194n.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222m5194n.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would probably work best by making a custom part for it -- the actual hoppers are way smaller and lighter than the smallest and lightest KSP parts, so it\u0027s kinda too far out of scale.
