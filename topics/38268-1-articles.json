The game is awesome, as are the people who created it. I\u0027ve never enjoyed epic failure so much \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut on my second successful (kind of) mission, my love for this game was solidified:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mission, code named Destiny, was a very ambitious one; Land a rover on Eve. This is even more ambitious because my only other successful mission was to launch a tiny probe into orbit around Kerbin. But eve looked awesome so I wanted to go there. After about 18 hours and three \u0022Destiny\u0027s\u0022 Destiny 4 took it\u0027s first test flight. It looked promising, but I knew it wouldn\u0027t have the fuel to make it to Eve. So I decided to land it on the Mun. Surprisingly this went really well in just two attempts the rover touched down unscathed. I was overjoyed just at the fact that I got a rover somewhere. I mean, this IS rocket science after all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately I landed on the dark side of the Mun though. So I sped up time until sunrise, and what a sunrise it was. I won\u0027t even try to describe it, better to see it for yourself: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/tKI2H\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/tKI2H\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn awesome mission, followed by an awesome Lunar eclipse.... I\u0027ll be playing this game for a while. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to actually check out the mission, and some fanboy banter between me and my friend you can click \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.twitch.tv/tdt_shadowclone/c/2619423\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHERE \u003C/a\u003Eto watch it. An I\u0027ll also be broadcasting a ton more Kerbal in the future, including my mission to Eve, which will happen at some point. So throw me a follow if you want \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
