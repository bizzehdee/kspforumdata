By the vessel splitting in two with a gap between the halves and one half chasing the other...\u00A0 it\u0027s a kind of diametric drive that is literally fueled by the last charge rate of acceleration that was NOT using the ship\u0027s scifi drive that nonetheless accelerated the ship for a length of time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne can even steer with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E while accelerating even though the halves are separated, since they are so attracted and repelled by each other that they keep alignment as if they were joined together when steering. To cut acceleration you just cut it off and the ship joins together again. In so doing you will save \u0027charge\u0027 until you decide to use it again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLimitations: You are locked in at your acceleration rate, so you want 4g to quickly get to orbit and escape earth\u0027s gravity, but the scifi drive cannot be throttled down so you would merely use it to get up to a certain coasting speed desired by the crew and then begin coasting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImplications: \u0027Fueling\u0027 these not-a-torchship-but-just-as-good vessels is relatively easy on a homeworld with magnetic vacuum acceleration tubes.

Of course a cheaper way of travelling can harvest more passengers, while a higher cost can discourage some passengers, either way it\u0027s not gonna be a great change.

The 2 Space shuttle accidents killed 14.

That means, one accident which causes penalty per 1.4MILLION departures, or a total success rate of (1,000,000-1.24)/1,000,000=99.9999876%. Each nine stands for decades of hard work, and thousands of lives that are lost in previous accidents, which warns us of safety, and pushes us into making new rules and coming up with new safety measures.(Data by Boeing.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022f12d6eb6f24a44479d4efc3a1079158c.jpeg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002281.11\u0022 height=\u0022876\u0022 width=\u00221080\u0022 src=\u0022https://5b0988e595225.cdn.sohucs.com/images/20190618/f12d6eb6f24a44479d4efc3a1079158c.jpeg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt takes a long time to make a new means of tranportation as safe as established ones.

How to stop a maglev from hitting the walls of the tube when its moving at 1km/s and out of control? Also a single accident will cause the entire facility to be out of service--breaks the tube and fills it with air. What about the train that leaves a few minutes after the one that suffers an accident? stop it. How will passengers come out of the tube? I don\u0027t know.

It would cost less to vacuum a smaller room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomeone once proposed an idea of line, starting from US west coast, passing Canada, across Bering Straight, passing east Siberia, passing Beijing to Shanghai. That\u0027s, (more or less a coincidence,) almost a \u0022large circle\u0022 on the Earth. So it only bends towards the ground, with little sideways bend. Of course it has to tunnel into some mountains.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPoint is... even passenger jets can\u0027t have all their seats filled on intercontinental flights, which is a major reason of abandoning further A380 production. Antonov 225 is gone, Airbus 380 won\u0027t be produced any more. We simply don\u0027t need such giant passenger jets. (although cargo jets can be useful)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor such a maglev, it would cost a lot to maintain its state of vacuum, whether you run it or not, because re-vacuuming it can cost even more. The total amount of passengers of intercontinental travel is more or less a fixed number. Of course a cheaper way of travelling can harvest more passengers, while a higher cost can discourage some passengers, either way it\u0027s not gonna be a great change. I doubt that this maglev is more costly than an airplane although it\u0027s faster. This makes it even harder to squeeze enough money out of it to make ends meet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso about safety. As of 2021, we have seen 146 launches (51 by the US and 55 by China), of which 92.5% are successful. 22 astronauts have lost their lives in accidents, and more casualties are recorded for ground crew. 1960 SS7 accident killed half of USSR missle experts. 1996 CZ-3B accident killed 8 and injured 57. The 2 Space shuttle accidents killed 14. Rockets simply aren\u0027t safe enough to be used by the lot of people--even if the cost is minimal.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn contrast: As of 1959-2016, Boeing 727 records an average of 1.24 hull losses per MILLION departures, and 0.73 hull losses that kills passengers/crew per MILLION departures. That means, one accident which causes penalty per 1.4MILLION departures, or a total success rate of (1,000,000-1.24)/1,000,000=99.9999876%. Each nine stands for decades of hard work, and thousands of lives that are lost in previous accidents, which warns us of safety, and pushes us into making new rules and coming up with new safety measures.(Data by Boeing.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://5b0988e595225.cdn.sohucs.com/images/20190618/f12d6eb6f24a44479d4efc3a1079158c.jpeg\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022f12d6eb6f24a44479d4efc3a1079158c.jpeg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 data-ratio=\u002281.11\u0022 height=\u0022876\u0022 width=\u00221080\u0022 src=\u0022https://5b0988e595225.cdn.sohucs.com/images/20190618/f12d6eb6f24a44479d4efc3a1079158c.jpeg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt takes a long time to make a new means of tranportation as safe as established ones. An accident on a vacuum maglev would possibly be as fatal as a rocket failure -- high speed, poor maneuverability, in vacuum. How to stop a maglev from hitting the walls of the tube when its moving at 1km/s and out of control? Also a single accident will cause the entire facility to be out of service--breaks the tube and fills it with air. What about the train that leaves a few minutes after the one that suffers an accident? stop it. How will passengers come out of the tube? I don\u0027t know.
