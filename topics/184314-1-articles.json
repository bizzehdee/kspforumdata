In other words, if I have a lander with relay antennae, and a rover with a tiny little whip antenna (or just an internal antenna) that can only talk to Kerbin by relaying through the lander, will the rover lose signal the moment a hill comes between it and the lander, or will it still have signal until it\u2019s far enough away that the curvature of the planet is in the way? Will a taller craft be able to communicate farther over the surface?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aeroboi","CreatedById":186653,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-07T19:11:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Geo ID.
