The atmosphere is so thin that the craft is still accelerating at this point while heading towards the periapsis, all while experiencing this excessive heating. If my craft survives, the heating doesn\u0027t really let up until the craft hits the lower atmosphere where it\u0027s thick enough to really start slowing down. This is with default heat settings.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this issue? I\u0027ve seen it both in stock and with FAR\u002BDRE.\n\nEdit: Apparently it\u0027s related to DRE, I just deleted FAR and DRE and it\u0027s much more sane now. Probably should have tried that again before posting:blush: (I thought when I had seen it before I was playing stock, apparently not).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-17T03:18:42Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2015 03:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lord Aurelius**"},{"CreatedByName":"Gerandar","CreatedById":136705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T03:08:15Z","Content":"I\u0027ve yet to notice this and I\u0027ve sent plenty of kerbals and probes to eve o.o"},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T03:19:26Z","Content":"I just went through and deleted FAR and DRE and the issue went away..."}]}
