I\u0027ve only been with them for a year, and already we\u0027ve done things that my high school has never done before. Getting main stage at ITF is something other thespians can only dream about, and we\u0027re doing it!\n\nMy drama teacher is also having me dabble in Speech and Debate. I recently did some work with a piece and sucked big time on it, so I\u0027m hoping to find some other stuff I can do a bit better. I\u0027m also considering writing a piece on the Apollo 1 fire.\n\nDoes anybody else here do any acting? ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T02:49:41Z","Content":"I\u0027ve done some voice acting for various productions over the years.
