My guess is that you are burning radially or in a anti/normal direction to the node. Are you sure the control element or the engine is pointing where you want it to?\n\nThird, no, TWR doesn\u0027t have anything to do with this. You\u0027ve already said that burning the engine changes the orbit, so thrust is produced, however small it might be (0.15 isn\u0027t such a bad TWR). Well, unless you set up a node with ridiculous amount of dV needed, then it would just take a long time to notice any difference.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-21T20:49:25Z\u0022 title=\u002203/21/2015 08:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Deutherius**\n  \nforum borked my post"},{"CreatedByName":"Francois424","CreatedById":98138,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T22:07:50Z","Content":"Also, if there are obstacles right behind the nozzle of your engine(s) thrust will not happen... Oh it will eat your fuel, but not give thrust.

I noticed I was in the wrong forum immediately, sorry, but I couldn\u0027t delete the thread and repost..\n\nI feel really dumb, I had attached a small upgrade (a kerbal engineer flightbox, on a structural girder section with a docking port) to one of the docking ports on the side. For some reason this set the docking port as the \u0027control from here\u0027 element... so yes I was burning 90 degrees from where I wanted to... doh! \n\nThank you all for your help!"}]}
