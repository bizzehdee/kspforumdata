My guess is that you are burning radially or in a anti/normal direction to the node. Are you sure the control element or the engine is pointing where you want it to?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird, no, TWR doesn\u0027t have anything to do with this. You\u0027ve already said that burning the engine changes the orbit, so thrust is produced, however small it might be (0.15 isn\u0027t such a bad TWR). Well, unless you set up a node with ridiculous amount of dV needed, then it would just take a long time to notice any difference.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-21T20:49:25Z\u0022 title=\u002203/21/2015 08:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Deutherius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eforum borked my post\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Francois424","CreatedById":98138,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T22:07:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if there are obstacles right behind the nozzle of your engine(s) thrust will not happen...
