(Movement to integrate the asteroid day mod into stock)","CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T19:19:59Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T19:19:59Z","Content":"This is the official thread for the Go Stock! movement, which is based around making the parts in the official DLC asteroid day mod stock!\n\nYou can download it here: **Asteroid Day**\n\nThis is the second Squad official mod, the first being a football/soccer mod.\n\nI don not think squad should release another hotfix with this mod included, but I think it should be included in 1.1.\n\nHere\u0027s my reasoning for why it should be stock:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Quote\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E True, but for beginning players, installing a mod is not super easy (I speak from experience here), and it isn\u0027t a very big mod, plus, as Hobbes Novakoff says, if it was stock, we could design and share craft with it more easily than if it was a mod.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Of course, you could also say that, if you never built planes, plane parts should be released as a official mod, but some people would still want to build planes without having to install a mod.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If this was more frivolous, like the soccer/football mod, then it makes sense to have it as a mod, after all, how often is someone going to use a soccer ball?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So, in my opinion, whether something should be a official mod, or stock, is how often a player would use the parts. I could imagine a lot of uses for all the parts, and the new antenna, telescope, and contract would add more variety to career mode, so I think they should be stock, plus: If someone doesn\u0027t like the new parts, and feels like they should only be a mod, they could remove the parts.\n\u003E \n\nHere\u0027s the official avatar:\n\n![MXZPyon.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/MXZPyon.png?1)\n\nTo show your support for this movement, you can put this code in your signatures:\n\n[noparse][![jbqhMGa.png](http://i.imgur.com/jbqhMGa.png)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127314-Go-Stock%21)[/noparse]\n\nTo get this:\n\n[![jbqhMGa.png](http://i.imgur.com/jbqhMGa.png)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127314-Go-Stock%21)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-05-23T16:22:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2021 04:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Snark**\n  \nLink to defunct website removed by moderator"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T19:28:16Z","Content":"What\u0027s the asteroid day mod?"},{"CreatedByName":"justidutch","CreatedById":99185,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T19:31:03Z","Content":"I fully support this movement, but the curvy \u0027K\u0027 in the image\u0027s font bothers me so I won\u0027t add it to my signature."},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T19:31:32Z","Content":"Asteroid day mod?
