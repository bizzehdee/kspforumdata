Yes, I was too confident. As teaching me the basics of modding clearly is not up to the community, I came here with my WIP parts! I\u0060m gonna learn so much things here enough to making me a skilled modder. (hopefully?)\n\nIt seems obvious that I have to learn first and then do things, but English is not my mother tongue, so that kind of top-down solution is really painful. Instead I\u0060m trying bottom-up solution, making a small steps by my own, and figure out what kind of walls are blocking my way, and then study to find my answer.\n\nHere\u0060s my WIPs:\n\n**#1.** Initial trying to make 4m DCSS directly out of [Aerojet Kerbodyne](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76170-0-23-5-Aerojet-Kerodyne-%28Service-Module-NASA-Extension%29?p=1084610#post1084610) mod with CFG modification\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/ERGZawtfDLQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**#2.** First trying to make a my own part: 4m-3m adapter which is used in 4m DCSS\n\n![449MS2N.png](http://imgur.com/449MS2N.png)\n\n(Wow, it\u0060s too big! Can\u0060t I modify the html tags directly?)\n\n**#3.** Initial checking out whether it looks fine or not in Blender.\n\n![DCfXdNa.png](http://i.imgur.com/DCfXdNa.png)\n\nLooks fine, huh?\n\n**#4.** After 4 weekends of work...(2015.06.21.)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/n3ET1N9gDAs?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nTo be done:\n\n1. Making a model of MRM-106D, which is a hydrazine RCS jet used in DCSS. Blackheart612 gave me his awesome model!\n\n2. Making some Payload Attach Fittings as described in Delta IV Payload Planner\u0027s Guide. successfully done!\n\n2.1 Making some Payload Adapter as described on Delta IV Payload Planner\u0027s Guide - 50% done\n\n3. Implementing RealPlume onto my ones.\n\n4. Texturing!\n\nMaybe:\n\n1. 8m EUS which looks very similar to 5m DCSS.\n\n2. Other Cryogenic Upper Stages.\n\n3. Entire Delta IV rocket, include CBC.\n\nCredit to Blackheart:\n\n![quote_icon.png](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/misc/quote_icon.png) Originally Posted by **blackheart612** [![viewpost-right.png](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/buttons/viewpost-right.png)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php?p=1972869#post1972869)\n\n*I do not allow any kind of modification and redistribution unless I give the go ahead.

Well, I\u0027m only working at weekends, and I\u0027m so much a noob, so I\u0027ll be very appreciate every help you might give. And I consider this mod only for Realism Overhaul, so I have to rewrite cfg whatever those parts have, so whether it works well or not doesn\u0027t matter. Frankly, your models are great in detail, so I hope to get yours!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-10T03:51:53Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2015 03:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FennexFox**"},{"CreatedByName":"blackheart612","CreatedById":42741,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T03:04:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Frankly, your models are great in detail, so I hope to get yours!\n\nI started with little details, it just went like that ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nKindly check if these are the right files:\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/v8bs56wexepr872/MDM106.zip?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/v8bs56wexepr872/MDM106.zip?dl=0)"},{"CreatedByName":"FennexFox","CreatedById":111279,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T15:42:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I started with little details, it just went like that ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\u003E Kindly check if these are the right files:\n\u003E \n\u003E [https://www.dropbox.com/s/v8bs56wexepr872/MDM106.zip?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/v8bs56wexepr872/MDM106.zip?dl=0)\n\nSorry for delaying! I was too busy last few days. Checked your models, and they are fantastic as always! Since I can\u0027t run unity and ksp until weekends, I could only check the models themselves, but it seems prefect. Always thanks to your help and generosity!"},{"CreatedByName":"blackheart612","CreatedById":42741,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T17:17:36Z","Content":"It\u0027s your mod, take your time, that\u0027s about what I can give.

I\u0027ll do that next weekend.\n\nProblems: I didn\u0027t touched anything about textures but they are gone!\n\nThings to Learn 1: How to make engine-faring things with Unity? I mean, the parts not visible unless they\u0027re attached to something.\n\nThings to Learn 2: I made low-poly colliders for my models, and unchecked the \u0022mesh renderer\u0022 setting in Unity, but it\u0027s still shown in-game. How could I make it invisivle?\n\nTo be done: initail cfg making, node editing, and some more research to make it\u0027s parameters more realistic.\n\nI found that node editing is a real pain in the ass. It really takes much time to make a properly sited node...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-14T02:54:16Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2015 02:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FennexFox**"}]}
