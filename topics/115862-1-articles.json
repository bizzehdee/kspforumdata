It shouldn\u0027t be reclassified because romantic notions cannot overrule scientific fact and proven falsehood. Also, what kind of mess would the classification system be if any planet were classified according to fact AND romanticised indulgencies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am only sad that a representation of the solar system counts 8 planets and stops at Neptune because i am so used to there being a lonely and out of place ....ty little rock at the end of the list. Put a big asterisk next to it, refer to it by an insulting or silly classification, i don\u0027t care just put it back on the list.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe no longer draw silly mermaids, giant squids or Lovecraftian monsters on maps of oceans and we certainly shouldn\u0027t but at the same time we killed off a little bit of romance and made the style way to factual and boring. We can\u0027t will ourselves to believe the Earth is flat nor should we make any special dispensation for the fact we believed it to be flat for so long and for the same reason we cannot include Pluto among the planets when it became obvious it doesn\u0027t meet the requirements of actually being one. But it has been at the tail end of every model of the solar system before it was demoted and there is no scientific, statistical, encyclopedic or whatever-elsic reason it cannot still occupy it\u0027s place especially since other small person planets are also included.
