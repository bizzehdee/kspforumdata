The Kerbals are plants as well, except they evolved to live not only on photosynthesis but also to get nutrition from other plants...basically, Kerbals are the top of food chain on Kerbin.

Terran equivalent - the orang-utan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuffas. Distant evolutionary cousin to the kerbals. Somewhere in their history, a homeobox mutation gave them a doubled pelvis (two normal pelvises fused together) complete with two pairs of legs. They\u0027re rather ungainly creatures but their extra legs make them well suited to wading around the rougher coastal waters of Kerbin. They have basically kerbal shaped heads, only smaller and with much longer necks. Terran equivalent - none.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKaya.

Terran equivalent - the yak.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGronnek. Small, swift and vicious burrow dwelling predators of northern Kerbin. When trained, they make excellent hunting animals, but even in this day and age it takes a brave kerbal to do the training. Traditionally captured by placing a large canvas bag over one entrance to their burrow, and setting off some sort of commotion at the other entrance. This does tend to make the gronnek even less amiable than usual, hence the kerbal expression \u0027letting the gronnek out of the bag\u0027 has a (rough) Terran analogue involving fans and faecal matter.
