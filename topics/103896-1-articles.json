And both of them are in how jet engines are built in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is about the simplest jet engine nacelle one can build:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v119/pincushionman/ksp/jets/stockengine_zpsw657rlh7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022stockengine_zpsw657rlh7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the shock cone intake (the heaviest intake), a full Jet Fuel Fuselage, and a Basic Jet engine (the lightest engine). Notice how far aft the center of mass of this nacelle is, even when the tank is full. It moves even further aft, obviously, as fuel is drained. Engines are the heaviest single component on KSP jets, and this is not dissimilar to the real world. But because the mass is concentrated in the \u0022engine\u0022 component here, this causes problems - the weight of the entire aircraft is unrealistically shifted aft. In the real world, the center of mass of such a nacelle would be close to the center of this assembly, regardless of fuel load.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we all know, aircraft are very sensitive to the fore-aft location of the center of gravity relative to the center of lift on the main wing. As a result, it is far easier to build canard-style aircraft (main wing behind the horizontal stabilizer) than it is to make traditional aircraft, with the main wing ahead of the horizontal stabilizer. If it\u0027s a single-engine plane, the jet must be at the very tail end, and there are no good massive components to move the center of mass ahead of the main wing, resulting in planes where the main wing is at the back. If it\u0027s a double-engined plane with the engines on the main wing, the engine weight \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E still be aft of the main wing\u0027s center of lift. We still have the limitation of no good massive components to move the CoM forward, so we still end up with planes with wings at the back. I\u0027ve \u003Cem\u003Eseen\u003C/em\u003E pictures of airplanes that fight this tendency to a greater or lesser degree (usually large ones), but I\u0027ve yet to come up with a satisfactory solution myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, we have no propellers. All we have at our disposal are high-power jets. Which may be fine for always making spaceplanes, but for actual aircraft to explore Kerbin, it\u0027s a real constraint.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESo I propose a new paradigm for designing and building aircraft.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now, you need three components for your jet: (1) engines, (2) fuel tanks, and (3) air intakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my proposed system, you instead need (1) engine cores, (2) fuel tanks, (3) outputs, and (4) air intakes. This is a little more complicated, but may or may not require any extra parts, as I discuss below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEngine cores:\u003C/strong\u003E This is the component that engines are built around. They take \u003Cstrong\u003ELiquidFuel\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003EIntakeAir\u003C/strong\u003E, and produce a resource called \u003Cstrong\u003EEnginePower\u003C/strong\u003E. \u003Cem\u003EThese\u003C/em\u003E are now the heaviest components (usually) in the engine chain, but since they\u0027re in the center of the engine chain instead of the business end, we now have much greater flexibility in fore-aft placement, resulting in greater control of our aircraft designs. These usually look no fancier than the fuel tank in the picture. \u003Cstrong\u003EThey may or may not also contain fuel\u003C/strong\u003E, depending on model.

Unless they\u0027re a new set of parts, making the existing ones (somewhat) redundant. But I think the flexibility we\u0027d gain in terms of fore-aft placement of engines would be a huge step forward for the flexibility or our airplane designs. Having an integrated tank/piston engine and an integrated propeller/intake early in the tech tree might make it easier for players to design small starter planes early on in Career for survey contracts while limited to the bumpy, crappy Tier 1 runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPick apart!

And certain constraints like a turbofan intake has to be attached to the core - it can look like a turbofan all it likes but all it actually is is an intake and a modifier. I only really added seperate outputs because then you can easily model turboshafts. Things like afterburners would be an optional module for a standard tailpipe rather than a seperate device.

And certain constraints like a turbofan intake has to be attached to the core - it can look like a turbofan all it likes but all it actually is is an intake and a modifier. I only really added seperate outputs because then you can easily model turboshafts. Things like afterburners would be an optional module for a standard tailpipe rather than a seperate device. The other advantage of separating out parts like that is it\u0027s easily installed in a tech tree.\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest difference I had to yours was my engine cores didn\u0027t produce anything at all - all they do are provide either modifiers or base stats and are parts which take up the sort of space a turbine would actually take up. You need all three parts of an engine installed in the craft to make it work, but the actual computation of work is done by the output device which effectively makes it the part. Given all we actually need is output, how it goes about that doesn\u0027t have to flow like an actual turbine. If you want to model a spool that is just an internal number to the core which tweaks it\u0027s modifier a little rather than going all the way through the resource system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggested having the core create a virtual resource for a few reasons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne, it seems an obvious way to force the user to insert a core into the assembly. With a null part, it would be just a flag \u0022does a core exist?\u0022 which may be opaque to the user. All other useful components list the type of resource they require and the rate they need it; if the part lists EnginePower, the user should be able to assume that they need a component that provides that resource. Without it, it may not be obvious that a core component is needed, or what it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo, it acts as a way to differentiate between various engine cores of various capability. A piston core would produce power at a certain efficiency and effectiveness, and a jet could have different performance curves; a RAPIER core could switch from air-breathing to LO use. All with the same nozzle output. That way you could let the outputs handle what effects you get (thrust only, or add reverse thrust, add vector thrust, etc.). You\u0027d get more flexibility by mixing and matching, while keeping the number of parts to track more reasonable (you don\u0027t need to compare between ten different nozzles for efficiency and features; you only need three or four based on features).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThree, it allows more flexible setups. Need more engine power? Add cores. This would make a lot more sense for piston cores than jets - a twelve-cyclinder engine is three fours stacked in series. An afterburner would essentially be a turbojet core with another core attached that\u0027s staged later or toggled via action groups. You could also run power from a single core to multiple outputs - with null parts it\u0027s not clear whether that would be or should be allowed (based on how the flags are checked), but a virtual resource would simply be split between all the outputs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yeah, ramjets wold be pretty awkward under such a system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, you said you\u0027ve \u0022worked something out\u0022 similar to this - did you intend to make a mod to implement this behavior?

And that was after spending 25 hours a day toiling in the factories for tuppence a month and having to sleep in a hole in the ground on a bed of broken glass for five minutes (I know, utter luxury!) before being woken up and having a bowl of gravel for breakfast (and not that delicious premium gravel, but that disgusting bitter expired gravel that was rejected from the gravel factory) before having to go back to work!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat aside, no offence to the OP (who put some reasonable though into the suggestion, which in turn made me seriously consider it before rejecting it), I\u0027m simply not really vibing with this suggestion because the end result is exactly the same as it is now. Game design-wise we put tanks on a rocket then an engine, and jet engines follow the same game principle, but with the added complexity of adding inlets (yes, I went there and wrote inlet instead of intake! Jets are aircraft, not vacuum cleaners!) and little else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fact is that the rationalizations aren\u0027t particularly compelling, and I honestly don\u0027t see it being a must have in the stock game.

IntakeAtm is a resource defined in the community resource pack which a bunch of things use, or you can do it yourself, which you can set the intake module up to gather from atmospheres; you could call it \u0022InertAtmosphere\u0022 if you want, the name isn\u0027t important. You could make it sufficiently overpowered to run jets on but more sensibly it\u0027s a quite practical way of running already existing piston engines, like the RetroFuture ones.

Currently they\u0027re even smaller than most rocket nozzles which is just silly.
