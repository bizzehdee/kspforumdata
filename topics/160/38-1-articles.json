It seems the bots are capable of going through the captcha at the registration page...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027ve set up a required verification for first posts. If you\u0027re posting for the first time, you\u0027ll see a captcha box (those \u0027type the letter in the image above\u0027 things) before you post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis only happens for first-time posts though. If you\u0027re deemed human you can keep on posting normally after that. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just wanted to let everyone know about this. I reckon very aggressive anti-spam measures can make a forum seem unwelcoming, and that\u0027s the last thing we want to do. So I hope a simple captcha on your first post (and only on the first post) is a reasonable compromise. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"C3PO","CreatedById":12,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-05T12:01:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExcellent!!
