We had made some changes to the forum security and all users who have a weak password have to change it. If your password is strong enough (combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and special characters), it is not necessary.\n\nDon\\\u0027t worry! Nothing happened and no one\\\u0027s personal information is vulnerable. This is only for security reasons, hehe.\n\nCheers ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
