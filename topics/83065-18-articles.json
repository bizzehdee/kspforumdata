Considering the F-15 has two engines capable of 67.9 kN dry, 105.7 kN wet each, and they almost never take off with full AB (why would you? It burns fuel like mad), that should result in (for the heaviest numbers there, 27.2 t mass) that the plane should reach rotation speed (66.8 m/s) in 13.38 s dry, 8.59 s wet after starting its run (having covered 446.9 m and 286.9 m, respectively), before lifting off at 92.3 m/s approximately 18.49 s dry, 11.87 s wet (covering 853.3 m and 547.8 m, respectively).

Any kid who has built a few Estes rockets would know that tying a few coke cans together with an engine in the middle is a recipe for a tumbling mess.

The OP was intentionally painting this as a \u0022total realism\u0022 thing (which it is not, and never has been actually about), and in part of attacking that very wrong premise, one rationale was that as an edu tool (stated by Squad), it should at least get the under the hood physics right.
