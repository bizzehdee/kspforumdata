I too was so against not having resources taken out of future updates (although I never posted about my frustration) as I thought that would add a new depth of difficulty. The release of .23 has opened my eyes though. The new challenges that are imposed to players doing career are so much heavier than they were with .22, which I love. I was able to max out the tech tree in under 10 flights before with transmission spamming. Now I am on around flight 20 and still looking for more science from the mun and minmus to finally get an interplanetary vessel going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think (and I am speculating) is that most peoples frustrations were that career in .22 was too easy and seasoned veterans of the game could max out the tree in a few flights. Granted new players would still have a challenge but old players felt left behind. Resources seemed to be the way to fill this gap of challenge. People that knew how to get massive payloads into orbit, mastered the art of docking, and interplanetary transfers, really had nothing to look forward to. Adding resources would have added the challenge of getting even bigger and more complex things to other moons and planetary bodies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the release of .23 I am amazed at how much more difficult it is. And yes I am happy about it. I am not able to unlock 10 different tech trees after 1 flight now due to transmission spamming. Instead I am forced to go back to different bodies multiple times to gather the science needed to get the parts I need to unlock for my future plans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am no expert player but here is a good example. Tonight I thought, well I have a good portion of the tree opened up. Let me try for a Duna mission. I wanted to get a mothership (transfer vessel) and a lander into orbit. I\u0027m not going to go into detail but in the end I just had too much weight I was trying to push up into orbit and failed for a few hours. I never ran into this wall in the past and went back to the drawing board and decided on more mun and minmus landings to get more science to provide me with the parts for interplanetary missions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, a lot of you are probably wondering what I\u0027m getting at and here it is. Resources would be nice and I would love them. If they are \u0022shelved\u0022 ok cool, that\u0027s what the devs wanted. There are at least 2 groups from what I saw in the add on development chat that are working on what sound like incredibly insane mods to fill that gap for all that want it. If resources are what you want give the good people that make the mods time to come up with something that surpasses kethane (One of the best mods I\u0027ve seen so far). In the mean time enjoy the insainly good way that the devs have come up with this new update. They have added more difficulty without making the game harder for new players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn another note the devs did an awesome job with optimization. I used to CTD every time I reverted a flight with 150\u002B parts back to VAB or launch. In the past 2 days I haven\u0027t had a single CTD with even bigger ships (been trying to push the limit.) Only mod I run is kethane and for a while I couldn\u0027t even play with that. Now its not an issue at all. I do see a memory leak though. I can start the game and I check my memory resources used and I am at about 50%. As my flights come and go that number slowly rises. Even after I have ended a flight and removed ALL debris I check again that number does not change, only goes higher as I keep playing. Basically if I play long enough my game will eventually crash, yet I have not hit that point yet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne last thing you all that are still upset about the \u0022shelving\u0022 of resources have to remember is this. This was a dream made up by developers when they were small children with bottle rockets and I would guess army men. They pursued their dream and are now making it a reality. We saw this dream and all thought, wow that is really F\u0027ing cool. That\u0027s why you bought the game, because you wanted to be able to play a part of their vision. It is THIER vision though. They are the ones that need to decide where it goes because it was theirs to begin with. They can do with it as they please. Remind you I was one very upset about the resources thing but have moved on after playing this new version and seeing mods are going to hopefully add in that new element. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, remember, I cant think of anytime that Squad has let us down. Every update has been a blessing and everything keeps getting better.
