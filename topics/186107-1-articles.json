Most add on parts are fairly modular, but even with ship mods, unless your doing a replica, you can\u0027t really just stick stuff on top of it. Even with tops of free space.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI mention this, because there aren\u0027t really any i like. I was blasting along in my little makeshift catamaran with a huge KSPi reactor bushing a huge ship to massive speeds. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E I feel like it needs a better modular parts set. I was considering doing (a very simple) one myself in kinda a generic Kerbal scalable look, something that works as a small yacht and is scalable to a ship large enough to land on. Dosen\u0027t really feel like it would fit KSP though.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThoughts?
