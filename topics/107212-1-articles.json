A lot of different opinions and preferences have been expressed recently over the 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2 aero issues).\n\nI have read on a few occasions that one of the limitations is due to the size of the planets being quite small, so and as the atmospheres are in scale (more or less) they too are very thin (in height not soupiness).\n\nGiven that making the planets themselves bigger would probably not be am option would making the atmospheres reach higher altitudes offer the opportunity to achieve a similar effect? \n\nIf they were higher by say 50% kerbin\u0027s would be about 105 km high. Orbital speeds would change and there would be half as much again to fall through giving more time for heat to take effect. Also if the density at sea level stayed as is then the change in density with altitude would be more gradual.\n\nWhat do you think? Is my thinking viable? Would it work? What have I not thought about?"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T20:03:55Z","Content":"The atmosphere is already quite a bit thicker than in .90.

It should actually dissipate rather than just suddenly drop off."}]}
