I\u0027ve had this happen multiple times now and can\u0027t seem to figure out what the issue is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m flying a ship I built with a mk3 Command Module, which I then dock with a mk1 Lander Can (both go up in the same vessel)\u00A0and take that into orbit of the Mun. Once there I transfer a Kerbal over to the lander, disconnect and then land on the surface of Mun. I do my thing there and then head back into orbit to dock with the CM. On approach I can see the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thruster cloud from the CM thrusters, but when I switch to control the CM, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters are not on and turning them on and off again doesn\u0027t do anything. After connecting the two craft I transfer my Kerbal back to the CM and make my return to Kerbin. All the while it looks like the CM\u0027s thrusters and firing but everything says they are not. Once I make my return and splash down I cannot recover the vessel, nor can I go to the science center or save or anything. I can only reload from my latest save.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen reloading from the \u0022Persistent\u0022 save, I reload when the lander is returning to orbit from Mun, but the CM is now nowhere to be seen and the two Kerbals from the CM are in a pop up right when I load in saying they completed their trip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help anyone can give would be greatly appreciated. I would hate to have\u00A0 this occur every time I go to land on another planet or moon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-04T18:57:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are using KSP version 1.11.x, this sounds very much like a bug that appeared in version 1.11.0 (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/27025\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elink\u003C/a\u003E)\u00A0 Often, when players find\u00A0a work-around\u00A0to avoid a bug, we post them on that bug-tracker ---\u00A0but so far no solutions posted for that bug.\u00A0 \u00A0It \u003Cem\u003Eseems \u003C/em\u003Elike only a small number have people have noticed it, so hopefully the conditions to hit that bug are rare.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(You might already know, many players move their KSP installation so that the new version goes in a separate directory, avoiding overwriting the version we have been playing.\u00A0Then when a new version comes out we can try it out, but if there is anything we don\u0027t like we can stick with the previous version.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
