New user just getting into KSP!! Could just use a bit of help to find the best graphics settings to balance between it looking at least ok but still being playable relatively smoothly on my iMac - and some of the graphics options I don\u0027t fully understand what they mean! I\u0027m playing on an iMac as mentioned and my system information is as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMac OS X 10.7.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.4 GHz Intel COre 2 Duo\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 GB SDRAM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EATI Radeon HD 2600 Pro 256 MB\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1920x1200 display\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help on what settings I should be using would be great! Thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rainbowtrout","CreatedById":60253,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-20T17:59:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t help much with your question as I barely use iMacs. But 4GB of RAM is fairly good.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-20T18:58:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe big setting you have to worry about is the delta physics slider. Keep that all the way to the right on .03 and the rest doesn\u0027t matter much. You have a weak gpu so you may want to avoid anti-aliasing and other particle effects.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DaRocketCat","CreatedById":32377,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-20T19:06:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, lower anti-aliasing to x2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso set terrain detail to fastest, and turn off terrain scatters.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Luke1987","CreatedById":75089,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T10:15:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry for that late reply - but that physics slider worked a treat!!
