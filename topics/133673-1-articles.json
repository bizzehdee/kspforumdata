It should give some insight into the daily life of our favourite people who make KSP. It sounds like this guy was not working for a company as nice as Squad but some elements resonate, like the demands from users to fix bugs and provide more features.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022At my studio you needed to have the \u201Cpassion\u201D for a project to work six days a week, or put in 16-hour days. This is very much prevalent in the game industry and is seen as pulling out all the stops for your love of the project. Of course, this places exceptional stress on your quality of life and family time. I have gone through really tough periods at home, when it feels like there\u2019s enormous pressure to put work first. Management will always talk about having a healthy work-life balance but the implication is there that you could be doing more, fixing more bugs, taking on more work. I\u2019ve had blazing rows with my wife about the amount of time I was spending at work rather than with my children \u2013 but feeling like your effort is constantly being judged means you end up doing it again and again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe ends up working programming in the financial sector, sorry to ruin the end.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RizzoTheRat","CreatedById":123362,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-07T14:00:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be fair, I think he\u0027s just described working in any project based industry for the wrong company.\u00A0 Sounds like the work is interesting but the company don\u0027t value the employees.\u00A0 A different employer in the same industry, and maybe even a different department in the same company,\u00A0could be a completely different story.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pxi","CreatedById":78711,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-07T16:34:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://ea-spouse.livejournal.com/274.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ea-spouse.livejournal.com/274.html\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/97391-Rockstar-Wives-Complain-About-Working-Conditions\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/97391-Rockstar-Wives-Complain-About-Working-Conditions\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBad working conditions seem to be extremely common in the games industry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-07T20:42:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthis is why i retired early and became a bum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-07T20:49:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222446179\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022133673\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221457368443\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002278711\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pxi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, pxi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBad working conditions seem to be extremely common in the games industry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBad working conditions are the norm, unfortunately.
