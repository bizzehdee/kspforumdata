It is possible to meet the goals of several proficiency ratings in a single mission. Keep track of your proficiency progress on your own, and as you meet all goals, reward yourself with a new forum badge! \n\nAs a general rule, STS Astronauts are those who can fly the STS Space Shuttle (or any stock variant). Mission Specialists are those who can get stuff to orbit. Pilots are those who can get stuff to orbit and land at KSC. Commanders are those who can get stuff to orbit, land at KSC, and survive emergencies. Legends are those who earn their place in the Academy Hall of Fame forever until someone else unseats them. Which astronaut are you?\n\n**Mission:** **STS Space Shuttle Maiden Flight**\n\n![F2Shi35m.png](http://i.imgur.com/F2Shi35m.png)\n\nDescription: The Kerbal Space Program administration team wants you and your crew to fly the maiden launch of the STS Space Shuttle, and hopefully make it back alive.\n\n![fagZP7S.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/fagZP7S.jpg)\n\nSTS Space Shuttle Astronaut\n\nTo earn this badge and get listed in the Astronaut corps:\n\n-Fly an STS Space Shuttle at least once above 70km \n\n-Post in this thread your space shuttle name and a screenshot. \n\nThen feel free to wear this, and/or others you earn below proudly in your forum signature.\n\n![JfuP7ZU.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/JfuP7ZU.jpg)\n\nMission Specialist Qualification\n\n-Orbit above 70km.\n\n-Make two complete orbits.\n\n![Rvs3vgQ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Rvs3vgQ.jpg)\n\nPilot Qualification\n\n- Complete a roll program between launch and 10km or your gravity turn, whichever comes first. (Your tail must face the ocean for most of your launch)\n\n- Complete another roll program before jettisoning your External Tank. (by 50km is a good time to do this)\n\n- Achieve a circularized orbit greater than 120km over Kerbin. (Pe and Ap must be within 100m of each other)\n\n- Land the Space Shuttle intact on Kerbin.\n\n![sE1QW9Q.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/sE1QW9Q.jpg)\n\nCommander Qualification\n\n- Achieve a circularized orbit greater than 200km over Kerbin (Pe and Ap must be within 100m of each other)\n\n- Land at KSC Runway or KSC Island (Bad weather is reported at KSC with wind shears capable of harming your shuttle wings. Try landing at KSCI to avoid a .90 wing collision bug, though its not required)\n\n**Mission:** **STS Fuel Pod Deployment** - Hall of Fame Mission\n\n![5q89yLDm.png](http://i.imgur.com/5q89yLDm.png)\n\nDescription: KSP mission planners require a fuel pod to be delivered into orbit for future missions. KSP weather forecasters warn of bad weather at KSC and recommend an alternate landing site to avoid wing damage (a bug in .90), but they leave that decision up to you.\n\n![Gm9RLVR.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Gm9RLVR.jpg)\n\nMission Specialist I:\n\n- Deploy the STS Fuel Pod into orbit above 70km.\n\n- All crew must survive returning to Kerbin. Crash landings are acceptable.\n\n![EynVoXa.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/EynVoXa.jpg)\n\nPilot I:\n\n- All Pilot Qualification goals must be achieved on your attempt.\n\n- Deploy the STS Fuel Pod into a circularized orbit above 200km. (Pe and Ap of STS Fuel Pod must be within 100m of each other)\n\n- You may not use any of the STS Fuel Pod liquid fuel.\n\n- You may only use 5 units of STS Fuel Pod monopropellant to extract the pod from the cargo bay, and fine tune the orbit.\n\n- You must not alter the STS Space Shuttle or STS Fuel Pod in anyway, except to adjust fuel amounts pre-launch (I suggest filling up all tanks).\n\n- You must land the shuttle back at KSC or KSC Island to qualify for having your attempt ranked in the Hall of Fame.\n\n![WUvoQpP.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/WUvoQpP.jpg)\n\nCommander I:\n\n- All Pilot I goals are included in this rating attempt.\n\n- You must complete a separate RTLS (Return to Launch Site) abort mission: At least 1m 30s into the flight while during your gravity turn above 10km and over the water, prematurely eject the boosters. Then attempt to make it back to KSC without ditching your cargo. You may of course use the fuel in your attached External Tank, and even the STS Fuel Pod in an attempt to dump some of the weight. KSC doesn\u0027t care how much fuel you burn up as they just want the STS Fuel Pod, the Shuttle, and your bodies all back in once piece. Land at either KSC runway or KSC Island.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/XGgfg3z1m_4?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n.\n- Relaunch and deploy the STS Fuel Pod into a circularized orbit above 300km.

Crew survival is required. Crash landings are ok.\n\n![kNqUcoq.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/kNqUcoq.jpg)\n\nPilot II\n\n- Pilot I is required before attempting.\n\n- Simulate an ATO per the Mission Specialist II goals above. This can be done in a separate mission or during the same mission.\n\n- All Pilot Qualification goals are required during your attempt.\n\n- Rendezvous and dock with your deployed STS Fuel Pod (you may refuel as necessary)\n\n- Return to KSC or KSC Island.\n\n![neSFTQk.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/neSFTQk.jpg)\n\nCommander II\n\n- Commander I is required before attempting.\n\n- Simulate an ATO per the Mission Specialist II goals above. This can be done in a separate mission or during the same mission.\n\n- Rendezvous with the STS Fuel Pod and stow it in your cargo bay. You may modify the cargo bay anyways you wish for this mission. (I recommend using 2 Sr. docking ports at either end of the bay)\n\n- Return the the Space Shuttle with STS Fuel Pod in the cargo bay, to KSC or KSC Island. You may use the STS Fuel Pod fuel to burn it off or use it for your flight home to make the shuttle easier to land.\n\n**Mission:** **STS ComSat Deployment \u0026 Servicing**\n\n![yhHSXS0m.png](http://i.imgur.com/yhHSXS0m.png)\n\nDescription: KSP has received the first commercial contracts willing to pay the premium for hands-on Kerbal deployment of their cargo into orbit which the STS (Space Transportation System) offers. Launch the SBS and Anik ComSats into orbit! Be wary, installing the cargo into your space shuttle will require you to adjust and plan your staging accordingly. Each satellite is deployed via a decoupler which trigger sepatrons to spin stabilize the sats. After they clear the orbiter, their PAM (Payload Assist Module) fires them into orbit while spinning, (you manually kill the rotation after you achieve the target apoapsis), and decouples from the satellite.\n\n![hEV3RTD.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/hEV3RTD.jpg)\n\nMission Specialist III\n\n- Mission Specialist II is required before attempting.\n\n- Deploy both STS ComSats into orbit at any altitude and inclination of your choice. Satellite spin launch is not required.\n\n- Decouple the PAMs from the satellites to let them orbit freely.\n\n- Land intact anywhere on Kerbin. Shuttle must not be damaged (KSC bug excepted).\n\n![YaW2NZ8.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/YaW2NZ8.jpg)\n\nPilot III\n\n- Pilot II is required before attempting.\n\n- All Pilot Qualification goals are required during your attempt.\n\n- Deploy both STS ComSats from the orbiter using spin stabilization\n\n- Use the PAMs to have the satellites reach Kerbin synchronous orbit on opposite sides of Kerbin from each other.\n\n- Decouple the PAMs.\n\n- Land at KSC or KSC Island (KSC Island preferably) or else a previously marked (with a flag) alternate landing site.\n\n![yCCnUU7.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/yCCnUU7.jpg)\n\nCommander III\n\n- The Service Module subassembly is required to be installed in the orbiter cargo bay prior to launch (along with KIS, KAS, IR, and Tweakscale mods), in addition to the STS ComSat subassembly in order to complete this rating.\n\n- Commander II is required before attempting.\n\n- All Pilot Qualification goals are required during your attempt.\n\n- Deploy one STS ComSat from the orbiter using spin stabilization\n\n- Use the PAM to deploy one successful satellite to Kerbin synchronous orbit. \n\n- Deploy the other STS ComSat but don\u0027t allow its PAM to fire. \n\n- Capture and return the defunct satellite back to Kerbin (feel free to use KAS struts to accomplish this).\n\n- Bad weather at KSC. Mission Control orders you to land at KSC Island or else any previously marked (with a flag) alternate landing site.\n\n**Mission:** **STS Orbital Construction**\n\n![y8xwyd7m.png?2](http://i.imgur.com/y8xwyd7m.png?2)\n\n![CCofqXf.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/CCofqXf.jpg)\n\nMission Specialist IV\n\n- Mission Specialist III is required before attempting.\n\n- Deploy the STS Space Telescope above 120km.\n\n- Assemble the STS Space Telescope solar array and deploy them via EVA.\n\n- Land the shuttle intact on the Africa-like landmass that KSC is on.

You must use the STS-4 Space Shuttle.\n\n2. STS Fuel Pod liquid fuel is locked and must not be touched during the STS Fuel Pod deployment mission.\n\n3. You may unlock the STS Fuel Pod monopropellant to activate its onboard RCS to extract the payload from the bay and fine tune its circular orbit, but only 5 units of STS Fuel Pod monoprop are permitted for this purpose. All other use is restricted.\n\n5. STS Fuel Pod payload must remain in circular orbit with only a 100m difference between Pe and Ap. Hint: use your RCS to fine tune your orbit.\n\n6. You may not modify the STS-4 Space Shuttle, STS Fuel Pod, or STS ComSats in anyway except to adjust pre-launch fuel amounts (I suggest filling up all tanks), and staging orders. \n\n7. You must land the shuttle back at the KSC to qualify for the leaderboard for all Hall of Fame missions. All other participants will be recorded in the STS Astronaut Corps Honor Roll.\n\n**Hall of Fame Allowances:**\n\n- All flight information, navigation, and control mods are allowed (MechJeb, Kerbal Enginer Redux, Trajectories, etc.). It is worth noting here that I believe the best Shuttle Commanders will actually manually beat those who use computer aided flight controllers exclusively. As an extreme example, **I have been able to achieve 300km orbital payload insertion**, and have enough monopropellant left in the orbiter tanks to make it back to KSC runway. \n\n- F5 saves are permitted. The goal is to learn the STS flight characteristics and enjoy completing these missions to the max, not make it a chore for you. That said, if you can fly any or all missions without saves, the experience is well worth it.\n\n**General Requirements for Submitting Your Entries:**\n\nHall of Fame:\n\n1. Name of your Space Shuttle\n\n2. Picture of your launch\n\n3. Picture of your completed roll program.\n\n4. Picture of your space shuttle\u0027s or deployed payload\u0027s orbital altitude periapsis and apoapsis (either map view or mod info window view)\n\n5. For the STS Fuel Pod mission: picture of your deployed STS Fuel Pod with tank levels. Liquid tank must be 100% full. Monopropellant must have 745 units or higher remaining.\n\nOther Missions:\n\n6. For the RTLS Abort mission, all I need is a picture of your abort start point (showing altitude), and a picture of your rested shuttle with bay open and fuel amounts displayed on the STS Fuel pod.\n\n7. For the STS Fuel Pod Retrieval mission, picture of your landed shuttle with pod fuel amounts showing.\n\n8. For the STS ComSats mission, picture of a satellite being deployed\n\n9. For the STS Orbital Construction mission, picture of the STS Space Telescope constructed in orbit, or completed Space Station.\n\nAll Entries:\n\n10. More screenshots as desired to tell your story.\n\n11. Videos of all or any of the above are greatly desired in lieu of screenshots. \n\n**You may award yourself if you know you\u0027ve met the requirements, but if you want me to check your work, give me 72 hours to respond. Else assume you\u0027ve earned your badge and wear it proudly!**\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-17T00:26:38Z\u0022 title=\u002211/17/2015 12:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by inigma**"},{"CreatedByName":"Columbia","CreatedById":135031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T09:05:44Z","Content":"Wow, I am so thrilled to try this! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Columbia","CreatedById":135031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T09:43:25Z","Content":"I have a few questions:\n\n1.

Just so people have a reference to know what they should aim for.\n\nI think measuring STS Fuel Pod Pe with proof that Ap is within 100m of Pe is quite reasonable. KSC mission planners want to use the STS Fuel Pod for another mission (Mission Specialist II , Pilot II, and Commander II being defined shortly) and having a circularized STS Fuel Pod will simply make rendezvous with it simpler. \n\nSimply use the STS Fuel Pod RCS to fine tune your orbit at Pe and Ap. Not a chore per se, but if you think I should increase the allowable difference to 1km, let me know. Now you are right in that it *is* guess work when first getting started to see how high you can bring the shuttle up with the fuel pod. This is meant as a mission of testing one\u0027s mettle, not a walk in the park to Shuttle Commander. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Btw, 380km circ with return to KSC is far better than I\u0027ve achieved.

They will not be ranked in the STS Astronaut Corps or leaderboard but they can wear the appropriate badge proudly!\n\nNow you have my attention... Nothing against your shuttle, I just prefer to fly my own crafts ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nAlso, how about a [Rescue mission](http://i.imgur.com/SAOPQ7X.png)? \n\nThere was a *slight* mishap in the very early development of my shuttle (I forgot RTGs and to top off the OMS fuel tanks)... And one test flight got stranded in orbit without fuel and electricity. Second orbiter was launched with extra crew cabins to dock and save the stranded guys. Jeb also volunteered to stay behind with a bit of fuel the second orbiter could spare, deorbited and landed the first orbiter intact on KSC runway.

As mentioned before i had a bug that tore apart my ship\u0027s wings, even though the entry was accepted by the OP i restarted the game and thankfully i had a save while near the KSC and i landed the ship intact. As for the RTLS abort mission i may not win an efficiency award for recovering the cargo but hey i managed to land safely after a death spiral once the main tank was dropped that led me to go for a landing at runway 09.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
