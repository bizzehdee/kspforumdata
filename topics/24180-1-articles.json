Next thing I\u0027d do is hit the wiki and go through the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorials#Recreation_of_historical_spaceflights\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERecreation of Historical Spaceflights\u003C/a\u003E section. The wiki also has useful information on vanilla parts and planetary data. Between the two sets of tutorials that should be enough to get you started on learning the game.

I\u0027m CONSTANTLY trying to find a better lifter, trying to go that extra mile. Am I the most efficient space launcher? CERTAINLY not. Am I improving? Most definitely. Try out every part and don\u0027t discount anything. There is always more than one way to do anything. Find the game lacking in content or parts?
