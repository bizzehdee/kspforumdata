My plan was to take the antenna bit on top of the lander and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E it over to the Command Hub. I decoupled the mast from the docking port up and told MechJeb to fix it for me, but as it turns out, the eight \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E ports don\u0027t provide enough power to do anything but topple the mast and roll it around a bit. While amusing, I find communications and solar panels generally perform better when pointing up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, plan B was to launch the lander again, detach the antenna in flight and get MechJeb to fix it for me, but for some reason I can\u0027t fire the engines anymore. I\u0027m sure they\u0027re not broken, but even if I got that thing up again I doubt I\u0027d be able to manage the decoupling, instructing MechJeb and safely landing the pod again in what I expect to be a small window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone have a good idea? It\u0027s all sandbox, so basically I\u0027m only limited by my own stupidity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I\u0027m thinking of maybe just building a crane and sending that over. I\u0027ve got a couple of more flights to make anyway, but I can\u0027t seem to find the parts to construct a crane arm, which I thought were in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E. I\u0027ve yet to look into crane building manuals, but I\u0027m here posting the question anyway, so I figured I\u0027d squeeze in this question too. So would that even work? Grab antenna, drive it over and put it on the roof?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne more thing: To a KSP veteran there\u0027s probably a lot wrong in that picture, but right now I\u0027m just either doing things because I can or to see \u003Cem\u003Eif\u003C/em\u003E I can. And esthetics. Esthetically I wanted a large metal rod on my Command Hub because it looks spacey.
