Thank you for stopping by my humble showcase! I have nine designs to share with you today, but don\\\u0027t let that number intimidate you. Each one is tailored to a different purpose and style of piloting. Four rockets, four aircraft and one SSTO spaceplane provide a wide array of options to meet almost any mission profile. The rockets have been designed with minimal debris in mind while retaining the capability to reach either of Kerbin\\\u0027s moons. Two are single-Kerbal craft and two utilize the new three-Kerbal Command Pod. The four aircraft are very stable in flight, using advanced placement of both lift and control surfaces. Apply a little trim to render the included Avionics Packages unnecessary. They also include a fairly generous fuel supply for extended loitering or medium-range travel. The single SSTO spaceplane is also very stable during atmospheric flight, and surprised even me with its capabilities which I will go into in due time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now that the \u0027fake company\u0027 segment is finished, allow me to present to you my various designs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EThe Rockets\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll but one of the following rockets feature an asparagus-stalk design.

When you draw the tangent line across Kerbin surface and \u003Cstrong\u003Ethrough\u003C/strong\u003E your orbital path, you are burning at the pink dot. Pick a spot where it crosses your path and draw directly towards the planet. Pick the spot it intersects with the surface and use whatever feature is on the line as a guide. I do this every time before I do a TMI and then double-check with Mun rise just before I do the burn. You can normally flip the map so it\\\u0027s horizontal instead of being top-down for the view after you\\\u0027ve done your corrections and gauge if the spot you picked is going to coincide with Mun rise.
