I love making SSTOs and have only played about 5 hours on 1.0 due to school constraints. I have tried the old way of going to 10-20km up and getting speed on the orbital m/s to 1600 but then I just kill my pod with the heat. I tried what I read on another thread about pitching to 45\\* and gunning into space, that seems to fix the heating problem but I run out of fuel before i can get into orbit.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nI will definitely try that when I get the chance to.
