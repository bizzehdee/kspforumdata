I love making SSTOs and have only played about 5 hours on 1.0 due to school constraints. I have tried the old way of going to 10-20km up and getting speed on the orbital m/s to 1600 but then I just kill my pod with the heat. I tried what I read on another thread about pitching to 45* and gunning into space, that seems to fix the heating problem but I run out of fuel before i can get into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will definitely try that when I get the chance to.
