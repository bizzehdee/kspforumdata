So if you activate the follow target function it won\u0027t have any effect on attached rockets. The closest you can get to guided missiles is by using remote control on a missile that takes off from the launch pad. But again i have to stress that the system was not designed for this at all and albeit it is possible to do this stuff, it is not easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know i have said that lazor system is not a weapon system, but i see there is a lot of interest for this stuff. So i have decided to make some lazor guided hellfire missiles which will also be the prototype for the system i and Tosh were discussing months ago. The one where other modders can make and attach aimable devices to lazor system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo i was thinking to make the missile out of one solid part with an attachment point on top where you can place a color crystal which will determine what type of missile it is, right now i have two ideas, hellfire and err...rocket to take atmospheric readings. You will place it on one of the standard plane decouplers and once activated it will fire away following the direction of the lead lazor, the target of the system or in the direction it is originally aimed, all depending on the type of missile.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Elven_sword","CreatedById":16427,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-04T15:44:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you release the cameras as a stand-alone plugin?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Romfarer","CreatedById":20387,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-04T16:16:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Elven_sword\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Elven_sword\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECan you release the cameras as a stand-alone plugin?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m working on something that will make it possible to connect aimable parts to LazorSystem.
