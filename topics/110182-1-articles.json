Some hospitals have a nurses\u0027 hotline you can call. Sometimes with sudden blindness, waiting a day before seeing the doctor can be the difference between temporary and permanent blindness. You might even consider getting your eyes checked by an ophthalmologist (not optometrist) just because it happened once. NO ONE should EVER go blind in an eye, even for a short while from spending too much time at a computer. No one. Ever. Even for a short while. The fact that it did happen to you means there is a real chance there is something wrong. Imagine your eyes are a car. Adding oil when you\u0027re a quart low is a good idea, and no big deal. And if it turns out that you need to add a quart every week cuz you developed a leak somewhere, still no big deal. But if you wait till you\u0027re 4 quarts low your whole engine can seize. I strongly suggest you get your eyes checked. The fact that this happened to you once is like a light coming on on your dashboard, and it says \u0022Check Eyes.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T08:30:10Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 08:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DarkGravity\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hunting.Targ","CreatedById":141427,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T09:13:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYup.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThree things are important;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EContrast\u003C/span\u003E; avoiding extremes of contrast is especially important to avoid eye strain and its long-term health penalties (onset of myopia, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_disease#H49-H52_Disorders_of_ocular_muscles.2C_binocular_movement.2C_accommodation_and_refraction\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eother problems focusing\u003C/a\u003E).

If you have another episode, especially after implementing the steps above, please seek professional medical help. Many hospitals or health care networks allow you to call a Nurse Practitioner (someone who has a nursing credential or degree, but not a medical license or M.D.) for free advice. I would find such a phone number or similar hotline, and post it near the computer or put it on voice dial on a cel phone.
