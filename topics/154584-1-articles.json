I\u0027m fairly far into a career-mode game and it was annoying me that I didn\u0027t have a cheap way to get Kerbals into orbit and back down again, but while I have a good portion of the tech tree unlocked it wasn\u0027t complete yet and I didn\u0027t have access to the R.A.P.I.E.R. engines. Not to be deterred, I built the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/WhiskyTangoFoxtrot/Grasshopper\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGrasshopper\u003C/a\u003E, a spaceplane based around a pair of Whiplash engines for atmospheric flight and a Toroidal Aerospike for space. The thing turned out fairly well, able to easily transport 4 Kerbals up to 250km orbits (which is where I keep my Kerbin space station) and back down again and, when pushed to its limits, can get up to a 500km circular orbit (although once up there I had trouble getting back down again, needing to use my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters for that last bit of delta-V that I needed to get back into the atmosphere.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nToday, after completing a successful mission with the Grasshopper (several, actually; I had four different Kerbals from four different rescue contracts on my station and brought them all down at once) I took a look at my new contracts and discovered that I\u0027d been offered one to test the R.A.P.I.E.R. engine, effectively unlocking it for the duration of the contract without needing to invest the science points to get it normally. I immediately upgraded the Grasshopper with the new technology, replacing its Whiplash engines with R.A.P.I.E.R.s, ditching the Aerospike (putting a second shielded docking port in its place) and rebalancing my fuel tanks to better suit the new configuration. The new craft turned out to be slightly lighter than the old one (but also more expensive) and I immediately took it to the runway, got it into orbit and discovered that it performed... well... pretty much exactly as well as the old one. It could get to a 500km circular orbit but didn\u0027t have enough oxidizer to come back down again. The new design did have some advantages, with that second docking port meaning that I could attach a NERV tug to the back for long-range journeys and still have it dock with a station (where before I could only have it docked with one thing at a time) and I managed to fit a science container in where I used to have a small LiquidFuel tank, but it was also substantially harder to fly due to the R.A.P.I.E.R.\u0027s poor low-speed performance and, as I said, more expensive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat got me thinking about the various \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E designs I\u0027d seen for this game. Nearly all of them are R.A.P.I.E.R.-based (with the occasional NERV engine for when you absolutely positively have to take a pair of wings and a set of air-breathing engines with you to Eeloo,) to the point where I don\u0027t think that a lot of builders are even considering the possibility of alternate designs. The R.A.P.I.E.R. is certainly convenient, being a jet engine and a rocket in a single package, but it has significant disadvantages in both modes, with its odd thrust curve requiring an exacting (and often tediously long) ascent profile in atmosphere and just being generally inefficient in vacuum. On the other hand, the Whiplash (and even the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/WhiskyTangoFoxtrot/Gnat\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPanther\u003C/a\u003E) are still able to get a craft into the upper atmosphere with a significant fraction of its orbital velocity, are cheaper, get unlocked earlier and offer some significant advantages for in-atmosphere flying (with the Whiplash\u0027s smoother performance curve and the Panther\u0027s dry mode offering a very long cruise-time for when your re-entry falls wide of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what do you think?

If you build one space plane and use whips you will use them on Kerbin, but from there on there is no place to use them anymore and they just become weight that you carry around in space with no use. Good if you keep it local, but the moment you want to land on another planet they become an issue. At which point you wish you had Rapiers because you can use them to take off and land on other planets. Plus, if you\u0027re going too fast you can really slow down almost instantly.

The RAPIER is not the end all be all.
