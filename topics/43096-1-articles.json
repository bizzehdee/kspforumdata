Well, maybe not exactly. I remember posting things under a different name but the forums aren\u0027t recognizing my of my emails so I just registered a new account. I most definitely am not good at the game, and often need MechJeb\u0027s help just to get to the Mun. I can get into debates that aren\u0027t my field of expertise as I have no fields of expertise, but I am attempting to improve this bane of mine and hopefully it won\u0027t get me into trouble here.
