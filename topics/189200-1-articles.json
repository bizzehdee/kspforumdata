I want them to have exactly the same functionality as normal landing legs but I do not want to add as secondary pieces outside. I can build them in the model and create animations in blender for them but other than that I have no idea how to procceed in order to create my idea. Please give me any tips you have and ideas.

Well guess I\u0027ll try and see how it can be done differently. I can just split a part of the spaceship mesh and put it outside and make it the legs it all should be perfectly fine. Thanks a lot m8 for helping me out and letting me know :D. Though I\u0027m still not sure how all the stuff works I\u0027ll figure it out as I go I guess! \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
