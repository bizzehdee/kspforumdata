This causes me to literally never be able to complete a maneuver where I\u0027m expecting to use more than one stage - I either have to discard the old stage prior to the maneuver and waste whatever fuel was left (sometimes which I have planned on using with the flight plan), or I have to break my maneuvers into 2 stages, which is a huge pain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny advice, or is this a known issue, or...?
