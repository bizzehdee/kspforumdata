(Addonception?)\n\nAn ongoing WIP suit picker suit pack which will eventually feature several (really not sure about \u0027all\u0027 - there\u0027s a lot...) of the flags, agencies, and decal stuff you can find below.\n\n**WHAT DO THEY DO?:**\n\n***Kerbalized Flags, Agencies and Decal Textures*** adds Many Kerbalized national flags for your Space Agency.\n\n~~Several~~ Many Space Agencies with logos that offer you contracts in the contract window.\n\nDecals for your crafts and missions for use with drewcassidy\u0027s Conformal Decals - **Links below.**\n\n***Kerbalized Suits*** will eventually allow you to further Kerbal the shizzz out of your space agency.\n\nCurrently included: \n\n**Kerbal States of America (Base, Slim, and Future):** **Pilot, Engineer, Scientist, and MKS professions**\n\n**Koviet Union (Base, Slim, and Future): Pilot, Engineer, Scientist, and MKS professions**\n\n**Russia, and China (Base, Slim, and Future): Pilot, Engineer, Scientist, and MKS professions for both**\n\n**ESA (Base, Slim, and Future):** **Canada, UK, Belgium, Romania, Norway, Iceland, Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Ukraine, Denmark, Switzerland, France, Spain, Ireland, Austria, Israel, Sweden, Finland, and E.U. for MKS suits.**\n\n**ALCE for South America (Base, Slim, and Future): Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay, Ecuador, Bolivia and Latin American Union (CELAK - the flag is based on UNASUR) for MKS suits**\n\n**An imaginary International Space Agency (Base, Slim, and Future):** **Aus, Japan, South Korea, India, Indonesia, North Korea, NZ, Malaysia, Iran,**  **and United Kerbin for MKS suits.**\n\n**Two Vintage (Kerbal States/Koviet Union) suits**\n\nApart from the Vintage style suits, they are all colour coded for Kerbal Skills (based on Community Trait Icons colour scheme), including those used by MKS.\n\nThe files are organized in such a way that if you don\u0027t use MKS, or don\u0027t want to use a particular set, it\u0027s as easy as deleting an obvious folder.\n\nNot a fan of a particular flag/agency/whatever? I\u0027m not here to do politics, there are plenty of alternatives and use is not mandatory...\n\n**Things to note:** \n\n**By default, the suits are only visible in EVA (see below for how to fix this) and are also not currently set up for use with Texture Replacer - As the suit mod is standalone, TR is not needed to use it.** \n\n**A TR version may or may not appear in the future.** \n\n**You will need to disable to Custom Kerbals option in the TR in-game menu in order for the suits to work correctly.** \n\n**As far as I am aware, TR reflections are unaffected, but the visor up/down feature (stock) doesn\u0027t seem to work with TR installed. Ask in TR forum about that, not here.**\n\n**Also, this suit pack isn\u0027t magic. Suit sets are only compatible with versions of KSP that include them. Obviously...**\n\n**Download Link below.** \n\n**More images at bottom of this post**\n\n**KERBALIZED SUITS DOWNLOAD:**\n\n**[SPACEDOCK](https://spacedock.info/mod/2813/Kerbalized%20Suits)**\n\nTo install, simply extract everything in the zip directly to your \u0027.../Kerbal Space Program/GameData\u0027 folder. You can safely delete/not install undesired suit sets (delete the appropriate subfolder) without affecting any of the others.\n\nCredit goes to [@overkill13](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/173506-overkill13/),  [@GregroxMun](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/36077-gregroxmun/), [@fast_de_la_speed](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/111433-fast_de_la_speed/), [@Scart91](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/117290-scart91/), [@Omega482](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/116949-omega482/), the Green Skull people for the inital conceptual inspiration of this whole affair, and very likely others for prior work which was modified and/or incorporated into this suit pack.\n\n**If you want the suits to appear in IVA, [Benjee10\u0027s Historical Kerbal Suits](https://spacedock.info/mod/2675/Benjee10%27s%20Historical%20Kerbal%20Suits) is required. If you don\u0027t care, it\u0027s not needed.**\n\n**Answers to a couple of FAQs:**\n\n**1. Why aren\u0027t the suits appearing when my Kerbal is inside a vehicle/ship/etc?** \n\nThis is because the stock suit picker doesn\u0027t provide a way to change IVA suits. The mod linked directly above contains a plugin that allows this to be a thing.\n\n**2. Why does my Kerbal\u0027s suit texture look all mangled?**  \n\nThis is a Texture Replacer issue and will only happen with Jeb, Bill, Bob, and Val.\n\nThese steps to make this not a thing will need to be done for EVERY/EACH new/saved game:  Load KSP  -  Start or Load a game  -  In the Space Centre view (the one where you see the buildings), open the Texture Replacer menu and uncheck \u0027Personalize Suits\u0027  -  Go back to main menu and quit KSP  -  Open your .../Kerbal Space Program/saves/mysavegame/persistent.sfs (notepad\u002B\u002B or some such is great for this)  -  search for:  \u0027hero = True\u0027  -  Set it (and all other \u0027hero = True) to \u0027False\u0027 (the CaPiTaLiZaTiOn is important)  -  save the persistent.sfs  -  Restart KSP  -  Play.\n\nYou could alternatively simply not use Texture Replacer, but then lots of other things might stop working. I use and love Texture Replacer and recommend it highly.\n\n**FLAGS, AGENCIES, AND DECALS DOWNLOAD:**\n\n**[SPACEDOCK](http://spacedock.info/mod/996/Kerbalized%20National%20Flags%20and%20Space%20Agencies)** **[Latest]**  I try not to, but if I make any changes that affect an ongoing save game, use:  ---\u003E   **[PREVIOUS VERSION SPACEDOCK LIN](https://spacedock.info/mod/996/Kerbalized%20National%20Flags%20and%20Space%20Agencies/download/19_Apr_2021)K** \n\n**NOTE TO ANYONE UPDATING FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION - Much pruning has occurred. It is entirely possible that savegames started prior to 19 Apr 21, and any Sandbox savegames started prior to 03 Aug 21 might be affected by this pruning.

If you are only interested in Flags and agencies, then only copy this folder.\n\nFor the decals, first extract \u0027KerbalizedDecals\u0027 to your \u0027.../Kerbal Space Program/GameData\u0027 folder.
