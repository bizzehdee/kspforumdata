It\u0027s extensive use of titanium finger doublers makes it much more fatigue resistant than any of the Boeing or Airbus designs and Airbus still to this day even uses basically the same engine pylon design as the DC10s much maligned engine pylons. The DC10 is more of an example of how an otherwise great airplane can have its reputation tanked by bad maintenance and, subsequently, by people who don\u0027t know what they are talking about than an example of a bad airplane. There\u0027s a reason you see so many of them flying in cargo operations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S. Before someone says \u0022buh buh buh but!\u0022 about the Turkish Airlines flight 981 crash: That was the result of Turkish Airlines mechanics screwing up a mod to the door latch that was mandated after the AA96 incident. (Their error made it easier for the door to be closed improperly, rather than harder, as was intended). And the ensuing AD that mandated installation of blowout panels between the passenger cabin and cargo hold affected all widebody aircraft of the day, from B747s to L1011s to A300s to DC10s. The cargo door failure on Turkish Airlines revealed a design flaw in all widebody types, not just the DC10.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-24T18:06:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou know, the media loves to portray the aviation industry as some sort of \u0022heros and villains saga\u0022, but that\u0027s short sighted and stupid. I have spent most of my engineering career in the industry.\u00A0 And while I grew disillusioned and cynical towards the end, feeling like I was being held hostage by a bunch of Pakleds, the people in the industry are by and large conscientious and good. They are people though. They make mistakes. Pilots make mistakes, mechanics make mistakes, engineers make mistakes, management makes mistakes. But the system, as a whole, is designed to catch those mistakes before they become c\u003Cspan\u003Eatastrophic. It does an extremely good job of that. You\u0027re far safer riding on a commercial flight than you are driving on the highway. That\u0027s not a coincidence. Even in the Alaska Airlines 1282 case, engineering design, pilot training, ATC procedures, etc. came together to yield an outcome where nobody got seriously hurt. That makes it a success story. Should it have happened? No. Given that it did happen isn\u0027t it great that nobody got hurt? The backups and backups for backups worked. The industry learned a valuable lesson, and the mistakes are being corrected. That\u0027s what\u0027s supposed to happen. During my time in the industry, we celebrated the aircraft that we sent to the desert to be turned into beer cans. It was our job to safely get them to that point in their life cycle.

Either way their processes would need to monitor and ensure that all parts of all assemblies conform to the design. It sounds like Boeing\u0027s QA mostly does that, but stuff is somehow still falling through the cracks. The question then is \u0022why?\u0022. Are they understaffed and overwhelmed by a flood of poor workmanship by their supplier? Are they jaded and don\u0027t care anymore? Something else? I can\u0027t know.
