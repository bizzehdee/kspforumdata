See, that is how I keep track of my stuff, the SSTO is obvious, Mk LIV means it\u0027s the 54th model that short of works (Kod I have been making SSTOs long... that doesn\u0027t count failed concepts), and Longsword is the model name. Then, if I make any special version, that gets added to the end, along with a mission number if necessary. But yeah, I often shorten it myself if it\u0027s going to be in the tracking station for any length of time... this bird\u0027s designation ingame would be, for example, SS-LX \u0022RecordBreaker\u0022, for SSTO, Longsword-based, eXperimental model. Other examples would be CS-01 \u0022Spatha\u0022 for the first Crew Shuttle of the Spatha model, or LE-03 \u0022Copernicus\u0022, for the third Lander, Eagle model, that happens to be called \u0022Copernicus\u0022 so I can distinguish it from it\u0027s siblings.
