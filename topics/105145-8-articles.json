I feel like this was more of a piloting/luck thing than anything else, though... I finished the gravity turn, and I *know* it was a gravity turn because the autopilot was on prograde since I ditched the second pair of boosters... on a 72x38 suborbital trajectory, at 54 kms. The boring part was to wait until I got out of atmo with the probe off to save power. You can\u0027t deny it has a sweet thrust curve, though (separatrons on launch is a great idea!). If I compute correctly, 19.94/89.94=22.17%. Just enough.\n\n![k1b3lws.png](http://i.imgur.com/k1b3lws.png)\n\n![7wT54Be.png](http://i.imgur.com/7wT54Be.png)\n\n![HzZE6DO.png](http://i.imgur.com/HzZE6DO.png)\n\n![aekFuqu.png](http://i.imgur.com/aekFuqu.png)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Cheers, one of the biggest problems was actually getting enough speed to take off (really needed all the runway, and a bit more), even the 5 rapiers are enough for the main atmospheric part of the ascent, although a bit underpowered once in rocket mode. Also tried one turbojet on the back, but that really lacked once the air ran out. I\u0027m pretty sure that it could have a slightly better payload fraction with a little more cargo and a better ascent.\n\u003E More wings seems to be a viable approach - how things change!\n\nYup, just like in real life, wings let you \u0022cheat\u0022 physics, and low TWRs give awesome tankage fractions. A worthy example of physics!\n\nRune. Basically wings nullify a great % of the gravity losses."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T17:05:35Z","Content":"Sweet, another rocket entry!
