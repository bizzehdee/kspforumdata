This has two reasons. No. 1 is that in reality RCS has no throttle, so you don\u0027t need analog input for translation. Second reason is I can\u0027t handle rotation and translation at once, it just puts too much stress on me. You can see my joysticks in my hardware thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt first I had two full joysticks where I used one twist rudder as up/down control.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
