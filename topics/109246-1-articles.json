Trying to find a way to get a list of the items mentioned in the title to be able to disable their visibility in gui and flight. The disabling I\u0027m fine with doing, but somewhere in the back of my mind there\u0027s a thing about BaseFields that I can\u0027t quite remember.

If you create another way of triggering the action and so you set the BaseAction.active = false to hide it from the GUI as you don\u0027t want the same action showing twice. The issue is that now your way of triggering the action will no longer do anything because since the BaseAction is not active, it will not execute when called.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI assume the same is true for Events, but I have not tested them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor actions in your own mod under your control this is not a big deal, but if you start disabling actions in other peoples mods, that could be opening a very large can of worms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T18:04:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks D, that plays into my hands for what I\u0027m doing, but great to have noted down for future reference.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
