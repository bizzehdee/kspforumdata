We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve completely rethought how Science Labs work now. Instead of merely boosting the xmit factor of a science experiment for a small amount (something that scientists can do now), and allowing you to restore inoperable experiments (also something scientists can do now), the Lab now works much more like a long-term research facility. Now, when you run experiments, you can transfer data to the lab just as before, but instead of a quick process for a small boost in the xmit factor, the data fed to the lab will generate a steady output of Science for a very long time, ultimately yielding far more science than transmitting or even recovering. This, of course, requires the labs to be manned by scientists, and have a steady supply of electricity. It should greatly increase the benefits of setting up orbiting science stations and surface bases, however, and also give you good reason to visit them every now and then. (The data does decay after a while, and the labs can only hold so much processed data before having to transmit, so don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t expect to be able to timewarp your way to infinite science)\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbaldevteam.tumblr.com/post/117031055505/devnote-tuesday-thank-you\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elatest DevNotes\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWait, I thought it was \u003Cstrong\u003Eimpossible \u003C/strong\u003Efor time-based mechanics to be fun?

Just think if you pressed the \u0022increase timewarp\u0022 button in KSP and got: \u0022Players are limited to 1000x maximum timewarp. You can increase to 100,000x timewarp for 5 Golden Coins.

I don\u0027t think I ever got an apology from Microsoft from Windows 8 having a crappy interface (in my opinion). They just slowly tried to fix it through patching up to Windows 8.1 while I yelled \u0022I TOLD YOU SO!\u0022 but nary an explicit acknowledgement came.

Or is it? I already timewarp to get the planetary phase angle I want, I timewarp to the right point in my orbit to get to the landing spot I want, and to get more electricity, and to get daytime launches. I actually don\u0027t think orbital science changes gameplay a whole lot. What I think \u003Cem\u003Ewould\u003C/em\u003E change things is a downside of some sort. For example, if rep or funds got decremented over time, forcing you to keep doing contracts or face your space program being shut down, or life support. Then things get interesting!
