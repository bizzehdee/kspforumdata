The upper 1/2 of the way to maxTemp is divided into quarters and displayed on the gauge as green, bronze, orange, and red in order of increasing severity. Thus, the lower the item\u0027s maxTemp, the sooner its gauge appears, and the sooner its gauge goes red compared to other items in the vicinity. Kerbals are the least heat-tolerant items present on Eve and the ambient surface temperature is \u003E 1/2 a Kerbal\u0027s maxTemp, so Kerbals get a gauge but nothing else.\n\u003E At Moho, it\u0027s the same way. An EVA Kerbal will have a bronze-colored gauge (about 1/2 full, meaning at 3/4 of the Kerbal\u0027s maxTemp) while only the most sensitive of rocket parts (usually science instruments, probe cores, etc.) will have gauges, too.\n\nTrue. And on Ablate, they die in 27 seconds. Definitively less than 30. Their maximum temperature is 800 K, IIRC.\n\nSadly, one Kerbal can not screw a radiator on another Kerbal. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-15T00:57:26Z","Content":"The Martian anyone?\n\nwell, except Bob dosn\u0027t have a truckload of leftover eqiipment for him to use."},{"CreatedByName":"Endersmens","CreatedById":80723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-15T01:04:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The Martian anyone?\n\u003E well, except Bob dosn\u0027t have a truckload of leftover eqiipment for him to use.\n\nAnd because technically he would be \u0022the Venetian\u0022 since eve is the Venus analogue.

Even if you\u0027ve got radiators, because the radiators themselves ultimately reach ambient temperature and can do no more. So, an EVA Kerbal on Moho will quickly get a bronze temperature gauge.
