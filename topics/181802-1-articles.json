This became a sort of universal rule for all my rockets regardless of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E. From then on, \u0022whatever it takes\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile you cannot throttle you engines, you can control your ascent by pitch. By 50km, the atmosphere is thin enough that you can point your rocket any which way with reckless abandon. Keep an eye on climb rate, the other on time-to-apoapsis and pitch up and down as necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEarly on, you want time-to-apoapsis not to get too low, though precise numbers depend on the TWRs of your upper stage(s). With a very long-lasting upper, it may be reasonable to let TTA drop to very low numbers (maybe even negative, iow, you\u0027re falling) as long as you\u0027re confident that the high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E near burnout will eventually bring it back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTowards the end, you should pitch so that your climb rate becomes nearly zero: that, and cutting the engines at just the right moment, will make a circular orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHitting a certain altitude takes some experience, both overall and with the particular LV you\u0027re flying. I suggest you aim for somewhat higher orbits to begin with,180\u002Bkm, and then circularize at whatever altitude you end up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starman4308","CreatedById":122674,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-30T02:51:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tend to try to aim my initial gravity turn for 45 degrees at 20 km altitude. You sort of get a feel for how to start the turn to achieve that; with high-thrust first stages, you may be starting your turn at 30 m/sec or less, whereas low-thrust rockets may see you turning at 60-80 m/sec.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor low-thrust upper stages, especially long-burning engines like the RL-10, you\u0027ll often wind up with a fairly slow gravity turn, and then keeping your nose pitched up about 20-30 degrees above the horizon for several minutes. I know with my Titan* series of launchers, I don\u0027t dip the nose below 30 degrees until roughly 8 minutes into flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*Only tangential relation to actual Titan rockets. The upper stage is a triple RL-10 burning for 470 seconds, the core sustainer stage a pair of hydrolox-variant LR-87s burning for 300 seconds, and has one to six H-1 based boosters burning for 150 seconds. Hydrolox stages have\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ewonderful\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0specific impulse, but the thrust tends to be poor, and since you\u0027re losing mass slowly (high Isp), \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E doesn\u0027t climb as fast as it does with kerolox/hypergols.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I have one rocket that I don\u0027t pitch over until at least 200 m/sec velocity is achieved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPower sliiiiide!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022kUmIBbN.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/kUmIBbN.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Astronut33","CreatedById":188433,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-30T03:12:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for the responses, I\u2019ll have to try these.
