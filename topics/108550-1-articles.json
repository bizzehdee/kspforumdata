I have rt10,rt5,lv45,testing first and I can only get these part test, deselecting and returning till i can do it suborbital. the next series is BACC the mk16 and mk2 r parachutes.

Could it be that you don\u0027t get part testing contract anymore because they are under prioritized by other contracts because you have done them all?? If so then I think someone should inform the developers one this bug/feature. I see it as a bug but they can have put it in as a feature, but they should ad least be aware of the effect.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T09:00:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EParts available from testing are sort of like within one or two tiers you already have - once you research more, you\u0027ll be eligible to test more parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn case you don\u0027t know - you can just reject contracts with no penalty and new contracts will spawn. This way you can just focus on the contracts you want to do. Parts testing are dull - especially those with weird parameters (alt~1000m v~600m/s ???).
