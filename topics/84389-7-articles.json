It doesn\u0027t send any other data, just a list of part names and mod names (and I\u0027ve now had it verified by Symantec so it\u0027s on their white-list of safe programs) . \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u0027t apply to any one craft in particular, what it does is to \u0022teach\u0022 the site about parts and which mods they belong to. By running the tool you help make the site better for everyone; so, in your case if you ran it the site will then know about RetroFuture. Then if someone else uploads a craft with those parts it will then be able to identify them as well as making it identify your crafts parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut as it happens, someone else who also had RetroFuture installed has recently run the PartMapper and taught the site about it. So now your craft has all its parts identified. That\u0027s kinda the idea with the PartMapper; the person who uploaded the part-map that contained RetroFuture didn\u0027t have any RetroFuture parts in their craft, but it\u0027s helped complete the mod list for your craft. If you run the PartMapper you might help complete the mod list on another user\u0027s craft or at the very least you\u0027ll strengthen the associations in the knowledge base.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MK3424","CreatedById":19932,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-11T00:41:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI feel like nobody understands your website: my crafts are being downloaded at a mild pace.

I used Imgur\u0027s icons as the basis for KS\u0027s icons, made them from scratch so as not to be stealing anything, but they\u0027re pretty much the same. Would you more expect to find them at the bottom of the craft\u0027s page, which is more like the imgur style? \u003Cp\u003EEDIT\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eon the main search page, you can use the sort-by options and select \u0022points\u0022 to have them sorted by votes.

But there are quite a few hurdles to get over. One of the issues is I don\u0027t want to make KerbalX into an image hosting site. That will get expensive to run pretty quickly. The other option is to enable people to sign in with imgur accounts and have the site basically forward their images to imgur. There\u0027s a few worms in that can too! And once the images are on imgur, any extra info inserted into the images gets stripped out by imgur.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to do something like that in the future, but as its just me working on it, I feel that the mod based stuff is what I need to focus on first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do like the idea of a plugin that can interface with the site and upload and update craft.

(sorry if that is confusing)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyeah, that is one of the issues with an ingame plugin, how to yo edit the craft\u0027s page. If the plugin also sends images then it can just give you a default layout, but them I\u0027m back to dealing with hosting or managing images. So I\u0027ll have to ponder this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes imgur albums are planned. Just putting an album in is v easy, the problem I have atm is how to select the image to use as the thumbnail for the craft. Currently the thumbnail is the first image used on the craft page (which is pretty basic and I do want to change that). With an imgur album I don\u0027t know how to resolve the url of its images and get say the first one. I\u0027m sure its do-able thou, I just have to poke imgur a bit and see what I can find.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK! updates! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emostly back-stage stuff to reduce the memory footprint of the site so nothing really to see there. But I\u0027ve reached a point where I\u0027m feeling pretty happy with the core code in terms of stability and efficiency. So that means I can now focus on more usable features. Links to mods is going to be next, with a voting system to allow users to suggest links and have the best link voted up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also think I may be able to auto-discover some of the links by interfacing directly with KerbalStuff, but I need to study it\u0027s API a bit more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also implemented the suggestion of having the up/down votes links shown on the thumbnails in the search results (main page, users/craft page, and mod pages). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other change is that all craft now start with a single point (they started with 0 before), like it is on imgur, you automatically up-vote your own craft when you post it. All existing craft have been upvoted 1 point to bring them up to spec.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERE limits to votes. You can only give 1 up or down vote to a given craft. Once you\u0027ve upvoted a craft, if you click the up arrow again, that removes your upvote (and same for downvotes). The difference with downvotes is it costs you 5 of your own points to downvote. This is an experimental idea to limit aggressive down-voters. You need to have gained some rep first, either by posting craft, contributing to the knowledge base (most lucrative way of getting points!) or by having your craft and comments upvoted. When you downvote you will loose 5 points, but you get them back if you withdraw your downvote or if that craft gets deleted. So you can\u0027t go on a down-voting spree! I feel this is a different environment to imgur, and people of all skill levels will be posting craft and will have prob put a lot of effort into them. So down voting is really intended for craft that are really really awful, or craft that con you (with a nice pic, but when you get the craft its not as show), and that sort of thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway I must go lunch (and I should prob do some of that \u0022work\u0022 stuff too, but I hope to get a bunch more done on the site this weekend.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the support and feedback guys!
