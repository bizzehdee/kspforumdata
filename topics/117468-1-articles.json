View full album](//imgur.com/a/yKetH)\n\nThe craft is heavy and hard to master but it handles pretty well at both low and supersonic speed and can manage landings on the bumpy tracks you could find on Laythe. There is a small loss of both yaw authority and kinetic energy between 5500m and 8500/going supersonic but it is easy to overcome with a few extra corrections. \n\nIt is very important before taking off to control the craft from the RGU RC-001S just behind the front \u0022nosecone\u0022, otherwise the navball will not display the correct informations.\n\nAt take off pitch 14\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and keep that attitude till 8500. At 8500 pitch down to 8\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 to get trans sonic. Watch the fireworks and let it go till 18000, manage your pitch accordingly to your speed (it can manage speeds over 1400m/s in air breathing mode but it might be better to switch to closed cycle in an early stage to save fuel), I usually take off the whips at 21k, then I switch raps to closed at 24k. Usually I add the NERVs too for a small but sensible extra kick to orbit. You will reach a 100Km Ap at around 2250m/s when your Ox will be out leaving you with approximately 6000U of LF to reach your next refueling destination.\n\nThere are 1800 ore stored in the craft at take off, I usually start refining them to LF as soon as the craft reaches mach 1 to exploit the extra electricity produced by whiplash engines alternators, avoiding the use of the fuel cells till a later stage to save resources.\n\nTo land vertically just extend the assist tail gear and treat it like your average lander, managing height and descent speed as usual, just remember it is quite big and it needs rapiers to land proficiently on the bigger airless bodies (Vall included). Never tried Tylo but theoretically it should be possible to do that too.\n\nWhen landing like that, just bump on your tail gear to the correct parking position.\n\nThe ore polar scansat is RCS propelled and recoverable after each use.\n\nRovers are 2-seaters, with an almost complete science set plus a surface biome ore scanner. Just release their docking port to drop them on the surface ready for duty. Unfortunately they are unrecoverable at this stage. \n\nThe craft can give a better user experience to its pilots if used with fuel balancing and intake managing mods.\n\n1) Toggle Raps\n\n2) Switch mode\n\n3) Toggle NERVs\n\n4) Toggle Whips\n\n5) Toggle Drilling set up (ISRU must be manually managed)\n\n6) Toggle Intakes\n\n8) Toggle cargo bay 2 (ore scansat deployment must be manually managed)\n\n0) Toggle vertical landing tail gear\n\nYou can download your UDrillB [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mld2oh02dbm59pe/UDrillB%20prime.craft?dl=0).\n\n*Many thanks to* [*Nansuchao*](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/138631-Nansuchao) *for testing and hints.*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nOmegaButler is the bigger and the faster of the Butlers by now. Up to 75t payload to LKO and added range to reach Duna/Ike with a lighter 35t payload.\n\nThe design relies on a scaled up UberButler concept. G limit is 8.8 but it is clearly not meant as a high performance fighter.\n\nAscent profile is a UberButler analog, so please forgive the absence of a video.\n\n164 parts\n\nweight @takeoff: 174.189t\n\nmax payload: up to 75t\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
