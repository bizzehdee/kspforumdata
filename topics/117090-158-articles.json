That\u0027s not usually possible on the surface without ISRU refueling/large scale mining and processing, but is certainly possible in orbit with a tiny lander and large mothership. Something like the above (a little larger) would be great for taking all of Minmus\u0027 science and processing in a lab in\u00A0Minmus orbit, over an extended period.\u00A0Assuming the use of a\u00A0Life Support mod, the lack of decent hab options starts to become\u00A0really apparent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-01T23:16:45Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2016 11:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Domfluff\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-01T23:52:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy only other mod is KJR.
