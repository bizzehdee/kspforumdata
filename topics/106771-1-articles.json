Now lets say I got a VIP ferry contract, he needs to go to some outter planet, Laythe for instance. Can I build a SSTO and move him to the fuel depot in minmius orbit. Change the crew pod he is in and than send him to his destination in a \u0022bus\u0022 kind of ship. (the SSTO returns to kerbin for re-use) once he has been to his destination have a SSTO meet him at the fuel depot again and take him home. \n\nBasically this way I\u0027m not having to design a ship capable of a long trip and refueling it.

I don\u0027t think tourists can EVA, so you\u0027ll have to dock and crew transfer them.\n\nWhen you recover a ship, you get funds for all the resources in the ship.

If you instead use mined ore as fuel instead of bringing/buying fuel all the way from kerbin, you can save a lot of money.
