I\u0027ll tell you why: \n\n1) The mouse is already in your hand. Reaching for numpad \u002B/- is no easier than looking at where the mouse pointer is before zooming to avoid accidentally mousing over the maneuver node handles.\n\n2) There is a great joy in scrollwheel zooming. Spinning that wheel in or out as far and fast as possible, or zooming slowly. The scrollwheel responds to both direction and speed, while numpad \u002B/- only responds to direction. Pressing numpad \u002B harder won\u0027t make you zoom faster.\n\nReally, the game should detect which scrollwheel function is currently active, and not transition from one to the other mid-zoom. It can happen in either direction: Scrolling on a radial \u002B/- handle rotates the node such that your mouse may fall off the handle and start zooming the camera. I consider it a misfeature. (It\u0027s not a bug, but it\u0027s not useful or intended behavior.)"}]}
