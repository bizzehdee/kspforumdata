Every time I try this, the engines peak around 210kn and then start losing thrust. I\u0027m stacked with intakes and the intakeair resource is even above .50 when this starts happening. Can anyone explain the finer points of ramjets?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rryy","CreatedById":57357,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T11:11:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ramjets do have a peak thrust of 250 kN at around 18 km, but at higher altitudes, there is less drag, so even if there is less thrust to push the aircraft, there is also less air in the way to slow it down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T11:29:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETurbojet thrust is depedant on speed, with maximum thrust happening at 1000m/s, half thrust at 2000m/s and no thrust at 2400m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scialytic","CreatedById":43957,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T11:49:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf it got all the way up to 250 kN, I think the video must be from an older version of the game. The part.cfg maxThrust is now 225. As EndlessWaves said, the thrust follows a velocity-dependent curve. Also, the Isp changes based on air pressure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"V1rtua1An0ma1y","CreatedById":65724,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T13:38:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it was just 225kn, then.

I do find it odd that in the video the ramjets begin to overheat at the time I would be losing thrust, so I wonder if there\u0027s modding involved...\n"}]}
