Relies on a chemical reaction for the thermal power. Higher thrust than early fission-powered TTJ\u0027s and works in thinner atmosphere (due to ability to operate in the absence of *any* IntakeAtm if necessary).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStandard Jets\u003C/strong\u003E- The closest parallel, as it performs a chemical reaction and mixes it with atmosphere for additional thrust- but does still carries all its Oxidizer with it, so less efficient than turbofan engines. Unlike jet engines, incapable of flaming-out, as it has no actual reliance on external air, and simply exploits it for additional thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELFO Chemical Rockets\u003C/strong\u003E- Higher thrust and ISP (consumes the same amount of fuel, but produces more thrust) than an engine of similar size/mass, but requires the extra mass and drag of air-intakes to obtain this additional \u0022free\u0022 thrust. Behaves identically, except for the extra mass of the intakes, in vacuum- and transitions to more and more similar thrust values as less IntakeAtm is available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESolid Rocket Boosters\u003C/strong\u003E- Perhaps the most interesting thing about this technology, it can also be applied to SRB\u0027s (in fact, this has been its main application in the real world). Basically, you would have a unique SRB part with built-in air-augmentation. Although such an SRB would be heavier in dry mass than a standard SRB, its base-thrust and atmosphere ISP curves would be adjusted such that it produces much more thrust for the same fuel-flow in the atmosphere, but equates out to having the same ISP/thrust (and a heavier dry mass to lug around) in vacuum conditions.

Basic fusion rocket has about a 1.5 TWR on pure liquid, might not be enough to maintain a \u0026gt;1 on eve when you include the required fuel but adding oxidiser gives almost 4 times the thrust so should be plenty as long as your not too deep.
