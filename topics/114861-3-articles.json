I think I had a bad Kopernicus install or something as I reinstalled everything fresh and no longer receive the exception.\n\nQuestion: Is there a way/option to disable the colored globes for each of the planets in the map/tracking station views until discovery? They show as unidentified objects currently but are still easily identified as the planets with the colored globes (Image 2 of the OP Tracking Station View for example). In the OP I see that you may be adding a feature to blur undiscovered planets, any chance there may be an option (Hard Mode?) that will also show them (Initially) as the same question marks in the map screens as every other unidentified object that you can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t zoom in on until you discover it, only track orbit? But still be able to see them as a grey question mark at tracking station lvl1, as in the station is not upgraded enough to see unidentified smaller objects without lvl3 but Kerbals can see that there is \u0022something\u0022 sparkling in the night sky with their eyes. Then when \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cdiscovered\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 the color globe enables and you can zoom into the blurred image, as in telescopes have only been able to produce blurred images (which unlocks non-blurred image when you enter SOI?, minus planets on the ignore list of course which start as colored globes that are blurry). Or is this out of scope/not make sense/already the intention (hopefully ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif))?\n\nI love the idea of being able to send a probe out to a random grey unidentified object and still be able to discover a planet/moon by \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Caccident\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 if you will. Not just be able to say send a probe to the green dot right off the bat if I want to discover Jool without using the telescope. And all the more reason to set up a more extensive telescope/ground based observatory network to discover planets/moons so your not just flying out to a colored dot or an asteroid \\*squeal of excitement\\*\n\nAlso, eagerly awaiting an update that will disable contracts for planets not discovered.\n\nLove this mod, Thanks for adding so much more fun and immersion to my careers.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-12T15:04:51Z\u0022 title=\u002207/12/2015 03:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by BT3**"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T17:26:32Z","Content":"Whoa, how did I not see this before?

The idea that you need to find the planets sounds good, but there are a few problems. One is that we all know the planets already. Maybe if the mod was able to randomize the planets and moons or something like that, it would be more novel. But it just kind of turns into a \u0022click until you reveal Eve\u0022 festival of random mousing.\n\nOrbiting the telescope was nice touch, but once there it really is just as passive as the main interface. Open its window and click click click. There is no need to aim the telescope, which could have added a little interest. Maybe it could be that you point the telescope at Eve and you discover Eve. A little skill rather than random luck would make it more interesting.\n\nI didn\u0027t try to discover the planets in person, but that should be allowed. Thinking of Pluto, it would be nifty if you had to send a probe to the planet before you really could get a good view of it. Again, though, the fact that most of us know all the planets by heart kind of spoils this.\n\nSo in summary, it\u0027s a nice idea but it has too much random mouseclicking. And it would really work best if it was accompanied by a mod that randomized the solar system, to add an actual element of surprise."},{"CreatedByName":"Andrewx21","CreatedById":140332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T15:24:54Z","Content":"Awesome"},{"CreatedByName":"Cdr_Zeta","CreatedById":59015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T18:15:11Z","Content":"Hello,\n\nI will be adding this to my extensive list.\n\nThing is I need to move planets and moons to my liking....\n\nI dont move many of them but some need to be moved....\n\nSeems like distance should be a priority and the telescope (now this is a bit confusing I dont need a spoiler yet but I am not sure what scope to use; I thought there was a mod for this and the range of this scope would be extended based on funding and science; it will give my Kerbal Space Engineers something to do!).\n\nI also use Distance Object MOD...great for spotting those elusive planets...thanks for adding modification specs as well this will be a great help in customizing this MOD !\n\nCmdr Zeta"},{"CreatedByName":"simon56modder","CreatedById":119640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T18:01:00Z","Content":"**UPDATE 1.3:**\n\n- Tracking bodies with telescope now requires looking in the direction of the body to track  \n\n    - NOTE : still needs to be under the 75 millions km radius\n\n    [\\*]Added texts on body discovery\n\n    [\\*]Tracking station now requires being level 2 or 3 in order to track (configurable)\n\n    [\\*]Removed space field UI, back to button\n\n* * *\n\n[**Download from** **** !\\[75px-Curse%2C_Inc_Logo.png\\](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bd/Curse%2C_Inc_Logo.png/75px-Curse%2C_Inc_Logo.png)](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/232274)\n***Source code included***\n\n[Support on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/user?u=893184\u0026ty=h\u0026alert=1) | [Donate with Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick\u0026hosted_button_id=X77GH7XW5EQWA)"},{"CreatedByName":"MoeKitsune","CreatedById":127670,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T01:27:17Z","Content":"Are all bodies auto-discovered in Sandbox?"},{"CreatedByName":"simon56modder","CreatedById":119640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T08:56:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Are all bodies auto-discovered in Sandbox?\n\nBy default the mod enables the tracking system in sandbox but you can disable it in the config file : change value \u0027enableInSandbox\u0027 to false."},{"CreatedByName":"casper88","CreatedById":144962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T11:55:19Z","Content":"hi there.\n\nfew questions. does this play well with the tarsier space telescopes parts in this mod ([http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111157](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111157)) ? do these telescopes work to discover the bodies?\n\n does discovering the planets reward science? \n\ndo the career missions get hidden if you havent discovered a body in question.. ie \u0022fly by duna\u0022 doesnt appear if you havent discovered it?\n\nthanks"},{"CreatedByName":"simon56modder","CreatedById":119640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T12:07:00Z","Content":"\u003E few questions.\n\nFew answers.\n\nTarsier telescopes compatibility is planned.\n\nReward science on body discovery wasn\u0027t planned but is now planned because it is a great idea !

And when I install outer plants suddenly minmus and a bunch of other things that are normally NOT pre-discovered are... why for this be? And can I change it so that I start with still just Kerbin, Kerbol and the Mun, even with outer planets? And if so, how? Because I was not able to find that. I can see how to change priority but... that doesn\u0027t fix things being pre-discovered?\n\n For the record with OPM installed I can already see Minmus Jool, Eve, Duna, and Moho. But not the moons of Eve or Duna or Jool. And the outer planets are all hidden which is good.\n\nUpdate: Never mind, found the file in the OPM folder I neede/wanted to modify. Need to remove names in /that/ file from the ignore list.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-11T20:49:59Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2015 08:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by OakTree42**"},{"CreatedByName":"dronkit","CreatedById":67237,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-16T17:38:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E dronkit-\n\u003E Here is a [ResearchBodies patch](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ridm7k6fafjis47/ASC_ResearchBodies.cfg?dl=0) for Asclepius (put it in the GameData/Asclepius folder)\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ll add it in the next release.

I\u0027ll try it now!\n\nAnyway I have the same problem with all undiscovered planets, not just Asclepius but the OPMs and stock: I can\u0027t \u0022track\u0022 them in Tracking station. Now I\u0027ve used the Tarsier telescope and photographed dres, asclepius, urlum and other OPMs, but they\u0027re still unknown and unable to be tracked in the tracking center.\n\nThe button in KSC that spends science and money to search random parts of the sky seems to work, though. I found Sarnus and Laythe that way.\n\nIs there a bug or am I missing the correct procedure for planet discovery? What would it be? Thanks!"}]}
