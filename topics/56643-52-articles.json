NEW! Massively upgraded Realism Resource transfers and dumps.\n- New:  Added ability queue transfers in realism mode.  you may now start and stop multiple transfers and or dumps simultaneously, \n        with the Vessel, Docked Vessels, individual parts or a selected group of parts.  Fuel Depot anyone?\n- New:  Added ability to dump resources in flight in realism mode.  Dump process follows flow rate rules.  Dumps can be stopped.\n        per forum discussions, this process is assumed to impart a zero thrust component upon the vessel.\n- New:  Massive refactor and reorgainization of code (nothing was left untouched). \n        A tremendous amount of work for very little visible effect except maybe performance :). Sets the foundation for easier to manage/enhance code.\n- New:  Added build automation and distribution.\n- Fixed:  In realism Mode, during Preflight, Fill and dump kerbals vessel wide was enabled.   Now disabled when Realism is on.\n- Fixed:  Corrected nested control displays in settings.\n- Fixed:  Corrected Errors with tooltip displays and tooltip settings.
