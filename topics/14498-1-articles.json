I\\\u0027m sure they could be improved upon given more time, but I kinda went for aesthetics as well as functionality. My heavy lifter might take another three solid fuel boosters on the first stage for example, and the Mother could probably benefit from an extra fuselage-mounted engine. It took me a while to balance them both though, so adding extra components might make them less stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: uploaded a new .craft for Sun Probe, as the last stage was too large.
