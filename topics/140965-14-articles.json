No private venture from the US, Russia or China would be able to move without the blessing of the other two countries. It\u0027ll look like sabotage by Greenpeace-type protestors (who would be involved anyway, naively or knowingly), but determined hacking by State-sponsored groups on the other side would make it virtually impossible to exploit the seam. Other countries not in on the act would be forced to rely on the OST, and they\u0027d milk it for all it\u0027s worth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo an unobtanium find would probably be great at concentrating minds on a common approach.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBranching off from that, in galactic terms that unobtanium is certainly not an element or compound but is actually time. Time to make a place habitable for advanced lifeforms. Time to wash the poison from the atmosphere and the salts out of the dust. So again, this is a reason for an intelligent species not to expand: the only place you want to go is a place that already has life, because otherwise you\u0027ll be condemned to living a pitiful existence in caves trying to create a self-sustaining system until the most vital components finally break down and can\u0027t be replaced, and you all die. You\u0027re therefore limited to worlds which have had time, with some sort of life, to become habitable. And so you return to the same situation as finding unobtanium on Europa - the intelligent spacefaring species has to cooperate, or face stiff internal resistance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou say we\u0027re living in enlightened times, and we are. A big reason is that the technology which made space explorable, also massively enabled the dissemination of information and everyday involvement in politics, which creates dangers (populism, extremist groups and the like) but also involves a much broader part of the population in decision-making.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt the time when the Fermi Paradox was being expounded, people thought very much in terms of leaders and nation states: the people that dismissed \u0022sociological reasons\u0022 limiting expansion back then seemed to reason in terms of leader A of civilisation A being able to send ships out to colonise the stars, without considering that a significant number of people A (let alone B, C and D) would have very strong reasons \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eand the ability\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E to stop them from doing so. The social pyramid which underpinned their reasoning then has changed dramatically, and has drastically limited the scope of independent action of any particular group to their own backyard. Outer space being nobody\u0027s backyard by any definition, groups (private companies, states or anything in between) cannot simply colonise it \u0022just because they can\u0022. It\u0027ll need consensus, and consensus to expand through space will (in my most humble opinion) be impossible for an educated, intelligent people to obtain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Steel","CreatedById":49317,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-15T20:05:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222804709\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022140965\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221476486270\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022127797\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bill Phil\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n20 hours ago, Bill Phil said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe are\u003Ci\u003E \u003C/i\u003Enice.

At the moment the universe began, the probability that biological organisms would ever organize out of that initial field of hot stuff might have been so close to zero that the number of zeros to the right of the decimal point would exceed the total number of atoms in the universe. Nonetheless, it eventually\u00A0happened on at least one rock orbiting around one sun that eventually \u0022turned on\u0022 (some 7 or 8 billion years after the universe got underway).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe have no idea if that initial probability was close to 1.0 or close to -infinity.\u00A0So the safest bet at this point is: that the probability was \u0022halfway\u0022 between 1.0 and -infinity (a conception that pushes the boundary of my understanding of math and statistics and very likely is not even possible to express as a consistent equation?).

In the case of Earth, the probability that something with extraordinarily derived and complex systems like modern vertebrates or angiosperm\u00A0plants would seem to have been sufficiently above \u0022zero\u0022 that it was just a matter of time; that is my coarse read of the paleoontological record.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then we get the last \u0022bottleneck:\u0022 the emergence of \u0022intelligence.\u0022 Well that is the toughest one of them all, and depending on your criterion it hasn\u0027t even emerged on Earth yet!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut getting back to your original question . . .: is it unlikely or even impossible for \u0022intelligent\u0022 life to evolve from a \u0022mean\u0022 ancestral form, i.e., an ancestral form which is\u00A0completely lacking in empathy, self-reflection, compassion, restraint, self-sacrifice, humility, sustainable reward harvesting, etc.?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d have to say, 50/50 either way.
