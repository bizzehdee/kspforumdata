Once there, you\u0027d deploy a massive radio receiver system and/or telescope to look at Earth and try to watch events as they happened roughly a hundred years ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo answer this question, yes this would work assuming you did have an FTL drive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou would have outpaced the light containing the radio and light-images that you sought to receive and would now be able to receive it. As far as WHAT you could see, probably not a whole lot. For an imaging telescope to resolve something like a person over the distance of a hundred\u002B light years you would need a telescope of stupidly large size. And if you were hoping to watch a specific event, you better hope there were no clouds that day. Unfortunately, there is a rather large portion of human history that can never be recovered this way. Sure, you MIGHT be able to do some fancy games with IR telescopes to see people doing stuff through the clouds, but real color images would be basically lost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurns out of you have a telescope with one of those \u0022Stupidly large\u0022 apertures, say several AU\u0027s in diameter you could make reasonable visible light images.

But you didn\u0027t travel through time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDisclaimer: I have no idea whether this is right or not, it just sounds VERY fishy to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has something to do with causality, lets say you observe what happens, then you travel faster than the speed of light to the point where there is an effect, you could prevent that effect from happening. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if we reduce this to the microscopic something that observes an event and can prevent that event from happening where the event parameters travel at C is effectively going back in time. We are our effects of the causal past. Our electrons and many of the atomic processes are moving at SoL, so if we could change their fate, we have in essence gone back in the past. If an asteroid collides with earth, you can\u0027t FTL out 100 years and then notify earth to change the course of some unknown asteroid. However if you were sitting on the surface of the asteroid, asleep, and suddenly woke as the asteroid plunged into earths atmosphere theoretically you could move all that matter to a safe distance from earth with an FTL drive effectively alter all the effects from realizing on earth including blocking the light and radiant energies that had already occurred. From the observers point of view on the ground the asteroid approached earth and then disappeared. However, also from other points of view any attempt to reverse all those effects would cause even more dramatic and destructive effects (so it creates a paradox). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust want to make a point. According to the grand synthesis of the standard model quantum gravity separated from the other forces first, noting that we have yet to observe this in nature, but if we consider the basis of that force to be bosons, then its particle is its own anti-particle, this means essentially if quantum gravity exists there is no anti-gravity or collective negative mass, and alcubierre cannot exist. In addition since boson are fields and propagate at SoL, then the warp field could never propagate faster, any attempt to reach that speed would effectively destroy space-time capable of transmitting the field. The metric consists of a number of very unlikely preconditions for the drive to be possible, and even if the drive were theoretically possible, it is more than likely practically impossible, from both points of view, creating a negative energy field of great intensity and impractically sharp definition behind the flat-spacetime sphere and propogating a gravity well equally sharply defined in front of the flat space-time. Not only does this require an immense amount of energy (and the opposite thereof) but it also requires an alcubierre transport to create the field in front of the causality limit of the ship, which means that you need another alcubierre drive to make any alcubierre drive work. Summing you have an unknown physics operating behind the craft and an ungovernable metric in front. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the ultimate if and if and if and if argument where many of the ifs are all but false.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-28T21:07:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think of it in a car analogy.

Much more likely IMO is that you will do a travel into the future of KIC 8462852. You will arrive there 1400years later then a photon will arrive there doing the same trip. So you will be able to see how KIC8462852 will progress 1400years in the future from Earths perspective.
