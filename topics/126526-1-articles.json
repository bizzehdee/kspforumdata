But even without considering the fallout, that vault would have to be in the midle of nowhere to have enough distance from the centre of a nuclear detonation...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere is a good reason why many countries stoped building bunkers. To resist even a small hydrogen bomb that detonates something like 50km away from a vault it would need to be pretty deep underground and requires a suspension between it\u0026#39;s walls and the material surrounding it. With just a regular basement like shelter, the walls will colapse due to shockwaves.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe US and former USSR actually did build some VERY large facilities into big mountains located in the midle of nowhere. Those bunkers have building like structures on springs and are very, very deep underground. Guess what, that\u0026#39;s expensive as hell. They were build in the 70\u0026#39;s and 80\u0026#39;s when bombs got bigger and bigger with the intent of having at least a chance of surviving a direct hit. \u0026#39;Direct hit\u0026#39; is relative when it comes to nuclear arms though...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf ww3 is coming, go camping in australia, sibiria or alaska :P\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ChrisSpace","CreatedById":140622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-01T04:36:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-cite=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Switzerland government is already far ahead of them.
