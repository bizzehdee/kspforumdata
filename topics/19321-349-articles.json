Once the bulges were in place lowering the gear increased the wave drag area, which is more in line with what you\u0027d expect.

The mod is very obviously continuing and you can even download the dev version now (look through the last few pages for the download). Although I hear deadly reentry is having some problems with nuFar, the stock heat system may be good enough for your desires.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T23:02:06Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 11:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FG_Regulus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nerd1000","CreatedById":47230,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T23:52:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Quiana\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Quiana\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMay be a bit late to the party, but it depends on the gear you\u0027re using. One of the landing gears has, for some reason, more drag when it is put away rather than when deployed. It\u0027s a stock bug, I believe it\u0027s mentioned more precisely in the Stock Bug Fix sticky.
