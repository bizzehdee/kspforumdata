All mods will have to be installed and updated manually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, MultiMC\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Curse should\u00A0work. Create an instance on Curse, use their app to install mods on it (or just install a premade modpack, doesn\u0027t matter), create an instance on MultiMC, then create symlinks for the\u00A0Curse instance\u0027s \u0022mods\u0022 and \u0022config\u0022 folders in the MultiMC instance\u0027s folder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSymlinks are... one could call them a \u0022shortcut\u0022 of sorts, except that they can be used by applications as well. So if there are symlinks named \u0022mods\u0022 and \u0022configs\u0022 in the MultiMC instance\u0027s folder, and both point to their respective folders in the Curse instance\u0027s folder, when MultiMC\u00A0tries to load the contents of those folders, the symlinks \u0022forward\u0022 the request to whatever folders they point to. It basically causes MultiMC to\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the files are there, in its own instance folder, when they aren\u0027t. It\u0027s brilliant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen start MultiMC and ta-dah - it loads the pack you had installed on Curse! And because it uses symlinks, you don\u0027t have to copy anything whenever you update the mods using the Curse launcher because MultiMC loads the mods and configs from the Curse folder. I did this with a MC 1.10 pack called \u0022All The Mods\u0022 (check it out, it\u0027s pretty awesome) and it\u0027s working great. However, I had to copy the \u0022resources\u0022 folder over manually\u00A0because the pack\u00A0has\u00A0a custom main menu which looks stupid without a proper background image. I couldn\u0027t be bothered to create a symlink for a folder that contains a single file. But you\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E do that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-03T04:19:19Z\u0022 title=\u002210/03/2016 04:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CaptainKorhonen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-03T14:13:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI forgot about something \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/30142-ptnlemay/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002230142\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/30142-ptnlemay/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@PTNLemay\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTechnic Launcher and the Feed the Beast launcher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
