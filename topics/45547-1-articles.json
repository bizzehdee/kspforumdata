Relative speed is down to 5m/s..time for the hoffman transfer. A little tweak of the RCS and my prograde marker is right on the pink. So far so good. Coming up on 500 meters distance. Now at this point I switch to the target craft to align the docking port to the other. Now all I need is to close the distance and done. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem... My station has since become so large it cannot be moved. This 800 part, 10,000 ton rig is perfectly lined up north-south and I need to keep it that way. So docking becomes harder now. I\u0027m very good at docking. But I have trouble judging the approach angle. Just having the prograde mark on the pink will not help you. And when your docking a 400 ton fuel module that angle has to be perfect. Because the mass is so great the magnetism is completely nullified. Not to mention I also have to be moving well under 1m/s. But that\u0027s the easy part. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo are there any tips/tricks anyone can share with docking massive crafts to even more massive crafts? Particularly the approach angle?
