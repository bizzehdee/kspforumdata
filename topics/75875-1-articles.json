So far I have created them for TAC Life Support, KSP Interstellar, Extraplanetary Launchpads, and I have added Electric Charge to most of the tanks as well. The idea here was that I had a TON of tanks for all these different resources and I thought I could get rid of a lot of tanks using Tweak Scale and Modular Fuel Tanks. To this end I am offering these files to everyone so that they may do similar things with there tanks. Also, I have contacted the authors or caretakers for TACLS and EPL and they are balanced as of now. I have been unable to get any balance input for KSPI so I did the best that I could. I know that TACLS will be changing there units to a 1 unit = 1 liter, when he does I will be updating the TACLS file to a 5:1 ratio based on fuel being 1 unit per 5 liters of fuel. But for now I am leaving the current ratio until the next TACLS release. I am open to rebalancing the KSPI ratios and suggestions are welcome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/knnX4jCa\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EElectricCharge_MFT.cfg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/kQLT87Cz\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETACLifesupport_MFT.cfg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/nBzekkfG\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKSPI_MFT.cfg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/H3vpxaFG\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EEPL_MFT.cfg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did not know the best way to make these files public and in the end I figured that since they might warrant there own discussion on balancing and such that I would start there own thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eenjoy\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocinante89","CreatedById":106510,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-01T18:18:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheers for this!

Basically what I did was add methane to the standard tanks, which I forgot to do initially. So that is fixed. I then made a file to turn the tanks in KSPI modular but I \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EONLY \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003Edid the ones that were LFO similar. The other tanks hold a lot less units than they would if they were standard tanks. No initially I did this to get rid of the tanks in KSPI so I didn\u0027t think to do this, I can make the other tanks modular as well, but they are a bit more complicated because they all would need there own tank types. Also, ALL the tanks that are modular accept the Methane tanks are just default so they will be filled with LFO instead of water or whatever initially. You can change what is in them afterwards but I didn\u0027t make tank types for them all. There is another way to do it in the tank definition file but it makes them static and not have like the default tank type or anything. If you really \u003Cem\u003Eneed \u003C/em\u003Eall the tank types for these tanks I can make them it is just a bit of time. So the tanks from KSPI that are modular with these two files are as follows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Default Tank Types)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiquid water tank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPure liquid tank 2.5 and 3.75\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAmmonia tank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Methane Tank Types Methane45% Oxidizer 55%)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltra 75 Methane tank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EZ200-47 Methane Tank\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocinante89","CreatedById":106510,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-02T09:39:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheers, those helped me out a lot.
