So, I test-launched the huge 8-man MOLE space station with the Mk1 pod,\u00A0piloted by a probe, to go rescue a bunch of Kerbals floating in space. The test launch went so well that I just went ahead and started rescuing the guys, woohoo! Well, after the fourth rendez-vous, I realized... I hadn\u0027t put any parachutes on this thing yet!!\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, not to worry as they had plenty of food (I use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS). I sent up Bill with an array of radial Real Chute parachutes and a wrench. He fastened them to the space station body as well as the adapter piece and one to the probe\u0027s head for good measure. I noticed as I was attaching the chutes that they weren\u0027t really appearing on the surface... they just got sucked up inside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI figured it wasn\u0027t a big deal, I could still arm them from the staging menu. So, I armed them and returned to Kerbin... \u003Cstrong\u003Ebut as soon as the parachutes auto-deployed, the game warped me back into space and I got a popup saying congratulations on\u00A0exploring\u00A0the Sun.\u003C/strong\u003E Returning to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, everything was black and all the Kerbals were listed M.I.A. I fast-forwarded time but the sun never rose again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI reloaded a previous save, but the visual glitch persisted and my ship had weird holes in it. I have to go to sleep but I\u0027m hoping a reload of the whole game will fix that... But does anyone have any insight as to what happened? I have a lot of mods... but this mainly involves \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, and the the parts in question belonged to Real Chute \u0026amp; MOLE. Another mod\u00A0in action is Deadly Reentry, but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s the culprit. Finally, this was my first ship ever using ReCoupler.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-19T01:47:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nedit\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmisread post , thought you where trying to attach chutes to Kerbs with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust ignore me..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-19T01:50:39Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2017 01:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by SpannerMonkey(smce)\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MagicCuboid","CreatedById":174840,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-19T03:21:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo worries - it looks like this is a lingering incompatibility\u00A0with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E though, with an open ticket over a year long.
