I was able to make the textures for these parts look a lot better than in my first post.\n\nI\u0027m going to continue to work on the parts and their textures but since this is the first mod I will be releasing I will need some information on what all I need to do before I release it. Such as, what type of license I am suppose to use, tips on how to make my post appealing, ect.\n\nSo if you can help me out with that just let me know.\n\nOther than that just give me your opinion on how the parts are looking so far....\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Might end up taking the bolts off of some of the parts, just need to decide which ones. Also my parts are attached to a stock I-Beam for reference, they are all the parts to the left of the stock I-Beam \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
