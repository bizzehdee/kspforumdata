If you had a giant space station that took 10\u002B launches to construct, you could easily wipe all that work out with an accidental button press. The \u0022Recover\u0022 option is ONLY available when a craft is stationary on the surface of Kerbin; I doubt very many people have craft on the surface of Kerbin that are intended to be permanent fixtures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The primary flow of designing craft in KSP is the \u0022Build, Launch, Crash, repeat\u0022 workflow. Before 0.21, this was accomplished with the end flight button. That means that you got used to hitting \u0022End Flight\u0022 every 20 seconds when your rocket explodes on the launchpad or breaks apart halfway to orbit. That becomes a habit, and that\u0027s why a lot of people habitually hit the \u0022End Flight\u0022 button without thinking. Now, in 0.21, that workflow is handled by the Revert Flight button. The proposal here is to add \u0022Recover\u0022 as a \u003Cstrong\u003Eseparate\u003C/strong\u003E button -- since it\u0027s not the same button, people won\u0027t end up hitting it out of habit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I am very much in support of this as an option (though I\u0027m sure implementation isn\u0027t trivial.) It would also solve another complaint of mine: when I\u0027ve successfully completed a mission, there\u0027s no way for me to get the end of mission report like I could before with the End Flight button.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anton P.
