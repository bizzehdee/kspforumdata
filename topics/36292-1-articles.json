Managed to display the popup using PartListTooltips::ShowTooltip(). That method, however, raises a null pointer exception after the first time the tool tip is hidden: NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object. Hovering over the part again generates another exception (showing the tooltip): ArgumentException: Getting control 0\u0027s position in a group with only 0 controls when doing Repaint Aborting. I\u0027m guessing it has to do with the first argument of PartListTooltips::ShowTooltip(), which takes an EditorPartIcon object. The part information displays correctly - as if the mouse hovered over the part\u0027s icon in the parts list. However, I would like to know how to get rid of these exceptions and why/how this tooltip is working \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone can shed some light on how to work with the parts editor list I would greatly appreciate it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
