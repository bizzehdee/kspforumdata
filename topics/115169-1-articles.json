Good. Then click on one of the boosters, it selects, you place it back. \n\n*Suddenly: the staging for the engines is split in two.* It is now 1 \u002B *the rest,* taking *two* precious spots on the staging area.*..*\n\nI know you can split them (click on them so they drop down, click on the ones you dont want, then drag the greens to a new stage)\n\nBut I dont know how to join them. You would say \u0027click them so they all go green, then drag them away to another stage, and they should join\u0027. But: that does not work. The split remains.\n\nI have fairly long stages, perhaps say 11 different stages with engines, chutes, decouplers. The righthandside only can hold like 25 different stage events before it becomes invisible (unselectable), so I make it a point not to waste a spot. So. What I have to do, more often then I like, especially when placing struts and mis-clicking: throw away the entire part (often with nosecone, winglets, fuel duct, other stages of the spaceship), and build it.... again. And again. \n\nVery, very annoying."}]}
