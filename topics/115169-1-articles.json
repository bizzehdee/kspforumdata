Good.

You would say \u0027click them so they all go green, then drag them away to another stage, and they should join\u0027. But: that does not work. The split remains.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have fairly long stages, perhaps say 11 different stages with engines, chutes, decouplers. The righthandside only can hold like 25 different stage events before it becomes invisible (unselectable), so I make it a point not to waste a spot. So. What I have to do, more often then I like, especially when placing struts and mis-clicking: throw away the entire part (often with nosecone, winglets, fuel duct, other stages of the spaceship), and build it.... again. And again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery, very annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
