Not for the actual paramteres but for the calculations needed for the parameters, so for the most part the script is independent of the ship (for now staging occurs whenever 720 liquid fuel is used up). I actually think it\u0027s a quite nice piece of work, especially because it doesn\u0027t use maneuver nodes at all but rather it calculates delta-v at apoapsis needed for circularization, then burn time and then starts burning at burn time/2 before apoapsis. It also includes a thrust limiter (based on the TWR (or rahter the TMR, because I couldn\u0027t find the TWR :-) )) for the initial ascent limiting the velocity to 95% terminal velocity and a gravity turn based on a somewhat swashbuckling (what a nice word \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E) calculation BUT it works quite nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m at work right now, so I can\u0027t post the code (also it\u0027s not yet completely done, like I said, the staging needs to be modified and I worked on the gravity burn until 2 am last night so I did not yet implement the Isp calculation) but here\u0027s a screenshot of an achieved orbit (you can tell the script what you want your orbit to be, 100000m was the input in this case, it tends to overshoot because it stops bruning at apoapsis \u0026gt; input): \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/dpqfu69v29n1jg1/Screen%20Shot%202014-09-16%20at%201.59.45%20AM.png?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/dpqfu69v29n1jg1/Screen%20Shot%202014-09-16%20at%201.59.45%20AM.png?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote the burn time for orbital Insertion burn is shown in the terminal.
