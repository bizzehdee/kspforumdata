But I\u0027m having trouble building ships that have separate landing and return stages. My goal was to build a ship that used a Command Module (CM) as transfer/return stage for the trip to and from my target. Once there, I want to separate a lander for trips to the surface and back. I am using single Kerbonaut command pods that I will transfer between lander and CM as needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was able to get my transfer vehicle and lander to Munnar orbit and separate the lander. As I was controlling the lander all the controls and NaviBall were reversed. ???? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help or suggestions are appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-m\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-12T16:41:09Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2014 04:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by watmatt\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RW-1","CreatedById":107278,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-09T16:46:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter you separate, my guess is.... that you were still focused on your other ship or you didn\u0027t re-designate where to control your lander from ... I\u0027m not saying you have to but if we had a pic of both we could tell easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry this, separate, then use [ and ] to switch, and when on your lander, select it\u0027s docking port right click and choose to control from here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe that should take care of your naviball and control issue. It really comes down to making sure you are on your ship, and selecting the end for control that you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf not, please elaborate for the group, and we can go from there.

That sets the navball orientation, and also the part that SAS tries to hold the orientation of (which matters for large and flexible ships). Hopefully you have at least one part in the right orientation on your lander.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"watmatt","CreatedById":110658,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-09T20:41:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERoot part upside down.
