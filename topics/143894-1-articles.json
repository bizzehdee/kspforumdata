So the Idea was that I would not have to fly in and out of the Cargo bay, instead the arm would swing the Docking Port (incl. Lander) out of the Cargo bay into a 90\u00B0 angle, which would make it much easier (and cooler looking) to dock and un-dock that little \u0022captains barge\u0022. But as it turns out, the connection Arm -\u0026gt; Docking Port has absolutely no stabilizing effect. It is just a point connection and the Lander pivots around it. Just swinging which ever way it pleases. The docking port stays firmly attached to the arm, but only in the one point it freely pivots around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the Question is: Is there any way (or mod) which would make this work ? Because a) its freakin\u0027 cool and b) I foresee a bunch of explosions and dead Kerbonauts in the near future if i have to maneuver in and out of that tight cargo bay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S.: I am aware that i could stabilize the Lander with struts but that would defeat the purpose of it leaving and returning(!) to the main vessel. Also i do have the mod (Kerbal Joint Reinforcements) installed that supposedly reinforces joints but its not helping here. In fact there doesn\u0027t seem to be any kind of stress on the joint at all. It doesn\u0027t even try to keep the docking port in place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-16T00:53:30Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2016 12:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by John Kermin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-16T01:14:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe answer it\u0027s still struts.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83468-112-kerbal-attachment-system-kas-058/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EKerbal Attachment System \u003C/a\u003E\u00A0let you place then while in EVA.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso worth mentioning: decoupling/undocking will break remove struts between the separated parts\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John Kermin","CreatedById":165487,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-16T01:27:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222678093\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022143894\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221468631698\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022166502\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spricigo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 minutes ago, Spricigo said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe answer it\u0027s still struts.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83468-112-kerbal-attachment-system-kas-058/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EKerbal Attachment System \u003C/a\u003E\u00A0let you place then while in EVA.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso worth mentioning: decoupling/undocking will break remove struts between the separated parts\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSadly that doesn\u0027t really help because even if i strut the Lander to the cargo bay (which at least would prevent it from thrashing around the rocket during flight), as soon as i move the arm and the struts break the whole thing just swings around the pivot point. Same goes for docking. How am i supposed to strut it in place if its completely out of control and swing around like a wrecking ball. (No collision once docked, and i am not sure if that is a good or a bad thing in this case).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-16T04:43:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are gigantic red warning signs all over the Infernal Robotics arms that say \u0022do not ever put a docking port on a robotic arm.\u0022 So I think you are in trouble right from step 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John Kermin","CreatedById":165487,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-16T18:21:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222678273\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022143894\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221468644218\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154251\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bewing\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 hours ago, bewing said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are gigantic red warning signs all over the Infernal Robotics arms that say \u0022do not ever put a docking port on a robotic arm.\u0022 So I think you are in trouble right from step 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThx for pointing that out.
