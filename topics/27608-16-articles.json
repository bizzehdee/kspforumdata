The CoM, on the other hand, DOES respond to wing sweep. What this always and inevitably results in is craft with rear-swept wings always being WORSE tail-draggers than those with straight (unswept) wings- which is precisely the opposite of how it should be, and a real hassle in craft design as the weight of heavy engines at the rear (under-wing designs have too many problems with smashing their engines into the terrain on rough landings) requires me to pull my CoL back to prevent the craft from going nose-up...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SynthGlow","CreatedById":78281,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-26T17:19:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs there any chance you\u0027ve got the older versions of the plugin as im still running 0.22 (having issues with 0.23 at the moment) or will 0.6 work with 0.22?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
