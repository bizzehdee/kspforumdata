But when I launch, it becomes immediately clear that fuel is not being drawn from this replacement.

It sounds like maybe you\u0027re accidentally sticking the tank to your rocket via the side, rather than the end. In other words, you have a stack of tanks that is connected radially to a central column, and you\u0027re sticking the new top tank to the center column instead of to the top of the stack. If you can remove the lower portion of the stack and the top tank stays attached, that\u0027s what is happening. It can be very tricky to get things to snap into the correct place sometimes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re sure it\u0027s attached correctly, that\u0027s probably a genuine bug.

If you mean a radial decoupler, that can\u0027t work, the tank can only be connected to the decoupler OR the other tank, not both.

I can take actual screenshots later tonight if it helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I have a central rocket, and 2 side rockets. On the left is all the pieces (fuel tanks, decouplers in green, capsule on top, engines below).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the left is everything joined together. When I put it together, I make the central rocket first. Then I attach the decouplers on the sides. I then attach the side fuel tanks onto the decouplers, making sure visually that they are not crooked or attached wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the finished rocket, I was busy putting other pieces on and I accidentally grabbed the tank marked with the X. I was having trouble getting it back on perfectly. So I grabbed same size fuel tank from the menu, and attached it to the empty decoupler in the same spot. I made sure to line it up with the tank below, and I do this by moving the tank on my cursor down until it turns red from being inside the tank below it, and then up slowly until it turns green. Also the round edges get lined up perfectly, so it is straight up and down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut when I launch it, this side rocket where this happened depletes fuel faster on the bar. It isn\u0027t using 3 tanks of fuel.

This could change a lot of things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve built about 15 rockets using this somewhere in each. It has been difficult for me to get a stable rocket into orbit, without it leaning during liftoff or not having the stability or fuel to get there.

Namely in-line stabilisers (reaction wheels) which act as big gyroscopes to help keep a craft going straight. Try experimenting with these to see if they help your rocket fly true.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Also note, the stabilisers and any aerodynamic control surfaces won\u0027t do you much good unless you turn on SAS. Think of SAS as cruise-control for your craft: it activates stabilisers and control surfaces automatically to keep your vehicle on the same trajectory, but manual control input (WASD) will override it and \u0022set a new course.\u0022 Turn on SAS by hitting \u0022t\u0022 before launch; if your craft is built well it should help keep it going the right way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T22:17:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are two ways how to attach things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither you attach them by their attach points.
