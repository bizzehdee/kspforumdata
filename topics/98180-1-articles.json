More important than mission rewards or part balance in my opinion is the ability for the non-deadline career missions to be completed with an unmanned craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recently \u0022finished\u0022 the \u0022explore X\u0022 missions in career with unmanned probes and it leads to a huge influx of cash/science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI propose missions of this type require the mission be manned with at least one Kerbal, and adding missions with lesser that can be completed with probes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile satisfying to have visited all the bodies with probes, it definitely doesn\u0027t feel like I should be so rich from it. At the very least make the \u0022plant flag\u0022 missions rewards much more motivational.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut simply, this situation (below) really doesn\u0027t seem \u0022right\u0022. The kerbals themselves should be an integral part of any space program.(?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/f9Fzh5Bl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022f9Fzh5Bl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
