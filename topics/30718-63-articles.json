I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever explicitly said this but from the depicted timescales of Kerbal-Kerm communications, they\u0027re of a duration that humans are used to thinking in, which implies that Kerm thinking is fairly quick.

He thrust his pole into the sand beyond, hoping against hope to find a gap or air pocket beneath the surface as he worked it back and forth, but meeting the same gritty resistance in all directions. Wiping the sweat out of his eyes, he set to work digging out the rest of the rim but, no matter which side or angle he tried, his pole met nothing but sand. With a heavy heart, he walked back to the crater\u2019s edge, boots crunching over loose concrete as he went. He stowed his gear, took a two-handed grip on the rope and, hand-over-hand, began pulling himself up to the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe look on his face as he heaved himself over the edge of the subsidence crater told the waiting KNSA team all they needed to know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo joy. Looks like we\u2019re doing this the hard way.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you for pointing out the obvious yet again, Madame President. As I recall, we\u2019ve agreed on numerous occasions that security around our nuclear facilities is paramount. But the fact remains that, as we\u2019ve seen, the KNSA is simply not equipped to defend those facilities against a sufficiently determined force.\u201D President Maller unclenched his fists with an effort. \u201CWe cannot depend on future attacks being as slipshod or poorly planned and, for all their well-deserved reputation, we would do well not to assume that all KNSA agents will be quite as dedicated as Mr Hading. I trust that President Lanrick will agree.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLanrick wilted in his chair. \u201CI quite agree, Mr President. Rest assured that Wakira will do everything in its power to ensure that this incident is not repeated.\u201D He bowed his head. \u201CThis Council will already be aware that Chief Ambassador Burvis and I have tendered our resignations. Until such time as those resignations are accepted\u2026 everything in our power.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u201CWhich would be greatly assisted by a more permanent accord with Firesvar,\u201D said Burvis acidly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo doubt,\u201D President Enemone leaned forward in her chair. \u201CBut, once again, without more substantial commitments from Wakira, that is impossible.\u201D She spread her hands. \u201CI have spoken plainly in this matter - the Firesvarn Ruling Council will have no trust in a military which permits its officers to attack its own civilian facilities.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Firesvarn Chief Ambassador scowled. \u201CAnd neither will our Conclave.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChief Ambassador Aldwell cleared his throat. \u201CThis is all very well, good kerbals, but I fear the people may regard our\u2026 deliberations, as mere excuses.\u201D He made a circular gesture with one hand. \u201CI would remind this Council that we are now into the fourth night of demonstrations against the war. I cannot speak for other Regionalities but I am advised that similar demonstrations took place outside government buildings at a number of our territorial capitals last night.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI presume your citizens are also demonstrating against the Children of Kerbin?\u201D Burvis leaned back in her chair. \u201CPerhaps if the Confederation had been more assiduous in securing its own facilities against a home-grown terrorist organisation \u2013 or had put more resources into countering those terrorists before they got completely out of hand\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis is hardly the time to chew old soup, Madame Ambassador,\u201D said Maller sharply. \u201CAnd I would remind this Council that of all the Regionalities, only Veiid and the Confederation have avoided outright conflict \u2013 and have found common cause against the Children!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COnly because you\u2019re scared witless of Doren,\u201D\u00A0somebody muttered. Maller darkened but before he could reply, President Obrick knocked on the table for attention.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI agree with my honourable counterpart from Veiid. This is not the time to chew on old soup.\u201D He reached into his briefcase and placed a small, battery powered tape recorder on the table in front of him. \u201CAnd I can assure Chief Ambassador Aldwell that the Kolan people share the same sentiments as those of the Confederation, although they choose to express it in a rather different manner.\u201D He tapped the tape recorder. \u201CWith the Council\u2019s indulgence, I have brought a recording of a song from a recent funeral service that I would play to you. I\u2019m told it was originally composed to commemorate the Humilisian conflict but that versions of it have since been played at memorial services across Kolus.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChief Ambassador Donman gave his Doreni counterpart an apologetic look. \u201CWe also beg the indulgence of our honourable Doreni colleagues. The opening verse is less than diplomatic but please be assured that it does not set the tone for the rest of the piece.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadlin raised an eyebrow. \u201CAre you serious?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrick met his gaze squarely. \u201CNever more so, Mr President.\u201D He glanced around. \u201CIf there are no further objections?\u201D The expressions around the table ranged from indifference, to polite curiosity to mild exasperation. Obrick nodded and pressed the playback button on the tape recorder, watching the other\u2019s face as the strains of a tinny but still melodic duet filled the Council chamber. Chadlin\u2019s expression darkened as the opening verse came to a close but, at a gesture from his Chief Ambassador, settled for folding his arms across his chest. The somewhat distorted sound of Spierkan pipes joined the singers, to the visible dismay of several around the table and President Chadwick\u2019s lip quirked in a half smile as Obrick turned the volume down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExasperation and indifference were soon replaced by increasingly intent expressions as the second verse segued into the third, the original duet long since submerged beneath a chorus of other singers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201C\u2026our flowers of Kolus. Who brought us homeward. To think again.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrick stopped the tape. \u201CThank you, good kerbals, for your indulgence.\u201D He looked at Chadlin. \u201CIt is far from a formal mandate but I believe it makes the views of the Kolan people abundantly clear. As their President and Chief Ambassador, it is therefore incumbent on us to negotiate for peace on their behalf.\u201D Obrick pushed his chair back and stood up. \u201CAnd peace must begin with apology.\u201D He walked around the table and up to the lectern at the end of the chamber.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBe it known before these Twelve Pillars, that the Regionality of Kolus does hereby apologise to the Regionality of Doren and does most earnestly request a cessation of conflict and hostilities. In furtherance of that request, we offer to cede any and all claims to the islands of Humilisia, their airspace and lawful territorial waters, acknowledging the sovereign control thereover, of the Regionality of Doren.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDonman stood up. \u201CWe humbly beg that our request be placed on the public record, thereafter to be deemed accurate and inviolable.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldwell tapped on the table. \u201CAs the senior presiding member and keeper of the minutes for this Council session, I declare the Regionality of Kolus\u2019s request to be placed on the public record. As it was spoken, so let it be written. Does the Regionality of Doren wish to place a reply on the record?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Doreni exchanged looks. President Chadlin inclined his head. \u201CDoren does not wish to place such a reply at this time. We note that the Regionality of Kolus is making a virtue out of a necessity but, nevertheless, we thank them for their offer and do hereby undertake to consider it in good grace and honest spirit.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThen let the minutes show that.\u201D Aldwell made a note. \u201CAs set out in the Bill of Land, Article 25, disputes over territory are to be settled by the involved Regionalities outwith this Council, save only that any new treaties between them are presented here for discussion. By long custom, this Council merely offers itself as a mediator in the event that negotiations should break down.\u201D Aldwell steepled his fingers. \u201CBy even longer custom, peace treaties have historically fallen within the ambit of Article 25, although without consulting the Archives, I would be hard pressed to inform this Council precisely when that custom was last invoked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPresident Lanrick looked thoughtful. \u201CLet the minutes also show that, unless Doren wishes otherwise, Wakira would recuse itself from any mediations. As a wartime ally of Kolus, we would hardly be impartial.\u201D There were a number of approving nods from around the table.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CVery good.\u201D Aldwell made another note. \u201CDo any further Regionalities wish to follow Kolus\u2019s example at this time?\u201D He saw several pensive expressions but nobody else spoke up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThen, as it has been spoken by the Twelve Pillars, let it be written by the Twelve Pillars. This session of the Council is hereby adjourned, the next session to begin in two hours.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;Is this possible?\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EProfessor Erlin seemed to think the equipment would work\u003C/em\u003E, Jonton replied.\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EBut getting the whole system working will need a lot of help from you, Jonelle and Obrinn.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;yes.

Making a different set of probes for every Kerm will be complicated though \u2013 perhaps we can find some chemokines that work in most soils, even if it doesn\u2019t work in all of them.

I didn\u2019t like to intrude but we\u2019re here.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton shook himself awake and found a concerned-looking Thombal standing over him. \u201COh\u2026Sorry Tom \u2013 years away.\u201D He looked over at the treeline. \u201CShall we make a start?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThought yeh\u2019d never ask,\u201D Fredlorf swung himself down from the tractor cab. \u201CCan\u2019t believe nobody thought of this before \u2013 jus\u2019 asking the Kerm what they want could\u2019ve saved the world a powerful load of grief.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat\u2019s done is done,\u201D said Thombal quietly. \u201CBetter to put things right now that we can, rather than wasting time looking for someone to blame.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYeh in a proper thoughtful mood this mornin\u2019, Tom. Reckon you\u2019ve got the right of it though.\u201D Fredlorf opened the lid on one of the seed spreaders and poured clover seed into the hopper before squatting down and tightening a knob on its underside. \u201CBetter set these for as light a cast as we can \u2013 doesn\u2019t look like we\u2019ll have much spare seed to work with.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time the morning sun had driven the dew from the undergrowth, three of Elton\u2019s trunks had been surrounded by a grid of pegs and twine that marked out long strips across the newly cleared Grove floor. Jonton walked back to the tractor to retrieve his sunhat and by the time he returned, Fredlorf and Thombal were plodding back and forth along neighbouring strips, spreaders bumping along in front of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019ll make a start marking out his northwest trunks!\u201D Jonton called. He waited for Thombal\u2019s wave of acknowledgement then shouldered his pack, pulled the brim of his hat over his eyes and headed into the woods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sound of birdsong in the trees and soothing smell of greenery in his nostrils lulled Jonton into a comfortable sense of oneness with the Grove around him, as he stumped along. Almost automatically, he sorted through the scents surrounding him, the half-buried memories of his time spent an-Kerm providing a constant assurance and reassurance that all was well with the plants and soil around him. A carpet of cornshakes caught his eye, his nose wrinkling at the sickly-sweet odour from the scattering of yellowjacket symbiotes growing between them. On a sudden whim, he turned his head and saw the expected pair of elderly leatherbarks, the clusters of fronds running along their upper branches, swaying in the breeze.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton\u2019s eyes lost their focus. For a moment, the woods lit up with ever-shifting myriad-hued threads of light running through the soil, tying everything in it into the mighty living tapestry of which, he knew, his kerm-an senses could only perceive a tiny part. Smiling, he turned off the main trail, cutting through familiar clumps of undergrowth towards the Kerm tree he knew would be waiting for him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CReckon we\u2019ve done all we can today.\u201D Fredlorf hefted the sack of clover seed, squinting at the sunset. \u201CWe\u2019ll not be able to do as much planting around the last four or five trunks as we\u2019d like but it should make a sathy enough space for Elton to draw his map, as Enely might say.\u201D He lifted the sack onto the back of the trailer. \u201CGives a kerbal a thirst all this mapping does \u2013 a half litre of 905 would go down a treat about now.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt would,\u201D Jonton agreed, \u201Cif there was any left to buy. Meleny managed to pick up a couple of bottles of 1G, the last time she was in Barkton. You\u2019d be welcome to them \u2013 they\u2019re a little too fruity for me.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo long as it\u2019s got a bit of bite to it.\u201D Fredlorf clambered up into the cab of his tractor and started the motor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey arrived home to the smell of white bean stew on the stove and, much to Fredlorf\u2019s satisfaction a cold jug of Jorfurt\u2019s finest 1G ruby ale on the kitchen worktop, alongside an pitcher of iced water and a bottle of sapwood cordial.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie and Adbas sat side by side at the kitchen table, each of them putting the finishing touches on the stack of cards in front of them. Jonton watched his daughter cutting a picture of a cluster of yellow clover out of an old cookery book and pasting it onto the last-but-one card on her pile. At the other end of the table, little Katisa scribbled happily on a large sheet of paper, watched over by Meleny and Enely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThombal gave his wife a brief hug before squatting down to pick up an abandoned crayon. He offered it to his daughter who grabbed it and gave it an experimental chew before dropping it on the floor again\u00A0and returning to her scribbling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFinished!\u201D Adbas coloured in the final corner of the capital Z on his last card. \u201CCan I have a sapwood please, Mum?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes, but only one. Would you like one too, Joenie?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie shook her head. \u201CNo thank you. I think I\u2019ll have mine after dinner.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton finished drying his hands and poured himself a mug of iced water. \u201CAre you sure? I thought we\u2019d try your cards out after dinner.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a moment, Joenie looked torn and then she rolled her eyes. \u201CI bet we won\u2019t be doing that until you\u2019ve had coffee. I\u2019ll have my sapwood while I\u2019m waiting for you and that way my stew won\u2019t taste all weird either.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd speaking of stew,\u201D Meleny declared, \u201CThe sooner certain young kerbals lay the table, the sooner we can eat.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton put down his empty coffee mug and looked at Enely and Adbas apologetically. \u201CIf you don\u2019t mind, I think it\u2019d be best if only Joenie and I Communed tonight. It\u2019s going to be an odd experience for us all anyway and I think it\u2019ll be easier for Jonelle if there aren\u2019t too many others around.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COf course.\u201D Enely cracked himself another sweetnut. \u201CI owe Fred a return match of Tiles anyway.\u201D His expression turned faintly wistful. \u201CPerhaps we could all read Jonelle a bedtime story one day soon though?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019d like that,\u201D said Jonton softly. He smiled. \u201CI\u2019ll have to dig out some of Joenie\u2019s old books.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CStill can\u2019t believe yeh teaching a Kerm to read,\u201D Fredlorf broke in. \u201CAh\u2019ll take you up on that match though, Enely.

Come on, Joenie.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie grabbed both stacks of alphabet cards from the living room table and ran through into the sleep room. Jonton closed the door behind them and turned to see Joenie shove a cushion under one of Jonelle\u2019s leaf clusters and place the stack of alphabet cards within easy reach before sitting down against her trunk. Lying down on his bed, he watched the leaves close around his daughter\u2019s forehead before lifting his head into his own waiting cluster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe emerged into Communion to find Elton already waiting, the older Kerm\u2019s presence maintaining a discreet distance. Joenie stood still in the middle of the mindscape with her eyes closed. Jonton sensed her link with Jonelle thrumming, then with a sudden twist of focus, he found himself resting against a much smoother, younger Kerm trunk, looking at a stack of blue cards on the floor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie glanced up at her father lying on his bed and, for a disconcerting second, Jonton had the unnerving feeling of being in two places at once. Clamping down on his momentary nausea, he waited for Joenie to turn her attention back to the cards and pick one up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ECan everyone see?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EPerfectly.

The edges of his awareness flickered with spillover from the Kerm\u2019s thoughts; half recognised images of signs and book pages blurring past, letters flaring brightly in time with Joenie\u2019s voice. Snatches of other voices chattered past and Jonton could just make out the occasional \u2018acorn\u2019, \u2018breadfruit\u2019, or \u2018carrot\u2019.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThis is the letter\uFEFF\u00A0D.
