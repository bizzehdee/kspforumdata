Im in the 787-10 at FL410 between KLAX and PHNL. As I was about to start typing this my aircraft decided quite randomly (Im using live weather and ever since I got into cruise over the pacific ive had a TAS of 520 with a GS of 460\u002B- 10kts for a rough headwind of 49kts. So I suspect a batch of turbulence.) dump my heading select off and start banking right. I wasnt looking when it started as well, I was looking at my phone lol. I only knew I had an issue when my aircraft sounded an alarm. I got it back on course and am tracking with in about .5 down to .25nm of my course. If youre curious atm I am between waypoints DADIE and DIALO on heading 236. This flight marks by far the longest flight I will have made in any flight sim. Rough flight time of 5 hours 34 minutes.

He passed away in August 2020 a short while before the game released. It was hard to fly at first with him gone. I only recently started flying in it again after almost 2 years of not playing/flying in it after his passing, and its hard, but, I think he would want me to fly.

The outskirts of my city are photogrammetry and are somewhat off. Ive lived here long enough (whole life tbh) that I know my area well. So, to get onto what I was gonna say, I grabbed one of the Textron cessnas (which ever has the glass cockpit, which i think comes in the deluxe edition, i have the premium deluxe which is how/why I can use the 787-10 lol) and flew towards my neighborhood. Most of the area looks right if a bit heavy on excess trees, like 3-4x whats here irl. Also the major AFB base near me is also just off\u2026 missing key buildings its known for. Anyway after circling my neighborhood like a demented buzzard I decided to see how well my memory worked. I decided to see if I could w/out a flight plan or maps or gps assistance fly to the coast only by following roads. Happy to say I could! Also learned how that cessna (a textron 175 iirc) and its AP work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be fair, I envy those with simpits (homebuilt cockpits that emulate a specific cockpit) or just a good yoke and what not that are more GA/Commercial Aviation than fighter jet.
