Here on the picture linked i have my science hopper equipped with one but all time my science junior on the top gets damaged when flying it. Can someone explain to me why and what i can do about it?\n\n![raDhh8W.png](http://i.imgur.com/raDhh8W.png)\n\nThanks"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T19:05:34Z","Content":"Unlike real NTR engine designs, the NERV engine in KSP runs very hot. Why? Apparently somebody at Squad once upon a time got it into their head that NTRs were #LOLHOT, and they continued to go with this misconception (when operating, NTRs are cooler than chemical rocket engines).\n\nTo get around this, you have to:\n\n1) Put your NERV engine in good thermal contact with a large fuel tank(s) that will soak up the heat (ignoring the fact that a fuel tank with its contents heated to 1500 K would explode violently),\n\n2) Attach wing parts as radiators near the NERV to radiate the heat away to space,\n\n3) Limit the lengths of your NERV burns to prevent them from overheating,\n\n4) Locate sensitive components like batteries and science instruments far from the hot regions of the ship (apparently it\u0027s fine to heat kerbals to 2000 K).\n\n...or any combination of the above that lets you get the job done."},{"CreatedByName":"waterlubber","CreatedById":119333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T19:36:30Z","Content":"There\u0027s a thermal debug menu.

If they ran cool AND had awesome Isp, they\u0027d be OP.\n\n- Another thing you can do, which works great for me, is to just limit the LV-N\u0027s thrust to **73.5%**. It will get hot, but never exceed its maximum operating temperature of 2500 K (barring anything ridiculous in the design)."},{"CreatedByName":"Shatayen","CreatedById":144522,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T21:17:46Z","Content":"ok good to know.
