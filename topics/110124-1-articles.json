Here on the picture linked i have my science hopper equipped with one but all time my science junior on the top gets damaged when flying it. Can someone explain to me why and what i can do about it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/raDhh8W.png\u0022 alt=\u0022raDhh8W.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T19:05:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnlike real NTR engine designs, the NERV engine in KSP runs very hot. Why? Apparently somebody at Squad once upon a time got it into their head that NTRs were #LOLHOT, and they continued to go with this misconception (when operating, NTRs are cooler than chemical rocket engines).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get around this, you have to:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Put your NERV engine in good thermal contact with a large fuel tank(s) that will soak up the heat (ignoring the fact that a fuel tank with its contents heated to 1500 K would explode violently),\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Attach wing parts as radiators near the NERV to radiate the heat away to space,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Limit the lengths of your NERV burns to prevent them from overheating,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Locate sensitive components like batteries and science instruments far from the hot regions of the ship (apparently it\u0027s fine to heat kerbals to 2000 K).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...or any combination of the above that lets you get the job done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"waterlubber","CreatedById":119333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T19:36:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a thermal debug menu.

If they ran cool AND had awesome Isp, they\u0027d be OP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Another thing you can do, which works great for me, is to just limit the LV-N\u0027s thrust to \u003Cstrong\u003E73.5%\u003C/strong\u003E. It will get hot, but never exceed its maximum operating temperature of 2500 K (barring anything ridiculous in the design).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shatayen","CreatedById":144522,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T21:17:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eok good to know.
