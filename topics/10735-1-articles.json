So I made an aircraft that\\\u0027s *both*. At low speeds(flies best at only 2 marks of throttle) it can turn within the radius of the VAB, as proven by a number of crashes whilst using the VAB as a race pylon. I seriously recommend using a joystick to fly the ADD Swallow, or else you\\\u0027ll find yourself laminated to various surfaces at high speed.\n\nTo fly the ADD Swallow, you\\\u0027ll need the following:\n\nC7: All of the things\n\nDamned Aerospace: 1m pusher prop\n\nJellyCubes: Forward swept wing\n\nTiberDyne: Launch Stand\n\nKosmos: 1m inverter\n\nKW - KW Strut Connector Medium"},{"CreatedByName":"RoAM","CreatedById":18151,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-02T01:17:40Z","Content":"Hello,\n\nI cannot find the KOSMOS 1m Inverter anywhere, where can i find it?\n\ncheers.\n\nRob."},{"CreatedByName":"RoAM","CreatedById":18151,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-02T03:20:12Z","Content":"Eventually found the connector, now it says JAWRD.TypeAwing is missing and its not part of the JAWRD forward swept wing pack.
