I\u0027m finally able to get to a stable orbit, etc., but when I was trying to do science, my little Bill Kerbal let go of my capsule and is now in orbit about 90 metres from the capsule. I am NOT playing sandbox mode. What I am needing help with is to know what I can do to rescue him, since my command capsules only hold 1 person...and I can\u0027t find a way to launch a rocket with more than one command capsule. Obviously, I have not unlocked much technology yet. Any ideas as a low-tech option? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond question: This is not the first time one of my guys has let go of the command capsule without my prompting. Is this a bug, something I am doing mistakenly or do they sometimes just let go on their own?
