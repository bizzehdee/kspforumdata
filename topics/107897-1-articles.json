I\u0027ll click for a moment on something like the maneuver hold button. Wait for the SAS to start to turn the ship in the \u0022general\u0022 direction of the marker. And then take control and actually do it right. once i\u0027m lined up with the marker, i\u0027ll turn on the \u0022stability assist\u0022 or whatever it\u0027s called. And then it seems to hold it just fine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find that the game won\u0027t move the ship in the exact direction to get to a point on the nav ball. It\u0027s always making corrections. And then it always overshoots the marker. And it makes way too many micro corrections once it\u0027s on the marker. It\u0027s horrible really, I don\u0027t even use it. Makes me wonder how they left experimentals with it being the way that it is.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerBlammo","CreatedById":137834,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T15:35:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReducing the amount of engine gimbal will also help with this issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
