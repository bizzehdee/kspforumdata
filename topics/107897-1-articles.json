I wonder if someone can clear a few things up for me.\n\nMost of my rockets suffer the same issue:\n\nWhen making a burn and using SAS to hold to the \u0027manoeuvre point\u0027 (blue cross hair) my craft often gets into an oscillating wobble. This is exaggerated in long craft, but present in all but the very smallest. (often doing a ~100km orbit burn for example)\n\nTurning SAS off stops this wobble, but then I have trouble keeping an accurate burn.\n\nI can surmise this issue is caused by the SAS \u0027correcting\u0027 and then \u0027over correcting\u0027 and getting into an oscillating wobble.\n\nIs this poor ship design (too little SAS, too much SAS, too much trust/mass etc), a game issue (bug) or something else?\n\nAny advice greatly appreciated.

Thanks\n\nSAS is currently known to have the wobbles (perhaps it just gave up drinking?) when using any heading lock other than the standard setting. You\u0027ll be far better off just using the stability control and pointing it at the maneuver node yourself."},{"CreatedByName":"Watoh","CreatedById":141707,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T15:25:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E SAS is currently known to have the wobbles (perhaps it just gave up drinking?) when using any heading lock other than the standard setting.

I\u0027ll click for a moment on something like the maneuver hold button. Wait for the SAS to start to turn the ship in the \u0022general\u0022 direction of the marker. And then take control and actually do it right. once i\u0027m lined up with the marker, i\u0027ll turn on the \u0022stability assist\u0022 or whatever it\u0027s called. And then it seems to hold it just fine. \n\nI find that the game won\u0027t move the ship in the exact direction to get to a point on the nav ball. It\u0027s always making corrections. And then it always overshoots the marker. And it makes way too many micro corrections once it\u0027s on the marker. It\u0027s horrible really, I don\u0027t even use it. Makes me wonder how they left experimentals with it being the way that it is."},{"CreatedByName":"KerBlammo","CreatedById":137834,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T15:35:41Z","Content":"Reducing the amount of engine gimbal will also help with this issue."}]}
