I have solar panels, which are getting sunlight, but the batteries are not recharging. This is the first time this has happened to me in the current game I\u0027m playing. And before anyone says it, I\u0027m am not running the Kopernicus mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease help.

It\u0027s possible that may have been a contributing factor, but I think the primary cause was that whatever parts I had using EC were using it faster than the solar panels could replenish, and it looked like they weren\u0027t charging. Also, the Remote Tech flight computer had the satellite pointed in a certain direction, and as a result I couldn\u0027t turn it. But I wasn\u0027t aware parts could block sunlight, so I will definitely keep that in mind going forward.
