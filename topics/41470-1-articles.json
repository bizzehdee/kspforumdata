It\u0027s primary focus is to provide data to the player (some data you will need to collect yourself in future career mode) and reduce the need to alt-tab to the KSP wiki. Some portions of the knowledge base is already implemented, some of the most visible portions being the on-board resources tab at the top-right and planetary/craft data on the right of the map view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat extra parts of the base do you want to have focus on (i.e. added to the game in .22, .23 etc)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy dream addition is topographical data (height maps), ala the MapSat plugin. Sending out a probe to another world to chart the map sounds like an interesting task to do. One improvement I would add to it would be the ability to see on the height map where you will hit the ground, based on your current trajectory. This would be an insanely handy feature, as the non-atmospheric landing technique I use involves travelling a few hundred meters above the ground at orbital velocity, so knowing whether or not I will hit the ground is useful to know.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mefi282","CreatedById":63817,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T18:47:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would like to see something to find a landing spot without much difficulties.

It would be great to have a device that would give a readout for this, perhaps relying on data from the barometer and the gravity meter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would also be helpful to display equatorial nodes in map view, to help plan inclination changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if either of these is strictly a knowledge base thing though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
