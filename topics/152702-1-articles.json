That could be solved by making the marker states properties of the orbit they belong to (except not all markers do belong to an orbit which complicates that). And\u00A0what about when you want to clear all the toggled markers. ie sometimes you have several markers close together and you accidentally toggle them all, dropping out of map mode and back is a quick way of clearing them all. So if they make markers persist (which is something I do very much want), how to also add a simple way of clearing all toggled markers?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-28T21:48:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222867577\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022152702\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221480367507\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002235181\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022katateochi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n25 minutes ago, katateochi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfrom a dev point of view it might be much harder than it was to add the current toggle\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, I\u0027m not saying it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Etrivial\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Just that I \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewant\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E it.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222867577\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022152702\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221480367507\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002235181\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022katateochi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n25 minutes ago, katateochi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m guessing that the markers are an object that looks after itself, so when say the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E drops below the terrain or when you switch out of map view that object gets destroyed?
