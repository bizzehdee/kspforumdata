Anyhow, I tried out your mod tonight and found a couple bugs, one more interesting than the other:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The internal and external \u0022cabin light\u0022 states do not sync properly. Setting the cabin light state via the external view\u0027s context menu will not update the IVA\u0027s cabin light state:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Start with both external an IVA lights off, as with a new flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Toggle \u0022cabin light\u0022 via external context menu option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Switch to IVA view\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - IVA cabin light will not have turned on\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Setting the cabin light state via the IVA switch will trigger the external view animation, but will not update the context menu:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Start with both external an IVA lights off, as with a new flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Switch to IVA view\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Toggle cabin light on via IVA switch\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Switch to external view. Cabin windows will have lit up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Toggle \u0022cabin light\u0022 via external context menu option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Cabin windows will suddenly go black and then play the \u0022turn on\u0022 animation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The reverse of the second scenario (starting with the lights off) will result in the same bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. This is the really odd one. I\u0027ll do my best to keep the description understandable, but it may be difficult to duplicate:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - I used the KSO to ram my Space Station. The station had one ship (RPM-upgraded Mk1-2 Command Pod) docked to it, which contained all crew members, and probe cores controlling the station modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Upon impact the KSO cockpit was immediately destroyed and focus was switched to the station, with the Mk1-2 ship still docked to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Everything appeared normal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - I undocked the ship from the remains of my station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - I switched back into IVA only to see what I thought was an odd view of the destroyed KSO cabin. I came to realize that the console (and possibly other IVA elements) from the KSO Cockpit had appeared in the mk1-2 IVA, just in front of the upper two kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point I become a little less certain about the details of what I did, but I\u0027ll recall it as best as I can. Initially, the KSO cockpit monitors seemed normal. I believe I then either swapped to the probe-controlled station or some random debris and then switched back to the ship in question (it is possible that I just left IVA for the external view or map view and then re-entered it). Whatever I did, when I went back to the Mk1-2 IVA, the KSO console\u0027s monitors were all displaying the \u0022font\u0022 texture. I managed to take a single screenshot of this, and in doing so crashed the game. You can click the image below for a full-size version, if that is useful to you in any way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gcxQRtq.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gcxQRtql.png\u0022 alt=\u0022gcxQRtql.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue with the \u0022font\u0022 texture showing up instead of the proper monitor menus may just have to do with what I believe is an 11-monitor-per-IVA limit to the RPM plugin. There are 11 monitors in the Mk1-2 Command Pod already, so obviously the addition of the KSO monitors would put it well over that limit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s worth mentioning that I am using the [current version of the] \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/66198\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKSI MFD mod for RasterPropMonitor\u003C/a\u003E. I\u0027m also running a handful of other mods on my current install, which I can list for you if necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, I hope that information helps. The cabin light bug, at least, should be pretty easy to fix. I look forward to seeing where you go with this mod! = )\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Boamere","CreatedById":68058,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-06T16:40:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Raptor831\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Raptor831\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHere\u0027s an updated FAR compatibility MM config: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://cl.ly/code/2D2x2R2Z3I42\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://cl.ly/code/2D2x2R2Z3I42\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill no flaps at this point, but I should have that \u0022soon\u0022.
