OK, a lot of trouble! My record of very little quickloading? Completely out the window! I\u0027ve done Laythe a lot, but generally with specialized Laythe landers with built in parachutes and jet engines. Thus I never remembered what the dV for launching from Laythe\u0027s surface was. I looked it up, but just idly. I really didn\u0027t think much of this as I\u0027ve done Laythe tons of times before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBig mistake!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI allowed 3500 dV in the ship. Basically because I nearly ran out before I wanted to save as much fuel as possible. I thought it was 3000 dV to launch from Laythe\u0027s surface, and the landing wasn\u0027t as efficient as I\u0027d hoped. I ended up with a little over 3200 dV on landing. Yeah, well, 200 dV spare? Yeah, that\u0027ll be fine. So I did my science, got things ready, then launched... and didn\u0027t get close. What was worse was I had quicksaved on the ground, just to be safe... and now I was stuck with too little fuel in my ship! When I rechecked fuel to reach Laythe orbit it was... yup, 3200. I had to make a PERFECT launch to reach orbit. Well, I didn\u0027t make it. I redid it and redid it, and eventually got a ballistic arc that was close enough for the MS to do yet another rescue, but with the added thrill of very little time to rendezvous outside the atmosphere. I got down to 40km, 15km inside the atmosphere, before I stabilized the orbit.

I\u0027m a little worried about the landing on Laythe, given my only landing gear is heat shields with 9 m/s of crash tolerance, but I figure I\u0027ll just tack on a couple more chutes. As I suck at aerobrakes, I\u0027ll probably quickload a lot during the Jool aerobrake and the Laythe landing.
