I cannot select it in the tracking station and all actions (like go to and terminate) are disabled.\n\nWhen selecting the station the following appears in the debug log:\n\n    [PlanetariumCamera]: Focus: Manned Station 1(Filename: C:/buildslave/unity/build/artifacts/StandalonePlayerGenerated/UnityEngineDebug.cpp Line: 56)ArgumentOutOfRangeException: Argument is out of range.Parameter name: index  at System.Collections.Generic.List\u00601[InternalSeat].get_Item (Int32 index) [0x00000] in :0   at KnowledgeBase.CreateVesselCrewList (.Vessel v) [0x00000] in :0   at KnowledgeBase.OnMapFocusChange (.MapObject target) [0x00000] in :0   at EventData\u00601[MapObject].Fire (.MapObject data) [0x00000] in :0   at PlanetariumCamera.SetTarget (.MapObject tgt) [0x00000] in :0   at SpaceTracking.SetVessel (.Vessel v, Boolean keepFocus) [0x00000] in :0   at SpaceTracking\u002B .MoveNext () [0x00000] in :0  Filename:  Line: -1)NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object  at KnowledgeBase.UpdateVesselInfoList (.Vessel v) [0x00000] in :0   at KnowledgeBase.FixedUpdate () [0x00000] in :0 (Filename:  Line: -1)\n\nAfter this the NullReferenceException begins to loop infinitely.\n\nI have temporarily disabled all mods but it does not make any difference.\n\n**Logs and Savegame:** [http://1drv.ms/1Lx0wxD](http://1drv.ms/1Lx0wxD)\n\nThanks for any help in advance!"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T15:54:39Z","Content":"Just a guess, but does your space station contain parts that, in 0.90, lacked an IVA and now in 1.0, have one? Like, the Mk2/3 crew cabin or mobile processing lab etc? Because the second link you provided says changing INTERNALs of previously-launched vessels produces this error - adding an IVA could be classed as changing its INTERNAL..\n\nEDIT: Also, what with the many and wide-sweeping changes to the game 1.0.X brought, it\u0027s probably best to start anew anyway as all crafts will behave differently, parts have different stats etc."},{"CreatedByName":"leepfrog","CreatedById":135189,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T17:22:33Z","Content":"Thanks for your reply, yes it definitely had a mobile processing lab. Not sure about the crew cabin though - its been over 6 months.\n\nI haven\u0027t followed the changes to KSP in the meantime to be honest, but I\u0027d guess that if such savegame-breaking changes were interoduced there would have been some kind of migration logic applied on the first launch after the update?\n\nI\u0027ve put hours and days into that career save so I\u0027d prefer not to start over..."}]}
