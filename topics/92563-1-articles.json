I just kicked up KSP yesterday for the first time in a while, looked at all the shiny new stock parts, and decided I wanted to go to space with a plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first design was able to get into a stable bare minimum (70,000m) orbit and retroburn back into the atmosphere, allowing it to land using monopropellant VTOL. Think the ranger interstellar, that was the initial inspiration for the first model:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://38.media.tumblr.com/1dafb6279a2c75b2dd98224684139fd1/tumblr_ngfqrrNLEw1qeeu6qo1_1280.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tumblr_ngfqrrNLEw1qeeu6qo1_1280.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this Model (Hunter I) I just slapped on wings in a way that would look smooth and make the craft not take up much more space than the main body already did, and then afterwards I put on control surfaces in a way that placed the center of lift behind the center of mass. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second design was meant to be an improvement over the Hunter I, so I took off all the wings, auxiliary functions, and started fresh with the base body to make it more effective. Eventually I came up with this thing, which was basically just a pretty rocket with RAPIER engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://31.media.tumblr.com/3592b8c65411c0e7349e52d315b09fb9/tumblr_ngfr0dvVTv1qeeu6qo1_1280.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tumblr_ngfr0dvVTv1qeeu6qo1_1280.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInfuriatingly enough, this thing was leagues more efficient in getting into orbit and back, despite having no lift whatsoever. But when I went to add necessary functions to it (batteries, landing gear, ladders, etc.) that minute amount of weight made it unable to orbit effectively. Adding wings only made it worse, as if the weight of the wings overshadowed the lift rating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, i\u0027m curious, does anyone know what, exactly, lift rating actually does in game? It\u0027s been a bit wonky since it was first introduced, which was right around when I started playing, and the only thing it seems to do is allow you to change the direction of your craft with aiming, but it doesn\u0027t always do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEssentially: Are there any equations that allow you to calculate how much lift rating you need for the mass of your craft, or for the twr AND mass of your craft? Does anyone have extensive knowledge of the way lift works that could maybe help me get this thing working again?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPre-emptive thanks to anyone who answers\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-11T21:52:43Z\u0022 title=\u002212/11/2014 09:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by moleman122\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Empiro","CreatedById":112072,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-11T21:13:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELift doesn\u0027t really reduce the amount of delta-V you need to get into orbit.

At that point I just let it go as fast as it can, which usually ends up being about 14-1500 m/s. Once it\u0027s at top speed I change my angle just a little bit, slowly ascend, then they switch to rocket mode and I do standard orbital procedure from then.

And yeah, the way I figure it\u0027s only working so well because of the thrust. Mass is only about 8.61 tonnes, and calculated TWR at maximum engine efficiency (which only really happens higher up in the atmosphere) was somewhere around 4.0, I lost the calculation and i\u0027m too lazy to redo it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Empiro","CreatedById":112072,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-11T21:33:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn that case, it sounds like you\u0027ve already got enough lift. More lift is only needed if you\u0027re having trouble getting off the runway or if you can\u0027t maintain level flight at ~25km while building your speed up to 1500 m/s or so. The general advice is that as long as your speed is still increasing, try keep the engines in air-breathing mode longer by throttling down. Did you try to reduce the mass further by not carrying excess oxidizer? The perfect fuel mix would be if you\u0027re left with 0 LF and 0 Oxidizer if you burn until your engine shut off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR is a mod: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/20451-0-25-Ferram-Aerospace-Research-v0-14-4-11-24-14\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/20451-0-25-Ferram-Aerospace-Research-v0-14-4-11-24-14\u003C/a\u003E which adds more realistic aerodynamics. I generally only make spaceplanes in FAR, so I can\u0027t really give the best advice for stock aerodynamics.
