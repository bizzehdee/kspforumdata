So if you drop a stage (stage == vessel == parts you dropped) with parachutes and it lands before you leave physics range (22.5km) then you have to recover the stage manually and Stage Recovery does nothing. When Stage Recovery comes into play is when you leave physics range while the stage is still in flight and hasn\u0027t landed yet. When that happens KSP totally deletes the craft; killing any Kerbals inside, destroying all the science on board, and treating the whole thing as \u0022crashed\u0022, meaning you would get 0 funds back. Stage Recovery intercepts that process and calculates whether the stage would land safely. If it calculates that it should land at a slow enough speed, then it recovers all the Kerbals and science, calculates the total value of all the parts on the stage and then returns a fraction of that value back to you. The fraction is determined by how far away the stage is from KSC (same as with Stock) and how fast it would land. If it would land slower than 6 m/s, you get 100% (without range penalties). If it would land at 12 m/s or more then you get 0%. If it would land between 6 m/s and 12 m/s, you get an amount following a quadratic polynomial (the closer to 6m/s, the more you get back).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe values for the funds you get back are entirely compatible with the stock recovery, because they\u0027re equal to or less than what you\u0027d get if you recovered the parts manually. They\u0027re usually less, since you can\u0027t get 100% (98% is the maximum, since I don\u0027t check for \u0022landed at the launchpad or runway\u0022 like Stock does) and there are penalties for speed.
