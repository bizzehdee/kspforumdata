While in that\u00A0setup I have zero issues with my game. However, I am staying at my partner\u0027s house right now and brought just the laptop body itself with me as I have become addicted to KSP. This is the first time I have tried to load the game not on my dekstop setup. It crashes on load every time. What on earth could be causing that? Is it just searching for components that aren\u0027t there and crashing? That doesn\u0027t seem likely, but I cannot think of any other reason. Thoughts? To be clear this is the exact same computer I always play it on, just after having removed all the external peripherals am I having this issue. Also, when I say crashes, I mean that the game closes itself out to desktop, not gets hung up on the loading screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-06-20T04:22:08Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2020 04:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Atraxa\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
