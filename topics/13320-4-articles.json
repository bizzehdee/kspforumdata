I was worried in the beginning that my parts if I would convert them, would become massive satellites compared to the kerbals. However the sizes of the old stock parts aren\\\u0027t going to change which is only positive. I won\\\u0027t have to rescale my parts and the satellites will have normal sizes instead of those big ones I feared of. This also means that Probodobodyne will be extremely small compared to the whole new system. Cause those probes would be as big as or smaller then a kerbal himself?! I wonder how that is going to be pulled off. But my satellites and probes will stay \u002B-1m in diameter. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy plan with the Satellite\u0026amp;Probes pack, is that you would be able to use those parts for other future parts that consist out of other packs. And that you would be able to use those for other spacecraft to give you full customization. I\\\u0027m not 100% sure how that will turn out for now, some elements will be too small such as some of the solar panels, So I might have to scale them up a bit more to make them fitting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENew Method of Updating\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m going to write proper \u0027blogs\u0027 here instead of a couple of pictures.
