On the 1.0.4 version I installed Realism Overhaul and some suggested mods with CKAN. Now it\u0026#39;s not loading it stopped right where it is on the picture. I noticed that there could be issius with the yellow marked mods in the list.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHow can I fix this? 1.0.5 is running well.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://s21.postimg.org/kvmv5pko7/KSP_Installation.jpg[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit:\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. I deinstalled Testflight and VenStock Revamp. Same errror!\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. Tried to deinstall SolverEngines with CKAN. Can\u0026#39;t because CKAN wants to remove other mods including RealismOverhaul when I try.\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. Deinstalled Testflight, Venstock and Procedural Parts. Now the KSP.exe stopps working before finished with loading.

An issue report should contain the log, a set of reproduction steps, and be done in a clean environment with a list of the mod(s). [I]If you don\u0026#39;t follow these instructions, modders will ask you to do so before providing help, and that just slows everyone down.[/I]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]Note that a number of mods maintain their own issue trackers.[/B] If a modder mentions (for example in the opening post for the mod, or the readme) that you should post your issue on their issue tracker (for example the issue tracker on Github) please do that rather than posting your issue here, but follow the same steps.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[LIST=1]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[*] [B]The Logs[/B]\u003Cbr\u003E\nThese are text files that the game spits out for debugging purposes as it runs; if something broke horribly in-game, there will be something in here about it. You should upload the [B]entire [/B]log [I]as a file[/I] (i.e. not to pastebin); you can use [URL=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/\u0022]dropbox[/URL] or an equivalent host to upload the file. Make sure the entire file gets uploaded; you may have to zip it first, as logs can be very long. Here is where you can find the log:\u003Cbr\u003E\n[LIST]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[*][B]Windows:[/B] KSP_win\u0026#092;KSP_Data\u0026#092;output_log.txt (32bit) or KSP_win64\u0026#092;KSP_x64_Data\u0026#092;output_log.txt (64bit)\u003Cbr\u003E\n[*][B]Mac OS X:[/B] Open Console, on the left side of the window there is a menu that says \u0026#39;files\u0026#39;.

If you don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t include reproduction steps, the modder won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be able to reproduce the bug, and then can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t fix it. The more detailed you make this, the better. [B]Leave nothing out.[/B] Leaving out details can make bugs impossible to reproduce, and thus, impossible to fix. The gold standard for reproduction steps is an [I]unedited[/I] video of you causing the bug.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[*] [B]Clean Environment[/B]\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf the issue stems from one mod, try to replicate it with [B][I]only [/I]that mod and its hard dependencies in a clean KSP install[/B]. If the issue stems from the use of several different mods (for instance, Procedural Wings are still producing lift underneath a Procedural Fairing while FAR is installed) then get a clean install of KSP and install [B]only[/B] the mods (and their dependencies, if applicable) in question.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis may seem like an extreme measure, but it ensures that only those mods (or the stock game) is to blame. Despite how complicated it may seem, it is actually quite simple to do (even for Steam users), as you can simply copy your install directory elsewhere as needed. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s especially useful since interaction bugs are some of the hardest to nail down; something that appears to be a bug in one mod might actually be caused by something else.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[/LIST]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nRegardless of how many mods are installed, [B]you should include a list of all mods installed [I]with their version numbers[/I][/B]; a screenshot of your GameData directory is [B]not[/B] sufficient, as it does not include version information and some directory structures may hide what mods are installed. Obviously, this is easier if you reproduce the issue with fewer mods.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[/QUOTE]\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CanadianDutchman","CreatedById":137362,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T19:43:18Z","Content":"\nI also have this problem for realism overhaul on 1.0.4 (even stops on the exact same moment) I don\u0026#39;t want to upgrade to 1.0.5 because I\u0026#39;ve heard that 1.0.4 savegames are not compatible with 1.0.5. \u003Cbr\u003E\nif you want to delete 1 mod but CKAN deletes a bunch of mods with it just delete it from the gamedata folder (and back it up). then CKAN won\u0026#39;t notice it is gone and you can test if that mod is the problem\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T20:14:15Z","Content":"\nYou heard incorrectly. 1.0.4 saves are compatible.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf it\u0026#39;s a career save (RP-0) don\u0026#39;t upgrade yet, though, that\u0026#39;s not out.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere were some metadata issues regarding 1.0.4/5 and RO mods, which should now be corrected.
