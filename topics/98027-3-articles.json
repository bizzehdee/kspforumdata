But i just want to stress that the point of the app is not to hold your hand while you build, it is more a tool to alarm you of possible issues which may be hard to spot during construction but would lead to major grief later on.

Ideal for me would be the status display while building/flying (TWR, total dV, number of parts, mass, etc etc), but have the actual Report part be a button the player has to click (and could do so at any time during the building process). Perhaps for the very first rocket it should pop up automatically (similar to how the Scenes have their respecitve pop-ups now the first time you enter them) so that new players don\u0027t overlook it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving the Report pop up every time you hit Launch would get very old very quickly. and totally break the immediacy of the game. For example, a parts-test often only requires a probe core, a SRB (suitably tweaked), and the part(s) to be tested.
