Unfortunately, a number of those requests didn\u0027t make it in. Among them was the ability for Part and PartModule code to influence the cost of a part, both in the VAB (for purchasing) and in flight (for recovery). This is essential for KAS because the part containers can have a base value, but they can also contain other parts. At the moment, part containers essentially break the game by making some parts free in the VAB and worthless in flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a possible workaround which I might be implementing in the next few days. It wasn\u0027t at all clear what would happen in the last few days of experimental testing, so I didn\u0027t want to spend a lot of time implementing something that would become obsolete soon after. So, at this moment, no update work has been done on KAS, and some structural changes (as well as the ordinary part cost balancing) will be necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMuch of this could be made easier if Squad would release a 0.24.1 patch with the requested features.
