To get a real reaction wheel rotating a spacecraft with the vigour that a Kerbal reaction wheel manages, the wheels would probably need to weigh several tons each, and be spun by motors demanding more energy than the entire ISS power system can sustain (which is about 150KW or so, if I remember right).

I found this very annoying game wise as it became almost impossible to use them. Flower child talked about reaction wheels being used in all situations but instead in his mod RCS was used in every situation and nothing else was used. Variety should be what we aim for. I think dropping their power by somewhere between half and a tenth of their present power would be a good idea (I side more on the 10% range). Also they should have double the power usage.\n"}]}
