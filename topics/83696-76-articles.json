It\u0027s the first one I apply everytime; fixes my troubles, makes my rockets look like rockets, etc. I am running into a glitch though that is making it so I can\u0027t use it though. Certain parts, when I place them, I can no longer place anything on them or remove them again. Specifically I\u0027ve noticed this with anything in the command section (Lander Cans, Command Pods, etc.). I\u0027ve noticed that if I place them first they stay able to be interacted with but otherwise, when I try to attach a girder for instance, the girder just passes through it. I\u0027ve also noticed this on other parts outside of the command tab now such as the 4 kerbal 2.5m station/rocket piece (sorry I can\u0027t remember what it\u0027s called off the top of my head!). When I uninstall the mod the problem goes away. Please help!

It\u0027s probably because of the duplicate reflection modules in your config and mine. I can fix this by making a \u0022Ven\u0027s Stock Revamp pack\u0022 for WindowShine that has a new config for only the parts you haven\u0027t revamped, which I was already planning on doing. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#A9A9A9;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E- - - double updated! - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVen I got it working!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/quaU2WM.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/quaU2WM.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI added a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/bhqixdjre0qt0wc/Ven%27sStockRevamp%2BWindowShine.zip?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EVen\u0027s Stock Revamp pack\u003C/a\u003E to the main page of WindowShine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I wanted to note a few things to you (which you probably have already noticed). The Cupola and Mk2LanderCan don\u0027t have reflective windows... I\u0027m not sure why but it\u0027s on your end of the configs as they weren\u0027t there even before I started messing with things. It\u0027s probably a cfg error or something idk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- also a little personal note which you don\u0027t need to change but is a little annoying to me is that your redone windows have a different hue than the stock spaceplane windows. I\u0027ve been using the mk2/mk3 windows as the baseline for window colors. If I really cared that much about it I could shift the hue of your windows manually. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for fixing this! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E My OCD was kicking in with having half my parts only having windowshine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T00:25:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Avera9eJoe\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Avera9eJoe\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat\u0027s with the Github config?
