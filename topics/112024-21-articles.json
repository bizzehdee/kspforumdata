The actual transfer of collision models, thermodynamics and all those things were done with the 1.0.5 patch. I only gathered bits and pieces of info on the gap between these two updates and as I stated before, there maybe more to it than just releasing it for 1.0.5 and having to go back and doing it again with 1.1. But, I also look at it like this: It\u0026#39;s your mod, you can do what you want with it. If you feel comfortable waiting and working on 1.1, by all means, wait for the next update. If you feel you can roll a few systems out that\u0026#39;s compatible with 1.0.5, that would be great, too. I for one would love to put this mod back into action again, but I also understand that making mods compatible and re doing all your work is a pain. As I stated before, I\u0026#39;m no expert mod maker, I just mod it till it crashes. In any case, do what you feel is right for you. If too many people complain about you not working on your mod and it\u0026#39;s dead, you can always ignore them, but I am happy to hear that you are interested in our thoughts on this.\n"}]}
