It also makes the period of your orbit and that of Mun radically different, so you don\\\u0027t have to wait so long for it to catch you.\n\nThat\\\u0027s the technique I use because I\\\u0027m no good at eyeballing when the Mun will be where."},{"CreatedByName":"StelarCF","CreatedById":13985,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T11:11:40Z","Content":"In the latest version (0.15) it tells you where you will be captured by the mun/kerbol/minmus/kerbin"}]}
