Originally I planned to develop (For just myself) a standalone engines mod, but I\u0027ve decided that\u0027s too ambitious for my capabilities. I would however like to put my work to some use, and I thought I might try to model some realistic and feasible, tho quite fictional engines using a variety of propellants ranging from kerosene/O2 to B2H6/ClF5 and much more. I recently decided to try RO, and that introduced me to Real Fuels - which comes pre-packed with a huge range of propellants including the aforementioned more hydrazines than I could shake a stick at,\u00A0fluorines, boranes and all sorts of good stuff. But, there\u0027s no engines making use of them. Furthermore, they aren\u0027t really accurately modeled. I remember seeing kerosene\u00A0and oxygen having the same density, but of course they don\u0027t. I would be interested in A. helping more accurately model various propellants in Real Fuels/RO, and B. dreaming up some engines to use them, that could be reasonably considered \u0022Realistic\u0022. I don\u0027t do graphics stuff at all, or really coding, but I can prepare/gather the data in spreadsheet form and balance the engines/propellants\u00A0into tech nodes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA snippet from my previous project:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/YBtIIcr\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/YBtIIcr\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
