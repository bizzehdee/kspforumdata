Two methods of setup that do slightly different things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor actual slats, just set up control surfaces on the leading edge, set pitch/yaw/roll to 0, and enable them as flaps. Then bind them to an action group. These act like active slats.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other way is a control surface on the leading edge, set the pitch/yaw/roll all to 0, set AoA to -100, and control deflection to 40 or so. That makes them point directly into the airflow at all times. They provide no benefit during takeoff/landing (unless you also set them as flaps) but do substantially lower the aircraft\u0027s stall speed automatically, enabling more aerobatic maneuvers. Essentially these act like passive slats.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
