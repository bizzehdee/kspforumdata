What I mean by that is say you want to make your space station less wobbly, you would add an attachment point similar to how you add support struts during construction except that instead of having to connect the other end to something now you could use an engineer later to attach a rod between two of these connection points later allowing for more stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other idea I had (though it would take some work to pull off) is for engineers to be able to actually build a vehicle from parts on-site, i.e. build a mun buggy out of parts stowed in a service bay like they did in the apollo missions. The complexity and size of the object being built would also depend on the skill of the engineer and the time it takes to build it would also be affected by the number/skill of all the engineers working on it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T04:01:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGet Kerbal Attachment System and Kerbal Inventory System.
