Questions about it pop up nearly daily so big thumbs up your way for managing it without having to ask.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally enjoy both rendezvous and docking immensely, so I honestly haven\u0027t timed mine. My first few times took quite some time, can\u0027t give you any numbers but a guesstimate would be around your first time as well. Nowadays it\u0027s more routine and I can do it fairly fast, even so for me it\u0027s one of the most enjoyable things in the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums as well, and again well done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sgt_flyer","CreatedById":57690,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T13:51:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy best time was a rendez-vous in around 11 minutes ingame time - it was not planned, but i ended my circularization after ascent less than 2 km from my target (i directly switched to burn retrograde to target upon seeing this to directly match velocities)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, other than luck or mechjeb, it\u0027s hard to make such interceptions \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-15T14:05:16Z\u0022 title=\u002208/15/2013 02:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by sgt_flyer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spyritdragon","CreatedById":70515,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T13:58:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you mean IRL time, i can do an RV in about five minutes given my current strategy, i.e. enlarge/shrink orbit to catch up to target or let target catch up, timeaccelerate till aforementioned happens, then use maneuver nodes to plan a closest intercept, either around 10 kilometres, timeaccelerate and execute maneuver, or immediately go to 4-5 kilometres.
