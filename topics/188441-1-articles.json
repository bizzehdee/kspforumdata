Ideally, I want to disable the vanilla experience gain system entirely and instead assign XP manually based on my own rules. Is it possible to disable the vanilla xp gain system?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only thing related to experience I could find in the game files is opening my save file with a text editor, where there is:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nextraXP = 0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCAREER_LOG\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0{\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0flight = 15\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[...]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3 = Land,Mun\u003Cbr\u003E\n3 = PlantFlag,Mun\u003Cbr\u003E\n3 = Flyby,Kerbin\u003Cbr\u003E\n3 = Land,Kerbin\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\netc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my guess is that XP is determined by these things in the save file (e.g. 3=PlantFlag,Mun - kerbal has planted a flag on Mun and gets 5 XP), so it could be edited by removing those lines (taking away XP) and adding new ones (e.g. writing in 4=PlantFlag,Duna would add 12.5 XP to the kerbal). And I guess extraXP increases XP by whatever number you type in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my questions are: are those guesses correct? Can the stock XP gain system be disabled/edited, or do I have to edit my savefile and change extraXP/CAREER_LOG?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zer0Kerbal","CreatedById":190933,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-23T09:25:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthis might help:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Experience\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Experience\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VasimrVasimrovich","CreatedById":187919,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-27T06:06:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe wiki page only shows how much XP is granted for specific actions, doesn\u0027t say anything about how it works in the files.
