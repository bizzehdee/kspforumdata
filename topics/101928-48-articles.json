State information is not always visible to the player, so you\u0027d have lots of stackable parts that may look identical, but some of them refuse to stack for no obvious reason. \n\nAnother approach would be to show a stack in the UI, but internally keep a list for the non-stackable modules.

You -might- be able to work around the problem by putting a wrench in seats 2\u002B, that way when the kerbal enters @ seat 1, the other inventories -might- still be intact (have not looked at source code, so cannot say for certain if this would work or not)."},{"CreatedByName":"Gryphon","CreatedById":58513,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T17:25:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Well, s\u0026@%.
