Rozor and Agake were chosen as the first research team for Kelgee Station.

Similar in construction to Kelgee it was speculated by the ground teams to have been built around the same time. After their rendezvous burn was finished, Agake EVA\u0027d over to it and wrestled a few antennas open. The airlocks showed zero pressure inside the station, much like Kelgee, so she skipped the internal tour.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160104_ksp0040_n-t7.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160104_ksp0040_n-t7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe station\u0027s computer appeared to still be running, but no downlink or data transmission was forthcoming. The crew noted the presence of two docked vessels, one without any crew capacity and another that appeared to be a space taxi of some sort. (Wernher was already making plans for it.)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNothing more to do at this Thing, and as such the crew moved on to their actual target, Kelgee.

If they were going to use Kelgee as a primary facility they\u0027d need to launch several more docking adapters, with the one she delivered being only the second on site.
