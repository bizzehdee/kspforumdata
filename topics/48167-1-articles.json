I think what I\u0027m new to is the website. This is only like my 4th or 5th time ever coming to this website and actually looked around. Since I\u0027m new (not, maybe, kinda), is there any advice I should have as to the website? Any good old fashioned tips as to getting along with the people here? Or just how not to be a guy that\u0027s like \u0022WAT I DO?!\u0022?

They used to tell us in the army \u0022when in doubt, pull it out\u0022 and \u0022sound off like you got a pair!\u0022. You probably don\u0027t wanna listen to me. You\u0027ll be the first to get banned before 5 posts.(just kidding). Welcome aboard! There\u0027s no such thing as a bad question. I tried to read through the stickies as much as I could before posting. Most of the info you need to know about what not to bring up and how to use the forums is in there.

You should checkout the challenges topic if you\u0027re looking for some real fun: I once made a probe that could get from Low Kerbin Orbit to Laythe, back again, and back to Laythe. It weighed less than 7 tons, and was only designed for a one-way trip and deorbit. Best of all, it included a rover, 2 weather stations, and a base. The fuselage was made out of xenon tanks. Starter tip: DON\u0027T estimate dV numbers on pen and paper. That\u0027s how I got 4 times the dV I wanted.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
