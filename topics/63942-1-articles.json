I\u0027ve tried to copy the methods but it doesn\u0027t seem to work for me, and I can\u0027t figure out what I\u0027m doing wrong. When I have a rocket blast into a fuel tank, it doesn\u0027t do much. I can get the tank to pop, but only after a very long exposure which drains a large amount of rocket fuel and wastes a large amount of time. Solid rockets seem to work a bit faster, but it\u0027s nothing like the instant decoupling I\u0027ve seen in one video somewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have any tips on how to decouple rockets using engines or other things that aren\u0027t an actual decoupling device?
