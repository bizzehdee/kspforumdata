If I decouple will it be easier for me to push the ship and modify the orbit?

Secondly, once you\u0027re in an orbit, you\u0027ll need to do a Hohmann transfer to get to Jebs orbit as you describe - but you may need to orbit several times to get the timing right. The timing is just as important as the orbit - you can\u0027t \u0027catch up\u0027 to someone when you\u0027re in the same orbit as them, so you must plan your transfer to reach Jeb\u0027s orbit at the same time as he gets there too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWemb\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T04:06:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI covered rendezvous in part one of my docking tutorial series.

Better extend your apoapsis a lot, trying to get one of the nodes (ascending, descending) as far as possible from Kerbin, then equalize the plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for matching the orbits: don\u0027t. You\u0027ll have an utter hell of finding the encounter. Make the orbits intersect (PE below PE of the other, AP above the AP of the other, preferably one pair quite close, the other more distant) and be not very similar. Then seek a good encounter. Matching the orbits without an encounter will make it take ages until you meet the target. You match them only once you\u0027re some 5km away or less (by burning retrograde relative to target).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
