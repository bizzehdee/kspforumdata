So I did. It\u0027s not a criticism. It\u0027s not me bashing you or your work. It\u0027s me gratefully learning for you and (I thought) repaying that with some real world testing/reporting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you put something into the public\u0027s hands, they will apply it under what are often less than optimal conditions. Nonetheless, I have the same issues with any craft I launch, bottom-heavy or otherwise. They can all be launched manually without incident or brute-forcing. I do not have FAR installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll leave you to it. Best of luck gathering feedback.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can\u0027t build a rocket like that. Straight up. It\u0027s common knowledge that things that are controllable by humans may not be by a computer. I\u0027m just giving you hints here. Launch a wide variety of crafts it can do. It probably wont do so well launching a rocket that is built ignoring all physics like they don\u0027t matter. That is far worse than \u0022less than optimal\u0022. I can\u0027t believe that thing actual did as well as it did. Another problem \u003Cstrong\u003Ethat is not your fault at all\u003C/strong\u003E is the fact that deployed coms dishes like that have about FIVE times the drag of any normal part. They should just get ripped off, instead they have a ridiculous breaking strength and they are trying to pull the top of your rocket down. Because the bottom is unnecessarily heavy, that adds up to a combo that is not dynamically stable. That is like putting the fletching on the tip of the arrow instead of the end. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt pretty easy to see if you have a good design or not. Watch the control indicators on the bottom left. If they are constantly swinging to the limit then you have an issue there that is beyond the control stability of the system. You can\u0027t just say that it failed to launch a poorly designed rocket properly. What do you expect me to be able to do about it? It doesn\u0027t launch rovers into space either. It wasn\u0027t designed for that. It is designed to be a starter script that you can tweak to launch your style of crafts. The default values are set to launch a reasonably large number of rockets perfectly fine. What you have here is a case that is far out from the norm. I do appreciate the feed back but saying that the program can\u0027t launch \u003Cstrong\u003Ethat\u003C/strong\u003E rocket is like calling an auto manufacturer to complain that the coffee cup you bought doesn\u0027t fit into the cup holders. Certainly if they are fully adjustable cup holders that you just haven\u0027t taken the time to adjust, that seems a little wacky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst. Adjust the TWR limit. I noticed that your rocket has a TWR of 6.0 as it hits the edge of the atmosphere. You can stop the TWR limit from cutting out at 10k if you so desire. Look at line 190. See where it says \u003Cstrong\u003E \u0022when altitude \u0026gt; turn1 then\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E { set throttleLimit to 0. set tThr to 1. }.\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E Delete the set throttleLimit to 0. line and the set tThr to 1 line. Then add set tTWR to 3. Then it will hold 2.0 TWR until you reach 10k and then increase it to 3. It may be that you need the control authority of full thrust all together. Try setting the throttle limit to off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not that I care about genuine criticism. But you are trying to launch one of the poorest rocket designs that I have seen in a while. I bet with some tweaking it can launch that rocket. Maybe not optimally, but hell the thing has very meager payload and you have it sitting on top of KSP equivalent to the Saturn 5. I\u0027d say that is a pretty edge case. Yes roll control is not added in yet and that is causing some instabilities right of the bat. But the rocket did recover from that. It just didn\u0027t have the control authority to keep it going straight up or to make the G-turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAverage rockets have a TWR of 2.0 approaching 3-4. Not a TWR of 6 by the time you hit 20k. I\u0027m asking if there is something you need to make your rocket easier to fly. Is there some setting that you need that is missing? Is there a part of the script that isn\u0027t functioning correctly? That is what I mean by feed back. Not \u003Cem\u003E this darned thing won\u0027t control my UNIQUE rocket because it\u0027s way out from norm and I haven\u0027t bothered to change one single setting.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is also not possible to launch into an orbit that is lower than 80k with my script unless you have changed the limits your self.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will say this one time and be done with it. This is not Mechjeb. It was never designed to be a MechJeb replacement. It is designed to be a framework that others can use to avoid having to write out an entire script when most things will just require a small change in settings. It is intended that you have some knowledge of this system and for you to be able to make changes where they are needed to fly any rocket to orbit. If you don\u0027t want to be bothered to take the time to learn how to use it. Then you need to use Mechjeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can handle building crappy rockets to test with my self. I built one with a TWR of 15 off the pad just to test my TWR hold. It still managed to orbit and steer that with perfect authority.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I seem harsh because I\u0027m Old. I have no time to mince words nor do I have any desire to do so. If the truth angers you so much then I am the wrong person to discuss it with.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kalista","CreatedById":67544,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-15T20:13:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3_rtxWIUww%5D\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3_rtxWIUww]\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ELast video test I\u0027ll do with this version this time same rocket fired at a 60 degree orbit.
