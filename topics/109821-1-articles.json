Also I use [Remote Tech contract Pack](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106580). But I also use some other mods that change the number of planets (like [OPM](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104280)) which causes some odd behavior with the contract packs. \n\nSI have used the original contract pack as a base but in this pack all the data is dynamically generated using the data in your own install. So it will (should) work no matter the number and name of the planets and moons on your installations.\n\n If you use stock probably the original contract pack is better since it has customized data for each planet/moon. But if you have changed your solar system this will create mission based on your planet names and size.\n\nIt may still need some testing regarding the rewards and I\u0027m still thinking about adding some mission for a complete system (like the Jool system in only one contract) but I hope it works fine.\n\n[**DOWNLOAD**](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/938/ContractPack-RemoteTech%20LITE)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - Have a network relay on homeworld: Requires 3-4 satellites\n\u003E - Have a satellite pointed at (any) moon.\n\u003E - Have a network relay on (any) moon.\n\u003E - Have a satellite pointed at another planet.\n\u003E - Have a satellite pointed at the m oon of another planet\n\u003E - Have a network relay on another planet.\n\u003E - Have a network relay on the moon of another planet\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - Doesn\u0027t start offering relays until a homeworld relay is launched (not necessary to have been done under a contract)\n\u003E - Doesn\u0027t start offering relays until that body is already pointed by a dish (not necessary to have been done under a contract)\n\u003E - Doesn\u0027t start pointing moons until their parent planet is pointed (not necessary to have been done under a contract)\n\u003E - Doesn\u0027t start offering relays networks on moons until their parent is covered by a relay network (not necessary to have been done under a contract)\n\u003E - Doesn\u0027t start offering contracts for another planets until Long Dishes have been discovered.\n\u003E - Doesn\u0027t start to offer contract to planet number 6 (Jool in stock) until gigadish are discovered\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E 1.1 Updated minimum coverage and version number\n\u003E \n\u003E 1.0 Initial version\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n Assumptions: \n\n- It assumes that homeworld is a planet (not a moon).\n\nMods Requierements: \n\n- Remote Tech [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83305](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83305).

I\u0027m currently using the RemoteTech contract pack for the Contract Configuration mod. I use OPM also.

Correct?"},{"CreatedByName":"KaiserSoze","CreatedById":117446,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T18:00:18Z","Content":"Yep, thats the idea.\n\nHowever it will not break anything if you use both (on my tests). Also you will never receive more than 3 contracts in total of both (in order to not saturate you). But if you keep the old one you will receive contract for eelo as it was still a planet. \n\nI have plans for a better use of the original one because with LITE there are 2 thing that are lost right now.\n\n- There are no contracts for a whole planetary system (I think I knwo how to do it, but not sure I want to have contract for a whole planetary system).\n\n- Text are VERY generic. I have plans to have some texts to be used if the planet/moon selected is known (by me at least). Once I have it it will use the specific text if its a know (or important) celestial body, and use a generic one if not.\n\nLatest version of contract configurator allows to do both things, so I may decide to do it later on."},{"CreatedByName":"Perry Apsis","CreatedById":97519,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-02T02:30:24Z","Content":"Hi, [@KaiserSoze](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/117446-kaisersoze/).
