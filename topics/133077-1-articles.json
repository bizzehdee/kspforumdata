mounting them radially, they can be considerably farther forward than they would if they were mounted underneath.\u00A0 This means that my tug has a much smaller moment of inertia around the forward

suggestion for usability/convenience:\u00A0 you could add some radially-mounted 1.25m docking ports so that you could use the tug as a convenient refueling tank for smaller ships.\u00A0 One option would be to rotate the placement of your radial nukes by 45 degrees, so you could put a foursome of 1.25m ports on the four \u0022sides\u0022 of the central tanks.\u00A0 However, that\u0027s not optimally convenient, since anything docking there would have to thread its way between the nukes.\u00A0 A more convenient option might be to do something like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\ninstead of mounting the reaction wheels directly to the radial decouplers, put a 2-ton LF tank on each radial decoupler\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nthen mount the reaction wheels and nukes above/below that LF tank\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMove the radiators that are currently sticking out of the reaction wheels so that they\u0027re attached to the big central tank, in between the nukes\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThis gives a nice, large, blank place on the outer surface of the little 2-ton LF tanks-- perfect for putting a docking port on, nicely accessible.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt also moves the radiators where they\u0027re less likely to get snapped off by another ship passing nearby.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nMight be worth giving the tug a couple of little radially-attached monopropellant tanks (even if it doesn\u0027t need monoprop and you leave the tanks empty).\u00A0 Adds operational flexiblity-- you can use it to deliver monoprop if needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne option to consider (not necessary, just a thought):\u00A0 you could use the rotate tool to angle the nukes very slightly outward.\u00A0 This would give you a slight amount of extra flexibility in designing the craft that your tug can pull:\u00A0 by angling the exhaust outward, you give a smidgeon more clearance, so the tug can pull a slightly wider load.\u00A0 Of course, that means you\u0027ll lose a little bit of fuel efficiency, but it ought to be fine as long as you keep the angle small.\u00A0 For example, if you go just one \u0022click\u0022 of the rotate tool while holding the shift key down, that\u0027s a 5 degree rotation, which would cost you less than half of 1% of your fuel efficiency in cosine losses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-29T05:04:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes it is much simpler to have 2 sr docking ports so the

Vernor\u0027s need, or else switching to standard RCS and slashing the existing 16 Vernor\u0027s to 8 standard RCS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese are both good plans.\u00A0 It\u0027s good to have a bit of overcapacity for various resources on your tug, so it can serve as a \u0022mini tanker\u0022 for topping off other ships, or taking on board their spare resources if they don\u0027t need them anymore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI myself tend not to use Vernors, mainly because I use RCS very sparingly in my own designs and need only tiny nudges, so monopropellant is fine for me.\u00A0 Another thing to bear in mind is that when the tug is doing its thing, it\u0027s going to be connected to another ship (which will likely be more massive than the tug itself), which means that when you\u0027re maneuvering the combination of the two, they\u0027ll be using \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eall\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E the RCS thrusters (mono or Vernor) together, and sharing fuel for all of them.\u00A0 So, for example, if you decide to go with monopropellant-only and ditch the Vernors, it would be good to have a bit of overcapacity for your monopropellant, so that you can use the tug\u0027s mono supply to power the \u0022payload\u0022 ship\u0027s RCS thrusters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s also a really good idea to make sure that your \u0022payload\u0022 ships or containers have some RCS thrusters of their own, even if they don\u0027t have a probe core or a monopropellant supply, because then those thrusters will become available to the tug when it\u0027s docked.\u00A0 It will make maneuvering much easier, because you \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ereally\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E don\u0027t want a situation where you have a long, skinny, massive object (tug \u002B payload) that has all its RCS thrusters way out on one end (i.e. on the tug, with nothing on the payload)-- it\u0027ll make for extremely wasteful docking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0022right\u0022 way will depend on what sort of cargo you have in mind for your tug (e.g. complete ships, or simple dumb cargo tanks, or whatever).\u00A0 For example, suppose it\u0027s shuffling simple dumb tanks around.\u00A0 In that case a typical payload might be:\u00A0 a fuel tank with a docking port at one or both ends, and a simple ring of four one-directional RCS thrusters around the tank\u0027s \u0022equator\u0022.\u00A0 That\u0027s a useful setup even if the payload has zero monopropellant storage of its own, because when you dock the tug to it, the tug can make use of the RCS thrusters on the tank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium

The reversible thrust especially, as I really hate having to undock to rotate just to start applying counter-thrust. And ultra-low part count sort of ties in with the part casting suggestion that we\u0027ve all wanted for ages. Big enough to see and click things, yet small enough to maneuver easily around crowded stations. Radios so it ties in with RemoteTech users.\u00A0I\u0027m assuming that I will be able to fly it unmanned, so if it were somewhat expanded for crewing it can double from a space bulldozer to moving crews around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor another idea, since it\u0027s your modded craft, how about adding wing \u0027deflection\u0027 to the engine pods so it can also benefit from angling the pods?

I could integrate some RCS into a larger version of the radial NVs... someone else suggested a end cap/service bay shaped similar to the command pod, I think it would work as well as endcap/servicebay/dronecore\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
