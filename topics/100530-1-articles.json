The higher the orbit, the slower the orbital velocity and the more easily you can correct it."},{"CreatedByName":"42_aerobrake_passes","CreatedById":114147,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T23:21:27Z","Content":"Depending on how over-engineered your launch was, it\u0027s often possible to raise your apoapsis to be just short of leaving the SOI, then burn retrograde at the new apoapsis to turn around. It\u0027s the situation as large inclination changes (after all, going retrograde is basically just a 180 degree change in inclination); with the much slower velocity at the top of a highly elliptical orbit, making major changes to your direction is much cheaper, to the point of the saving exceeding the cost of getting your apoapsis up that high then getting it down again. With a sufficiently large amount of dv on reaching low orbit, it\u0027s possible to satisfy several orbit contracts with the same launch, even if some of them are retrograde to the others."}]}
