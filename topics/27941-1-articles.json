It makes sense for an app like mine, I am copying to a mobile device to take with me. If that is the function of it and I take it by your post that it is then I still have to copy it off of my pc to a thumb drive. Can\u0027t I just do that from the KSP folder, what is the real need for this. You need to add a browser popup allowing me to save it to a thumb drive. That would make this feature usable, as it is I can do the same thing just as easy without using your app.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t started on adding mods yet but just looking at the screen looks very confusing.
