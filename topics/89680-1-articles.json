By using them instead of rockets you save a lot of fuel, which means you also don\u0027t have to worry about staging and throwing-away expensive engines just for efficiency. A vehicle that takes-off like a rocket can benefit from that too (eg; \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99277-M%C3%BCn-challenge?p=1528204\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1528204\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u0027s one I just finished\u003C/a\u003E) but it is relative hard to land one vertically.
