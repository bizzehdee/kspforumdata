In this edition we start at the current year, i.e. Year 1, Day 1, 0h, 0m as displayed whenever one of us takes control of a new save game. Then we go \u003Cem\u003Ebackward\u003C/em\u003E just a little bit at a time, listing important events that led up to that point and then what events led up to those. The game will of course end when we reach the Big Bang, but who\u0027s to say how many billions of posts that will take?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRules!\u003Cbr\u003E\n- No repeated MLP, Homestuck, Doctor Who, etc. references. I hate to call out specific fandoms like this but we\u0027ve all seen what can happen. If the Kau or the KIONICLEs want to make one or two cursory appearances I won\u0027t press F9, but we\u0027ll all be sad if the thread derails and crashes.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Don\u0027t jump back zillions of years at once. I don\u0027t want to see the second or third post be \u0022Year -13750000000: The Big Bang. Thread Locked.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n- No other horrible thread-killing events. Since we\u0027re going backward in time it\u0027s very hard to say \u0022Year 5: Kerbol explodes,\u0022 but I don\u0027t doubt people\u0027s creativity in coming up with ways to ruin everything. ;P\u003Cbr\u003E\n- No going forward in time! If someone violates Rule 2 and jumps back too many years, you can try to fill in the gap with a few events, but don\u0027t go forgetting and posting stuff going forward in time or we\u0027ll all get very lost and confused very fast.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- I reserve the right to add a few new rules in case some nasty contingency appears. Also if a post is exceptionally stupid I reserve the right to mark it as \u0022non-canon,\u0022 but as much as possible I\u0027d like to leave it to the people in the thread to fix problems with clever narratives.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cs\u003EExamples\u003C/s\u003E last few events, to get the ball rolling:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYear 1, Day 1\u003C/strong\u003E: The official Kerbal Space Program opens its doors for its first day of business at the newly constructed Kerbal Space Center.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELate Year 0 BK\u003C/strong\u003E (Before Kerbal Space Program): The Mark 1 Pod memorial is erected to commemorate the long service of the now-retired Mark 1 Pod.
