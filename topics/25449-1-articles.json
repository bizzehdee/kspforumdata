I set out to design a craft that would make use of the SAS systems tendancy to over correct and turn it into an organic oscilation. In short, I was trying to design a new type of aircraft that was organic looking and swam through the air like a fish or an insect. I didn\u0027t expect to uncover a new method of propulsion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn effect I have developed a craft that can propel itself simply by flexing it\u0027s body, like a fish swaying it\u0027s body back and forth to propel itself through the water. I created a craft built of segmented sections with one pair of wings each, and then assembled a half dozen of these into a long and flexible aircraft. The way it works is that the control surfaces in the front are in 180 to the ones in the rear causing the entire fuselage to bend under extreme control inputs. Once released, the fuselage straightens back up which whips the wings out and propels the craft forward. It does this many times a second and the result is up to 200m/s without an engine, at sea level. Even a rocket motor can\u0027t make a small craft go this fast. Yet I\u0027m able to achieve it with a huge, very weird looking craft, and without any engines or thrusters pushing me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause it needs to bend in order to work, for take off you must still use regular propulsion. You lift off at 50m/s and shutdown the engine. Then you can begin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you turn on SAS it will begin undulating like the legs of a millipede in a corkscrew type motion. I\u0027ve set it up for steady propulsion as SAS corrects back and forth. This is mode A. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMode B is turning SAS off and using up and down oscilations manually using the keyboard to create a wave like undulation along the length of the fuselage, this propels the entire craft at great speed. It propels the craft through the air, similar to the way those new water bicycles propel people on hydroplanes through the water, with an up and down flapping motion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a video. Enjoy. I will post a tutorial on how to build one later. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/IzxV1yP4kJw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thes50","CreatedById":13495,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-04T18:04:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah this is the infini-glide glitch, it\u0027s well known.
