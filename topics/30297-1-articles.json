We have enough applications for the first stage of KSP-TV. When we are ready to take on more broadcasters we will open the application again.

If you are a Twitch live-streamer, this is your opportunity to shine. We\u0027re looking for mature individuals that know how to showcase KSP and all of it\u0027s amazing facets. We\u0027re interested in any type of KSP related or themed programming. We\u0027re going to have live streams, pre-recorded shows, live interview/talk shows, as well as any other type of show that we think the fans will watch. This is your chance to work with SQUAD and the Community Manager to promote KSP to it\u0027s fullest potential!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;You will be expected to hold to a certain level of broadcast standards as our rules for KSP-TV are no different from our other properties. Each broadcaster will be expected to be punctual and on time both starting and ending their show in consideration of each other. You will need a Google account (so we can share documents and the Schedule Calendar) and Skype for access to the KSP-TV Control Room. You will also need 2 video clips (15 sec \u0026amp; 30 sec) promoting your show. This can be as simple as static screens with text or some fancy animation.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;We are looking to start with a group of 10 broadcasters and will add more once we have any kinks worked out of the system. People willing to commit to a regularly scheduled weekly show will get first picks at time slots.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;!--\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;iframe src=\u0022https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1SRIrMHq_ufBq8z18b05PYwzqu6wGmmbW_uxQQ6MYJXY/viewform?embedded=true\u0022 width=\u0022760\u0022 height=\u0022500\u0022 frameborder=\u00221\u0022 marginheight=\u00220\u0022 marginwidth=\u00220\u0022\u0026gt;Loading...\u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E// --\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-01T17:12:16Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2013 05:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Capt\u0026#39;n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
