Basically, I just want to know what the ISP is if I have the atmospheric pressure for the point of the atmosphere that I am calculating for. Can anyone point me in the right direction?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T00:38:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt might be easiest to do this graphically, the atmosphereCurve in each of the engines\u0027 configs gives you your two points, e.g. 320s at 1 atmosphere, 370s in vacuum.
