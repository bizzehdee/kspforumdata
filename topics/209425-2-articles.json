A good example are the early X58 chipsets.

Now you\u0027ll need two things, Fittings, and tubing. As a measure of reliability, its usually a good idea to get your fittings and tubing from the same manufacturer. it helps ensure that nomenclature and any possible measuring differences are a complete non-issue. it can happen that they both run a 1/2ID, but one is 1/8 thick, the other isn\u0027t, and you\u0027ll not be able to get a good fit if you used compression fittings. by sticking to the same manufacturer, they tend to have a single line of tubing, or will generally state which models of fittings are compatible when you select your tubing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor tubing im a fan of Primochill Tubing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.frozencpu.com/products/17584/ex-tub-1573/PrimoChill_PrimoFlex_Advanced_LRT_Tubing_12ID_x_34_OD_-_Clear_PFLEXA-34.html?tl=g30c99s1614\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.frozencpu.com/products/17584/ex-tub-1573/PrimoChill_PrimoFlex_Advanced_LRT_Tubing_12ID_x_34_OD_-_Clear_PFLEXA-34.html?tl=g30c99s1614\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethats a good solid choice right there. if its a first time build, buy extra. if you change your mind about how your tubing will be laid out, it would suck to not have enough tubing to complete the build if you\u0027ve already cut some of it. For a full size ATX tower, you can expect to eat quite a bit of tubing. I bought 12ft, and had less than 6in left when I was done, and i\u0027d planned it all out in advance. 18 ft is not a bad idea by any means, extra is always good, its not like it goes bad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe aware of wall thickness in your tubing. you can get 1/2in ID tubing that is 3/4 or 5/8 OD(outer Diameter), and if you go with compression fittings, its very important that they be the right size or you will not achieve the compression needed to seal tightly. For barb fittings with clamps, you clamp down on the tube, so OD doesn\u0027t really matter, but ID still needs to match up with your barbs or this might get interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome people have chosen to go with a slightly smaller tube ID than their barbs. it makes for a VERY tight fit, but its also much more difficult to get your tubing over the one size too large fittings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that you have tubing, you have one last decision for your loop, what fittings. i have tried both barb and compression fittings. They both work if you put in enough care to do a good job. Compression fittings need more space as they are wider around the outside, so its something to be aware of. The recurring theme here is research, know the measurements, and pay attention so you don\u0027t have any surprises. its like the old saying measure twice cut once, except in this case, measure twice, purchase once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.frozencpu.com/products/11501/ex-tub-172/Bitspower_Chrome_G14_Barb_Fitting_-_12_ID_BP-WTP-C01.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.frozencpu.com/products/11501/ex-tub-172/Bitspower_Chrome_G14_Barb_Fitting_-_12_ID_BP-WTP-C01.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethose are the barbs I went with, no leaks, no problems of any kind, on a pump that easily maintains a 50PSI working pressure.

Well, you can\u0027t do anything about that except to add more fluid. Your pump can burn out if you let it run out of fluid, and your parts don\u0027t cool well/at all if there\u0027s no fluid passing through them, so you definitely need to keep enough in your loops. You can\u0027t miss it if the fluid level gets low, the pump makes quite a bit of noise when it eats an air bubble so you will know when the fluid level gets low. its kind of like how a garden hose makes little noises when it has air bubbles in it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA reservoir holds another few hundred mL of fluid so you need not babysit the loop, you can let it run for a long while and when it gets low, one quick top up and all is good again for quite some time.

If you get a reservoir, remember to add two more fittings(and clamps if necessary) to connect it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuick disconnects, these can be very useful, or an unneeded expense. its one of those personal choice things. Where they can come in handy is that you can put a male/female paring in between any parts, and you can then sever your line there with little to no mess or fuss. GPU dies, pop the quick disconnects, put in a new GPU, attach a length of tub with disconnects on it and continue on without the GPU in your loop. No fuss, quick and easy. Bought a New GPU and it arrived before the waterblocks did?, no biggie. Unhook your GPU form the loop using the quick disconnects, reconnect the loop without the GPU, install your new GPU, and carry on as if nothing ever happened. When the block arrives, mount it, attach tubing, quick disconnects, mount, attach to loop, carry on gaming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately they are quite a bit more costly than fittings, about 8 times more for good ones, lol. The beauty of fittings and quick disconnects and well, everything except your blocks is that you never need to buy new ones if you like the ones you have.

What it is is a 4pin molex connecter that plugs into a wall outlet. it lets you provide power to your pump, without having to turn your system on, or short the pins in the motherboard cable to make the PSU believe its just been told to turn on. So why is it worth having? Well, its not a good idea to run your system with no cooling, and when you first try to fill your loop, you\u0027ll need the pump running to achieve that, and don\u0027t want your parts to over heat. Same goes for draining. you can briefly run the pump to raise the line pressure so you dran much more quickly, just be ready to yank its power when it starts to run dry. The pump is usually cooled by the fluid it passes, so you only get a few seconds of dry running before you\u0027ll burn it out, brief moments of dry operation, such as fill and drain operations won\u0027t hurt it as long as they\u0027re over quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehere\u0027s the two types. here\u0027s a bypass that jumpers the wires so your PSU things its plugged in and told to start, plug this in and your PSU is on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.frozencpu.com/products/1102/cab-21/FrozenCPUcom_ATX_Power_Supply_Bypass_Adapter.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.frozencpu.com/products/1102/cab-21/FrozenCPUcom_ATX_Power_Supply_Bypass_Adapter.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI prefer this thing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.frozencpu.com/products/9106/bus-192/AC_to_DC_Adapter_-_110V_AC_to_12V_DC_Converter_w_Standard_4_Pin_5000mA_Max.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.frozencpu.com/products/9106/bus-192/AC_to_DC_Adapter_-_110V_AC_to_12V_DC_Converter_w_Standard_4_Pin_5000mA_Max.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMuch easier to unplug quickly giving you greater control over how long its powered, plus you don\u0027t have to unplug your motherboard to run the pump for a moment, or unplug everything else.

Nothing will kill your cooling performance like a little bit of crap plugging up your blocks or radiator.

A good one can give you an actual readout of the flow rate, so you can monitor it and get some advance warning on things like your pump dying off and losing power, or your lines becoming clogged and harder to push fluid through. Keeping an eye on your temps can do the same thing though, as either a clogged line in a block, or reduced flor rate will cost you in increased temperatures, so when your temps start rising its time to clean the system anyways. one thing it IS good for is a quicker alert to pump failure.

Arguably the most useful of the sensors. Keeping an eye on your fluid temp gives you a very good idea of whether your radiator is effectively doing its job or not. If you work your system hard, and the temp in the reservoir doesn\u0027t rise at all, you have a very effective radiator, if on the other hand it shoots up, you either don\u0027t have enough radiator capability:too small, or not efficient enough, or its in need of a cleaning. Of course, if your fluid temperature rises, it won\u0027t take on as much heat, so your temps will rise, and if your watching those......common theme that...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.frozencpu.com/cat/l3/g30/c229/s579/list/p1/Liquid_Cooling-Liquid_Cooling_Safety-Liquid_Temp_Sensors-Page1.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.frozencpu.com/cat/l3/g30/c229/s579/list/p1/Liquid_Cooling-Liquid_Cooling_Safety-Liquid_Temp_Sensors-Page1.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPressure valves. They can be a good idea if you experience large temperature shifts in your fluid, such as if the indoor temp can\u0027t be effectively controlled(gets warm indoors in the summer even with AC, or no AC at all?). As temperatures rise, so does pressure. nothing sucks more than having one of your fittings let go because the loop pressures got too high. Its not a particularly significant risk if all is done well, and the reservoir has a small air pocket that the pressure can squeeze. Still, it is one, and at 500l/hr pump capability, your 2l loop capacity will be gone almost before you can unplug the system if you blow a line. in practice you\u0027ll have more time than that implies, as the pump only achieves 500l/Hr with no resistance, every block you add increases resistance, so its definitely flowing slower, how fast requires a flow sensor to determine......\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.frozencpu.com/cat/l3/g30/c229/s1382/list/p1/Liquid_Cooling-Liquid_Cooling_Safety-Pressure_Valve-Page1.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.frozencpu.com/cat/l3/g30/c229/s1382/list/p1/Liquid_Cooling-Liquid_Cooling_Safety-Pressure_Valve-Page1.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EControllers. If your a control nut or thrive on sensor readouts, these are for you. Expensive, and entirely unnecessary, they are none the less cool. Pretty much all of them can control the pump speed to reduce what little noise it does make, and many of them can read info from any number of sensors and display it in a windows ap, or trigger alarms, or shutdowns of the system. the last feature is likely the only reason to really consider these in my opinion. Suppose you go out for a minute and blow a line.....would be great if your system could say oh shi...all by itself, and shut down. The danger is no worse than a fan failure on your GPU or CPU, which is a very real risk even for stock systems, its like car insurance. have to have it, when was the last time you actually needed it? of course, if you need it and don\u0027t have it?
