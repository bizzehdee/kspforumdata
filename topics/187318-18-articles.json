I think beginning the tilt at Duna would be a good idea instead, since going there is generally the first interplanetary step. The Mun is basically at zero eccentricity to allow players to first handle the concept of orbital transfers, and Minmus then adds inclined orbits. Duna then adds eccentricity, so I\u0027d argue it\u0027s also a good case for introducing some light axial tilt.

None that I know of, at least around Kerbin. It affects getting into interplanetary orbits, but nothing before that. Are you perhaps thinking that zero-inclination orbits would end up effectively being inclined by the amount of tilt? Not so.
