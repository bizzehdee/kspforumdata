Took me a while to figure out how to cram 7k dV into a Klaw ship (with KIDS \u0022real-life\u0022 setting), but I managed it and a launcher that could orbit it.\n\nSo here I am, in an 80k LKO, in the same plane as the incoming rock. The rock is on an impact trajectory, so I need to do a stright line, head on intercept. Now I\u0027ve set up a maneuver node and make sure its apoapsis is on the line of target\u0027s course. I run the prograde out until the \u0022Target position at intersect 1\u0022 and the apoapsis are as close as I can get them.\n\nHere\u0027s a screenshot\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/yqb35r8vxi2efwd/ARM_node.GIF?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yqb35r8vxi2efwd/ARM_node.GIF?dl=0)\n\nI think this is the right way to go about it, but I can\u0027t seem to get my intercept precise enough to come within rendezvous range. Never at any time during my node setup or burn do I get an intercept marker with an actual seperation distance. I\u0027m thinking I could maybe use the Kerbal Alarm Clock\u0027s closest approach option to roughly get my burn right, but I\u0027d love to be able to get it right with the node beforehand. What do you guys usually do for these sorts of ARMs?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-01T13:53:42Z\u0022 title=\u002204/01/2015 01:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NFunky**\n  \nParagraph spacing was wrong"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T14:20:02Z","Content":"Target position at intersect is only half the equation, the other important bit is -your- position at intersect, which I can see from your picture is on the far side of Kerbin close to your periapsis. That\u0027s why you aren\u0027t getting a rendezvous node. You can try right clicking on your maneuver node and adding an orbit to it (which will add a full revolution to the T- time) and see if your nodes get closer. If they do, you can keep adding orbits until you\u0027re close enough, then adjust your flight path as necessary. If they don\u0027t, you\u0027ll need to take another approach.\n\nAlso, heading in the opposite direction as the asteroid is going to make the capture harder, since you have to consider your relative speed to your target object. Since you will be heading towards each other, that relative speed is going to be much higher and you\u0027ll have to cancel it almost completely out to safely make contact with the object. If it\u0027s only a redirect mission, you\u0027d probably be better off approaching from behind in the same heading, and maneuvering to latch on in a radial position, pushing the asteroid away from Kerbin without trying to slow it down. \n\nYou can take the latter bit with a grain of salt, I\u0027ve only ever done one asteroid capture mission.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-01T14:27:08Z\u0022 title=\u002204/01/2015 02:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo**"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T15:47:52Z","Content":"ARM missions can be hard... \n\nAs Randazzo says, the best way is get your relative velocity at closest approach to a minimum.\n\nEg you could get a kerbin escape, then adjust your solar orbit to intersect the asteroids orbit before it enters Kerbins SOI. This should significantly reduce the dV costs, as only a small velocity change is required to alter the ateroids course when you are further away from Kerbin.\n\nIf however the asteroid is inside kerbins SOI your best option might be to launch to an orbit wich is going the same way as the ateroid will when it passes Kerbin, taking account of the inclination, as launching to an inclined orbit is cheaper than making an inclination change burn while in LKO. Once in LKO you could raise your ap and then try getting a close approach to the asteroid as far from Kerbin as possible.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-01T15:51:50Z\u0022 title=\u002204/01/2015 03:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheXRuler**"},{"CreatedByName":"radonek","CreatedById":84077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T16:26:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6You can try right clicking on your maneuver node and adding an orbit to it (which will add a full revolution to the T- time) and see if your nodes get closer.

As others have remarked what you\u0027re trying to do is hard, but I\u0027ve done it and it\u0027s not impossible.\n\nHead-on intercept is easy, but most call that \u0022impact\u0022. You need to match the asteroid\u0027s orbit, in whatever SOI the asteroid is in at the time you intercept it. If it is in Kerbin SOI and on a collision course with the planet, the intercepting ship also needs to be on a collision course. Another way to think of it: pretend the asteroid isn\u0027t there at all, and you are fulfilling a contract to match its orbit.\n\nI think the intercept you\u0027re showing is about as good as you\u0027re going to get given the velocity involved. I would fly the ship out on that elliptical track and then just thrust straight at the asteroid as it approaches. You do this by putting the navball in \u0027target\u0027 mode and thrusting like crazy to \u0022pull\u0022 your prograde marker onto the marker showing direction to target. Then as you approach you need to match its velocity. You do this by thrusting even crazier to \u0022push\u0022 your retrogade marker onto target direction--ideally slowing your velocity relative to target to zero as your distance to target goes to zero.\n\nYou may find yourself running out of delta V as you do this. I would be surprised if you have enough left, even after intercepting, to shift a class E rock out of a terminal trajectory. My big tugship has several thousand m/s dV on its own, but only about 150 when attached to 3000 tons of asteroid... that\u0027s why I needed to run a refueling intercept in Kerbin SOI, but by that point the rock was already half captured and I just needed to prevent its escape.
