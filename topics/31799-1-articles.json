The Kerbals are green because before the apocalypse, humans genetically tampered themselves to live off solar energy. This payed off because as you can tell, there are no animals to eat, no grass to chew, nor apples to pick. They\u0027re green because of the chlorophyll in their skin cells to give them the nutrients they need. This also explains why the Kerbals can survive in a capsule with no oxygen tanks; they produce their own. \u0022But what about the space industry? That surely can\u0027t exist in a post-apocalypse world, right?\u0022 Wrong. These humans-now-Kerbals preserved the only things that could give them salvation: \u003Cstrong\u003Ethe Human-Now-Kerbal Space Center.\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only things preserved were the best candidate for human survival: space colonization which, unfortunately, was funded too late.
