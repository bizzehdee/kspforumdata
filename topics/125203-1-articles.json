Is this some sort of drag from extreme upper atmosphere? Does is have to do with Kerbin\u0027s movement around the sun? Is it a unique phenomenon only suffered by polar orbits?

Although generally orbits below 100km are less stable. (Yes, I see you are at 120km.) If you are waiting for the mapping, time warp also makes the orbit more stable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aethon","CreatedById":110755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T18:13:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure about this version, but previously any clipped parts will cause orbits to change in unexpected ways. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a shame.
