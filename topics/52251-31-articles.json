This gave me an angle that allowed me to finish climbing on the ladder and then slide toward the hatch door to grab a hold of it. I then did a second EVA with the leg still raised (this is when the picture was taken). To get back on, I raised the leg, got on the ladder and repeated the same steps again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERefueling Mission:\u003C/strong\u003E I think I misinterpreted what a refueling mission was.

Therefore, you need more fuel, in order to bring that empty/full ratio further down, which in turn gives you more fuel to carry around. (which ruins the thrust to weight ratio you wanted to increase in the first place, and makes the ship formidable kraken bait). This is especially important when landing on Tylo: Nukes are no good there, since they have a terrible thrust to weight ratio, which requires additional engines and again, fuel tanks. If you are to land 10 tons, maybe consider a cluster of the 48S engines - they are not as efficient as the LV-N, but their weight is a fraction of the LV-N, which, given the nature of the Ln-function, results in better delta-v yield. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI post this because I see a lot of space ships that, I admit, look cool with all 20 LV-Ns running, but also a lot of people posting problems with ship sizes and fuel requirements. Of course, if you have to haul 10 tons of equipment around Jool, you may want to have more thrust to execute the maneuvers on time, however, quick burns come at a terrible price, which brings us to the beginning of the post \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SSSPutnik","CreatedById":91745,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-15T12:44:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m doing the Kethane challenge, carrying probes and a return module, I\u0027m not aiming to reduce weight.
