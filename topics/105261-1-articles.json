What I have experienced with previous updates is that it would be a quite awhile before all the mods that I consider essential (Mechjeb, Kerbal Engineer, Enhanced Navball, atmospheric trajectories, ship manifest, and more recently added to my essential list Kerbal attachment system.) The wait would be even longer (some times two or more months) for my favorite mods to be updated. (like rastor prop moniter, vessel viewer, launch countdown, probe control room, remote tech, procedural fairings, procedural parts, and tac life support).\n\nMany times it would be frustrating as I wait week after week for some of the mods to be update, and some times weeks would turn into months. So I was pleasantly surprised after steam updated KSP to 1.0, that many mod authors of my essential mods and even some of my favorite mods were hard at work in updating their mods to 1.0. I am very excited to get started, and hopeful that with in a week or two I will have most of my essential mods so that I can start getting used to the new game mechanics, and I am even more hopeful that from the end of may to even mid June I will have many of my favorite mods available.\n\nAgain, Kudos to all those mod makers that are working hard to get their mods compatible with 1.0 and improving our enjoyment of KSP."}]}
