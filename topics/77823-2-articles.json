You can\u0027t win Kerbal. You can win Civ. And hence you can lose Civ. But not being able to win at Kerbal kinda precludes being able to lose at Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESim City is a much closer comparison, and one that - like you - I\u0027ve failed at multiple times yet happily ground through the tech or funds once more so I can implement subways for the thousandth time. I\u0027d say the difference here is systems. Essentially in Sim City the systems are unknown to the player - the replay value, and happiness at failure, comes from trying to figure out just how quickly you can push commercial \u0026amp; hi-tech industry, when will the middle classes get grumpy at lack of mass transit, how much can I let crime rise in the poor housing areas before my dirty industry employees get grumpy and move out? There are a huge number of variables which are infinitely complex, placing a park a tile to the left will set up a chain reaction affecting the rest of your city.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Kerbal however, the systems are actually fairly simple. And well known. There exists a handful of planets and a handful of moons. You can orbit these bodies. You can land on these bodies. You can return from these bodies. The replay value comes from the Lego factor - you can do this in a thousand different ways but none of them will be necessarily better or worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther, with Sim City there exists a point where you\u0027ve got everything, where a city is bustling and the map is full, where enjoyment comes from restarting.

It\u0027s a place where you don\u0027t get hurt. It\u0027s for beginners. In every game I\u0027ve ever played it\u0027s been for beginners...hence the name sandbox.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
