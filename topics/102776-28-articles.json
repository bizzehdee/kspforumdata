I know what you mean - My current game is using New Horizons, sadly with a number of its. the planets cut out due to memory/speed issues. I then moved the remaining planets around, to mantain interesting configurations, and made Kerbol many times bigger and moved all the bodies orbiting it further out (by 1.5x).

This coincided with me updating Kopernicus and to a new version of New Horizons. I noticed after this update that in the tracking center about half of my ships that were already in play were listed as \u0022escape trajectory\u0022 from the sun with linear orbits going off to a new galaxy. I had to go through and actually fly each of these ships for the orbit to be recalculated as what it was intended to be. Is it possible updates to NH/Kopernicus may cause small changes to orbits or that they are recalculated slightly different from what they initially were when they get updated at some point?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
