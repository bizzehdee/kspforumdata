Prairie dog holes, as another option - probably modelled as a ridge of earth with a black centre. Algal colonies, if you can do them on the surface of water - or even just on the ground, as long as the surface samples from that biome give a hint as to their nature. If you can do things that glow, bioluminescent plants would be ace. Dried bones. Boulders with fossils. Velociraptors. Simple green foliage. Nests with eggs. Eyeball plants. A tardis. Tall crystals/ice shards.\n\n...I\u0027ll stop now.\n\nAlthough... if there\u0027s one major big thing I\u0027d love to see; rivers.
