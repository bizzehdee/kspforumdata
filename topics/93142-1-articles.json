This would be helpful to deal with attached sub assemblies that don\u0027t depend of the main staging to be used, but are attached to decouplers, for example. If you have a big vessel with a lot of stages, it becomes pretty hard to find out where your stage that shouldn\u0027t be activated is and increases the risk of you misplacing it on the order. Once you remove them from action groups, they return to the staging column.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother nice thing would be to have command order priority for action groups, much like staging. You can decide in which order things get done by creating groups for different actions. This would give an easier implementation to the prior suggestion, since you could just set the entire staging sequence as an action group of the \u0027Stage\u0027 category, pretty much like landing gear and lights get automatically assigned to their respective groups in the Action Groups tab.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
