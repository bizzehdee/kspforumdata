For example: If you gathered 2000 science over the whole course of career mode and you have only reached into orbit, then the contracts should be bumped up, telling them to get in orbit around the moon. This would make the player have to think of how to get further and not just sit there gathering resources.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"arkie87","CreatedById":103434,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-20T21:23:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Busterundead\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Busterundead\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have found and used a really easy way to exploit the contract system in the new update.

In doing so you eventually--after acquiring lots of science through means other than experiments outside kerbin-- were offered contracts with large science rewards for testing parts in/on kerbin? If so, that does seem silly, but how did you acquire so much science without leaving kerbin? Did you just test the crap out of parts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-20T21:38:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHigh reward contracts come from having high reputation (which comes from doing alot of contracts)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s why you have those contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, the contract system obviously needs a little reballancing, it\u0027s only the first version.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-21T00:00:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethe repeating contracts(transmit science from space around ______, plant flag on _______, ect...) gives you reason to build permanent bases, have satellite networks and so fourth. now ideally you dont have bases until after a few manned return missions, but still, you see what im saying?
