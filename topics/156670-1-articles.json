Let\u0027s say you would get like a collectible!

The ball of dirt would be animated and changed its visuals to represent the biome/planet it came from.

Each body would unlock you one (or several) flags. Maybe even milestones could do that? Go abouve 70km and get a nice flag with stars on it.\u00A0Also companies.
