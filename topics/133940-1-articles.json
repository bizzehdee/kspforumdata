However, 1.1 is bringing about changes in wheel physics, so it would be best to form new conclusions after we all see what that\u0027s like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-11T12:51:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoesn\u0027t do everything you are looking for but it does allow for adjustable wheel grip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/87737-ksp-v105-stock-bug-fix-modules-release-v105a4-25-jan-16/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Matt77","CreatedById":69015,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-11T13:06:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdjustable suspension would be handy too, on legs as well as wheels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
