Yay! Except now all my aircraft controls are inverted (or un-inverted, since ksp was always inverted). to be more precise, un-edited aircraft fly fine, but the moment I change something in the\u00A0SPH the ailerons want to push the nose down (when I\u0027m pressing D, which should make the nose go up). The worst part about this is the reactions wheels are still working the right directions, and SAS cannot tell that the ailerons are working the wrong direction so it plows the plane into the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappens with all craft, even stock ones (if they are edited).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"silent_prtoagonist","CreatedById":1927,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-30T00:45:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre the ailerons close\u00A0to the center of lift, or rotated in the editor, or otherwise weirdly placed? I noticed some similar behavior with some of my more...creatively placed control surfaces. As a temporary fix you can un-invert them by setting the Authority Limiter to negative values in the right-click menu, even mid-flight.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SelectHalfling0","CreatedById":105051,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-30T13:24:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, they are placed at a slight angle (and virtually on top of the center of mass).
