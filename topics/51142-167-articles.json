I love it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A suggestion for greater realism in the clouds: like clouds are created in the camera position now (much better imho), I suggest a fade between the clouds texture and the particles. In the point where the particles finish the texture of the clouds should be 100% visible and in the central point of the particles (camera point) the texture of the clouds should be 0% visible. Or in other words: only particles near to the camera point and a fade of the cloud map to visibility at the point where the particles ends.
