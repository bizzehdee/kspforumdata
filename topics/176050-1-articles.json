To shrink and expand space, you need to generate negative mass which can be achieved by exciting exotic matter. KSPI warp drive can generate exotic matter and use it to create a warp field. The amount of power required to create a stable warp field depends on the speed and power of the warp coils. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EThe speed of light itself requires the least amount of energy. Travelling faster or slower requires more power. However, speed is influenced by a large degree by the curvature of space, in other words, gravity. It means that the higher the gravity pull of any celestial body, the lower the maximum speed possible for a finite amount of power requirement. This effectively means that when a vessel is in a low Kerbin orbit, where the pull of gravity is significant, the maximum warp speed is very low. And since travelling slower than the speed of light requires more power, it means that it will be hard or impossible to generate enough power. To get around it, you need to bring your vessel further away from the gravity source or install more warp drive power.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWarp Power is achieved by any of the 3 warpdrives in KSP, The Light Warp Engine, the Foldable Warp Engine and the Heavy Warp Engine.
