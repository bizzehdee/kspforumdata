I like the new tank models! However, is there any particular reason that the X-240L Xenon tanks only hold 5000 units of xenon? The stock KSP PB-X150 xenon canister holds 700 units, but the X-240L is about 56 times the volume of the PB-X150 (it has four times the radius and ~3.5 times the length, at least as I measured it in the VAB. So it is 4^2*3.5 = 56 times the volume of the PB-X150). Multiplying all the numbers of the stock PB-X150 by 56, then the X-240L canister should hold 39200 units of xenon, have a full mass of 6.72 tons, and a dry mass of 2.8 tons. Being conservative and just multiplying by 50 instead of 56, then the numbers are 35000 units of xenon, a full mass of 6 tons, and a dry mass of 2.5 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a comparison, the current X-240L xenon canister, weighing in at 0.84 tons, is actually larger (maybe 10% longer) than the 2.5 meter Rockomax X200-8 fuel tank, which weighs 4.5 tons.
