Use The Lazor system if you wish to do auto plane landing. In the Lasor guided fly system you will be able in input direction and elevation. You will need to use the throttle to slow down. But it will work. Hydro jeb will also keep to plane level but will require a bit more work from you. good luck.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mach56","CreatedById":57826,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T01:33:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to land a shuttle use the ILS.
