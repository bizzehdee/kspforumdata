The signal was picked up on a soviet space frequency in 1962 and gave rise to the theory of the (lost) first female cosmonaut.\u003Cbr\u003EThis project was made by Mirjam Veske (Production Designer) and Nils Eilif Bremdal (Cinematographer). After finishing their exam films at the Norwegian Film School they teamed up for this final project before graduating from the film school. They worked as a Production Designer and Cinematographer, but made all directorial decisions together all through the production process. Accompanied by Thomas Grotmol (Editor) and Vegard Soldal (Sound Designer) and fellow students and friends, the film has been a great collaborative experience.\u003Cbr\u003EIf you want to see stills from behind the scenes, go to flickr.com/photos/52410795@N07/14184763815\u003Cbr\u003EMusic by \u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u0153lafur Arnalds - \u0022Out To Sea\u0022\u0022\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-27T14:54:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery cool video, but based on a hoax.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-27T15:12:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe description is misleading at best and false at worst.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It is an actual sound clip of a female, but the \u0022cosmonaut in distress\u0022 part is an allegation.
