Having extra parts and plugin aids make the game far more enjoyable. Mechjeb is a must, it takes the tedium out of endless launches, the Smart A.S.S. and the statistic panels are essential. Crew Manifest does something that should be stock, that is, the internal transfer of crew between docked ships. Kethane and Mapping add to gameplay and HOME modules are so useful and look good.\u003Cp\u003EWhy on Kerbin would anyone stay stock?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe mods are (in a way) more entertaining (for me not really), but there is no challenge any more. Of course, some additional parts that the game would need in stock are ok, but Mechjeb is just doing everything for you. The only mod i REALLY like is Kethane, because it doesent make the game easier or something, it just adds a new challenge and, fortunatley, a real reason to land somewhere. Unfortunatley, the jet-rocket engine they bring does not work and after using it in a rocket or plane(launching it) the engine just dissapears out of the parts list. I ll have to Report this bug at the Kethane Thread later. Anyway, for example mapsat or Mechjeb just make the game easier and for me, really not entertaining or challenging any more.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarkusA380","CreatedById":45759,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T16:07:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheDarkStar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TheDarkStar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFirst, the devs have said that autopilots will not be in the stock game.

In the full game they intend to make, Kerbals will gain experience by flying and eventually be able to perform missions themselves while you are elsewhere. So your pilots will be your autopilots. That\u0027s also why they\u0027ve said SAS and ASAS are stopgap measures; kerbals will take over the job of stabilizing the ship as well. Come to think of it, this might explain why manned capsules have so much more control torque than probes. I wonder if that will represent not just the capacities of the part, but the fact that the capsules assume a pilot will be at the controls as well?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AmpsterMan","CreatedById":32671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T17:21:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022dr_jt\u0022 data-cite=\u0022dr_jt\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOkay.
