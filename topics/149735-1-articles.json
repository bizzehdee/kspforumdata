What happens is that the when the game loads the menu has the kernels floating around kerbin\u00A0except the planet is completely dark. When I load my file I am greeted with what appears to be a map of KSP, instead of the three dee models, it also appears in blue so this may not be a issue. One more thing worth noting is that in the Space Plane Hangar I cannot find the save, load, launch, symmetry, center of mass, center of lift or center of thrust. This is very agonizing, but that leaves me with two questions, question one should I attempt to fix this (in that case I need help) or wait for a patch to be released. I have Screen shots on the link below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/e0LRl\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/e0LRl\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS I do not know if this is pre release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-12T06:57:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid you update your existing installation, or did you install it completely fresh?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the past, KSP has sometimes had issues with updating properly.
