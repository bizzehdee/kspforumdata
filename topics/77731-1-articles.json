Simulators have high learning curve by definition - they aim to recreate experience as accurately as possible, and in the real life, you can\u0027t learn how to fly a fighter jet in one day. Besides, most of these games expect that you know about basic operation principles of simulated machine, and in-game tutorials usually based around that.
