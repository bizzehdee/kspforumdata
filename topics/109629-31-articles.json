I was rather wanting feedback on the diffetent texture packs and weather we should go for the new set or keep both as switchable \n\nAs for the missing textures like for the rcs yes I know they are not added to the cfg or are incorectly entered in. I did ask for people to have a look into it while im at work but not send out a complete new download with a couple things fixed. I will rather fix all issues first. I will download yours and correct mine with it tonight along with everything else\n\nAlso with firespitter texture switch have you found a fix for why it dorsnt work for somr people. Including me. I dont want to release it and only some people can testure switch. Rather keep it bd for now to also go with my wheels\n\nI know why the oms has that issue and will fix.\n\nAnd I have more from DECQ to go in.\n\nanimated et flaps and my proper airlock etc\n\nRan out if time for the last release (4am limit) but posted it for people to test anyway for bugs.\n\nHoping for a full one tonight.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Only needed for the New textures download\n\u003E [Cargo Bay Texture Switch Fix](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/227008324/New%20Textures%20CB%20Fix.rar)\n\u003E \n\u003E Just Drop in CSS/Parts folder and overwrite the files.\n\nWill have a full release out tonight if people dont mind waiting but thanks heaps for finding fixes at saves me time"},{"CreatedByName":"cheech420now","CreatedById":32124,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T00:42:30Z","Content":"Do you have the latest firespitter plugin?\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nAnd im pretty sure everyone will want the new textures.
