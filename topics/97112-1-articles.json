View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have all read the science reports and wondered what the experience was REALLY like for the Kerbal sending it home. The wonder of standing on the surface of Laythe looking up at Jool and all of its moons. The curiosity of whether the Mystery Goo has frozen as you touch down on Eeloo. The excitement of telling the Kerbals back at KSC what the atmosphere is like on Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are 10 scientific instruments that can be used in-game on each of the 17 planetary bodies. And now with .90 and biomes you can be flying over the grasslands of Kerbin checking the thermometer, or perched on one of the ridges of Dres checking for seismic anomalies. The opportunities are vast, but the amount of content is daunting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EThis is where you come in!\u003C/span\u003E Help us give Kerbal-kind a personality. This is the ultimate opportunity for fan-fic...you can see your creation played out in a thousand little stories IN THE GAME! Right now most of the planets/moons outside of Kerbins SOI have little content, so they are a blank slate to let your creativity loose on. And even inside Kerbins SOI you are very likely to see one of your own reports in-game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow is this possible?
