They are both in Kerbin\u0027s system so they don\u0027t take long to get to and back. Minmus has the advantage of being a lot more forgiving (needs less fuel and thrust), but the Mun doesn\u0027t require a plane change from Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a lot of tutorial videos out there. You can youtube trips to Minmus or Mun and you\u0027ll find many. I\u0027m sure someone will also come along and post their videos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb uses a series of maneuvers to get to a destination. You\u0027ll need to make Mun or Minmus a target by clicking on it, and selecting \u0022set as target\u0022 (that\u0027s not a MJ thing by the way). Then cycle through MJ\u0027s maneuver planner to find things like \u0022match planes with target\u0022 and \u0022homann transfer.\u0022 I really do recommend that if you don\u0027t know what any of that is, watch a video first. It will make a lot more sense when you try to do it in game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-06T17:12:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe information might be a tad outdated, but it\u0027s still viable.
