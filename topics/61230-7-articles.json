On the other hand, if you surround the whole crew compartment, you have less shielding directly between the reactor and crew. Another method common when working with radiation is distance. Taking advantage of the inverse square law, as doubling the distance from a light/radiation point source decreases exposure 4 fold, just put the crew as far from the reactor as possible. This was the thought for the Discovery One in 2001: A Space Odyssey, also emulated in \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20050160960_2005161052.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENASA\u0027s nuclear fusion powered Discovery Two proposal \u003C/a\u003E, which I also ripped of for my own \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64251-Discovery-2-Mission-to-Jool\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDiscovery 2: Mission to Jool.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course the problem with using propellant for shielding is, you loose shielding as you burn propellant. But at least it minimizes your exposure time to more radiation prior to it being burn - so say on a Mars mission with a 6 to 9 month travel time, you have that fuel shield there until retro burn. Come to think about it, I would expect the greatest radiation flux to occur only WHEN the engine is being fired. During those burn sequences, the crew could sit in a highly shielded compartment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, cosmic radiation...that would require 360 shielding.
