This is because the game is called Kerbal SPACE Program, and the devs wanted to encourage you to explore the great beyond, and not Kerbin. However, this is a blessing to nerds like me, who now have a whole world to work with, in a very literal sense. Therefore, I will set out to do what no one (I don\u0027t think) has gone out and done before: theorize life on Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003ECHAPTER 1: THE KERBALS\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbin is a planet orbiting the star Kerbol, with a very unique property to it: life. It\u0027s just the right enough distance away to support liquid water on it\u0027s surface, and have very temperate climates pretty much globally, with the occasional dessert. One of the most unique and fairly bizarre inhabitants are the Kerbals. Kerbals are essentially the bare minimum of what can be considered intelligent life. They\u0027re able to construct governments and civilizations, and have even become a space fairing species, and most of this was probably achieved completely by accident.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EBiology\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022brFzqOy.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022100.00\u0022 height=\u00221000\u0022 style=\u0022width:500px;height:auto;\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/brFzqOy.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EArtist\u0027s (me) impression.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbals have very large heads and eyes, with big arms and torsos and stubby little legs. This gives them more of a waddle than a walk. They have a very humanoid shape. It\u0027s unknown how fast Kerbals can reproduce, but their populations seem close to undepletable. If there was a mas extinction of Kerbin, their populations would recover, if not double, if given a century or two. In fact. their sheer numbers seems to be the only thing keeping them alive. Kerbals are known to be huge dunces, frequently getting into sticky situations. A large head might make you think that they have a large brain capicity, but what\u0027s really in there remains to be discovered. Their green color to their skin indicates that they may have evolved from plants, but have long since lost the ability to photosynthesize. The green color though could have also been evolved so that early Kerbals could hide from predators in Kerbin\u0027s open plains. Their ability to sweat means they are mammalian-esque with their biology. This is further backed up by their hair.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis entry into the field guide doesn\u0027t even cover a fraction of what lifeforms lie on Kerbin. In the next entry, we will look at creatures that are associated with Kerbals. Pets, livestock, and other such things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-25T15:35:08Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2023 03:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Kerbalsaurus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EOh man, that\u0026#039;s a BAD Kerbal drawing.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
