Here\u0027s a basic 8-page comic that talks a bit about a number of semi-basic things, like asparagus staging, gravity turns, and aerobraking. The image quality decreased when I uploaded but I think all the words can be made out, and someone might get a kick out of a couple of the jokes or maybe learn something. Also, if there\u0027s anything I put in that was wrong or could be better (including the pictures and design) don\u0027t hesitate to say so. Without further ado, here\u0027s Bill and Jeb talking about how to reach other planets, using Eve as an example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/APLAHCn.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/APLAHCn.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sof","CreatedById":65663,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-05T18:17:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Elol at \u0022most of my landings are spontaneous and unintentional\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketTurtle","CreatedById":67534,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-06T00:45:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOMGBBQLOLROFLLMFAO.
