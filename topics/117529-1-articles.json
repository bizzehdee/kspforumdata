If some future update trashes everything you\u0027ve built, say a supernova wiped out civilization and start over. That\u0027s what I do. I used to have a poster showing a ship having difficulty in a storm at sea. Its caption said, \u0022Ships that stay in harbor are safe, but that\u0027s not what ships are built for.\u0022 Keep that in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I 1st started playing KSP back in 0.20, I was a bit worried about this sort of thing. And I even tried to keep my old games going the 1st couple of updates. But I quickly decided this wasn\u0027t worth it. First, the new update usually added some cool feature I wanted to play with from the get-go. Besides, I always spot imperfections in my designs once they\u0027re flying, or learn some better way to do something, and knowing these things makes me not want to continue going things the old way. So after a while, I became rather grateful for game-breaking changes because that gave me an excuse to pull the plug on old, imperfect games I was by then dissatisfied with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I now do careers with science set at 200% and funds at 150%.

THere was significant support for my woes, but the overwhelming feeling I think is one of \u0022Just get back into it, by not-playing, all you are doing is denying ourself Kerbals!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am impressed by the speed of development of the Unity 5 upgrade, and look forward to what it might bring (to flog the dead horse, my greateset hope is for stable 64bits), the gameplay additions, specifically an integrated remotetech-like system, also look really cool. I love the flexibility and content that mods bring, but IMO, the more things that are integrated into the base game, the better, even if just so that people not inclined to mod, get to experience some of the things that modders do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo whilst I am keen for that to arrive, I am also aware that timescale are just not predictable in an way, and I decided to take the plunge. Whatever build of KSP I am able to put together, it will be worlds ahead of the last one I had working anyway!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECKAN has been my saviour, cutting days, I am sure, from my modding procedure. I was able to simply pick most of them from the list, and significantly, adding/removing mods is now a FAR (or is that NEAR...) simpler task, making finding that RAM-limited sweetspot many times easier and less time consuming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECKAN is a new addition since I was last into KSP, what are peoples experiences with it like? Are mods kept up-to-date as reliably as other platforms? Are mod-creators keen to upload to CKAN, or do I need to keep an eye on kerbalstuff etc. as well?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am exclusively using 32-bit, my last session was a foray into the (then) new 64bit build, which with mods, gives you screaming nightmares. So I cannot have the volume of additions that I used to, and I need to have it set to helf-res on textures in order to get a satisfactory number of mods installed. To be honest, the resolution is the biggest hit, I am limited for mods, but you are still able to install a very generous number of new parts, below is an abridged mod list (its just the most significant ones off the top of my head so it is not complete, I think I have over 100 mods of various flavours installed.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB9\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAIES\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKW Rocketry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHabitat pack\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the \u0022Near Future\u0022 addons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKarbonite\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemotetech\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngineer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeadly Reentry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDistant Objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModular Fuel Tanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETAC LS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002Bmany others\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Including lots of little extras like \u0022Final Frontier\u0022, various contract packs and menus, and tools like Kerbal Alarm Clock and that transfer window planner thingy etc etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESadly, none of the \u0022EVE\u0022 addons made the cut, they are just too RAM-intensive. Aesthetics take second place to parts and game mechanics in my book. Sad though, EVE in full glory is, well, glorious!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll-in-all, the entry into full-blown Kerballling has been much less stressful this time around, the 32bit build hums along quite nicely, even with what must be a max-load of mods (seriously, any other tiny mod added to the list gives RAM-crash on startup) I have only had a couple of crashes so far, and the have been fairly benign. No sign of the Kraken as yet...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am looking forward to when a 64 bit build removes almost all restriction on mod/part count, alongside enabling high-res textures, but I can feel the start of a brand new obsession with the 32bit thang I have going on right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven now, I am mainly only writing this because I have ran out of things to read in the threads, but I dont want to leave the forum just yet, I\u0027m jonesing for my kerbal fix when I get home!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
