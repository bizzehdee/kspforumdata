Try downloading the newer version as it should now be fixed to be cross platform. I\u0027m on linux and ran into the same problem. It has to do with file systems, as windows uses \\ and linux/mac uses /.\n\nEdit: Looks like Brian got his reply in as I was typing lol.\n\nAlso, I wanted to add The new version of the addon does not require loading a blender file. Unless you have a scene setup that you want to use. I\u0027m actually working (when I have time) on setting up a generic back drop scene. I\u0027m going to add some lights into it that should make it easier to move around and change lighting if you\u0027re not entirely familur with Blender. It\u0027s going to have some \u0022studio\u0022 lights that I plan on constraining so certain parts only rotate like they would in real life. Should make it easier to aim the lights if need be, at least for studio type renders.\n\nIf you want to do something that looks like it\u0027s in the game, that, you\u0027ll have to figure out on your own lol, or I recommend Blender Guru (Andrew Price) he has a Facebook page, a youtube channel and website. He actually puts on training classes that includes a bunch of resources (textures, HDRI files, reference images etc). Though his youtube channel does have free tutorials, but usually you don\u0027t get all the special resources, though on occasion he has released a basic set of textures/pre made models (in the case of his recent grass tutorial).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-04T18:46:20Z\u0022 title=\u002203/04/2015 06:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sma**"},{"CreatedByName":"Spartwo","CreatedById":58131,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T18:47:00Z","Content":"I\u0027m on windows, Jaffa is on Mac."},{"CreatedByName":"JaffaFediration","CreatedById":112619,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T18:55:50Z","Content":"i downloaded today, how could i be using a older version?\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u0022I said KREE\u0022 what?

The error message I saw posted showed the \u0022\\kspblender-master\\demo\\kspblenderdemo.blend\u0022 part, which I\u0027m pretty certain is from the old version. The blend file I believe has the old script built into it. As Brian said, with the new version all you have to do is go to File -\u003E Import -\u003E KSP/Craft or whatever it\u0027s called. Now if your blender is set to use Cycles you\u0027ll have to setup your own lighting, or you can change your lighting to blender internal which will then use the light that is in the default scene when you start Blender.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E - - - Updated - - -\n\u003E \n\u003E \u0022I said KREE\u0022 what? I dont get it.\n\nOh, sorry it\u0027s a Stargate joke. In Stargate, there are these beings called Jaffa, and one of their phrases is kree, which means, pay attention, look here, etc.\n\n For those that don\u0027t know Stargate, Jaffa are like soldiers of their \u0022gods\u0022 or \u0022false gods\u0022 (Ra, Apophis, Anubsi, Ba\u0027al, etc) really. Another thing Jaffa\u0027s do is play host for the larva form of their \u0022gods\u0022 the Goa\u0027uld. The Jaffa have a special pouch thing in their stomach that keeps the larva and provides it a safe place to grow, meanwhile the larva Goa\u0027uld gives them strength, and self healing abilities. Once the Goa\u0027uld larva matures it is transferred into a new host and attaches to the base of the skull and nervous system. \n\nTo make a long story short (from the Stargate Wiki about Goa\u0027uld language): \n\n\u0022What the hell does \u0027kree\u0027 mean?\u0022\n\n\u0022Well, actually, it means a lot of things. Loosely translated it means \u0027Attention\u0027, \u0027Listen up\u0027, \u0027Concentrate\u0027.\u0022\n\n\u0022\u0027Yoo-hoo\u0027?\u0022\n\n\u0022Yes, in a manner of speaking.\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACDaniel Jackson, responding to Jack O\u0027Neill\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-04T19:16:58Z\u0022 title=\u002203/04/2015 07:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sma**"},{"CreatedByName":"JaffaFediration","CreatedById":112619,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T19:22:53Z","Content":"I am jaffa as in Jaffacakes, a british snack."},{"CreatedByName":"Sma","CreatedById":67377,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T19:27:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I am jaffa as in Jaffacakes, a british snack.\n\nAhh gotcha.
