Sometimes it\u0027s a quick note. Sometimes we discuss the matter among ourselves. Sometimes we have to put some thought into exactly what to say. See, there\u0027s a sequence of a few clicks, but we also hand-write a message to go along with the standard message. And, we check the members\u0027 infraction history to see if the person has a history of doing similar things. Repeated offenses get sterner infractions.

Nevertheless, I believe that among the criteria for moderator selection are a demonstrated willingness to sacrifice your time and effort to be helpful to the community as a whole and the maturity to recognize that holding a different opinion from someone on certain issues doesn\u0027t mean you can\u0027t still have a beneficial and productive relationship with them, which I think helps to winnow out the sorts of people inclined to play \u0022office politics\u0022 games."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T05:47:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Does anyone know how to set a custom profile background?\n\nTop right of the page.
