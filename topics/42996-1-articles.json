I have two Space Guys on the Mun. First I lost three to shuttle tests (they respawn but I still felt bad about pushing the wrong button). Than I could not return three who had landed, by accident, on Ike (so I terminated them). But I left the flag on Ike to remind me of my failure. Than I somehow lost the Space Trucker, MK I, in orbit around the Mun. Not sure where that went...(that is why I had to test the MK I by launching one from Kerbin and then landing it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wanted those two on the Mun back on Kerbin. There was two rovers, a house, a science probe there. No need to have crew there. But the MK II on the Mun was TOO low on fuel. Unlike the MK I which can launch, go to the Mun, land, delivery its cargo, get into Mun orbit and THAN wait for refueling the MK II, because of its design, had too much mass. It had burned up too much fuel to be able to leave the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I would have to launch another, refuel it in orbit around Kerbin, refuel it at the Mun before landing, than refuel after it was back in Mun orbit. Now I COULD use a bunch of refueling rockets - but WAIT! I have two unmanned fueling stations in orbit. One around the Kerbin and one around the Mun. Lots of fuel, easy and quick to get to. And it is THIS kind of mission that those stations were created and filled to start with! The only reason I had not used them before this was that I found the unmanned refueling rockets I had designed to top them off easier to use with my spaceships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESO I launched a MK II, topped off at the H.G. Wells, went to the Mun, and then refueled there, at the R. L.
