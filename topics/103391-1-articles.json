It was a large, gas giant. On their telescope, it was like 50 pixels big. Everything they know is that it have rings (which may be beautiful or ugly, who knows), and some half pixel things orbiting it. They named giant Sarnus and orbiting pixels Eeloo, Slate and Tekto. They have decided it needs a big ship, because tracking of that 50px-thing have revealed how far from us it really is. And here comes the Icrum. It and every module is named after Kerbalian cities.\n\nBasic info\n\nName: Icrum\n\nDestination: Sarnus\n\nLKO mass: 95 tons\n\nCrew: 8\n\nN\u0027 of launches: 4\n\nMods: Outer Planets Mod, Near Future Mod, Kerbal Engineer Redux, Kerbal Alarm Clock\n\nModules\n\nI have get that monster part-by-part to orbit, without any cheating. It took me while to make non-explosive staging on start. And I love docking, so that wasn\u0027t anything I have worried about.\n\nDescription is always worse without proper images. Here are some images with nice labels. Under each image, you can find what each labeled thing is\n\n![SdV1rVh.png](http://i.imgur.com/SdV1rVh.png)\n\nIcrum\n\nMEAS (Main Engine and Argon Storage module) - Galam - Powered obviously by Argon and Nuclear power, it is the thing that will take us there and back\n\nSNPG (Scientific and Nuclear Power Generating module) - Danarg - I don\u0027t know who had that stupid idea of placing reactor right next to lab\n\nSAOL (Standardized, Absolutely Ordinary Lander) - Noel - It could be also used on every second body in Kerbol System. On other side is just fuel for refuel and right balance.\n\nCLSS (Commanding, Living and Secondary Storage module) - Llives - Here our 8 victims heroes lives and spend their time next to the storage of nuclear fuel.\n\n![Q2dAqdp.png](http://i.imgur.com/Q2dAqdp.png)\n\nMEAS - Galam\n\nEngine - 4x KX-XK Pulsed Inductive Engine - It eats Argon and a lot of electricity. It is our only way there and back\n\nRest don\u0027t need labels. It\u0027s huge amount of Argon tanks ready to be ionized out of KX-XK (or be used by it in some other way).\n\n![uoG8dBP.png](http://i.imgur.com/uoG8dBP.png)\n\nSNPG - Danarg\n\nLaboratory - Mobile Processing Lab - If satellite does flyby of moon, this place will tell you if it is ok to land there. And scientists hides snack from pilots and engineers here.\n\nReactor - MX-1 Fission Reactor - It can generate up to 2000 Ec/s, which is enough to power 4x KX-XK at half throttle, I think.\n\nDocking port - Meant to be place for Noel and Fuel at other side.\n\nSCSS (Send Anywhere Scientific Satellite) - Nolecrab - What would be lab for, if you had nothing to collect data with?\n\n![W2QNIbG.png](http://i.imgur.com/W2QNIbG.png)\n\nCLSS - Llives\n\nNTFS (Necessary Things for Flight Storage) - RCS fuel and Electric charge storage. It is not visible.\n\nArgon - Secondary storage of Argon - You can\u0027t ever have enough Argon, can you?\n\nLiving quarters - Hitchhiker Storage Container - Most comfortable module available for space travel. There are 2 of them, each for 4 Kerbals.\n\nNFES (Nuclear Fuel and Electricity Storage) - This amount of nuclear fuel can last for decades.\n\nCommand pod - PPD-12 Cupola Module - When not used for commanding, you can observe depths of universe.\n\nPart 01 - Up!\n\nGetting it up and assembling at ~117 km ~circle. Everything you need to know about part 1 is above and here is just process of assembling itself.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

You may see these huge engines and say, that it should carry that big ship with no problem. Well each of them has maximal thrust only 80 kN. It really won\u0027t be so bad (it would be just what I need on full thrust!), but Ec consuption is really high. With all solar panels extended and nuclear generator running at 100%, it can only run on about 40% most of time. That means below 130 kN, which means acceleration of about 1.4 m/s^2, which means 500 dV burn should take about 7 minutes. Nice thing is that I have ran it 2x most of time, sometimes 3x, but that caused wobble after time. But I can imagine worse maneuvering. At least rotating was kind of possible, sometimes RCS helped me little bit.\n\nWhen I was closer to Sarnus, I have tried finding it on \u0022sky\u0022 (I don\u0027t know how to call it, hope you know what I mean). When I want to observe something, I look on map (focused to vessel) and rotate view, so I have label in center and look at star constellations behind it. Then I find these constellation on \u0022staging view\u0022 and search where 2 pixel thing should be. I have did some observations and pretended that Kerbals have made scientific things with photos of these. When it was observed from smaller distance, Bob (he is one of our 3 scientists) did some calculations and found this (G\u0027s are gravitation):\n\nEeloo - Ice planet, 0.15-0.28 G; Slate - Desert-like planet, 0.6-1.0 G; Tekto - High chance of having atmosphere, 0.1-0.3 G\n\nAnd then, time of aerobraking came. Calculations were done on Kerbin from data, which were gathered by Icrum. In KSC Computer Lab, it took them 10 days to get right altitude, which will get Icrum into Sarnus orbit, while not generating too much heat and not damaging ship (I don\u0027t have any mods, I just pretend to make it more interesting). And it get them to (not-that-much) perfect orbit.\n\nYou have to know something about Kerbals on mission:\n\n***Team Alpha*** - they are operating in mothership\n\n*Herfrid Kerman* - Captain of whole mission, he pilots Icrum\n\n*Bill Kerman* - Engineer, knows everything about ship\n\n*Ludmon Kerman* - Engineer, he is nuclear technology and ion-power expert\n\n*Bob Kerman* - Scientist, astronomer, he handles satellites (Nolecrabs)\n\n***Team Beta*** - they are trained for non-atmospheric landing, most likely Eeloo\n\n*Eddos Kerman* - Pilot of Noel lander, he have landed once on Mun\n\n*Anfrod Kerman* - Scientist, leaded polar expeditions on Kerbin, he helps Eddos with piloting\n\n***Team Delta*** - they are trained for atmospheric landing, most likely Tekto\n\n*Jebediah Kerman* - Pilot of Noel lander, he have landed once on Duna\n\n*Merski Kerman* - Scientist, he have spent some time on Duna with Jebediah\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
