Now, it is modelled, and partly unwrapped and textured, but I didn\u0027t got it through Unity, the wings and especially the gear didn\u0027t work at all in game, which frustrated me very much. Now, I gave up on it, and wanted to ask if anyone would like to finish it. Some parts will need to be unwrapped and textured, others are already. The whole thing needs to be pushed through Unity, and part configs have to be made. Not easy, but I am sure someone out there will be able to to this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are two preview images:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mJgJXkF.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mJgJXkF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XwzJ5wE.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XwzJ5wE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote though that this is not a full replica, it is only heaviliy based on the real airplane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EA note on licensing stuff:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI give those files away for free, in hope that someone can get this model into KSP.
