Now, it is modelled, and partly unwrapped and textured, but I didn\u0027t got it through Unity, the wings and especially the gear didn\u0027t work at all in game, which frustrated me very much. Now, I gave up on it, and wanted to ask if anyone would like to finish it. Some parts will need to be unwrapped and textured, others are already. The whole thing needs to be pushed through Unity, and part configs have to be made. Not easy, but I am sure someone out there will be able to to this. \n\nHere are two preview images:\n\n![mJgJXkF.png](http://i.imgur.com/mJgJXkF.png)\n\n![XwzJ5wE.png](http://i.imgur.com/XwzJ5wE.png)\n\nNote though that this is not a full replica, it is only heaviliy based on the real airplane.\n\n***A note on licensing stuff:***\n\nI give those files away for free, in hope that someone can get this model into KSP. If you are this person, you can publish this as your own mod (eg. make your own thread etc:sticktongue:), though I want to get credit for the models. You are not allowed to make money with this, in whatever way, otherwise, do whatever you want with it. \n\n[**Download from Mediafire**](http://www./download/1wee8h3wq2d18gb/KK_BAe-146.zip)\n\nGreeetings,\n\nKK"},{"CreatedByName":"simon56modder","CreatedById":119640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T20:52:21Z","Content":"I want to see it in the game !
