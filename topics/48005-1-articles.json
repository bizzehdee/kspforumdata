Welcome to a universe where the Soviets were the first to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and won the space race.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe all know the sad story about the KSA\u0027s failed attempts to land on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn: First there was the heartbreakingly close Kapollo 11 mission where flight controllers waived off the lunar landing after repeated 1202 and 1201 computer alarms. Then Kapollo 12 was struck by lightning during liftoff, lost all power, and the flight was aborted (because the only guy who knew about the SCE switch was home sick that day). And Kapollo 13 experienced an oxygen tank explosion enroute to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, and the crew was almost lost...which lead to a two-year program hiatus as the systems were overhauled, causing the KSA to miss Kennedy Kerman\u0027s (sorry about having to make up all the \u0022K\u0022 names) deadline to reach the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. And then when the Kapollo 14 landing mission had to be scrubbed because the docking latches on the LM failed to catch and it couldn\u0027t be pulled out of the S-IVB...well, the Kamericans just threw up their hands in disgust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut this delay was just what the peoples of the glorious KSSR needed to complete work on their giant N1 launch vehicle and get it ready for a mission to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn!

But the Block E also has a backup engine that can be used for lunar liftoff if the main engine fails to restart. I\u0027m not sure how these engines were arranged, but since the Soviets were in the habit of calling collections of multiple combustion chambers fed by a common propellant supply system as one engine, I will do that here and point out that two of the three Rockomax 48-7S engines you see on the bottom of my LK are, in fact, one engine -- the primary Block E engine. The single 48-7S in the center represents the backup engine, and was not used on this flight...but I did check to be sure that it can lift the LK back into orbit by itself.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iZPQyX5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022iZPQyX5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, Leonov sets the LK down gently onto the m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar surface.

I apparently was mistaken about Leonov Kerman not planting a flag on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, because the KSSR officials have released the photo below of Leonov with the flag on the surface. And they said that he later moved it to a safe distance away from the LK before liftoff so it wouldn\u0027t get blown over by the exhaust, because that would be just a silly thing to let happen. Any suggestions that this photo was taken later in a Soviet movie studio will be treated as the scurrilous lie that it is (probably the result of evil KSA propaganda).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BjNko1V.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022BjNko1V.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, released by the evil propaganda machine of the KSA are the photos below supposedly showing an abort that occurred when a KSSR N1 malfunctioned on launch.

The difficult design aspect of the LK is that it must use the same engine for liftoff that it uses for landing, and it must leave an intact undercarriage on the lunar surface after liftoff. My original design used a small decoupler mounted sideways to a cubic octagonal strut as the separation point, since I wanted to have the centerline of the LK clear to mount the engine. But, after I went with an \u0022engine\u0022 that consisted of \u0022two combustion chambers\u0022 (so that I could accommodate a contingency engine, as the real LK had), I no longer need to keep the centerline clear. My new design uses two 24-7 engines as the primary engine, and two more 24-7 engines as the contingency engine (not normally used). These engines are tilted inward one click (to make up for the built-in outward tilt of these engines), and rotated around to clip into the fuel tank (which the VAB allows you to do with no cheats turned on). It did feel a little \u0027cheaty\u0027 to me, so I did not bury the engines deep into the tank, but had them sticking out as far as possible. Then the rest of the undercarriage structure is built primarily out of cubic octagonal struts, and it is much more compact and looks much closer to the original USSR design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AxSfODa.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022AxSfODa.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new design also uses a smaller fuel tank. I designed my original to basically be able to descend and ascend from m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar orbit unaided, and I treated the descent help of the Block D stage as an extra (but unnecessary) step required for the re-creation of the L3 mission. But the fun of the Soviet style landing is using the Block D properly as a \u0022crasher stage\u0022 to save fuel in the LK. So with the new version of my LK, I use the Block D (which has to be large enough to have already slowed the LK and LOK return ship into lunar orbit) to bring the LK down to under 1000 meters and a few dozen meters per second. Then I drop the Block D and use a relatively small amount of fuel in the LK to finish the landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/e7HDQWw.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022e7HDQWw.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Q8CcYI8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Q8CcYI8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps not the landing technique you\u0027d want to use when bringing a lander into an area where you already have a moon base, but it\u0027s fun to do as a change of pace.

If I had no probe core on the sky crane, its engines would continue to burn after separation; but when I added a probe core to the sky crane, its engines would shut off upon separation. Has this behavior been changed? Apparently...since I have to be careful to cut the thrust before separating the Block D, or it will head off still burning.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-13T00:36:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Morokth\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Morokth\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve also had that weird bug where the nav-ball was oriented on a clearly wrong angle while sitting on the launchpad.

This sort of behavior happened to me back in version 0.18 when I was first landing rovers using a \u0022sky crane\u0022 maneuver. If I had no probe core on the sky crane, its engines would continue to burn after separation; but when I added a probe core to the sky crane, its engines would shut off upon separation. Has this behavior been changed? Apparently...since I have to be careful to cut the thrust before separating the Block D, or it will head off still burning.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThey changed it in 0.20 when you can change the root part of your ship - essentially making debris behave like controlled craft. Since the engines would previously shut off for controlled craft, this would make fly-away debris non-functional. So, as a fix for that, they made all vessels with liquid engines to continue firing its engines after separation, regardless if it was a probe or not.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022All parts on a stage will get activated now, even if that stage causes some of those parts to get jettisoned away.\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Giggleplex777","CreatedById":29829,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T02:25:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI too, have attempted a Soviet-style Mun mission, but on much smaller scale. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/iEXCC\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
