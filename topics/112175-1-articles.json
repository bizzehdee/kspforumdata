Every time I play around with it, I can only click on one thing, but it tells me to click on 2.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe primary use of this is preparing to save subassemblies. To understand it, you need to know how KSP craft files work so I\u0027ll explain that first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP craft have a root part (by default, the 1st part placed, usually a pod or probe core). All other parts must attach to the root part or to chain of other parts that ultimately ends attached to the root part. These chains of other parts are \u0022branches\u0022, and branches really can\u0027t attach just to each other. IOW, the file structure is like your hand, with the root part being the palm and the branches being your fingers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESubassemblies can only be composed of branch parts, never the root part. Say you started with a lander can and built a whole lander with fuel, engines, and legs attached under the can. All you could save as the subassembly would be these other parts, not the can itself because it\u0027s the root part by default. You find this inconvenienty--you want the whole lander, can and all, as a subassembly for your Apollo-style rocket. You use the Root Tool to make this happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you do is attach some other part, it doesn\u0027t matter what (I usually use the short box girder) to your wannabe subassembly. Then you activate the Root Tool. Now click on the part the new part is attached to. Then make a 2nd click on the new part. This turns the new, extra part into the root part and makes the entirety of the vehicle, including the can, into branch parts. So now you can grab the entire vehicle, leaving the new, extra root part behind, and save this as a subassembly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMPORTANT NOTE: The subassembly will only have 1 attachment node until you attach it to the vehicle you want to use it on. This attachment node will be at the joint where the subassembly was connected to the extra part when you saved it as a subassembly. So, you have to plan ahead and know how you\u0027re going to attach the subassembly the the main ship. By it\u0027s nose, by it\u0027s tail, or radially. Then, when you add the extra part and change the root while saving the subassembly, be sure you put the extra part on the right place of the wannabe subassembly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E3) Why can\u0027t I attach the rover in the picture to the lifter in the picture?
