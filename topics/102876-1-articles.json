(when pointed to Stability Assist there\u0027s no shake)\n\nCan anyone give me any info about this oscillation? It ends up screwing my injection burns. Thanks.\n\nNote: between the big fuel tank and the other engine (next stage), I have an Advanced Reaction Wheel. So there are 3 torques here being used by SAS: engine gimbal, adv. reaction wheel, and the reaction wheel in the command pod.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/pLFAWloO3DE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-13T01:33:04Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2015 01:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by seyss**"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T21:32:24Z","Content":"You might need to put some struts from the tank up to the trusses.

Any craft told to point pro/retrograde (or other directions determined by orbit) will wobble, as the SAS is overcompensating for its own movement - unless being pointed **exactly** in the direction you want it to and having no thrust offset torque whatsoever. And even then it\u0027s not going to last, because when you thrust, you change the orbital parameters and therefore the precise position of the node itself, which the ship is going to try and follow - and overcorrect itself.\n\nYou can observe this effect more clearly when you tell your craft to point somewhere and it has to turn around on its own - it\u0027s going to go full reaction wheel/RCS power until it reaches the correct position, and ONLY THEN it\u0027s going to try correcting any momentum that\u0027s left (which is a lot, usually). This causes the craft to wobble back and forth over the chosen node as it overcorrects a little less each time.\n\nThe reason why simple stability assist doesn\u0027t wobble is it\u0027s not trying to point anywhere in particular, it\u0027s just trying to kill any rotational momentum by producing torque in the opposite direction, until the ship is steady.\n\nThe solution is simple - use less thrust (so the ship has less momentum to overcorrect), turn on smooth controls (caps) or use stability assist, and pray for SQUAD to implement a better node tracking method."},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T23:15:52Z","Content":"Turning off one of your control systems should help."},{"CreatedByName":"bakanando","CreatedById":126310,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T00:00:21Z","Content":"The gimbaling engine will give you the worst wobble so locking it will help.\n\n But as was mentioned earlier, this is an implementation bug (feature?) that is better fixed by not using it.
