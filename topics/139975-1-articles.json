Rudders (tail fins placed vertically as what you do) is for yaw and its purpose is mostly for stabilizing the plane, not for turning. To turn, one typically\u00A0uses roll\u002Bpitch maneuver, not just yaw.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn KSP, there\u0027s no wind or turbulence, so technically you don\u0027t even need a rudder - I sometimes don\u0027t put any control surface to my vertical stabilizer and it still flies fine all the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd also you probably need to pull CoL behind a little bit. The CoL in SPH isn\u0027t precise - in flight due to different flight state CoL might drift a little, and if it comes in front of CoM you might be in trouble. I always do a lot of flight testing to make sure where should I place CoL, but for all my planes built it never came that close to CoM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-18T01:52:14Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2016 01:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by FancyMouse\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Efixing whatever didn\u0026#039;t make sense\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AWNROKR","CreatedById":164366,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-18T01:55:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni tweaked the design a little base on the suggestions, at least it flies now lol\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\na bit too hard to control and it does not fly high, but for my need at the moment\u00A0its good, now i have base to improve once i research better parts\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthanks ppl\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-18T01:57:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2016 01:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by AWNROKR\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Egramatical corrections\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
