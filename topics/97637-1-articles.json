It turns out that having more than two meshes in the same space completely breaks FAR drag modelling (?!). Now that I actually know what the issue is, I have a couple of ways to fix it. Going through and fixing this in all the inline engines may take some time -- hopefully not too long though. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also started working on normal maps for procedural fuel tanks.
