Hopefully they can do a user-friendliness pass over the game sooner then later. Just a -little- love, to help keep public interest. I\u0027m afraid all the public awareness of KSP now can be a double edged sword. In a world that moves so fast, many people may have heard of KSP, tried it, and been quickly discouraged. They will move on to other games, and many will never think twice about KSP. I know its in the best interest of the dev cycle to do these kinds of things (user-friendliness/UI/tutorial) later in the dev cycle. Due to the public awareness of KSP I think that priority should be re-evaluated though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LameLefty","CreatedById":57336,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T22:14:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ve already got a Kerbal named \u0022Gus.\u0022 Not to sound insensitive, but perhaps we need a \u0022tweakable\u0022 on the crew hatch to \u0022Blow the door!\u0022 Yeah, you risk the command pod flooding and sinking if you do it in water, but for the rest of us, it\u0027d help fix design issues like this. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T03:57:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis sort of thing is why I test each stage on the pad before adding another stage to my design.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nubcaker","CreatedById":63205,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T04:06:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis sort of thing is why I test each stage on the pad before adding another stage to my design.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI envy your great amount of patience.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T04:21:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s actually impatience.
