Right now I mainly been trying to get satellites up in orbit. Unfortunately after every success, I\u0027ve noticed the ship icon from the previous stages of the ship are still appearing on the map (M), whether they are in orbit or back on the planet. This concerns me because if I plan on launching many missions to assemble a space station, then chances are, more icons will show up on the map, making it difficult to keep track of things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was wondering if there are any methods for me to keep the planet and orbit clean of this debris or is that just an unrealistic goal for me?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the assistance\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-18T22:57:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGo into your settings from main menu and set your \u0027persistant debris\u0027 counter to zero. However be sure to add a probecore (and power/battery) to anything you DO want to keep. Anything without a probecore or crew module will count as debris and be removed once outside of render range when the game saves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, the more elaborate / hard work solution is designing all your ships in a way that the spent stages are deorbited using sepratrons when you stage your craft, or by leaving fuel in the tanks and a probecore so you can swap to them and manually deorbit them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zerotwo","CreatedById":60799,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-18T23:01:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EZerro,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeeping the skies clear is completely up to your design policies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesign sections as single large stages (instead of dumping four small engines/tanks), separate them early so there is fuel remaining, use that fuel to deorbit the object oif needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENever use stack separators, use decouplers, they leaves the ring behind on the object that is being released (the direction of the arrow will tell you which end it will remain stuck to - the fat side stays stuck), that prevents you from leaving bits of debris from staging up there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlways plan your stages with control computers and potentially a tiny amount of RCS for control and deceleration.
