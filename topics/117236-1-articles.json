This mod employs different approach (direct vertex manipulation instead of controlling skinned mesh renderers) that is more verbose and inconvenient to set up, but allows [proper UV mapping of arbitrary geometry](http://i.imgur.com/sGD98yO.gif). Multitude of parameters can be configured, from leading and trailing edge shapes to widths, lengths and thicknesses at root and tip of a wing.

Wings support thickness of up to one meter from now on\n\u003E - Removed leading and trailing edge multiplier property from wings\n\u003E - Added leading edge root/tip width and trailing edge root/tip width properties, all four of them can be adjusted from zero to one meter, allowing you to set up vertically elongated edge cross sections, horizontally elongated edge cross sections and cross sections proportional to arbitrary wing thickness values alike.\n\u003E - Added collapsable categories parenting logical property groups (dimensions, materials, edges and so on) to the tweakable menu, making the selection and adjustment of numerous properties more manageable\n\u003E - All tweakable properties are no longer initially open in the context menu, being hidden under categories\n\u003E - Replaced all edge models with new ones, improving cross section polycounts and adding hard material edge that looks better under arbitrary thickness and edge width combinations resulting in stretching\n\u003E - Reordered edge models: first type is circular, second type is biconvex (between sharp and circular in shape), third one is triangular, which makes a bit more sense (progression from smooth to sharp shapes instead of random order)\n\u003E - Reordered and renamed some properties for convenience\n\u003E - Added flat fill support (fifth material type) to edges\n\u003E - Improved aerodynamic value calculation for wings, edges now properly contribute to the behaviour\n\u003E - Improved aerodynamic value calculation for control surfaces, trailing edge widths are now taken into account, along with contributions of offset properties to taper ratio\n\u003E - Internal fixes and refactoring in geometry handling, setup sequence and field updates\n\u003E - Top and bottom surfaces of control surfaces and wings are collapsed into one mesh with a slight benefit to performance (separate material selection still available, shader based switching makes use of one mesh a non-issue)\n\u003E -

Implemented coloration - every wing surface (top/bottom/leading/trailing) can now have not just previously implemented separate material type, but also an appropriately masked paint overlay with configurable opacity, hue, saturation and brightness\n\u003E - Reimplemented alternative UI, it now closely resembles tweakable menu with a number of improvements over stock (color coded groups, longer labels, hints, collapsable sections)\n\u003E - Moved all sliders in the stock tweakable menu to KSP API Extensions UI\\_FloatEdit editor, which seems to positively affect the rate of a memory leak on tweakable window redraw (sometimes it even stops entirely).\n\u003E - Unified all properties, control surfaces and wings no longer use isolated fields (breaking change, all previously built crafts will not retain wing part configurations)\n\u003E - Added an option to set current configuration of a wing or control surface as default, making all subsequently created parts of that type use the same values (along with an option to reset default values back)\n\u003E - Shifted all properties into logical groups\n\u003E - Implemented collapsable menus to make editing more convenient\n\u003E - Geometry and performance fixes, refactoring and minor fixes in other areas\n\u003E -

Editing mode button changed to J to prevent conflict with Editor Extensions hotkeys\n\u003E - It is now possible to force the part you are editing to match the shape (parent tip width becomes child root width, parent tip thickness becomes child root thickness and so on)\n\u003E - It is now possible to force the part you are editing to match the surface material settings of a parent\n\u003E - Control surface offset settings can now assume a wider range of values, allowing proper setup of control surfaces on high-sweep trailing edges\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [/td]\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [td]**0.21**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E -
