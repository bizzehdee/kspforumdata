I click end flight but it just says \u0027Warp 1x\u0027 and refuses to bring up the menu to tell me what went wrong, or the options to exit or go back to the VAB.

I click clear and launch at pad, but I\\\u0027m immediately greeted with my craft exploding for seemingly no reason. I have noticed in prior versions (since I don\\\u0027t play religiously), that the aircraft will sort of, fall, a very short space to land on the pad prior to take off. It seems to me that it doesn\\\u0027t actually render and sit on the pad, as you would expect. Perhaps this is the reason an it is toppling and colliding with the tower, triggering an explosion but sadly I cannot see anything because as soon as the game loads there is already endless plumes of black smoke and fire. It could be that the pad is not being clearly properly of debris, but I don\\\u0027t know if KSP devs have made it so debris on the pad actively interact with other parts, so I\\\u0027m not sure if these pieces of debris are causing it or not. For all I know, the pad is entirely clear, but then again it may not be.
