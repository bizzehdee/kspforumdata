I realized that I could find mech jeb\u0027s optimal trajectory for this particular rocket if I ran a few hundred test flight and recorded the data and plotted using Excel and Maple. That said I also realized that in actuality even with hundreds of test flight I was only going to get close the the Ideal trajectories. since I am still keeping the number of variable to 3, more on those in a bit. In reality there of many variable not the least of which many are derivatives including da/dt and dm/dt respectively. Where a=acceleration, and m=mass thus dT/dt=change in acceleration with respect to time and dm/dt=change in mass with respect to time. There are also many other variable, including d(u)/dh=change in resistive force with respect to height, and once you throw in a more complex rocket with multiple stages,you really start feeling overwhelmed. I am absolutely certain that their is a overarching function that could be made that would calculate the exact ideal path no matter the rocket, I also know for a staged rocket it would have to involve the step function.
