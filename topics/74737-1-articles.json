They\u0027re very complex and sometimes something doesn\u0027t get installed quite right\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, the hardware may be the problem:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may also want to try a known good video card from the same manufacturer as yours, or try using the onboard video - if you have it - after removing your video card, and see if then it works as expected. If it does then there\u0027s something up with your video card. If it doesn\u0027t, then it\u0027s not the video card.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf pulling the card makes things work then you have two routes to go - it could be heat related. Your case may be dirty preventing good cooling. Cleaning it up might fix the problem also look for cables that may be preventing the fan on your video card (or even processor) from spinning. Heat is most likely the issue if you\u0027re also getting unexpected shut downs. (The applications stopping can be the video card going... \u0022aaaand I\u0027m to hot - nope!\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you put the card back in after making sure the fans are spinning and it has adequate air-flow and it still behaves like you describe, and it still doesn\u0027t work after working with the known good video device, then the card is toast and you need a new one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s hardware but not the video card- the next routes to go would be that you\u0027ve got a bad RAM stick (some BIOS will test for you. You can also use memtest but, I\u0027ve had that tell me my RAM is just fine and it wasn\u0027t. Typically you remove a pair at a time, or a stick at a time if you only have two. If the computer behaves when one of the sticks is out but not when it\u0027s in especially by itself, then that stick is bad and you will want a new pair to replace that stick and its friend), could also be that your power supply is going and sending irregular power to your CPU and video card - this one is a bit harder to diagnose without flat replacing it. The next one is that something is up with your motherboard or CPU, there are utilities that you can use to test those but I\u0027ve found they are somewhat unreliable. But, it\u0027s also not super likely those are the problem unless it\u0027s getting way too hot and you\u0027re cooking something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs jmiki8 said it could be a corrupted OS install as well. You would then want to back up your documents and do a format and clean install. Because it is possible if it\u0027s a corrupted OS a virus or other nasty piece of software is responsible. So you will want to do a scan from boot prior to the OS loading that will run through your memory to make sure that if you start over again with the software on your computer that it\u0027s actually clean and you won\u0027t be doing this again in a week.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt could be malware alone and you may be able to clean it off of there, but I wouldn\u0027t trust that I got it all and do a format and re-install anyway. If its bad hardware a clean OS install will not help. Some would go here first because it\u0027s free. I know there\u0027s nothing that is going to mess up my OS, so I\u0027m going to test the hardware first because that\u0027s more likely and if I\u0027m stumped (as in I\u0027m not pretty sure) then do the OS, and if its still broke then I KNOW its hardware and start looking into exactly what part now is needing replacing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll computers can be fixed. There is no reason to flat replace the whole box it unless all of the hardware is so woefully out of date that there is no point and the power supply and case you either hate, are under powered, or are proprietary.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-11T10:04:05Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2014 10:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by helaeon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-11T13:30:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree with helaeon.
