Once there, I tried to attain an orbit as tight as I could get it without hitting any mountain tops. I got my periapsis down to 3908m and sat bqack and watched Minimus fly below me. At one point on my orbit, I was headed straight for a mountain and figured it was the end, but I flew right through it!
