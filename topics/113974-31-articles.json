But the gunships... Valentina shuddered just to look at them. They wore a broken, visually jarring pattern of white and black that would easily stand out against the sky or ground. Splashed along the flanks in red paint \u2014she *hoped* it was red paint\u2014 was what she could only assume was Ceriman writing. It wasn\u0027t *the same*, but... She *could* see faces in it, and they certainly weren\u0027t smiling... yet somehow it reminded her of the symbols she had seen scrawled on the walls of the abandoned M\u00FCnbase. Topping it all off, on a field of black on each tail was a skull and crossbones. She thought they might even be real. The two disturbing constructs hummed ominously as the group approached. A sound like a shifting mountain came from Igor. He probably was still unhappy over having to fly cargo. \n\n\u0022*Buenos dias*,\u0022 the Andacamian Converter pilot nodded, then returned to his inspections. His flight crew, though...\n\n\u0022Yes, well,\u0022 Reginald began as he mopped his brow, \u0022that\u0027s Juan. He and the transport are leased from the Andacamian government, but our security contractors are all Ceriman. This is Vachirmynydd, Yisurcapel, and Bill.\u0022\n\nValentina blinked for a moment, wondering how he\u0027d just made those sounds. This gave her time to take in the three Kerbals and their... unusual garb. It might once have been uniforms. *Uniform*.\n\nOne fellow\u0027s sleeves had been unceremoniously torn off. What remained was covered in an incredible array of badges and insignia. The steel helmet on his head had a very prominent bullet hole... right in the middle. There was a playing card stuck in the fabric band around it, the King of Clubs. \n\nThe next fellow dispensed with the shirt entirely. What he wore was little more than a few pockets held together by strips of ragged fabric and bandoliers full of ammunition. He carried a ridiculously long rifle with a cruel bayonet that she instantly recognized. She had seen the same kind in her... whatever the Kommissar had shown her. Judging by the worn blueing and scarred stock, for all she knew it *was* the same rifle. It was twice as tall as the Kerbal holding it. On his helmet, was the Ace of Spades. \n\nThe third, fellow, well... he was in nothing but his underwear and a raggedy flak vest. And boots. Oddly, they all wore very stout boots in good repair. *His* helmet, of course, bore the joker. \n\nValentina put on her best diplomat\u0027s smile and offered a hand in their general direction, \u0022um... hello...\u0022\n\nThe one with the King on his helmet seemed to be in charge, no doubt this was... Vachi... or maybe... Yisu... certainly not\u2014\n\n\u0022Mi Bill,\u0022 he said staring at Valentina\u0027s hand for a moment. Then he gave a slight bow, more of a nod, and made a gesture on his forehead with his right hand, \u0022*ismet*, *Mhysa*.\u0022\n\nShe blinked. \n\n*...on that, I am counting, **Mhysa**...*\n\nBehind her, Igor rumbled ominously. \n\n\u0022*Mhysa*... what does it mean?\u0022 she asked... Bill. \n\nReginald wiped his face and answered, \u0022roughly it means \u0027mother,\u0027 it\u0027s one of the very few Ceriman words that doesn\u0027t change its meaning based on context, inflection, body language, time of day, or the relative velocity of the fourth nearest partially swallow. It\u0027s sort of a general term of respect.\u0022\n\nShe noted the slightest flick of Bill\u0027s eyes toward him, and a look she recognized as \u0027I *would* kill you right now but it\u0027s simply *not* worth the paperwork.\u0027\n\nBest defect this if she could, \u0022er, do you speak Kerblish?\u0022 she asked Bill. \n\nThis time Bill answered, \u0022tok-tok Pisin, Mi-Bill. Laitin\u0027 Seri-mah\u0027.\u0022\n\n\u0022Laitin\u0027,\u0022 the other two agreed.\n\nValentina blinked, again.\n\n\u0022*Enlightened*, is what he means,\u0022 Reginald offered, blotting his head. There was that look again, \u0022Cerimans typically struggle with proper Kerblish.\u0022\n\nAh, she could relate. She tried to give Bill an understanding smile, but hadn\u0027t quite opened her mouth when\u2014\n\n\u0022Some of them have picked up a sort of pidgin of the tongue,\u0022 he wrung the rag out, \u0022you gain an ear for it eventually, but nearly all of them\u2014\u0022\n\n\u0022*\u0428H\u0423 H\u0417 T\u0414L\u041A F\u0426\u0419\u0419\u0427?*\u0022 Igor boomed. \n\nValentina had to resist the urge to put a hand to her face, \u0022*H\u0417 SP\u042D\u0414\u041AS FI\u0419\u0417, H\u042D\u0027S P\u042F\u0424\u042C\u0414\u042AL\u0423 \u0414 P\u0424L\u0427GL\u0424T*.\u0022\n\n\u0022*L\u0414\u0419G\u0426\u0414G\u0417!*\u0022\n\n\u0022*P\u0426TI\u0419*.\u0022\n\n*Wait, Igor doesn\u0027t know Kerb\u2014*\n\n\u0022I beg your pardon?\u0022 Reginald paused wiping his face, \u0022I\u0027m sorry, I don\u0027t speak Ussari.\u0022\n\nBill seemed to take all this in with the same blank look. \n\nSuppressing a sigh, Valentina tried for that diplomatic smile again, when the underdressed Ceriman nudged his comrade... and said the most peculiar thing....\n\n\u0022*Milli vanilli \u003Cblink\u003E [blank] ari no mama no |alveolar trill| sugata miseru no yo {glottal stop}?\u003C/blink\u003E*\u0022\n\nThe other one nodded thoughtfully and said, \u0022*\u00A1libertad sin [click] \u003Cclack\u003E vuelta atr\u00E1s! ~lateral fricative~ [left armpit fart] deadmau5\u003C/clack\u003E*.\u0022  \n\nThe first one gave him a rough shove, \u0022*pthbthbthb milakunis \u003Cgleek\u003E wszystkim wbrew na ten gest mnie sta\u0107 {rising belch}?!\u003C/gleek\u003E*\u0022\n\n*\u0022Ke$ha, ke$ha \u003Cmouthpop\u003E [left blink]!\u003C/mouthpop\u003E*\u0022 the other one waved his hands frantically with a look of panic on his face, \u0022*J\u00F6jj\u00F6n sz\u00E1z ork\u00E1n, \u00E9s k\u00F6zben a sz\u00EDvemen \u00FCl a j\u00E9g {hiccup}!*\u0022\n\nUnderwear recoiled as if slapped, then charged and the two of them disappeared into a roiling cloud of dust punctuated by fists and boots. Igor moved a huge, protective hand in front of Valentina, who could only stare in shock. Bill turned with a sigh, produced a hammer from somewhere, and dove into the fracas. \n\nBING! BONG!\n\nThe dust slowly cleared, revealing the other two sitting on the ground, holding their heads. Their helmets seemed to have acquired a new pair of dents. Bill was now yelling at them in an entirely *new* language. Valentina didn\u0027t recognize it, but there was no mistaking the unique tone of a noncommissioned officer dressing down his subordinates. Who were half undressed to start. \n\n\u0022*\u0428H\u0423 TH\u0417\u0427 D\u0424 TH\u0414T?!*\u0022 Igor boomed, glaring with suspicion. \n\nValentina just gaped, shaking her head slightly. \n\n\u0022And there you have the core of the Ceriman problem,\u0022 Reginald explained, mopping his brow, \u0022*he* said, \u0027well, she\u0027s quite the looker, isn\u0027t she?\u0027 and then *he* said, \u0027yes but *your* face looks like the blunt end of a deceased raccoon,\u0027 so *he* said, \u0027why would you say something like that to me?!\u0027 but then *he* said, \u0027sorry, sorry, what I meant to say was, a pox be upon your family and may the fleas of a thousand camels copulate in your armpits.\u0027\u0022\n\nValentina\u0027s expression never changed, she just turned slightly to stare at Reginald. He didn\u0027t seem to notice, just kept wiping his face, \u0022this is precisely why we forbid the contractors from speaking Ceriman. Somehow they\u0027ve adopted an old dialect of Atezacan as a *lingua franca*. Well, most of them at least.\u0022 He glanced nervously toward the gunships, his sweat running a little more.\n\nShe followed his eyes. One of the pilots paused going over his switches to grin at her beneath his dark, bug-eyed helmet, causing her to step back.\n\n*His teeth...*\n\nReginald seemed to avoid eye contact deliberately, \u0022*they* don\u0027t speak anything. No tongues, you see.\u0022\n\nThe pilot just kept grinning at her. She made herself hold his gaze, until his sharpened, interlocking teeth parted just enough to bite down on his own lip, sending a glut of blood down over his chin. She shuddered, and looked away. \n\n\u0022Even the other Cerimans fear *them*,\u0022 Reginald had gone as pale as his rag now, \u0022stories, you see. Like, they consume the bodies of their slain enemies, and mortify their own flesh, and delight in...\u0022 he swallowed hard, \u0022well, probably all just a bunch of mumbo-jumbo anyway. As long as they\u0027re paid, they do as they\u0027re told. And the powers that be always ensure that they\u0027re *well* paid.\u0022\n\nValentina could feel her headache coming back. Igor rumbled like a storm cloud. \n\nAt some point, Bill had stopped yelling at the other two. He pointed to the gunships, \u0022*Valar Arct\u00FBctis*.\u0022\n\n\u0022Erm, yes,\u0022 Reginald wiped his brow, \u0022it means\u2014\u0022\n\n\u0022Children of the Kraken,\u0022 Valentina\u0027s said without looking up. \n\nReginald froze in mid-blot, \u0022well... yes, I suppose that *does* work. It\u0027s a bit flowery, I\u0027d always just translated it as \u0027Brood of the Squid\u0027 myself, but how did you\u2014?\u0022\n\nHow... *did* she know? \u0022I have dealt with *those* before.\u0022\n\n\u0022You have?\u0022 for a moment he seemed to have forgotten to wipe, confused, \u0022well, you\u0027re lucky to be alive, I must say! If that pilot ever finds you again\u2014\u0022\n\n\u0022He\u0027s dead. I knocked him out of the sky,\u0022 she still didn\u0027t look up. Bill\u0027s head whipped around. \n\n\u0022You... shot down a Ceriman gunship?\u0022 Reginald nearly dropped his handkerchief. \n\n\u0022I outflew it and dropped it in a river.\u0022\n\n\u0022*Toruk Makto...*\u0022 Bill whispered, then spun around to the others, \u0022*Toruk Makto!*\u0022\n\n\u0022*Toruk Makto!?*\u0022\n\n\u0022*Toruk Makto!*\u0022\n\nThey all stared at her with eyes wide, \u0022*Toruk Makto!*\u0022\n\nShe blinked, \u0022*Toruk Makto*... what does that mean?\u0022\n\n\u0022Well... er... that is...\u0022 some color finally returned to Reginald\u0027s cheeks, mostly red. He dabbed at his face, \u0022diplomatically speaking, um... it means... one who acts, uh,  without thinking.\u0022 Then added hopefully, \u0022or perhaps just out of ignorance.\u0022\n\nValentina opened her mouth. \n\nValentina closed her mouth. \n\n\u0022*Nobody* takes down a Ceriman gunship!\u0022 he blurted and blotted incredulously, \u0022that\u0027s how you get *El Grande Muerte!* And *worse!* \u0022\n\nShe looked at the three *other* Cerimans. In unison, they took a step back. \n\n\u0022That\u0027s why we *hired* them in the first place. Things beyond the wall can get a bit... sticky,\u0022 he peeled the rag from his face. \n\nSlowly, Valentina raised a hand to her face. Her head was throbbing. Wonderful. An infernal shadowy shadow trying to corrupt the world with mind-controlled goons, a cadre of sub-kerbal mercenaries with a blood-vengeance against her, and a jungle full of giant irradiated hungry things. And now said mercenaries were about to escort her over said jungle with probable said goons. Reginald seemed harmless enough, as long as you didn\u0027t get within spraying distance, but still...\n\n*Dunna trust **anyone**...*\n\n\u0022Let us just get this over with,\u0022 she said with resignation, \u0022I have a rocket to catch.\u0022\n\n\u0022Quite so, quit so,\u0022 he gave the rag one last good ring, \u0022you heard the lady, boys, tallyho and all that rot!\u0022\n\nAs she swung herself up into the cabin, Valentina noted with a frown that both of the Converter\u0027s sliding cargo doors had been removed altogether. In each hatchway now was a pair of large pintle-mounted machine guns. The rest of the craft didn\u0027t exactly look... regulation, either. She took the side-facing jumpseat next to the hatch just behind the pilot, then took a cue from Reginald as he plopped into the seat on the far wall, and clipped her harness on. \n\n\u0022You look nervous,\u0022 she observed. \n\nHe gave a longing look to his handkerchief before pressing a flight helmet onto his head, sending a curtain of sweat down his face, \u0022nervous? Me? Oh, certainly not! It\u0027s just this heat, bother it.\u0022\n\nHe didn\u0027t sound very convincing. With a grimace, she pulled on her own helmet, which smelled *exactly* like one would expect from well-used unwashed helmet in an equatorial jungle. At least it had some decent noise-cancelling headphones, so she could actually hear over the Converter\u0027s shriek. \n\nThe plane listed to one side as Igor pulled himself in and moved toward the front. Incredibly, Reginald\u0027s hands went up, \u0022oh, er, terribly sorry, ah, big fellow, but you\u0027ll have to sit at the aft bulkhead berth.\u0022 Igor\u0027s eyes narrowed, and the entire structure rumbled. Reginald tried to force his face into a helpful grin, \u0022weight and balance and all that.\u0022\n\n\u0022*I \u0428ILL \u042C\u0417 FI\u0419\u042D*,\u0022 Valentina put a hand on an arm like a boulder, \u0022*P\u0417\u042FH\u0414PS IS \u042C\u042DST T\u0424 D\u0424 \u0414S H\u0417 S\u0414\u0423S*.\u0022 \n\nReginald just blinked in confusion. Igor made another noise like a distant rocket launch, but stalked to the back of the cargo area, sitting down with a thump that made the front wheels jump off the ground for just a moment. Reginald blotted and blotted at his face. A small puddle was growing beneath his seat. She *hoped* it was just sweat. But something about this *did* smell awfully fishy. Other than the helmet. \n\nThe three Cerimans seemed to take no notice. They bounded into the cabin with practiced grace, busily setting about prepping their weapons. The one with the big, silly rifle popped it into a rack over his head, and neither one bothered with safety straps or helmets. Bill conceded to only a small headset. From somewhere, he produced a wheel of magnetic tape and fitted it into an ancient reel-to-reel player bodged into rear bulkhead. Even Igor raised an eye... bulge at this.\n\n\u0022Is... is that to scare the enemy?\u0022 Valentina distinctly asked *Bill,* \u0022something about valkyries, over loudspeakers, yes?\u0022\n\nBill looked about to answer, when Reginald broke in, \u0022oh, heavens, no! The noise of an incoming Converter is *quite* enough to send any fool with a brain running. And if not, well, there\u0027s...\u0022 he nodded out the door towards the gunships. He\u0027d gone quite pale again. That pilot was still... staring.\n\nIn the back, Bill just rolled his eyes. He thumped a fist twice on the hull, then spun a finger in the air. The pilot began the familiar old hand-ballet that led to the engines spooling up through ever more grating levels of ear-splitting. \n\nThe gunships lifted off first, their nuclear-powered engines somehow still belching oily black smoke. The Converter shuddered, Reginald squealed, and it too slowly rose into the air. Igor\u0027s face bore a look of grim determination. He reached up, grabbed a random fuselage stringer, and bent it around himself as a makeshift belt. Far from being unsettled by this, the Cerimans seemed quite bemused.  \n\nAndacamian buzzed in Valentina\u0027s ears, \u0022*Vuelo de banana, est\u00E1n permitidos cruzar la Muralla... **hasta Cerima**.*\u0022\n\nAs the Converter lumbered ahead, Reginald seemed on the verge of hyperventilating. The two gunships took up echelon positions on either side, just a little behind. Valentina watched as they crossed over the top of the Wall. The far side looked like a loosing battle against the jungle, the land had been cleared for perhaps a couple of hundred meters at one point, but already vines and small trees were moving back in. The Wall itself bore the scars of many... things with more determination than brain power. Looking out the glazed nose past the pilot, the jungle seemed to stretch on, unbroken, forever. \n\nThis place didn\u0027t feel right. It wasn\u0027t the utter *wrongness* of the M\u00FCn, but still... it just wasn\u0027t *right*. The feeling itself was *layers* of madness, but Valentina was beginning to learn to trust those feelings. That, and... \n\nShe had known what would happen even then, she had *known* it, but... she had the growing feeling that something terrible had happened to Anastasia. \n\nBill pressed a button on the tape machine, and Valentina\u0027s earphones filled with the twangy sound of an instrument she\u0027d never heard before. A primal, syncopated drumbeat followed, and as the unusual little formation wailed out across the jungle canopy, the singer painted a dark picture...\n\n*I see a red door and I want to paint it black...No colors anymore, I want them to turn black...*\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-10T06:05:31Z\u0022 title=\u002201/10/2017 06:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 10, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"lodger","CreatedById":126565,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-10T07:21:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, CatastrophicFailure said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Bill pressed a button on the tape machine, and Valentina\u0027s earphones filled with the twangy sound of an instrument she\u0027d never heard before.

Then Valentina found herself looking *up* at one particular tree top, and realized they weren\u0027t quite above *all* of them. \n\n\u0022Are we not flying rather low?\u0022 she asked as another towering, vine-encrusted sentinel whizzed by the open doorway. \n\n\u0022Bit of a gamble, I\u0027m afraid,\u0022 Reginald managed. He\u0027d actually given up blotting and was now clinging to his harness for dear life, \u0022at this altitude we *are* quite vulnerable to small arms fire, but any higher and we\u0027d risk passing into SAM cones.\u0022\n\nShe blinked, \u0022surface to air missiles??\u0022\n\nHe gripped his straps a bit tighter as the plane hit an air pocket, \u0022some of the local factions are surprisingly well equipped.\u0022\n\nFrowning, she said, \u0022you\u2014er, *we*, seem to have a fairly well equipped army, too. Could you not \u2014what\u0027s the word?\u2014 placate them?\u0022\n\n\u0022My dear, do you know what the first rule of getting involved in a land war in Cerima is?\u0022\n\nShe didn\u0027t. \n\n\u0022Never get involved in a land war in Cerima.\u0022 His eye... bulge rose just a hair, \u0022despite how it may look, we try to *avoid* conflict with the locals. Conflict causes delays, and the last thing we need right now are a bunch of irate babbling Cerimans at our doorstep who *aren\u0027t* on our payroll.\u0022\n\nBill\u0027s eyes flicked up, but only for an instant. He stood at the back of the cabin, next to Igor, casually hanging on with one hand. The other two were all business, swinging their guns back and forth in slow arcs, eyes never lingering in any one place. \n\nValentina called back to Bill, gesturing at her own head and speaking slowly, \u0022what happened to your helmet?\u0022\n\nSurprisingly, Bill actually got to answer, \u0022bilong mi brata. Nogat nidim, sho.\u0022\n\nShe stared at the gaping bullet hole. That didn\u0027t sound good, \u0022why did your brother not need it anymore?\u0022\n\n\u0022Him gat nupela hat ain,\u0022 the slightest hint of a grin touched his lips. \n\n\u0022Clever. Why do\u2014\u0022 the skin suddenly tried to droop from Valentina\u0027s face as the pilot pulled up hard. Bill started barking out commands. Reginald squealed like a goat. It only lasted a moment before her stomach shifted the other way, and the plane leveled out, banking into a slight turn. Bill was pointing out the door. She followed his hand, and saw a patch down below where the treetops were whipping back and forth as they had not long ago, before the Wall. Straining, she tried to get some glimpse of whatever creature could *do* that, but the jungle was deep and dark. \n\nAs the mass of epileptic trees advanced, it startled a flock of birds into flight. No, *not* birds. Too big to be birds. Most of them scattered, shrieking horrendously, but one seemed to charge directly at the Converter. Long, leathery wings beat at the thick jungle air, not just keeping pace with the aircraft but gaining quickly. \n\nThe underweared one swung his guns onto it, but his compatriot put a hand on his shoulder and shook his head. He called something out to the pilot, who held a steady, circling, easy to predict course. The wing\u00E9d thing drew closer and closer, its scaly purple hide shimmering in the sun. The Ceriman popped his huge rifle out of the rack and cycled the bolt. He took aim through the simple iron sights. Waiting. Motionless. The thing was upon them. \n\n*Sound...*\n\n*Sound...*\n\n*...the world became sound...*\n\nThe noise of the Converter was briefly quelled by the thundering *BOOM* of the rifle, flame jutted a meter from the muzzle, and the horrible screeching beast simply disappeared in a purple mist. No, not *completely* gone... Valentina barely had time to register it before the head flew into the cabin, bounced off the roof, and landed on the floor.\n\nIt... it was *hideous!* Teeth... everywhere were teeth... it had teeth coming out of its eyes! Its head seemed to be *entirely* teeth. Such a thing shouldn\u0027t be anatomically possible, it made her eyes water just to look at it, yet there it was, lying on the deck plating.\n\nThe Ceriman nudged it with the bayonet, and it clamped onto it with a horrendous noise despite now missing most of its important bits. He grinned at it, then at his buddy, and the two of them knocked the backs of their forearms together in some sort of victory celebration. He deposited the frightful head in a large metal bin at the back of the cabin. By the sound of it, it wasn\u0027t empty. \n\n\u0022Horrid creatures,\u0022 Reginald said, wiping his face with a look of disgust, \u0022give our heavy transports nothing but troubles. Too big for most small arms, too quick for the autotrackers. They pay a sizable bounty down in the Hole for each head. A nice bonus on top of our already generous wages.\u0022 The look that passed between the three Cerimans told Valentina *exactly* how generous that wage really was. \n\n\u0022What... *was* that thing??\u0022 She said to no one in particular. \n\nBill answered, \u0022him nem, \u0027chew-face-spit-bone\u0027,\u0022 he shook his head, \u0022Mo-mo nogut, mo-mo nogut.\u0022 The bin thumped. \n\nThey banked around back on course, nearly due east as far as Valentina could tell. The jungle seemed still for now, if not exactly quiet. Every now and then, they passed over a meandering scar down through the trees to the rich reddish dirt beneath. Some sort of road. This, too, looked like a constant war of attrition against the encroaching vegetation. She pressed Reginald on this.\n\n\u0022We fly in everything we can, of course,\u0022 he said as he blotted, \u0022expensive, but far more reliable than the road. Those big Ki-48\u0027s your government has been so gracious to supply can carry nearly anything. But unfortunately there *are* some things that simply won\u0027t fit, even in a Super Converter. That\u0027s why we have the Arma-*diyo* back at the base.\u0022\n\n\u0022You seem to have it down to a routine,\u0022 *diplomatic, be diplomatic. Try not to think you might be sitting across from an abomination.*\n\n\u0022Quite so. Rather the accomplishment under the circumstances, if I do say so myself. We have our share of delays, of course, but Mr. Kerman knew what he was about when he set everything in motion years ago.\u0022 Wipe, wipe.\n\n\u0022Mister Kerman. You mean Layland Kerman.\u0022\n\nThe wiping paused, and his eyes narrowed just a fraction, \u0022*Mister* Kerman is brilliant. If you\u0027ve been cleared this far, then you must see that too. I\u0027ve been an adherent of his since the early days, and so I\u0027ve been blessed enough to witness the impossible. Here, in the most dangerous place in the world, filled with the most disagreeable *people* in the world, he\u0027s managed to get them to work together and build a *spaceport*,\u0022 his eyes seemed to glaze over, Valentina recognized a cast to them she\u0027d first seen years ago, on the baking hot concrete of the Kerbal Space Center at high noon, \u0022a tiny enclave of his vision for all Kermanity: a place with no government, no borders, none of the things that divide people. And from there, to send his aspiration of hope to the planets, and beyond.\u0022\n\nThe intensity faded away, and Reginald returned to blotting and sweating, \u0022of course, things are a bit different, now.\u0022\n\n\u0022How... do you mean?\u0022 Valentina asked, caution giving way to curiosity. \n\nHe raised an eye... bulge... then dabbed at it, \u0022well... perhaps you\u0027ve not yet been corrupted,\u0022 he leaned in conspiratorially, a silly thing since his voice only came through the intercom anyway, \u0022I trust you are familiar with that... business on the M\u00FCn a few years back?\u0022\n\nShe was. *Too* familiar.\n\nHe nodded, \u0022it was the Board of Directors that pressured Mister Kerman into acceding to it. Insisted on a test of the habitation hardware *in situ* despite the years of data from the KSA space station, then further testing on Duna. Then they turned around and used the, *ahem*, *incident*... as a pretext to wrest control of the Company from him and force him into retirement. And *then* once KSA funding was diverted to the planned Duna mission, through some *very* impressive bureaucratic tomfoolery, the whole program simply faded away with the money *and* the half-finished hardware now in the Company\u0027s possession. So you see, the Board *has* advanced the program considerably, but the priorities have somewhat... mutated.\u0022 Despite the sweltering heat, he shuddered. \n\nA thousand *more* questions stampeded across Valentina\u0027s mind. What she settled on was, \u0022wait, what do you mean, I have not been \u0027corrupted?\u0027\u0022\n\nReginald tapped a finger to the side of his...  not-nose,  \u0022in the beginning, we were pure. All working toward a common goal. Since the Board took over, too many have lost their way, pursuing all... sorts.... of..... mis...... gui....... ded........\u0022 he trailed off, eyes following some sort of building as it passed by below, then rising into panic. \n\n\u0022Pilot! Why are we going *this* way?!\u0022 he nearly screamed.\n\n\u0022*\u00BFQue?*\u0022 the pilot half-turned.\n\nReginald shook his head, and started yelling at the fellow in Andacamian. The pilot yelled back. By now, Valentina had picked up enough bits of other languages to guess which words had four letters, and both Kerbs seem to be using a *lot* of them. Finally, the pilot pointed emphatically to his knee board, then slapped his hand against it with a final word that sounded *quite* rude indeed. \n\nShe didn\u0027t need to know the language to translate, *I have my orders and this is **my** aircraft. If you don\u0027t like it, you can bloody well get out and walk.*\n\nReginald sat back against his seat, face, pale as his clothes, eyes, like dinner plates, and muttered softly, \u0022oh dear.\u0022\n\nSomeone seemed to pick up on it in the back. The grainy music in her headphones changed to an upbeat, thumping drumline, a gravelly voice singing about a fortunate son.\n\n*...and when the band plays, \u0027Hail to the Chief\u0027Ooh they point the cannon at you...*  \n\nThrough the glazed nose of the Converter, what looked like a very compact city suddenly appeared. Ragged, skeletal buildings rose into the sky like reaching corpse fingers. Valentina couldn\u0027t tell if they were half completed or half destroyed. Either way, the jungle was rapidly winning *this* war too, as spindly green vines wrapped around steel and concrete. \n\nThey crossed the edge of the tree line out over the city proper. Here, she could see roads, kars, all the signs of civilization. All being slowly swallowed by foliage. Yet even here, there were signs of habitation. As they passed one towering relic, she saw smoke from a cookfire trailing up from a shattered wall. Hanging on a rusting beam were colorful curtains, or perhaps someone\u0027s laundry. And there, in that empty window, a muzzle flash\u2014\n\nSomething went *pink* just above Valentina\u0027s head, opening a small hole in the plane\u0027s metal skin. \n\nAnd then many things happened all at once. \n\nSomething else when *pink* just beside her. Then again and again. Holes surrounded by spiderwebbing cracks appeared one by one in the plexiglass nose. \n\n\u0022*\u00A1Aye, caramba!*\u0022 the pilot cried, jamming the wheel forward. Valentina was shoved upwards against her straps. The three Cerimans all went airborne, the two of them clinging to their guns firing off in staccato bursts that filled the cabin with noise, fire, and searing brass casings. And somewhere, somewhere, a terrified little girl was screaming at the top of her lungs. \n\nNo. Wait. That was just Reginald. \n\nAs Valentina stared at him, his eyes wide with sheer panic, the pilot pulled up, and his rolls of flubber gave a very disquieting demonstration of fluid mechanics as the various acceleration vectors rapidly changed. And still the guns rattled away, *BAMBAMBAMBAMBAM!*, the crew seemingly firing away at random. \n\nNo... not random. Even in this chaos, Valentina could sense method to it. The Converter jinked one last time before pulling into a steep, arcing turn. Out the hatchway, now pointing at the ground, she saw one of the gunships roll in on the building where the shots came from. \n\n*BRRRT! BRRRT! BRRRRRRRRRRRRT!*\n\nTracers from its chain guns impacted the base of the tower, then a vicious fusillade of rockets tore from its wings, trailing smoke and sparks for an instant before they, too, slammed into the structure. Fire bloomed like an infernal flower, the dull, concussive *thuds* of the warheads reaching Valentina\u0027s ears despite the Converter\u0027s wail. Bits of burning debris cast their own corkscrewing trails of smoke tumbling through the air. \n\nThe first gunship peeled away, and the second one rolled in, repeating the attack in a coordinated assault. She watched in horror as the building shuddered, listed, swayed... then then toppled in slow motion like a felled tree, trailing billowing clouds of black and brown and grey. It smashed into the tower across the street, tearing at its face, before disappearing into an enormous cloud of smoke and dust. At some point, the tape player had switched to the next track. \n\n*War! Uh!Good Kerm, y\u0027allWhat is it good for?Absolutely nothin\u0027!*\n\nFor a moment, Valentina thought she might be sick. Then she saw Igor\u0027s face. A cast of grim resignation was slowly creeping over a complexion that looked decidedly green. Er. She quickly swung around to the pilot, not even knowing what she was yelling, pointing frantically at the rudder pedal. He looked at her, looked in his mirror, looked at Igor... and then much to his credit connected the dots very quickly and jammed his foot down with everything he had. The Converter yawed sideways into its own slipstream. \n\n\u0022*H\u0426\u042F\u041A*,\u0022 said Igor, adding his own brand of biological warfare to the pandemonium down below in a long, stringy, slightly chunky technicolor stream carried safely away from the plane by the air flowing through it. Once sufficiently emptied, Igor gave a weak thumbs-up.\n\nFinally, the pilot returned to straight and level flight. The gunships resumed their positions just off his wings. The two Cerimans did their little victory slap. The group left the smoking wreckage behind, heading out across the jungle again as a new track came through the speakers.\n\n*I fell in to a burning ring of fire,I went down, down, downAnd the flames went higher.And it burns, burns, burns,The ring of fire,The ring of fire.*\n\nExcept Valentina could barely hear it. Across from her, Reginald was still screaming. He barely paused to take a breath. His wild eyes had gone far beyond panic into hysteria while kicked and flailed against his straps. Valentina unfastened her own with a sigh, grabbed a stringer overhead and used it to pivot up and kick him squarely in the chin with both feet. His head rebounded off the panel behind, and the horrible noise finally ceased. She fell back into her own seat with a huff, pinching her eyes shut against the applause. \n\n\u0022Was that really necessary?\u0022 she said, and looked back at Bill. \n\nHe shrugged, \u0022him no sarap, cray-cray prat, hims sho.\u0022\n\nShe glanced at Reginald, \u0022no, not him. There were *people* in that building.\u0022\n\nBill shrugged again, \u0022is ples nogut, no kam bek,\u0022 he pointed to the unconscious Kerb across from her, \u0022him save long. Him ken.\u0022\n\n\u0022But... why did they shoot at us in the first place?\u0022 she asked, trying to make sense of the other\u0027s words. \n\n\u0022Ausaitas,\u0022 he looked at Reginald, \u0022bosbois. Dem kam. No ken bus, no ken Seri-mah\u0027. Biktaun, trai wokim. Wokim nogut.\u0022 He pointed out toward a gunship, \u0022*Valar Arct\u00FBctis*. *Dem* kam,\u0022 and spat.\n\n\u0022You do not like them,\u0022 not a question. \n\nHe spat again, \u0022Tunglis no tru Seri-mah\u0027! No laitin, d\u00FBm Seri-mah! Always is fait. Nebah pis,\u0022 he tapped at his helmet, \u0022nebah *min*.\u0022\n\n\u0022But... they are taking orders from...\u0022 she nodded to the jiggly white lump across from her. \n\n\u0022Bikman, him kam. Him painim dip Seri-mah\u0027, weh noman go. Wokim pis. Wokim ples, no mo fait. Skulim laitinman. *Dem*,\u0022 he gestured out the door, \u0022him baim.\u0022\n\nValentina felt more confused than ever. Before she could ask anything else, Reginald groaned.\n\n\u0022Oh, my... what... what happened?\u0022 he looked around, \u0022oh! I\u0027m bleeding!\u0022\n\nShe thought fast, \u0022er... shrapnel!\u0022\n\n\u0022W\u2014what?\u0022\n\n\u0022Yes, um, you were hit in chin by shrapnel,\u0022 she flashed a winning smile, \u0022you took it like champ!\u0022\n\n\u0022I... I did?\u0022 he winced as he felt his chin, then an odd little smile formed on his own face, \u0022I... I shall have to fill out a Combat Injury Report...\u0022\n\n*Strike while he\u0027s disoriented,* \u0022that settlement back there... what was it?\u0022\n\n\u0022Hm? Oh, that,\u0022 he grew a bit paler as his shuffled his handkerchief around and saw the blood on it, \u0022some of our earliest forays into this part of the world were not always so... efficacious.\u0022\n\n\u0022How so?\u0022 she raised an eye... bulge.\n\n\u0022Early on there was a bit of... well, let\u0027s call it a language barrier. It seems that\u0027s nearly *all* of the trouble around here. Mister Kerman quickly discovered that Cerimans can actually be *quite* industrious... as long as they\u0027re not allowed to speak Ceriman.\u0022\n\nValentina winced against another set of pulsing beats in her ears, \u0022regulations?\u0022\n\n*Pleased to meet you!(Woo!
