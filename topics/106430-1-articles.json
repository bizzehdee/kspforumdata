Just what i was going to suggest ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) Either have \u0022receiver\u0022 antennas or just have existing antennas being able to receive data, that will then be sent to any antenna in range until it gets to kerbin. It sends a \u0022linking\u0022 transmission that will try to find a link to kerbin. It will try to use as small amounts of antennas as possible, and tell if no connection can be established."},{"CreatedByName":"micha","CreatedById":113840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T10:39:46Z","Content":"The AntennaRange mod I linked to above does exactly what you guys are asking for.."},{"CreatedByName":"Master_Evar","CreatedById":98074,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T10:42:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The AntennaRange mod I linked to above does exactly what you guys are asking for..\n\nI saw that, but it would be nice for stock as there is no reason at all to use a more expensive antenna.
