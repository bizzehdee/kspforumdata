Most of the rockets i launch explode, don\u0027t have enough Delta-V to get there, or simply just crash at some point in the mission. I am now looking to a Kraken drive as an alternate mode of propulsion. (Since i play on the Xbox One, 1.2 hasn\u0027t came to the console edition yet. So any working k-drive from before 1.2 is good on the console)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Optimist","CreatedById":151904,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-17T02:22:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood for you. What exactly is the purpose of this thread, though? Are you looking for existing designs or ideas to make your own? And I should warn you that kraken drives work strangely and may not function on different platforms.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cunjo Carl","CreatedById":162109,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-19T07:13:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only consistent kraken drive I know of at this point is the ladder drive. It\u0027s a bit trickier to use than rockets, but I\u0027ll put this link to an old thread here in case you find it useful/entertaining.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/141696-kerbal-powered-flight-challenges/\u0026amp;page=2\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only one in this thread capable of interstellar flight would be the one in this post:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/141696-kerbal-powered-flight-challenges/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0026amp;comment=2679370\u0026amp;embedComment=2679370\u0026amp;embedDo=findComment\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s an older post, so you\u0027ll see the broken Imgur galleries.

No guarantee though, I\u0027m still awash in exploding craft myself! Ever onwards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
