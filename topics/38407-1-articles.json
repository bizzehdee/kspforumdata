When you are on the launch pad, you can manually input the amount of fuel you want in the tank. It actually can change the value of any resource in a tank, even electricity and solid fuel. It can also be used to transfer from a tank to another, but it can do much more. There\u0027s also a dump system, so it can do like those parts you have there. The main advantage is that it uses no parts, so it really helps on the part count and produces less lag.
