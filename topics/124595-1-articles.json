Starmade\u0027s been great, From The Depths has been great, and I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve been addicted to a game as much as ARK: Survival Evolved before (Avoid official servers though). Actually, the only early access title I kind of regret getting is Stranded Deep, simply because development is moving at such a slow pace. To be honest, I think I\u0027ve gotten more critical of SQUAD because of some of these devs (Though SQUAD has definitely gotten a bit better recently).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-08T02:11:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI do not think I ever regretted supporting an early access game, while I have backed a few.

If you are out to get your money\u0027s worth, that is the right approach. If you are out to finance upcoming developers and companies, in hopes of adding another interesting title to the library of games out there or to give some people a break, you can spend money on something that is not quite there yet. If I can make things better by risking a few bucks, I do not mind doing so. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf everyone only financed things that are already great fun, starting new projects becomes considerably harder. I have helped finance some pretty preliminary projects, and none so far turned out a disappointment. Most are great fun. I would rather finance four or five indies with the risk of one or two failing, than spend the same amount on some production line AAA title, if I am honest. I accept that failure is an option, but without risk (both conceptually and financially) there is no reward. Trying new things and the guarantee of success are not really compatible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
