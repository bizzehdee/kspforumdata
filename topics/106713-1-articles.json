It works fine so long as I don\u0027t use the symmetry feature in the VAB or SAB. It looks like it\u0027s rotating along one of the axes rather than mirroring the model.\n\nAny idea how or if it\u0027s possible to achieve it?

It should look in Unity as it does in the VAB. Hope that makes sense?"}]}
