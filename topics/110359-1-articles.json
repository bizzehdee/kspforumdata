I think it would be useful if some additional information were shown, e.g., current angular velocity and duration of a full orbit. That might help with approach manoeuvres for a rendezvous.\n\nAlso, if several orbital reference points (apo/periapsis, intersections) are close to each over, the mouse-over texts of them are printed in the same place, making them hard to read. For orbiting objects, they are printed beneath each other, like a list. I think that would be nice for the reference points, too.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-22T11:59:48Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2015 11:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by akruppa**\n  \nReference points, not orbiting objects, in 2nd paragraph."},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T14:08:59Z","Content":"really agreed, the information about apoapsis and periapsis (and so) superposing gets very annoying at times."}]}
