Any additional things you\u0027d like to see?\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there are parts you\u0027ve suggested before, and I haven\u0027t done them, either I\u0027ve forgotten (it happens), or it\u0027s something I\u0027m putting off, or haven\u0027t found a good way to work in yet. For the moment, I\u0027m avoiding larger engines. The only one I\u0027m still thinking of at the moment is a 1.25m monopropellant engine (and, I\u0027m tempted to make an alternate SLS-Quad engine; same stats but different appearance to the KS-25x4, since the stock engine looks goofy to me with such small engine skirts for the amount of thrust, and bi-radial symmetry instead of purely radial symmetry. But this one is a \u0022maybe\u0022). I\u0027m also going to have to wait on command pods, since the IVA thing is going to take some experimenting, and apparently hatches and ladders are very touchy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t bothered with the 3.75m battery, since I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s actually useful. I never see screenshots of people stacking thousands of EC worth of batteries, and I\u0027ve never needed that kind of power either. And at 3.75m, we\u0027re mostly talking about lifter stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also thought about radial stack mounts, as mentioned previously, but other mods handle that really well. I\u0027d also feel compelled to make one in each diameter. I can certainly do these, as it would be fairly easy to make, but I only want to do this if it\u0027s going to be useful. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince people were talking about VTOLs, I added basic-jets to the turbo-jet parts I did this past week. So I think we\u0027re done with jet parts, at least at the small scale. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny additional ideas? It\u0027s OK to repeat yourself here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2. Sort order of 2.5m tanks in the VAB/SPH.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI gave interesting internal ID names to these parts, but they don\u0027t sort well, so they\u0027re jumbled up with the other parts in the VAB menus. I can rename them such that they group together and sort properly. How important is this to you? Doing this would break existing saves, since the part names would change internally. I could provide a list of changes to fix your saves though, for those who are comfortable editing the persistence files. Even though I\u0027m calling this a \u0022beta\u0022, I\u0027m trying not to break saves. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.necrobones.com/images/screenshots/fueltank-order.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EClick here to see the current order\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3.

It was one of the earlier pieces I made, while I was figuring out Blender. Useful? Not useful? Should I take off the nose cone and allow stacking at the top? Luckily, even though I made it a radial part, the CoM should be right in the center line. My worry would have been with allowing it to stack, and then having an off-center CoM. It has the height and capacity of two FL-T800 tanks, but that\u0027s including the nose-cone (that is, the height with the cone included is about the same, since I used that capacity). If I take the cone off, extending the height of the cylinder to compensate might make sense. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, just looking for some opinions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the same image:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/4eBHwnS.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224eBHwnS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-18T14:41:29Z\u0022 title=\u002209/18/2014 02:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by NecroBones\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Parkaboy","CreatedById":64208,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-18T14:50:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi, just dropping by to say this mod pack is starting to look very good!

The fairing panels appear automatically when you stack something at the top.
