Why not have all the launcher options inside the game, like screen resolutions and all that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-What\u0027s the point of setting certain resolutions lower than 1024x768 if the game UI will just clutter around and overlap it\u0027s buttons? It\u0027s impossible to play the game at, say 800x480, because the VAB/SPH buttons overlap each other. Unless your plan it\u0027s to only fly stuff, you\u0027re not going anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The launcher doesn\u0027t start by default, making it almost useless, unless you need settings to work or is too lazy to manually edit the settings.cfg file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the launcher was, in theory, a nice addition to KSP,in practice it has bugs and doesn\u0027t really does what a launcher on most games does: Give the user the ability to change all the settings before starting the game. If you take a look, games that have launchers have all the resolution and game mechanics options in the launcher and not inside the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aeTIos","CreatedById":17032,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-05T15:26:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EACtually, if you use the installer, the launcher *does* start by default.

There are two problems with it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Some screen resolutions are not supported by KSP, hiding buttons and things like that as result. As an example, playing the game at 1024x600 will make impossible for you to click the \u0027Research Science\u0027 button at the R\u0026amp;D screen. Playing in 800x480, makes all the VAB and SPH buttons overlap, making impossible for you to search differen component categories.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The launcher changes terrain detail to \u0027high\u0027 automatically when you apply or accept settings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-05T23:37:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022plainawesome\u0022 data-cite=\u0022plainawesome\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EActually, if you go into the game folder, you can use the launcher.
