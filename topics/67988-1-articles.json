Using KAS, KWRocketry, and Kethane mods, with Kethane refuels coming from Minmus. I have a couple of service ships for moving things around, one currently docked on top of the PPD-12 base. I noticed you can transfer fuels through the asteroid, which I\u0027ll consider a feature until its potentially fixed as a \u0022bug\u0022. Tons of containers filled with all kinds of parts so I\u0027ll run KAS lines if that ever happens. My favorite item is the 3.75/2.5 dual purpose docking \u0022pad\u0022.
