There was no warning that 1.0.3 would break saves... Since you marketed it simply as a bug-fixing patch. All it did was create more. In my experience at least.\n\n![9NyPczt.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/9NyPczt.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T01:35:34Z","Content":"Am working this now. Moved the Kerbfleet save into 1.0.3... VAB broken, picture just like Jon144\u0027s. Then removed all mods except KER (I have ships with the Engineer Chip part, so this is a must-load on that save), reloaded, and it\u0027s fine. Will start adding mods back now and see what happens...\n\nETA: All mods loaded (KER, Alarm Clock, Boulder/EVE) and it\u0027s fine. Now will start moving some ships into the VAB and see what happens.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-24T01:44:57Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2015 01:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kuzzter**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T10:29:59Z","Content":"Ok, I moved some ships in and it was fine.

Loading a working save (or starting a new one) seems to correctly initialise something in KSP so it is then be able to load the bad save.\n\nWe will need an output\\_log.txt/player.log file of a run where the VAB has problems and (preferably) the save file you loaded that had this issue. The more examples of bad saves that we can give to the developers, the easier it will be for them to track down the problem and fix it."},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T10:49:03Z","Content":"Thanks--cannot get those files fro where I am but did find another thread where sal\\_vager said that the IRL pointing to the tech tree could get corrupted by module manager. This makes sense, as I did move mod folders in and out of the new install when I moved the save.\n\nWill try editing .sfs to point to the correct tech tree, and will report back a bit later."},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T12:21:01Z","Content":"OK here we go...
