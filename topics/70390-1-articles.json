Secondly, AFAIK they plan to make it in a modular maner, so components could be switched depending on the use. Also, tehey are allegedly improving ergonomics and reverting to inner and outer garment approach, like with the Appolo suits. I would be suprised if longer EVA duration, coupeled with possible air/watter/power replenishment while on EVA, were not on to do list.
