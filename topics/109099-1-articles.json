Not that games have to be realistic to be fun (the whole Mario franchise makes no sense at all when you think about it), but KSP is just realistic enough that my expectations are set accordingly. It has a physics engine that makes things behave the way they would (for the most part) in the real world, so my expectation is that other aspects should work in a similar way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe the underlying argument isn\u0027t about realism itself but rather about whether the proposed addition, mod, feature, etc. seems to fit in with the franchise. Example: Super Mario World isn\u0027t realistic at all, but if you gave Mario a plasma cannon (equally unrealistic) it would just feel... wrong. (edit: I mean, he shoots fireballs out of his hands, but a plasma cannon makes no sense in the Mario universe.
