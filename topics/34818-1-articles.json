One of which was a variant with a V-tail and swept-back wings. Another was a variant equipped with the experimental X-4 wire-guided missiles. Neither variants ever took flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETa-183 jet fighter:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis jet resembled an F-86 Sabre with a T-tail and a stubby fuselage. It was designed primarily as an airborne X-4 missile platform, but was also armed with four heavy cannons. The Germans had actually begun production of this aircraft, but the war ended before many were made, and British forces captured the production lines. Aircraft with designs based on the Ta-183 were experimented with, but the Ta-183 itself never flew.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe-178 (?):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least I think it was 178... Anyway, the He-178 was the first plane ever to fly by turbojet power. The original variant, with a double-tail similar to a B-25\u0027s tail, entered mass production and saw combat towards the end of the war. Other variants had different wing designs and V-tails, and I believe that they entered their test flight phases, but they were never mass-produced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBI rocket interceptor:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe BI-1 was developed around 1942 by the Soviet Union, and was tested on the field of battle a few times. The aircraft saw success at first, and other variants were produced, equipped with different rocket engines and ramjets. However, due to battlefield complications and high cost of production, the BI program was terminated. A lot of the variants never flew.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYak jet fighter:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith Me-262s inflicting heavy losses on Allied air squadrons, the Soviet Union experimented with a peculiar aircraft design in an attempt to create a fighter that could counter it. The experiment involved taking an intact Yak fighter and refitting the propeller engine with one of the jet engines from a captured Me-262. The result was the Yak jet prototype. However, the war ended before the experiment ever took flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI-250:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis design was basically a propeller fighter with a jet engine in the back. It was more of a post-war experiment and never saw combat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of this information came from the game Il-2 1946 by Ubisoft. It\u0027s a great game, but not as good as KSP in my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-26T06:23:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might find this interesting:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.luft46.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.luft46.com/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jwenting","CreatedById":57735,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-26T10:16:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Ta-183 flew, albeit in somewhat modified form, after the war in both Argentina and the USSR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETest firings of X4 missiles were AFAIK performed from Me-262s but it did not enter service before the war ended (to the relief of a lot of bomber crews no doubt).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are far more than those mentioned in that game, on all sides, that never made it into combat or only entered service after the war ended.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Canopus","CreatedById":57774,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-26T11:06:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love the Silbervogel: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mLQZh_0Svq4/UOherWD5y0I/AAAAAAAAY-8/yTO8OawYO00/s320/Silbervogel.JPG\u0022 alt=\u0022Silbervogel.JPG\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-26T12:06:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Canopus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Canopus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI love the Silbervogel: \u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mLQZh_0Svq4/UOherWD5y0I/AAAAAAAAY-8/yTO8OawYO00/s320/Silbervogel.JPG\u0022 alt=\u0022Silbervogel.JPG\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly problem was they\u0027d actually mucked up their heat flow calculations; it\u0027d have burned up on re-entry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Canopus","CreatedById":57774,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-26T12:11:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis one is cool too.
