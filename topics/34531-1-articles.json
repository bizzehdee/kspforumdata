They aren\u0027t going to be HD, they are just going to be a few pixels, but just imagine seeing a pale blue/green dot around another star.... I can\u0027t wait for the pixel pictures to see new star systems, can you?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Unit One","CreatedById":71471,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-24T05:32:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat are you talking about, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/faq.html#detectors\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u0022a few pixels\u0022?\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if 2,048 x 2,048 isn\u0027t enough for you, keep in mind that often times in astronomical observation telescopes will take multiple images to create image mosaics for higher resolutions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it will only be a blue or green dot if they false-color it that way since the only colors it will be able to see are orange, red, and infrared.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yes, I can\u0027t wait for it to start operating, though I\u0027m very disappointed the telescope won\u0027t run longer than 10 years since it won\u0027t be serviceable.

In 1 micron band, this will let the telescope resolve 1 AU from about 100ly. The figure quoted by the site, 0.1\u0022 at 2 microns is only slightly bellow this theoretical limit. So yes, in principle, the telescope is large enough and sensitive enough to resolve planets orbiting some relatively nearby stars. Whether it actually performs as expected, we will find out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Unit One","CreatedById":71471,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-24T16:07:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, I misread the OP. Though, isn\u0027t Hubble\u0027s resolving power also 0.1\u0022? Is the JWST\u0027s only advantage that it has a coronagraph and looks in IR, or will the larger mirror provide significantly less noise to actually be able to take advantage of the 0.1\u0022 resolution?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m honestly much more excited about what it\u0027ll provide as far as distant galaxies.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-24T21:19:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHubble could resolve 0.1\u0022 in 0.5 micron. This makes Webb about 2-3 times better at resolving power, and this increases number of stars where we could look for planets at least 10-fold. Webb should also do much better with high contrast stuff, because Hubble\u0027s optics had some problems. Add to that additional features of the sensors, better tracking, more opportunity for image processing, and I think it might just get us to the point where we can actually see a planet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drunkrobot","CreatedById":58034,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-25T03:43:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou also have to remember that the James Webb will be sitting out at the Earth-Sun L2 Lagrange point, while Hubble has this big, bright, noisy rock underneath it.
