As far as I can tell the kethane deposits are recorded via pixel color in PluginData\\MMI_Kethane. Is it as simple as adding new regions to the proper planet.png? The reason I ask is I have a base that I placed in the stock game, hoping that one day I\u0027d be able to use it as a resource outpost. However, once I downloaded Kethane I discovered to my chagrin that there are no deposits near my base.
