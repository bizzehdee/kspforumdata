The only thing it won\u0027t do is clear the completed maneuver node so that it can aim at the next properly, but this doesn\u0027t require a remote connection, so it could still work to plan multiple nodes to be executed out of transmitter range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, hit \u0022\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0022 to show the commands queue. For the first node, simply hit \u0022NODE\u0022, then \u0022EXEC\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the next node, you have to know in how much time you will need to execute that node. Let\u0027s say that maneuver node is in 4 hours. You will first need to orient yourself towards that next maneuver, so you need to queue a \u0022NODE\u0022 command before the burn, let\u0027s say in 3 hours 40 minutes. Type \u00223h40m\u0022 in the input box at the lower right corner, besides the \u0022\u0026gt;\u0022 button, then click \u0022\u0026gt;\u0022. The \u0022Delay\u0022 should now display \u00223h40m\u0022, this means any command you input from now on will be executed in 3h40m from the time you input the action.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, hit \u0022Node\u0022, and a command to orient towards the maneuver node should show up in the queue with a 3h40m delay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, it would be nice if you could simply hit \u0022Exec\u0022, and it would execute the next node, starting from 3h40m later, but that doesn\u0027t work, since the Exec command completely ignores the manual delay you just set.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead, you have to input a manual burn. Set the \u0022Throttle\u0022 slider to 100% (or less, as you wish), write the delta-v of your burn below it (e.g. \u0022204.5m/s\u0022), and prepare to click \u0022BURN\u0022 to queue the command. Before queuing the command, you need to adjust the manual delay so that the burn starts exactly when you want. Your burn is probably 3h55m from now, so write that in the delay input again, hit \u0022\u0026gt;\u0022, then hit \u0022BURN\u0022 to queue your burn command.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you mess up, you can cancel a command from the queue and add it again with the proper delay. You can of course adjust the timing of your burns so they start a bit before the actual maneuver node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the first burn is completed, you\u0027ll have to hit the checkbox to clear that maneuver, otherwise your following \u0022NODE\u0022 command will still orient the ship towards the first node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERepeat as necessary for more successive burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022V\u0022 button beside each queued action seems to simply set the \u0022manual delay\u0022 we just used to whatever time is remaining until that command. It can be useful if you want to insert a command after another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Also, this page helped me understand: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://remotetechnologiesgroup.github.io/RemoteTech/guide/comp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://remotetechnologiesgroup.github.io/RemoteTech/guide/comp/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-10T04:27:14Z\u0022 title=\u002202/10/2015 04:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Samapico\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
