Personally its a good thing as needing lucridious amounts of wings just to take off was annoying and hurt the part count, now most vessels that are like 40t can get by with 2 deltas, and it just doenst take much (if any now that you can use body lift forces) to get something to SSTO. The only downside i see to it is that we nolonger have the ability to create appearance using wings, structural panels are too heavy and look like crap on a plane, and wings are bad due to the way the new drag works rendering additional wings to not only be dead weight, but acting as a airbrake for the whole flight.\n\nAnyways, about your plane, try to cut down on the amount of wings, they are the most likely culprit to your inability to fly well."},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T21:10:01Z","Content":"(Personal opinion here) I was (still am) so unimpressed with the 1.x aero, that I installed FAR for the first time, just so it would make more sense to me.

You are willing to sacrifice low speed performance, braking parachutes solves the landing issue, you can use JATO boosters to get up to speed on runway. \n\nAn more radical idea is to use an rocket powered truck instead of legs during takeoff. Two benefits, you can easy reach 500-700 km/h fast, your landing legs only have to support the empty plane. Truck use its own braking parachutes and is towed back and reused."},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T22:00:37Z","Content":"I have to say that bugs and exploits aside, the new drag is actually FAR better then what the game was back in the old days. That said, i do have a few complaints especially towards 1.0.2, a fix that in my opinion actually made the game a little less balanced and fun, regardless of which one was more realistic.\n\nPretty much more drag makes an even bigger impact upon SSTOs. Right now i find absolutely 0 benefits to use them for anything except for career (which i dont even play myself) where money matters and you want to have 100% recovery of the craft. For everything else a rocket can lift more, gets into orbit faster/easier, and with fairings, even whackjob unaerodynamic junk can be brute forced into orbit (you might need to tweak the .cfg of the fairings to allow larger diameters when say trying to lift a refinery thats as big in diamater as the VAB). SSTOs right now, legit ones at least, have not that great payload fractions, and in general cannot lift near anything liek rockets. As for atmospheric planes, it is tougher to overheat to explosion, but this drag increase has had a minor if any impact on slower lower altitude craft, so those are for all intents and purposes unchanged from 1.0. High speed high altituders have been nerfed, but hey, i never actually made such craft unless they were SSTOs. Also, one more note about drag, its so high that you now actually still loose massive amounts of speed even above 50km (1.0 you really needed to be below 45 to get any real drag), and the sea level drag is so high right now that i can DEORBIT a capital ship that was NEVER intended for this, and it will actually come down at ~50m/s, low enough that most of it will remain intact. If this is in any what way realistic, then i guess KSP is the new sci-fi simulator where capital ships will NOT burn up at all, and they also WILL NOT crash at a high enough velocity to matter in any way whatsoever. Lithobraking is the new thing, forget those useless parachutes ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) i can land massive frigates just like that!\n\nAnyways, drag aside, i really dislike the new heat in 1.0.2. In 1.0, heat was a threat to most things that werent shielded and didnt go into a shallow aerobrake. Perhaps 1.0\u0027s heat was a little overboard, but thats what the settings slider is for, and right now even at 120% the heat is a utter joke. The other reason heat is a minor issue now is that the extra atmo drag stacked atop what i believe are just lower heat coefficients makes you end up slowing down way faster and not even reaching speeds where heat becomes an issue. Finally, i think some of the capsules could use a minor nerf to heat tolerance, so that you cant have a completely unshielded mk1 pod with a single chute come in from the mun or minmus and not even fry a little bit.\n\nFinally, even if squad determines the new aero to be better, they didnt make any compensation to rocket engine ISP to help counter the 30% or so drag increase. With 1.0, and its very low dV of under 3000 to orbit, the ISP was in my opinion balanced, even if interplanetary vessels that didnt rely on nukes suffered from it. Now, you get those same ISP values with extra drag added ontop. I think they should uppo the ISP a hair to compensate, but thats just my 2c, its not like i havent adapted to 1.0.2, i just keep a 1.0 physics config aroyund when im screwing around and want to go 1500m/s at sea level with a rapier powered missile!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T22:04:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 10:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b**"},{"CreatedByName":"K3RBAL KOL4","CreatedById":140935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T23:42:57Z","Content":"New Aero is trash for rockets. worthless..
