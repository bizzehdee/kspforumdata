Plus, mention of that might sway people thrown off from the basic look of a stock game, into trying it anyway, and even shilling out the dough for it...

Overwhelmingly positive games tend to be actually good, while \u0022mixed\u0022 reviews indicate either some problems or a hit-or-miss game. For example i really like Shattered Planet or Risk of Rain but a lot of people find them too simplistic or otherwise lacking. Individual reviews are a good source of fun or depression, depending on what you\u0027re in the mood for.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T15:18:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 03:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DuoDex**\n  \nRemoved political discussions"},{"CreatedByName":"DuoDex","CreatedById":107061,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T15:17:05Z","Content":"Guys, there are already two other threads for this, please go there if you want to continue your discussion.\n\nThread locked."}]}
