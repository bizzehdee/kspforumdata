With even a moderate number of recolorable parts on the vessel, the whole vessel list quickly becomes challenging to navigate, or to even remember where you are when you\u0027re trying to recolor just one part.\n\u003E \n\nIndeed;  #1 really seems like a good idea, until you get to play with it.  Even with part-highlighting to show the part for the GUI entry, it still quickly becomes hard to use.\n\nSeems like #2 likely is what I\u0027ll be going with.  With the possibility of additional use of #3, as I think it might be the next best, and isn\u0027t mutually exclusive with #2.\n\nWill likely implement it as a very simple PartModule that can be added to the parts that has a single function -- adding an in-editor GUI button to open the recoloring window.  Using a separate part-module removes the need for duplicate GUI code in all of the recoloring-enabled modules, and ensures that there is only a single button per-part (rather than per-module; so a part with both recolorable model and a recoloralble fairing will still only show a single button on the part).  Not fond of adding yet-more-modules to the parts, but this seems like the simplest solution for adding a per-part GUI button.\n\nWill work on getting that bit implemented today so that the initial bit of testing can focus on the functioning of the recoloring system, rather than \u0027how to use the GUI\u0027."},{"CreatedByName":"DocRockwell","CreatedById":174979,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-02T20:38:36Z","Content":"Hi Shadowmage, I installed \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Kontainers and the SSTU Kontainer had a blank model.
