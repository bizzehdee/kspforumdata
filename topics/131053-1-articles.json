unmodded KSP:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, once you leave the \u0022physics bubble\u0022, you aircraft is deleted. \u00A0Your launch vehicle either becomes a spaceplane or becomes single-use. \u00A0Most kerbalnauts prefer to make their spaceplanes SSTO the payload as well. \u00A0Note that there is a great mod for this (which might not work with 1.0.5 or be updated):\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbal.curseforge.com/projects/fmrs-v1-0-01\u0022 rel=\u0022external

understand the issues with air-launches, you will likely need realism overhaul (and the mod listed above to reuse your airplane).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you don\u0027t want *any* mods, there is a quick and dirty way to get around this: \u00A0build a first stage with solid rocket boosters that will burn with lots of thrust and a short burn time. \u00A0You are looking for less than 500m/s of delta-v (less than 250 if you don\u0027t have drogues or otherwise want to make things easy on yourself). \u00A0The trick involves the much larger \u0022physics bubble\u0022 of 1.0.5 (or thereabouts) compared to earlier editions. \u00A0WARNING: I am still working on this idea. \u00A0Its more a side project that hit me when learning about the physics bubble change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNOTE: the following has NOTHING to do with air launch (aside from reusing the booster that eats most of the atmospheric drag), and has everything to do with not paying for the last (well first, but we build rockets back to front for a reason)\u00A0200-500m/s needed for orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStep 1: add a solid stage that will provide no more than ~500m/s of delta-v and will get there well before 10,000m.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStep 2: slow the thing down. \u00A0This could mean strapping flea rockets upside down to reverse thrust (and will be needed for extreme attempts at this). \u00A0Add drogue chutes. \u00A0These will slow down your booster and survive at 500m/s. \u00A0Note that if you use flea rockets you are likely going to require \u0022upside down\u0022 fins (but presumably the COM will be well above them. \u00A0Put fins on the first stage and make sure they are below the COM as well).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStep 3: make sure your chutes survive [UNTESTED]. \u00A0Set the \u0022partial deploy\u0022 altitude as low as possible. \u00A0You need the drogue to slow the thing down to 250m/s or the main chute will not survive. \u00A0You also need the chute to go fast enough toward the ground to get there before the main rocket goes over 22km. \u00A0This means more aggressive rockets have to stage well before 10km.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStep 4: Make sure all stages (decoupler, retrorockets, drogue, chute) fire at once (you lose control of it after you stage it). \u00A0If you are using landing gear, deploy that first (it probably won\u0027t make a difference if you deploy it on the pad).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that there are two options. \u00A0Pad landing and sea landing. \u00A0Pad landing is straight up and requires gear, but give 100% returns. \u00A0Sea landing allows a pitchover (gravity turn) and puts you on course for the next stage. \u00A0I\u0027d recommend the sea landing, especially if you are trying for higher speeds (which will have less control. \u00A0Note that horizontal distance counts, so don\u0027t lose your rocket because it is 10km up but 20km down stream...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, don\u0027t be afraid to make both stage-0 and stage-1 solid rockets. \u00A0They might not be the most efficient by mass, but they are often wildly more efficient by price (especially stage-1 which isn\u0027t coming back). \u00A0This doesn\u0027t impart enough delta-v to support the \u0022don\u0027t lift solid rockets into space\u0022 rules. \u00A0Liquid might work best, or solid might work best.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-30T22:31:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve done an aircraft launched satellite just

Though when I detached the useless jet parts, the shuttle wings broke off too, so I had to abort the mission.
