As an engineer working in the aerospace industry, it fills my heart with joy to see this. It also is an opportunity in my mind. Aerospace has been stuck in the weeds ever since we left the Moon in the early 70\u0027s. True, companies like SpaceX and Planetary Resources are pushing the state of the art forward, but aerospace still suffers from Cold War era thinking in that nobody shares information. The KSP community does not have this problem, you all share freely! I for one want to see much of the vehicles you design in KSP to actually be built and flown, and think the aerospace industry would benefit ENORMOUSLY from your passion and creativity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo on to my actual question to the community. Is anybody interested in making KSP realistic enough to make it useful as a design tool? From asking around on other forums, and reading other people\u0027s posts on this forum, I know KSP has made a lot of progress in making the aerodynamics and dynamics more realistic. Also from playing KSP, some heating effects are also included. But, I also know there is still work to do; I have a list of things that should be included and couldn\u0027t tell if they were to make KSP useful as a design tool. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I know some of you (the ones who work in the aerospace industry at large companies) have access to very accurate flight simulators (SDK and others) and wind-tunnels, and may be wondering why bother making KSP more realistic. Well my answer is this, those accurate flight simulators are not accessible to the mass public, KSP is. KSP is affordable, and already has a huge community of vehicle and mod developers, so if we choose to do so, KSP can become just as good the expensive flight simulators NASA or Boeing use. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d love to see what you all think about this. Let me know what you think.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-08T18:52:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s still limited by the Unity engine, but I\u0027d say you should check out the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54327-Realism-Overhaul\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERealism Overhaul\u003C/a\u003E thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-09T10:05:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you want missing planning and simulation, also check out \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36476\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E KSP Trajectory Optimization Tool\u003C/a\u003E which works with RO/RSS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-09T12:43:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, yes and yes.
