How would that work? the centrifugal force pushes you out, away from the circle\u0027s center. would it be oriented Vertically? that would mean the moon\u0027s gravity would compliment you as you went down but not as you went up, and everyone would be bouncing up and down like jackhammers. If it were horizontal, the moon\u0027s gravity would pull you down as the centrifuge pushed you sideways, and you\u0027d end up at like a 45 degree angle to the horizon. that\u0027s better, but then there\u0027s not much point in putting them on the moon\u0027s surface as apposed to in orbit.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, you\u0027d build the city on the interior of a paraboloid. Think of the shape the water surface makes in a spinning glass. The local gravity will vary depending on distance from the center of rotation, but it will always point directly towards the floor. If you build the whole thing large enough, Coriolis forces are going to be low, so you\u0027ll feel like you\u0027re walking around on a level surface, even though you are inside a giant paraboloid. You\u0027d probably build habitats near the 1G area, and keep various life support equipment closer to the center.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rickenbacker","CreatedById":2349,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-18T12:55:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is.

So that is the minimum mass for a black hole formed during a supernova. A black hole would be stable with a much lower mass, but yes, there is no mechanism known that would produce them. Some have suggested that black holes of all manner of sizes could have been produced during Big Bang, but we have no evidence of any sub-stellar black holes being around.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
