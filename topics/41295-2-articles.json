No conjectural space-warping engine required. In fact, it would take just 6 years for a ship accelerating to 7% of light speed, coasting for 80% of the time, and decelerating once within the system SOI, to travel 0.4LY. If the stars were even closer than that, say 0.1LY, the time would be reduced to under 2 years, all of which are perfectly reasonable timeframes for KSP to function within. It\u0027s only when we want stars to be ridiculous distances apart that we start to have real issues with interstellar travel.
