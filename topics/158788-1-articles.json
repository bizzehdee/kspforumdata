Maybe it\u0027s relevant for the new release so i think I best post it here (and who knows, maybe someone knows what happened).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n99% of what I have is \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E-ned. So I foolishly saw a new BDArmory\u00A0and installed it. Silly me for not checking first: it was a pre-release (bda) for the pre-release (ksp) so it was not intended to work with the current version. So obviously my game crashed. No big deal so far. I removed it with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, removed the old BDarmory with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, reinstalled current BDa\u00A0via \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E... later on I reistalled it manually from elsewhere (github)...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut no joy.\u00A0This is what happened.\u00A0The currently compatible BDa installed properly. I\u00A0know it did, since I have old previously saved craft with BDa parts and they loaded just fine. I can even fly them. But\u00A0the BDA tab (and corresponding parts)\u00A0disapeared from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E parts menu. And from every other tab in the menu. Basically its like I\u00A0have BDa, since \u00A0the parts placed in previously saved craft exist allright,\u00A0but I cannot access BDa\u0027s parts anymore for new craft. Also, althoug the craft did load, the BDa parts were kinda \u0027dead\u0027, meaning, I couldn\u0027t interact with them by clicking on them, or any other way.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWeird!
