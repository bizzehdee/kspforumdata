When I switch to docking mode, the game does in fact use the axis mappings I made for translation. However, it also superimposes these controls with regular flight, so my ship is rotating as i\u0027m trying to translate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#000000;font-size:14px;padding:0px;\u0022\u003E\nAnd no, this isn\u0027t imbalanced \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E. If I just use the keys (IJKLHN) dedicated for translation, there is no rotation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#000000;font-size:14px;padding:0px;\u0022\u003E\nIs there some setting I am missing here? I\u0027m in translation mode, but switching to/from rotation mode makes no difference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Radboy16","CreatedById":185528,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-03T20:18:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFigured it out. When mapping the Axes, you select which modes you want that axis to be used in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this case, Rotation as well as Translation axes all default to enabled in every single mode. I think this is quite a ridiculous default setting, as one would expect Translation to only work while in translation mode, Rotation only in staging or rotation, etc etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlyingPete","CreatedById":127384,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-04T10:58:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI get on better with a gamepad rather than a joystick. The two sticks can be used for all three rotation axes plus fore/aft translation, with the d-pad for the other two. I put pitch/yaw on the left stick as this works better for rockets and in space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d like to try using a flight yoke and pedals along with a separate stick for translation. Could take some skill to coordinate all six axes at once though!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
