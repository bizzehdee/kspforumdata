I understand the bandwith and logistics concerns, as I\u0027m sure the Spaceport will need some major bandwith (as Google Drive and Mediafire are probably also figuring out due to the current distribution models) and moderation which is likely currently beyond SQUADs capabilities. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy concerns on this matter are twofold, however:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I have very valid (and you are likely aware of them, as you read threads) reasons for my dislike of Curse, only some being the viruses and malware that was injected onto my PC by their Curse client\u0027s (the standalone GUI) advertisements. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. My other concern, however, is the complete lack of transparency and/or communication regarding this decision. It concerns me that no input at all (at least transparently) was sought from the community on this decision. Who, other than modders (whom from my understanding weren\u0027t sought for much input), will be using the service? Should we as the end-users have any say in where we are forced to go for an \u0022official\u0022 download? As you\u0027ve seen today in the community, the decision of whom to choose to distribute mods as the \u0022official\u0022 source is a fairly hot topic. I\u0027ve seen many mod creators and active forum users (as well as many forum lurkers like myself) rise to action today over this issue, many of us with VERY relevant concerns and complaints about Curse and with other alternatives to this choice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn closing, my initial reaction to the announcement of Curse was disappointment and anger, which I\u0027m sure will cool to just disappointment, then annoyance and finally acceptance...but I\u0027m not sure I\u0027ll ever go back to Curse, they\u0027ve (or issues caused by their product have) been too much hassle thus far for me. I\u0027m sorry for all the grief this (myself included) has caused you today. Go out and get a beverage or something tonight, or maybe just crash some rockets! I\u0027m sure this too will pass but Curse was \u0022officially\u0022 the worst choice of mod distribution channels in my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AbhChallenger","CreatedById":106911,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T21:05:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust want to say thanks to those who are involved in this effort.
