I noticed that after I installed the newest version of BahamutoD\u0027s Armory mod, the toolbar icon was crisp and sharp, even with ATM aggressive installed. So just for grins I took a look at the ATM MM file that came with it (I can\u0027t remember if it stays in the BDArmory folder or if it goes into the BoulderCo folder with most other ATM configs, sorry), and decided to copy the same settings to my MechJeb ATM config, and it worked!

I am using the 7-4 (not the basic, which I think means I have the aggressive version) release, and there isn\u0027t an error log to document to go with this.... I first noticed this glitch while working on installing RSS/RSO but I have tried this on my regular .25 game install as well (with the same parts turning up without their textures). While I do have a slew of other mods, these parts were fine until after I installed ATM-- I\u0027ve been using the 64bit version for my standard game and I haven\u0027t needed it until I tried firing up the 32bit side (part of my troubleshooting other issues with RSS/RO \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt any rate, I love the mod and I\u0027ve considered it a must have until I started messing with the 64bit game.
