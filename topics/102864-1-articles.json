Even without mods, all planets and stuff are rendered, regardless of where you are. The majority of the time, that render will be a pixel in size (or smaller, so you can\u0027t see it at all), but it\u0027s definitely possible that what you saw was Jool. Seeing where you were in regards to the Solar System would help prove that answer, though."},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T22:27:32Z","Content":"Could be either jool or one of the other bodies, ksp can be a bit weird concerning distant objects.
