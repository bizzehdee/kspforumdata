This isn\u0027t a bug. (Or at least I don\u0027t think it is.) You can put the complex over capacity while in the lower tiers with rescue contracts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(If I recall correctly I had a career save with 30 some odd Kerbals while my capacity was only 12, I wish I had a screenie of that. Oh, and I was still getting more and more rescue contracts. I think I was only doing them at that point because I had a reliable rocket set up and it was pretty easy for me to just hop up into LKO and grab those poor sods, and bring em back. A quick, repeatable paycheck for my career save.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sure a lot of people would complain if Squad patched this. Hiring Kerbs gets disgustingly expensive in the late game (when you have 10\u0026lt; Kerbals), especially when you need lots of kerbals to crew all your bases and stations, so rescue contracts are a nice way to get more, and sometimes add a bit of a challenge to that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntl;dr. No, and this won\u0027t cause any save corruption or lost kerbals or anything, so don\u0027t worry. You just won\u0027t be able to hire anyone, obviously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-21T02:58:57Z\u0022 title=\u002201/21/2016 02:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Kuansenhama\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grek","CreatedById":68831,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-21T03:39:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthanks a lot\u003Cimg alt=\u0022^_^\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_happy.png\u0022 title=\u0022^_^\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
