At a minimum, the ability to see an overview of the solar system WHILE editing maneuvers would help. Zooming in-and-out constantly to, say, change the location of the maneuver along an orbit is difficult and just plain bad UI compared to what is possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestion: a \u0022picture-inside-picture\u0022 view zoomed in on the encounter when one appears would help enormously with a minimum of changes, while eliminating the need to zoom in and out so much. This would be an interim fix, but a lot more could be done to improve the \u0022big picture\u0022 view of interplanetary travel.

Another possible answer (and feel free to forum-slap me if this is already a thing) would simply be to add keyboard controls for the maneuver nodes for opening them, sliding them along their orbit and adjusting their control handles.

Basically, there would be maneuver node like objects, I called them \u0022transfer nodes\u0022 that, instead of being placed on a ship\u0027s trajectory, would be placed on the trajectory of the body the ship was orbiting. If I was orbiting Kerbin, I would zoom out and click on Kerbal\u0027s orbit to place a transfer node. Just like a normal maneuver node, I would adjust the three elements of a potential maneuver while monitoring the dV requirement. I could slide the transfer node around Kerbin\u0027s orbit allowing to me discover transfer windows up to one revolution later (a whole year for Kerbin) or more if there\u0027s a \u0022next rev\u0022 button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108944-Transfer-Nodes\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108944-Transfer-Nodes\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis doesn\u0027t address the zoom problem or how unwieldy maneuver nodes can be.

The one thing the transfer node idea has going for it is the \u0022self discovery\u0022 aspect - the player can fiddle with the transfer nodes until he \u0022discovers\u0022 a transfer window or at least an inexpensive enough transfer. The transfer node idea has a few problems though, for example I\u0027m not sure if it is possible or how the dV cost of the transfer node would be related back to a ship; ultimately the player wants a maneuver specific to a ship and its current orbit, I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s possible to make that translation from transfer node to maneuver node in a useful way. Your coloration idea sidesteps this translation issue and sounds very intuitive for the player.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
