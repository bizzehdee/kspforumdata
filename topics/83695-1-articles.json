Exactly how much of each depends on how far away the astronaut grabs the station from the stations\u0027 center of mass and the distribution of mass of the station (inertia). If they tumble around like in the clip, things are much harder to calculate, but most likely a larger portion of the energy will go to the extra rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way all energy between them stays constant. So if you add up the rotational and kinetic energy of both parts, it will be the same as the sum afterwards - just split a bit differently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe more probable outcome of the clip is that the astronaut hits the station and is killed (has no real gauge of closing velocity), or tears their suit on some sharp.

So from his point of view the station is not moving and it\u0027s the horizon that\u0027s moving.
