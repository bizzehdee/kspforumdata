The reason I am asking, I could do it all the time in older versions of the game, like 0.14 and some later ones. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems like the fuel tanks now don\u0027t hold as much fuel as before. I think before they held 500 and now they hold 400. Did they do this to make the single crew capsule more of a orbiter space vehicle like the Mercury mission and the 3 crew space vehicle the main Mun type missions?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t remember the last version of the game I played 0.15 maybe, but it has been a while since I played.

The other problem is that the efficiency of the engines has been nerfed quite a bit to make them more realistic. The Isp (specific impulse, if you don\u0027t know what it means, search around the forums a bit. I believe there\u0027s a thread in the Science Labs dealing with it) of the engines used to be ~500s, but is now droped to ~390s in vacuum and it\u0027s lower in atmosphere. In short, your rockets need to be larger or use more efficient staging than they did prior to 0.17 to do the same thing. That said, there are far more tools to work with (including the nuclear engine with an Isp of 800s) to make the job easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I have landed on the Mun with the 1-man pod, it is very possible and is easier to get there than the 3-man pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Ninja\u0027d by sal_vager.

I only use the three seater to land on other bodies; one seaters are reserved for orbital passes. Things in general have been made a little harder on some parts of the game, but easier on others. Example, most engines have lower ISP since 0.16, but now we have the LV-N engine which has 800 ISP. All engines also have slightly better TWR on the whole as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I can guarantee that the return stage from Mun doesn\u0027t need to be too large. If you have the correct exit trajectory, a single seat pod with parachute, decoupler, landing legs, LV-909, and FL-200 can get to Kerbin with fuel to spare on half a tank. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-17T23:19:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell once career mode is in it makes sense that the first capsule you get access to is the 1 man capsule.
