It can carry 4 Kerbals, and I\u0027ve done a successful re-entry using it with a Mk1-2 capsule, but it is a bit minimal. Out-of-the-box the \u0022crew tube\u0022 has no electric charge or RCS propellant, which tends to overload the Mk1-2. I may make myself a tweaked version with some battery capacity, at least. The 3\u002B4 combination with a battery, would make a good vehicle for supporting a space station.\n\nThe test flights used a 3.75m \u0022pancake\u0022 tank of Monopropellant with four of your \u0022Dibamus\u0022 OMS/RCS modules, giving plenty of delta-V for a rendezvous. I decoupled this before the re-entry. \n\nSome sort of fuel tank/adaptor with a full-size node at the top and four smaller engine mounts part-way down the tank side, radially-recessed into the tank, would reduce the vertical protrusion of the engine and give rim-space for landing legs. Might it have a central attachment node on the base? Could that be a way of carrying a Rover? Think of something akin to a folded version of that engine unit in your pics of the big landing-legs demo. 5m top, 4 x 1.25m bottom, could be a useful lander descent stage. An LV-T45 \u0022Swivel\u0022 is about 12 times the vacuum thrust of a 24-77 \u0022Twitch\u0022 radial mount engine\n\nThat could imply some sort of heat shield that would be notched to allow the rockets to fire.\n\nA small retro-rocket pack that was visually a .625m pack (Mercury-style) which triggered a 1.25m fairing from the decoupler would look good."},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T22:25:21Z","Content":"So the legs are looking really good now.

I could always try again, but of course it makes them look even bigger, since any slope has to start at the top of the existing box (there\u0027s very little clearance inside for the pistons, so it can\u0027t go shorter, unless I get more cheaty and compress the piston as part of the animation). \n\nMy fear is that even with a sloped top, the drag would probably still be significant. We may be looking at brute-forcing those guys in any case. \n\nPart of why I permitted myself a very blocky design on those, is that I was thinking along the lines of the gigantic stock rover wheels that look impractical but beefy. Not elegant, just big. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Maybe huge ore drills and tanks to go with your new parts?\n\nMaybe. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Drills might be a pain, in terms of animation, but we\u0027ll see. Right now I\u0027m starting out by adding parts that will make it easier to use the large stock parts. I noticed that the largest aircraft landing gear are too tall for stock ladders, and people are using them to get around the mainsails for Eve landers, since the stock landing legs aren\u0027t big enough.

I had to rotate them around a bit, but I attached them to the underside of the 5m tank (around a 3.75m Rhino engine). It does let you tuck them in a little more. Drag-wise, I\u0027m not sure what the stock aero will do.
