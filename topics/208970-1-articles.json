I loaded it up with all the science that makes sense for vacuum. I added ample battery and solar panels. I have 4 kerbals, 2 scientists in the lab and a pilot and and engineer above them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI sent a scientist outside to get a surface sample and bring him back in. I review the data and tell the lab to process the sample. I hit start researching button. Batteries are full. I time warp. It shows all 0\u0027s in the lab, therefore nothing is being processed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI quit the game, restarted the game and landed again. I ran only the materials processing bay to get some science data for the lab, and when I reviewed that data and told the lab to process it, it reported the lab was already full of data!!! I had just arrived! I use the orbital cheat to get to Tylo while developing the vehicle, so there was no data taken in-flight, or anywhere else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBottom line is that the Mobile Processing Lab is full of data at the start of the mission, yet it reports 0 data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is totally broken.
