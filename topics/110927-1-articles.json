It\u0027s a quick build and not detailed replica. But what I really want to show you is potential of launch escape unit as an ammunition.\n\nWhen people make cannon for something like tank, seperatron is a typical choice for stock part ammunition. Problem is, seperatron is more like a rocket than cannon ammunition shell.\n\nSeperatrons continue their acceleration until they flew about 500m distance, and at early stage they are not fast enough to punch something hard.\n\nBut in case of LEU, They use their fuel in a second and their velocity at eary stage is faster than any other rockets in KSP. Only problem is torque that LEU makes. Thus, two of them can be coupled and clipped together to compensate torque.\n\nAs shown in following video, ammunitions have enough punch to destroy small objects in space center. So, for close targets (\u003C200 meters) these ammunitions are really useful.\n\nAnd you can enjoy big explosions of empty fuel tanks, you know...\n\n[\u003Ccraft download=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003C/craft\u003E](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4j1ic6wsdh4nk54/Ontos.craft?dl=0)\n\nOh, I almost forgot... Hitting G to lower landing struts will engage artillerty mode.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/d8m792nJwvU?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-26T18:56:27Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2015 06:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by stardog573**"}]}
