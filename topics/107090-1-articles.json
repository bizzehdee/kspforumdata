If not, would anyone be willing to create one (if its even possible)? It\u0027s never really bothered me over the years, but when you land a capsule in water and go into IVA, and when the window falls underwater, the ocean texture disappears. I\u0027ve never thought it would be possible to add some kind of underwater texture on the windows, but who knows what can be done with the mods available today. \n\n[Note: It doesn\u0027t matter if it\u0027s compatible with 1.0.2 or not, I would just like to know if one exists somewhere]\n\nThanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T11:26:56Z","Content":"It\u0027s a good idea, oceans are really quite underdeveloped."},{"CreatedByName":"Helix935","CreatedById":71312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T17:24:25Z","Content":"well there is a submarine mod from hooligan labs but i think it\u0027s dead\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/53961-0-22-Hooligan-Labs-%28now-under-new-managment%29-Featuring-Airships-Subs-and-more](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/53961-0-22-Hooligan-Labs-%28now-under-new-managment%29-Featuring-Airships-Subs-and-more)"},{"CreatedByName":"Solarspaceprobe","CreatedById":125110,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T21:58:19Z","Content":"I think there was a procedural airships mod with a submarine add-on."},{"CreatedByName":"Inqie","CreatedById":142191,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T05:13:45Z","Content":"I saw a comment somewhere that suggested that the Boat Parts mod by InfiniteDice produced a dark blue window tint when underwater, but I can\u0027t seem to find any reference of it on the forum page. If it does have this ability, I wonder if it can be easily made into a standalone mod? \n\nThis is not a request for a submarine mod persay, but a mod which changes the underwater view for all pods.
