Players currently have insufficient information about how much drag and lift their planes are creating, and this was made worse by the removal of the F12 Aero gui window in the most recent patch. More than just aiding advanced players, restoring the Aero GUI shortcut and a debug option to show some aerodynamic debug information in the part manager would also enable players to help zero in on aerodynamics issues caused by specific parts, combinations of parts, fairings and cargo bays as well as any overall aerodynamics bugs remaining after the issue you highlighted in your dev diary is fixed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
