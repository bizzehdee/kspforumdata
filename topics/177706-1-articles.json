This is because when game developers make 3D models, they optimize their meshes by deleting hidden faces that players are never expected to see, resulting in models with lots of unclosed meshes and other physically-impossible geometry. When you import these models directly into typical 3D printing slicer software, you end up with lots of geometry errors that would either make the model impossible to print, or come out looking funny.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs tempting as it is for someone to yell out \u0022then fix all the models so that they can be 3D printed!\u0022, this means telling SQUAD / TakeTwo devs (as well as every single part mod dev) to spend significant amounts of time reworking all their parts, potentially impacting in-game performance just to satisfy a small subset of the community\u0027s desire for 3D prints of their ships. In fact, Eucl3d ended their collaboration with Kerbal Space Program and went out of business because they couldn\u0027t justify the cost of reprocessing all the game models for 3D printing into something that was actually affordable for most users.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nASIDE: There\u0027s one fairly successful and cost-effective example of 3D printing personalized game models, and that is the collaboration between GamePrint and Cryptic Studios for player starship models from \u003Cem\u003EStar Trek Online\u003C/em\u003E. In this case, they worked closely with CBS (who owns the \u003Cem\u003EStar Trek\u003C/em\u003E IP) and limited the number of ships and customization option available to customers/players, and so didn\u0027t have to do as much model fixing/optimizing for printing. In contrast, the near-unlimited permutation of part combinations in a typical KSP craft makes this much less technically and financially feasible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-22T01:21:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223437467\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022177706\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221534832738\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022160994\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022qzgy\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n18 hours ago, qzgy said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was support I think not from shapeways, but from a company called Eucl3d or so.
