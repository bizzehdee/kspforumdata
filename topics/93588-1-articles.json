My shuttles are quite lean as far as cost goes, but comparing my 1.5m boosters and 2.5m boosters (which cost 11k and 55k respectively), the shuttles start to lose benefit. The shuttles may cost more, but they allow me to bring kerbals along, as well as boost into multiple orbits. This adds flexibility ans the ability to have multiple missions per launch, reducing the cost of the shuttle systems. There are ways to make a shuttle work, but if you are simply launching light payloads into space, they are NOT the way to go.
