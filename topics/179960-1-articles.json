it pretty much just slams itself into the atmosphere in order to dump momentum and adjust afterwards to circularize / rendezvous with the station again.\u00A0 There\u0027s also a spaceplane to get the Kerbals into orbit in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt struck me that maybe I\u0027m not really saving any fuel by doing this, since I need to accelerate back out of the atmosphere at the end -

yes, aerobraking is absolutely a worthwhile way to lower your orbit.\u00A0 \u00A0It will always take a little bit of fuel to to raise your periapsis back out of the atmosphere, but this is usually much, much smaller than the amount it would take to lower your orbit without aerobraking.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I\u0027m a bit confused about the \u0022accelerate out of the atmosphere\u0022 part.\u00A0 You should NOT need to burn engines while in the atmosphere -- that kinda defeats the purpose of aerobraking, which is to bleed off speed.\u00A0 You will need to do that final burn to finish into the target orbit, but that burn always happens in space.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps the issue\u00A0is that you\u0027re dipping too low in the atmosphere, which is bleeding off more speed than you want, which is making you burn to compensate.\u00A0That 10m heat shield generates orders of magnitude more drag than smaller parts.\u00A0I would suggest trying the aerobrake up higher in the atmosphere, and seeing where that gets you.\u00A0 There\u0027s also nothing wrong with doing the brake over a couple orbits (and that\u0027s sometimes necessary to avoid burning up).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tibrogargan","CreatedById":91949,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-21T03:31:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223491084\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022179960\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221542770491\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022165625\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aegolius13\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 minutes ago, Aegolius13 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I\u0027m a bit confused about the \u0022accelerate out of the atmosphere\u0022 part.\u00A0 You should NOT need to burn engines while in the atmosphere -- that kinda defeats the purpose of aerobraking, which is to bleed off speed.\u00A0 You will need to do that final burn to finish into the target orbit, but that burn always happens in space.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry for the confusion, I was paraphrasing.\u00A0 At some point in time a burn needs to happen to get the periapsis back out of the atmosphere, hence \u0022accelerate out of the atmosphere\u0022 -
