That will reduce the \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV required to a hundred at most - if you\u0027re allready in Duna\u0027s SOI, though, you might not be able to change your orbit in time without using even more than 1500 m/s of \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-28T19:16:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo a radial burn as close to immediately after you enter Duna\u0027s SOI as possible, with the aim of getting the Duna periapsis to 12.5-13 kilometers. I did that with the Storax Anacostia mission; it took about 700 m/s for the burn and the aerobrake did the rest. Don\u0027t go too low or you\u0027ll head for lithobrake - Duna\u0027s aerobrake altitude window is very narrow (11k and you\u0027re going in, 15k is not enough).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spyritdragon","CreatedById":70515,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-28T21:02:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs everyone here said, try a 13km aerobrake :-).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuicksave beforehand though.
