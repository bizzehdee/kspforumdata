I did that last night testing a lander on Moho. Didn\u0027t fill up a pair of 16K unit tanks twice. Kethane goes on a per-deposit amount, you can drain all contiguous hexes in a deposit from one hex.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dakota2063","CreatedById":127687,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-07T06:26:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022taniwha\u0022 data-cite=\u0022taniwha\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENo, even the Kethane resource itself was not hardcoded (as of around the time of 0.21, at least).
