According to a thing i googled on rockets, this should make the rocket far more stable. It said add extra weights, but i couldn\u0027t think of how to do that, so I did what i\u0027m showing you now. Please ignore the delta V of the rocket, i just wanted to test it out, and see how it flies. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like feedback on this kind of design and would appreciate people trying ot build something similar, maybe you can find an easier way to design this. Also designing a rocket with this in mind, does it make it easier for you to fly?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI apolgise for this being in genreal discussion, but this is not meant to be a spacecraft showcase, but a design idea, which i think may lead to helping people with new aerodynamics.

Asparagus staging generally requires radial attachment, and if you want to retain control, these tanks need to be high up on the rocket, like moonfrog posted pictures of. Even more generally than asparagus staging, I have problems with every type of radial decoupling but bi-radial decoupling, as the stage collides with the rocket when it detaches.
