According to a thing i googled on rockets, this should make the rocket far more stable. It said add extra weights, but i couldn\u0027t think of how to do that, so I did what i\u0027m showing you now. Please ignore the delta V of the rocket, i just wanted to test it out, and see how it flies. \n\nI would like feedback on this kind of design and would appreciate people trying ot build something similar, maybe you can find an easier way to design this. Also designing a rocket with this in mind, does it make it easier for you to fly?\n\nI apolgise for this being in genreal discussion, but this is not meant to be a spacecraft showcase, but a design idea, which i think may lead to helping people with new aerodynamics. Feedback appreciated."},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T18:45:03Z","Content":"This would actually be extremely unstable due to the CoM being way too high in the rocket.

You want the center of mass to always be in front of the center of drag. So this will probably fly OK in that regard.\n\nNow, without the fins, that might be a different story. You can\u0027t rely on thrust alone to keep you stable if all you\u0027re doing is placing it ahead of the CoM.

Makes the fins far more powerful than the drag forces effecting the nose cone. Its very stable. guide i got was for building rockets, granted small bottle rockets, but, i\u0027m sure the principles are the same. Idea is just too have a high centre of mass. was able to make designs go past 300m/s without spinning out of control, at low altitudes."},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T22:39:29Z","Content":"Wasn\u0027t Von Braun thinking about something like this but with liquid fuel rockets instead?"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T23:26:16Z","Content":"This is how I would build it:\n\n![vpQvRNo.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/vpQvRNo.jpg)\n\nThe small central stage has enough command pod torque to go wherever it wants to go. It can even spin itself out an regain control instantly. The delta winglets are great for the boosters because they add a lot of stability and just a little control, which is great for small-medium rocket applications."},{"CreatedByName":"Moonfrog","CreatedById":76295,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T08:52:20Z","Content":"interesting, guess the centre of mass on yours would be dead centre.

Asparagus staging generally requires radial attachment, and if you want to retain control, these tanks need to be high up on the rocket, like moonfrog posted pictures of. Even more generally than asparagus staging, I have problems with every type of radial decoupling but bi-radial decoupling, as the stage collides with the rocket when it detaches. It\u0027s just above the rocket, and falls into it. One of the stages is inevitably on top of the rocket, and gets pulled into the rocket by gravity. \n\nFancy piloting and staging (spinning and decoupling the radial attachments on top of and below the rocket when they\u0027re sidways, then spinning back), or building a rocket as wide as the Atlantic Ocean solves the problem (causes lots of drag), but I was wondering if anyone could come up with an elegant solution.\n\nCheers"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T04:53:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I was doing some experimentation with high CoM rockets, and was looking for some advice.
