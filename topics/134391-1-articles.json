There would also be cases where objects on the other side of the sphere would be visible in opposite directions.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAccordingly, cosmologists have searched for galaxies that are visible on opposite sides of the sky, or for motion patterns that suggest galaxies on opposite ends of the sky are interacting with each other, gravitationally or otherwise. Alas, so far no such phenomena have been found.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe flatlanders could also, with sensitive equipment, draw very long, straight, parallel lines and note that the distances between them decreased gradually, such that an infinitely long pair of lines should eventually converge. Models and tests show that this can happen in our universe with straight beams of light in the vicinity of massive objects, creating effects such as Einstein rings. Cosmologists have been looking for evidence that this occurs on the grand scale as well, but also to no avail - within the limits of our measurements, the fabric of spacetime appears perfectly flat with only miniscule possible deviation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese separate observations indicate that the universe is not a closed 4D surface, or if it is, it must be much, much bigger than the visible universe - as in several orders of magnitude, the way the Earth was to ancient Mesopotamians who only knew of the Tigris-Euphrates basin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-18T02:27:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, I think it\u0027s accurate to say our universe is the surface of a 4-dimensional...thing.

If you look at the feyman lectures, he basically combines all three dimensions of space into 1, a reference point at which c flows out. It produces 2 dimensional plots. Read K2s post. The critical problem is gravity quantum/gravity distinction, I keep making the point that gravity is a faux force, its actually space-times effect on intertia.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo lets go through the problem in laymans eyes. To start let me just premise the argument with a piece of dogma that resolution relies on multiple perspectives. Our perspective is on a particular comoving space-time that has a visibility (composite of many time components of space-time) of less than 10% of the comoving units of the universe. The boundaries of the visible unit our defined by the CMBR radiation which is Doppler shift tells us was about 13.8 billion years ago, it is uniform in all directions (pretty much) and denotes that our current largely (ignoring dark energy) expanding universe. Its\u0027 uniformity defines an inflationary state and this is the singular visible (inferred) perspective on that state.\u00A0 Because we cannot see an edge to the universe in any direction, and because of the dating there is a secondary inference that comoving spatial frames (the relative average position and velocity vectors of averageing of four reasonably close galaxies in which there spatial positions are roughly tetrahedral) can be moving away from each other faster than the speed of light (c), and the best way of explaining this superluminal relative motion is via inflation (again excluding dark energies effect).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow for some perspective, lets take a black hole, black holes communicate information via the Hawking radiation, and external energy communicates with it via absorbtion on its surface. It behaves as a singularity but we see a frequency (hv) being released. It sees incoming energy (again objects inside may still have structure, we simply cannot see the structure, we see the properties of the singularity). Note that gravity acts through the ability for energy to warp space-time. Mass energy equivilance allows this, so we can denote the energy of a black-hole by its gravitational attractions and via the radiation it releases. Us and black hole have two very different perspectives of each other, its as if the black hole lives in its own dimensions, but its simply a distortion of our dimensions by immense amount of energy. The energy is acting through something called gravitons which we have the poorest understanding of. So now lets look at something perilously bigger.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImagine our universe\u0027s expansion\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. convert all mass to energy (its still maintains its gravitational attractions)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. confine all the energy to one geometric point with no dimensions\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Without dimension there is no space, and without space gravity become unitary, its \u003Cstrong\u003Equantum gravity\u003C/strong\u003E - ta-da the only force in the universe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. since there is no space - ta-da- \u003Cstrong\u003Eenergy density\u003C/strong\u003E is infinite.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat was easy, right [cough]. Well not exactly, because the universe as a singularity it may move around in other dimensions, for example virtual particles can move around in space and time and speeds greater than c, you can have all kinds of bizarre behaviors at the quantum scale. So what about our universe? Yeah, well we don\u0027t actually know. Then only thing is that its contents remain unidimensional, as a consequence the universe is timeless and spaceless in its origin from looking into the CMBR \u003Cem\u003Ecrystal-ball\u003C/em\u003E. This has consequences.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk so what happens next, well, errr, not so easy, layman computer malfuntion. S__t happens . . . . . . .inflation which really should be called hyperinflation because:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Space expands to faster than the speed of light in all directions (inferred above). Surprisingly the c-violation is not much of a problem, since quantum particles and disappear and reappear at places faster than c. As one quantum resolves into many, a probabilistic outcome is to spread energy according with the probability of where these sprites should be. Not too much of a problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. There is no mass to confine anything (there is energy of the most exotic form), there cannot be mass because there is no space-time, mass relies on inertia and inertia has space-time as a premise. (i.e gravity is the warping of space-time). But an issue here is if there is no rest mass for the universe and quantum resolve into quanta how then is energy divided up, and the answer may be in phases.\u00A0 There is actually a context here, since I can envision inflation as the end of this quantum/quanta resolution process, then the wave/particle nature of the energy exists pretty much as wave(s) until resolution thus can be divided evenly. \u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is where there is a problem, space and time supposedly don\u0027t exist, so how can the singularity be flirting about in either. One possibility is extra-universal dimensions. Remember the black hole analogy, the black holes dimensions are a warped representation of ours from our perspective and vice versa. We cannot see the extra universal stuff (except maybe dark energy pouring in) and they cannot see whats going on in our universe (except our total energy - the faux pas here is what is the gravitational interaction - and hv- relies on space-time), it might need extra dimensions to inflate.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. The inflation stops and space-time [poof] exists. We havent a clue as to what gravitational constant was, I surmise that very shortly afterward that constant began equilibrating into something like our current constant. One of the reasons we don\u0027t know is that quantum gravity is still is the most dominant force in the universe. There are some who argue that warping of space time is a direct consequence to the resolution of the quantum universe, thats its a reflection of the process. This is important because did energy resolve uniformly across all comoving space, or did energy pour into the inflation and afterwards as some have suggested? If either are the case then we can pretty much infer that the gravitational constant was not. If energy was pouring into the universe, then where was it pouring from? if energy poured from a central point what retained it? If super-universal dimensions are the origin of 3D space then during inflation you could have something like hybrid dimensions of space to finally what we see. The alternative is that there are a set of dimensions that resolve at the quantum scale.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut if the layman asks the question of evidence, he would be pointed at a fairly uniform CMBR and told inflation has occurred, and thats is a very messy circular argument.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is needed here is a better understand of quantum gravity, what produces it, how does it warp space-time, etc. However the exotic birth of our universe is clothed in the CMBR, and from that point onward there is flat euclidian geometry of comoving space is all directions to the CMBR, there is no \u0027fish-tailing\u0027 of the universe as it might be expected with a 4th spacial dimension. So that if other dimensions exist they are acting on scales much much greater than the CMBR boundary. This can be happening, as I pointed out above our visible universe is a small fraction of the total universe, we cannot see the point of inflations center (either in time or space) nor the edge, if it exists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-19T00:03:45Z\u0022 title=\u002203/19/2016 12:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-19T02:09:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222462663\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022134391\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221458309986\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107380\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 hours ago, PB666 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI keep making the point that gravity is a faux force, its actually space-times effect on intertia.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFunnily enough, the central argument of Holographic Principle is that, \u0022So is every other kind of force.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
