And while my english-skills are servicable for the most part I don\u0027t usually discuss rocketry and orbital physics... so forgive me if I don\u0027t use the correct vocabulary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow... to the matter at hand. I have been playing KSP for quite a while now and I like it a lot!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yesterday I had nothing to do so I said to myself \u0022Let\u0027s try modding the game!\u0022....

Looked at the video... and well it didn\u0027t work... One problem may be that the video is two months old (a LOT can happen in two moths) and also there is one point in the video where he installs pacthes and says \u0022You will have to gather these from the threads\u0022 being kinda new I have no idea which ones \u0022the threads\u0022 are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most obvious problem is that the TAC-Lifesupport mod won\u0027t work. It adds new parts and I can see new ressources (Oxygen, Water, Food) but these do not deplete and there is no fancy Lifesupport Monitoring-Thingy. It even won\u0027t work after I re-downloaded the game and installed it on it\u0027s own... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I got most (or all) the new parts from the mods but I think something went wrong there too since no matter how many antennae I stick on a ship it will say \u0022No comms device on this vessel\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI woudl like to get a more realistic game experience with some additional features like mining...

Usually all it involves is copying the mod to the GameData folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, for the interstellar mod, its highly recommended you start a new career that way you can use their techtree. Otherwise you\u0027ll have some problems. When you first start the career, you\u0027ll be presented with a window and a dropdown. Choose interstellar and you\u0027re good to go! You will need an internet connection to choose the techtree, but afterwards you can play without a connection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this helps you out a bit\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-13T17:52:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor your No comms did you install RT2 ? or was it a Sat you didn\u0027t use a probe core on ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bertibott","CreatedById":112866,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-15T05:38:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got it working now...
