It hits the basic idea of rookie on her own and Clooney helping then sacrificing. If you REQUIRE a basic EVA pack get 2 people about 50x farther (in terms of dV) than a single person could on his own then no. I can\u0027t write that movie in 5 minutes or 50 years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lajoswinkler\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lajoswinkler\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t understand the jaded hatred towards this movie.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t either. I really really liked it, and if they do a re-release in my local IMAX I\u0027ll be sure to catch it this time (I waited until it was on DVD). It just happens to take place in a setting I\u0027m EXTREMELY familiar with and it DOES get parts of it wrong. It\u0027s no different than if they made a movie about someone trapped on Mt Everest and had them running from Yeti in a light jacket*. It may be a really good movie and maybe they got all the not-running-from-a-yeti-while-wearing-a-light-jacket stuff spot on. But the people who know how to climb mountains are going to have trouble swallowing that part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*What he was doing in that light jacket, I\u0027ll never know.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
