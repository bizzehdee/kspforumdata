However, when ever I put the decouple and parachutes in the same staging the parachutes deploy and it falls like it should but it doesn\u0027t slow down at all even though I can see the parachutes have deployed fully. I have also tried putting the decouple first and then switching to the object but I can\u0027t switch while in the atmosphere. If anyone has an idea of how to get the cargo to not explode please tell me ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) \\*edit\\* nevermind, I think the new patch fixed it\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T09:26:21Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 09:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by 79robb**"}]}
