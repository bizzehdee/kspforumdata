Turns out someone was having the same issue I was having about a week ago and they had it figured out. I got it working. Of course, I lost control of my shuttle during reentry and it splashed down hard, killing all on board. Then I went and accidentally terminated my space station component I just worked 4 hours to get into orbil, again, killing all on board. It was a bad day.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
