If so, you\u0027re\u00A0asking in the wrong place. You should ask in the mods section of the forum. Also, you can ask all you want, but don\u0027t get your hopes up that someone will come along to make a mod for you. That being said, you should consider making the mod you want; while\u00A0it\u0027s unlikely that someone will just make the thing you\u0027re asking for, the community is pretty good when it comes to helping people to make mods. Lastly, the mod you propose sounds like you just want to magic away the physics that the game is simulating. That\u0027s certainly an option, and it\u0027s the easiest way to see the results you want on the vessel(s) you have in mind, but it will likely result in very unrealistic and unexpected vessel behavior if that part is used in any way other than the one way you\u0027ve designed it since it\u0027s defeating the actual physics the game is simulating. Also, forcing a vehicle to follow the terrain at a fixed height would likely just make that vehicle look like it is riding on the ground on tall, invisible wheels. Abrupt\u00A0changes in the slope of the terrain would cause the vehicle to adjust height in a very unnatural way for a flying vehicle,\u00A0and since all\u00A0terrain in KSP is made with hard angles the only place you could use your mod without it looking and acting very strange would be over water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry if it seems like I\u0027m being a total bummer. I\u0027m not trying to just shut you down. WIG effects are very interesting, but simulating the effect\u00A0is a bit more complicated than you describe\u00A0if you want vessels to continue to work as expected. I think it can be done in an effective and functional way, but simulating WIG effect has such limited use\u00A0in KSP that I\u0027m not surprised that no one has done it yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-29T20:44:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t listen to them, do it anyway.

They\u00A0have a 60 m/s crash tolerance, and none of the stock nose cones are that good anymore. Also the PEW PEW PEW factor is cool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat Galane said regarding the wings. Although I did it mostly for aesthetic and part limitation reasons. I also figure we\u0027re ramming a fair amount of air into that constrained box. Unfortunately blown wings don\u0027t work in post-1.0 aero. I fake it by having flaps on each wing segment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223231346\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022168003\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221512009351\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002277949\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Galane\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n21 hours ago, Galane said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA WIG that only operates from water needs to be maneuverable when landed. Thus their wing aspect ratio tends to be wide and short, just long enough to make 1/2 the wingspan an acceptable altitude for the plane.
