The vector is at a pitch of zero. You don\u0027t need ridiculous TWR to increase PE when there is no drag to overcome, all you have to overcome is the moment of inertia which requires a TWR greater than zero. The higher the TWR is, the shorter the burn, which in this situation is an advantage because you\u0027ll just end up burning back into the atmosphere otherwise.

Not an impossible task (it might be for MechJeb), but pretty intense - it\u0027s like manually balancing power to each wheel in a 4WD while driving offroad through a minefield during a blizzard.
