She was my 4th grade teacher, Miss Helen George, and quite honestly, the last of the really old school \u0022battle-axes\u0022... although I mean that as a compliment. She was the toughest, but also fairest... and when it came to writing... wow!\u00A0 When we wrote compositions, we had to first submit the draft! Seriously, 4th grade and we\u0027re doing 1st drafts... and most often she would shred them!!! Not literally, but she would go over them like a\u00A0professional editor... and she pulled no punches. And 9 times out of 10 you\u0027d have to re-write the whole thing. But I learned fairly quick if you swallowed your pride, and listened to what she said, you\u0027d eventually end up with a really professional piece of writing!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe was as tough as any drill sergeant I knew, but in the end I loved her for it!!!\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-22T16:10:47Z\u0022 title=\u002212/22/2017 04:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 22, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Just Jim\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeltaDizzy","CreatedById":150755,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-22T20:52:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy only joystick is a Microsoft Sidewinder Precision Pro.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002251J3M07MWNL.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022500\u0022 src=\u0022https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51J3M07MWNL.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022489\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-25T01:30:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223250562\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022156614\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221513975958\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022150755\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DeltaDizzy\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 12/22/2017 at 6:52 PM, DeltaDizzy said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy only joystick is a Microsoft Sidewinder Precision Pro.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51J3M07MWNL.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u002251J3M07MWNL.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 height=\u0022500\u0022 src=\u0022https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51J3M07MWNL.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022489\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy joystick is a mouse and keyboard.

Exams are active on the on-line portal one week before their due date, satisfying the requirement for students needing additional time (federal rulings have already said that on-line courses which have exams and give students access to the exams of at least 5 days are in compliance. So I now do this for every class I teach; and no, it doesn\u0027t change student outcomes at all. Some students are determined to fail college classes). I even sent her a PDF of the federal guidelines which our university uses to assure compliance. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI informed her that she is taking a world civilization course and if she is that emotionally sensitive, she might want to take Art History and Appreciation instead. I then told her that throughout the course we will be discussing a lot of religion, politics, sex, race and ethnicity, war, violence, pestilence, famine, and death. I then said that history doesn\u0027t care if we like the facts or not. It is what happened, when it happened, and the impact it had we are concerned about. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nMy department chair emailed me back and told me it was the funniest exchange she\u0027s read in a while - and that my answers to the student\u0027s concerns were exactly what needed to be said... \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d have failed her butt already, on principal alone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adsii1970","CreatedById":89014,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-02T15:55:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223258113\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022156614\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221514908199\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022111598\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LordFerret\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 minutes ago, LordFerret said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d have failed her butt already, on principal alone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m actually hoping she will go ahead and withdraw from the course.
