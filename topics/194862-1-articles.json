The decals can be different from each other\u00A0 allowing the decals to be used for adding details to a ship itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo here is my request for a Decal Texture Pack that contains - Windows, doors, greebling textures, all sorts of flags, solid color wheels, pipes and other things that one would find on a space craft. I personally cannot texture something to fit with KSP\u0027s artstyle, hence\u00A0my request for this mod given to anyone up for the challenge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for reading this, and leave your suggestions for such a mod in the comments below.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
