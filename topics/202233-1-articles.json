I have a couple good Minmus/Mun vessels with a capacity of 7, so I can take 7 At a time to get xp from then. Whenever I land on Minmus, I always escape Kerbin space to get the orbit the Sun xp before returning. My Gilly and Duna ships only holds 3 Kerbals, so I either have to design and\u00A0build bigger ships to send maybe 7 at a time to get the xp, or send lots of separate missions. \u00A0Duna and Gilly missions can take game years. And my\u00A0design skills aren\u2019t great and bigger means less delta-v or bigger rockets, which tends to be more difficult to fly.\u00A0Also me doing a Gilly or Duna run probably takes an hour or two as I am not perfect at this game yet lol.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know some people use SSTOs for lots of Kerbals but I suck at landing lol.
