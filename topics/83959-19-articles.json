But it\u0027s not specifically related to LET bay since I already had this problem with a standard 2.5m bay, the bay butchering the fuel tank I attached to it vertically when I openned it... A little problem when those fuel tanks are powering the engines used to land... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sealed:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the standard overheat issue...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i62.tinypic.com/soa2bt.png\u0022 alt=\u0022soa2bt.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i60.tinypic.com/r2rj1g.png\u0022 alt=\u0022r2rj1g.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI noticed that dynamic warp tends to make this bug more common.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if I just have necrobones stuff showed in buggy situations, it\u0027s because I almost only use his creations \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"snekposter","CreatedById":139710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-28T17:42:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eany new parts in the pipeline, or are you focusing on spacey?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-28T19:51:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022snekposter\u0022 data-cite=\u0022snekposter\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eany new parts in the pipeline, or are you focusing on spacey?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENothing new coming right now, in the way of parts, but that doesn\u0027t mean there won\u0027t be.

I was about to give up after many tries finishing in kaboom experience.
