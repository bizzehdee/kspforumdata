SQUAD has said that they will add a sort of thing like automatically doing maeuvers, as you said, but they will have a given chance of failure. This, I would be completely fine with in career mode, so long as the success rate wasn\u0027t 100% all the time. Mechjeb does everything exactly as you say, and doesn\u0027t give the classic chance of failure vibe as real rocketry does. I\u0027m not with the whole \u0022fly manual or GTFO\u0022 group either, I use ASAS on nearly all my craft, and will probably do so even more with the amazing new ASAS system being implemented. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the system that SQUAD has in mind would be implemented, you would hear no gripes from me. So long as you aren\u0027t guaranteed success, then the game still has a bit of difficulty to it. I agree I\u0027ve been a bit hasty in my responses, so thank you for making me realise that. And I do agree that mods enrich the gaming experience and that modders will eventually find a way to break through.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree that Squad doesn\u0027t want to lose interest, but they also deeply care about the end product of the game. The creation of ASAS was precisely made to the point that it is to not make the game too easy, but manageable in your flights. If Squad simply bent the will of KSP to what the community wants, it probably wouldn\u0027t be the game it is today.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AceGamer","CreatedById":61925,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-12T19:40:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust play the game as you enjoy it.

Which I doubt is even possible, but what do I know. IMHO, you can\u0027t in good faith embrace mods on one hand, and devote an entire slice of your website to hosting them, even hire former modders to your dev team, and deny them on the other. And I certainly would lose interest in KSP quickly if they did so. Part of the fun of this game, \u003Cstrong\u003Efor me,\u003C/strong\u003E is the mods. Designing is as well.
