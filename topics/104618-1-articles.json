I know that I can change the values in the config files, but there are so many, especially when you take mods into account. Is there a plugin or a separate config file perhaps, that can \u0022overwrite\u0022 the other config files? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T21:06:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExcept for Goo and Material bay, you can send the result once and redo the science but keep the second one.

This does however not work with goo canisters or material bays, as these need to be cleaned out to repeat (using the mobile processing lab).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T21:20:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes it work to bring back 2 exact same experiment (with same starting conditions) ?
