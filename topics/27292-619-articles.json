The transmitter, which had been in the middle of uploading some data, immediately used up all the remaining electricity in the pod, leaving the lander basically non-functional.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what to do - revert to my last quicksave and claim \u0022that\u0027s not really what happened\u0022 ...or IRONMAN IT LIKE A BOUSE?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, I checked to see if anyone nearby was leveled up enough to fix the panels. Nope. The closest I have is Bill (or was it Bob? I keep mixing those two up xP), who\u0027s about half a level short of that ability. However... I COULD bring my Kerbals home (and then with any luck one of them will be able to do it) and then send a recovery mission back to get the lander. As for Daphjorie, she was fortunate to discover that her EVA pack was more than sufficient to get her back up to the ship in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s the plan I went with. She will of course enjoy a thorough debriefing upon return to Kerbin and perhaps some remedial piloting lessons. At least now I know why she needed to get rescued way back when xD\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
