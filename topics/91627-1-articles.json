Deployed solar panels are going to be impossible: there\u0027s going to be way more shearing force on reentry than any realistic solar panel arrangement is going to be able to take. Use surface-attached panels like the OX-STATs: nothing else will survive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of retracted solar panels, I\u0027m not sure how much effect you will see out of FAR. I believe FAR simulates a concave shape over any object, so it might not do a good job distinguishing solar panels with aero casings from naked solar panels. Again, I don\u0027t know of any mod solar panels which have aero casings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-30T18:21:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is just a guess, but I think the OP is talking about solar planes using a lot of fixed solar panels on wings, because other solar panels would just burn up and/or breaks with DR and FAR, and is asking for bigger ones (like the ones in NFS) in order to avoid high part counts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"endl","CreatedById":119320,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-30T20:05:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RainDreamer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RainDreamer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is just a guess, but I think the OP is talking about solar planes using a lot of fixed solar panels on wings, because other solar panels would just burn up and/or breaks with DR and FAR, and is asking for bigger ones (like the ones in NFS) in order to avoid high part counts.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eexactly this. im looking for a way to have large solar panels that dont burn off and will not be torn off by far. id probably use it on some drop pods too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
