It was so close. Just there were no ferrings to put the lander for apollo 11 replica in. All I ask for are ferrings that come as a part and aren\u0027t proceduraly generated. That would do me and many others a world of good. If this conflicts with the \u0027don\u0027t post\u0027 thread, please take it down. I wasn\u0027t sure if the rule about not posting proceduraly generated ferrings would still count with non proceeduraly generated ferrings. Thanks again.

I think I\u0027ll ask him if he\u0027s able to release a fairings pack and leave the rest of the parts out. It\u0027s an awesome mod, but all I want now are fairings.
