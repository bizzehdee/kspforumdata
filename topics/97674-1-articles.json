I haven\u0027t tried to measure them on the surface yet because I wanna do the ones up high before I land. Anyway I believe the equipment to measure this is the GRAVMAX negative graviolie detector thing but when I go to log gravity data at altitude it says that that is unavailable at this time. When I click on it again the bubble for running the test has disappeared so it seems it has been cycled and I can still reset if I want but it doesn\u0027t count it towards the contract. I can\u0027t figure out how to fulfill this part of the contracts. I\u0027m assuming I won\u0027t have a problem running the test on the ground while I\u0027m stationary but I haven\u0027t tried yet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone has some ideas or knows what I\u0027m talking about advice would be helpful. Thanks. I\u0027ll try to get the name of the contract in a bit. I\u0027m still cruising around finishing up other contracts now since I already flew to this side of the earth.

I haven\u0027t played with those contracts much. I would keep the orbit as low as possible, though (~70 km). You\u0027ll have faster orbits, and hopefully get into orbit over those locations more quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ChillKill\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ChillKill\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWill it allow me to read the gravioli detector on the surface when stationary in a plane?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep, the gravimeter works just fine on the surface when stationary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, some of the contracts are a little screwy.
