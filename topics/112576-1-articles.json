The AARDV\u0027s are now done, as are my renditions of the Artemis hardware. (Which I kitbashed using regular LM parts, as the actual Altair/Artemis type lander parts I could use bug my game like crazy atm) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, my crowning achievement, is the full design of Space Station Freedom, which considering the sheer complexity and the lack of angles, comes VERY close to being an accurate replica.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s an album showcasing the new spacecraft, a picture of the CSM\u0027s (Too lazy to do a better picture atm), and an image of Freedom itself in almost operational state (though on Kerbin):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/NMuv9\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

With the current module selections and no plans to add any other non-canon analogue modules to it, it could support 26 Kerbals (though in operation will carry far less) for 6 months of Kerbal time. I also made an effort to ensure the station was \u0022boostable\u0022, as in, if I reinforced the structure in flight, I would be able to complete re-boosting missions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
