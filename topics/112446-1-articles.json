But either we never accomplish it or the craft files become outdated every time the game is updated. I think it is time for a robotic legs mod. I would be willing to do this, but I have no knowledge of programming and very little 3d design knowledge. I\u0027m honestly not even sure where to begin. But I think this is a needed mod, so if people have thoughts on how to proceed, how to do this, or if anyone wants to take a crack at it, let me know."},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T14:35:11Z","Content":"Have you tried infernal robotics?"},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T16:31:32Z","Content":"I\u0027d like to see tiny, all terrain Terror Drone-like legs."}]}
