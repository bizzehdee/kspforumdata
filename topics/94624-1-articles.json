I have a few quick questions on where to get hardware for the project. I plan on using keyboard emulation for input and an arduino for output. I will use Zitrogen\u0027s plug in for output. So my questions are: 1) What is a good and cheap source of SPST toggle switches? I am a high school student so I have a limited budget. 2) Ok so here is a stupid one probably: What are the vertical type gauges called and were can I find them? Ones similar to the ones on the Space Shuttle flight deck: \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1370.photobucket.com/albums/ag257/Starbird/Endeavour_flight_deck_3_zpsdf5ba2bd.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Endeavour_flight_deck_3_zpsdf5ba2bd.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading.

I\u0027ve never seen ones identical to the fuel meters in the Apollo/Shuttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat comes INCREDIBLY close, are a number of edgewise panel meters, particularly the ones manufactured primarily for industrial and power generation applications. First, for those with less available budget, and possibly not as much space to spare in their control panels, the GE/Yokogawa 185 Edgewise panel meters are a great choice. Yeah, stick with the 185 if you are on a budget. They are smaller, but still bigger than most cheap chinese made edgewise meters. These measure in at approximately 3 inches (7.35 cm) tall. I see them on ebay all the time, and you can find them for $10 to around $25 USD. Just be patient and wait for the right ones to pop up for sale. Ideally, you want 0-5 volt DC. 5-0-5 is also doable, but you need a dual supply driver, or a driver with a voltage divider derived ground to control them. If you end up finding a deal though, say, like 0-10 volt DC meters, you can just use the PWM outputs to drive a single transistor/MOSFET driver to boost the voltage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i14.ebayimg.com/04/i/001/30/3f/0265_12.JPG\u0022 alt=\u00220265_12.JPG\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want TRULY epic meters...

You can remove the screws in the back, and the whole outer shell slides off, so you can replace the scale and label panels also! Sadly, the prices on these are ridonkulous. I settled with 20 mA DC meters. It\u0027ll take a little extra hardware, but basically, I\u0027ll build a voltage controlled current source (x4) to power them. I got these meters for a STEAL.

Another trick you can do... If All you can snag are the 185 meters, the little ones, you can technically flip one upsidedown and butt it next to another one. If you redo them with white on black labels, like in the NASA hardware, then the labels may slightly mask the seam, and you can \u0022fake\u0022 dual edgewise meters, like the ones in the photo. They\u0027ll turn out a tad bit wide, but keep an eye out on ebay, you sometimes find slim versions. Two slim version butted together would be almost the \u003Cem\u003Eperfect\u003C/em\u003E size to mimic the NASA ones!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if the tiny, anemic needle style indicator of the 185 doesn\u0027t float your boat, cut out a triangle of paper (colored to your liking), and glue it to the needle. As long as it\u0027s light weight, the needle will still move. Be aware that if you peg the meters, you could damage your paper arrow. If the meters have adjustable stops, make sure they are adjusted so they don\u0027t let the paper get slammed into the ends of the meter movement\u0027s travel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for driving them, you have to be a teensy bit creative. On the arduino, you have to essentially invert the PWM output for the flipped meter. 100% output for nada, and 0% output for maximum scale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the cheapest way to do dual edgewise meters...
