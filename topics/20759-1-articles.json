Spent the better part of the week working on one design/modification or another searching for a viable design. Quite proud of the end result. Would love some feedback from others whom have made a functional shuttle design before. Also... anyone else getting \u0027The Last Starfighter\u0027 vibe from this? I know I did after I finished adding the main stage boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was the result: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropbox.com/u/41549957/TestShuttle-2Minmus.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TestShuttle-2Minmus.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropbox.com/u/41549957/TestShuttle-2Hanger.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TestShuttle-2Hanger.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Orbits and landings performed manually with stock install - no addons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Craft is stable in Atmo for landings and in transition. Throttle will have to be watched while cargo is in the small bay there as prior to jettisoning the craft is a little heavy on the dorsal side. payload bay is reconfigurable to suit task. Maximum size - approximately 1x FL-T400.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Config used to reach \u002B return from Minmus orbit: Displayed \u002B 1x FL-T400 in payload bay. Remaining fuel suggests the canister in the payload bay could be swapped for a small satellite to place in Minmus orbit or closer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Determined a classic space-shuttle external tank and booster config is not really viable with stock parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Mun landing possible... but difficult. Shuttle really performs best in Atmo. Same with Minmus landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Parachutes on dorsal side fore and aft are not required for safe landing., but are there just in case. Fairly easy to glide/land on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Only SAS is the Avionics package, so some light monitoring is required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-May be possible to extend range by swapping the LV-T45 for a Toroidal Aerospike or a Nuclear Engine and/or reconfiguring the fuel routings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally... the .craft file: ( Right-click and \u0027save-as\u0027.

Depends on how much Drag really affects things. As-is, it\u0027s a capable glider, if a bit nose-heavy if one jettisons the main engine on final approach.
