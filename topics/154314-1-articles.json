I want to sacrifice them Danny-style, however I don\u0027t know where to do it. If I do it in Kerbol it will simply poof away, if I do it in Jool\u0027s atmosphere is will heat up and blow up all at once. Where should I do it? I will post the video once I finish.

This is never truly possible (unless you have Galactic Neighbourhood) so you will eventually come back. Go far away enough then change you orbit so go directly into the sun at an extremely high speed. You will actually clip through the sun but will not explode. You will then continue to get pulled back and forth in the middle of the sun until you ship gets torn apart.
