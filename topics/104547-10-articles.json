I don\u0027t have much time for KSP lately, but I\u0027ll try to take a look at that problem and release the 1.1.3 compatible version over the weekend. Due to how IR and Sequencer works it would not be possible to save and load sequences on different vessels, but sequences are saved in a .craft file so every time you load the same craft in Editor, you\u0027ll get your saved sequences as well. This also should apply to sub assemblies, but it wasn\u0027t tested properly."},{"CreatedByName":"Ziw","CreatedById":135292,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-09T13:06:26Z","Content":"Everyone please try this version.
