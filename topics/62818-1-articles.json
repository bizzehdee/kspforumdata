My art skills aren\u0027t supreme, this I recognize, but it\u0027s better than the textured primitives otherwise available for the same part and I had fun creating these. The .cfg it comes with also is designed for use with KSP Interstellar and as such uses the \u0022Thermal Power\u0022 resource. You, the user, can of course tailor this to your own preferences. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn balancing: The value I decided upon for the power draw was the heat necessary to heat Hematite (Iron (III) Oxide, Fe2O3) to around 1400K, which is a reasonable estimate for the temperature at which iron reduction takes place in a blast furnace. Since there isn\u0027t much in the way of space-coal we\u0027re also assuming that you bring along some Carbon Monoxide to do the reduction and keep it in a closed cycle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to Wikipedia, large modern blast furnaces with volumes exceeding 5500 m^3 can produce 80,000 tons of steel in a week which would equal about 400 kg per second assuming the furnace was ran 7 days a week, 8 hours a day. I assumed a linear relationship between furnace volume and iron production and extrapolated this to the estimated volume of my model. This download includes a .cfg for 2 sizes of the smelter; the large ones weighs 50 tons and is about 10 meters long, and less than 4 in diameter, and produces about 10 kg of metal per second, drawing 12 MW of KSPI\u0027s thermal power (again, this is calculated as the energy needed to heat 10kg of hematite per second, plus a reasonable efficiency loss). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://puu.sh/6wFbN\u0022 alt=\u00226wFbN\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe smaller version is half as large and has 1/8th of the production capacity as the larger one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince these are very specific parts that depend on other mods, it might not actually be the best idea to release them here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI decided to do it anyway.
