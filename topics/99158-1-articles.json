Considerable scuff at the exploitative jet, but here is a use for Jets where the might, with the right technology be a use in real life. Granted balancing a Saturn V rocket on the back of a harrier jets flattened cousin would be a task, but this KSP and we don\u0027t have to worry to much about \u0027technical details\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VLYXKMW.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VLYXKMW.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7vysNL8.png\u0022 alt=\u00227vysNL8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm sure the question of what is the telescope\u0027s base that is a 4x Scale mod of the 3200L 2M tank (Rockomax X200-32 Fuel Tank). It was empty but the extra mass simulates the weight of the reflector.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are 40 jet engines turbo fan on MK1 jet fuselage with two radial mounted air intakes attached to MGS. the fuselage feeds through the LF tank to the engine. Its got a maximum thrust to weight of 1.7g. If the program allowed it I would make it crewed to land, but since putting on ship on hold while landing other is not part of the game . . . . \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEat your heart out NASA. ;^)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI forgot to add, the separation of the pad from the kerbodyne was tricky, those flares on the edge of the pad are sepratrons, required because the jets still have alot of residual lift, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etiming of the kerbodyne fire is immediate and full throttle after decoupling. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERed Iron Cross might like the pad, lol.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
