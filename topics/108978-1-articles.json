Like pre 1.0 with the height contracts?\n\n2nd, I have an explore contract for duna, will I still get the fly by, and landing missions etc? Or will I only get the explore duna contract?"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T23:07:52Z","Content":"I think you won\u0027t get the expore if you already went there.\n\nSame with the flyby... its a shame really... I never got the explore minmus contract.\n\nLuckily, the Duna and Ike explore contracts came up well before my probe arrives there.\n\nI got a duna flyby contract as well, but I may miss out on the Ike flyby... we\u0027ll see.\n\nThey should really change these to have the same \u0022automatic\u0022 system as the record contracts."},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T23:21:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I think you won\u0027t get the expore if you already went there.\n\u003E Same with the flyby... its a shame really...

All of the Explore Contracts for the First Record Keeping Society should be automatically given and completed.

Accepting the explore contracts and then fullfilling them systematically one after another really hampers your more ambitious career goals - it sort of puts you on rails and almost introduces a KSP version of fake difficulty, e.g. no Tylo gravity assist allowed because you have to avoid the SOI to get the explore contract later...\n\nIt\u0027s propably best not to overthink this and just grab the explore contracts when they are offered as an additional bonus. Deliberately avoiding a body\u0027s SOI simply to make it possible to pick up the contract some time later takes away a lot of fun for me."},{"CreatedByName":"Andrewx21","CreatedById":140332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T02:15:46Z","Content":"ok I can deal with avoiding SOI\u0027s for now, Ike is gonna be a jerk about it though, im sure"}]}
