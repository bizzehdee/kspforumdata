Accepting the explore contracts and then fullfilling them systematically one after another really hampers your more ambitious career goals - it sort of puts you on rails and almost introduces a KSP version of fake difficulty, e.g. no Tylo gravity assist allowed because you have to avoid the SOI to get the explore contract later...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s propably best not to overthink this and just grab the explore contracts when they are offered as an additional bonus.
