I want to see them!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new big fuel tanks are the perfect diameter to build shuttles with, and the new engines are great for creating powerful boosters for the American version, or giant Energia style things if you wanna recreate the Buran.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll start you off with mine. It\u0027s my most accurate shuttle yet, reasonably well proportioned and with all the correct functionality. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main differences would be the liquid boosters, and the little MK55 engines on the orbiter. The real one used these in orbit, however on my version they fire all throughout the ascent to help give more power. Once you\u0027re in orbit all you have is RCS, but there\u0027s over 2400 units, I haven\u0027t tested if this enough for a moon flyby or something, but it\u0027s definitely enough for lots of orbital maneuvering. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not too bad to fly, I\u0027ve balanced it quite well. It\u0027s got quite a lot of SAS units stashed inside the main tank, which obviously help quite a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlight plan is as simple as it gets. Full throttle, spacebar to launch and start the gravity turn around 8000m. It pulls slightly towards the VAB at the beginning of the boosters stage, so you\u0027ll want to correct that, and it slightly towards the gravity turn during the end of the boosters, so you\u0027ll also want to watch for that. Once the boosters are gone you\u0027ve gotta keep using the controls to keep it steady, but it\u0027s not difficult to fly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s only got a t/w ratio of about 0.7 when the boosters are gone, but this is just about enough to keep chasing your apoapsis and get it into orbit, it just takes a while to get the apoapsis up to 70k.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnlike the real one, this does have an abort system. Hit backspace, and then activate the parachutes if you survive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my first build, so I hold no responsibility if you encounter problems such as imbalanced RCS, imbalanced flying on de-orbit, or boosters taking out the wings during separation.
