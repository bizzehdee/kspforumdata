Once found, go to a hex containing Kethane, drill for it, store it, and convert it to fuel, oxidizer, monopropellant, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can practice on Kerbin. I setup a lander with storage tanks, a drill and a converter. Then made a rover to carry the fuel to ships that had landed nearby. All you need to transfer resources is a docking port set at the right height, for your rover to drive up to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I decided that next time I\u0027ll put the tanks, drill and everything else on the rover. No sense in having two vehicles when one will do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KhaosCorp","CreatedById":61149,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-28T03:25:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst is scanners, you have 2 of these. Use these to scan bodys for kethane deposits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext is drills, there are 2 of these also. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the various tanks, a radial, a 1.25m tanks and a few 2.5m tanks, this is for storage. Keep in mind that raw kethane follows same flow rules as monopropellant. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast we have converters, got 2 of these as well. These convert raw kethane into the different fuel types.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are the basic parts ya need to start making fuels from kethane......then theres the oddball parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe blender....got a mouthy crew member on a mission...throw him into this part and blend him into kethane....150units at that!!! (i think kerbals may themselfs be explosive..)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe kethane turbine engine runs on raw kethane and kethair intake, a resource the engine will gather on any body with an atmosphere(atmo NOT air). It works much like a jet engine, but meant for much slower speeds....its also a little tricky, fair warning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last bit is the generator. This is a VERY valuable part for large mining/refining operations. It burns raw kethane and produces electric charge, a fairly good amount when needed. It works much like an actual gas generator...throttling itself as power need rises....so it wont burn away kethane unless it needs to, GREAT part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EONE last thing....do NOT build ANYTHING with kethane till you read this thread:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35664-Kethane-Usage-and-Proper-Fuel-Routing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35664-Kethane-Usage-and-Proper-Fuel-Routing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will help you understand fuel routing in KSP and how it applies to kethane. We gonna know if you dont read it ... =P\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-28T03:26:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe main parts include:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Scanning: This is the first piece of the puzzle. There are two scanners, a small and medium one. Be sure to pack plenty of power and batteries. It is best to place a scanning probe into a polar (or near polar) orbit and time warp (but not so much that you skip over spots) until you find green/yellow sections filled with kethane. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Drilling: There are two drills, a small and large one. There is also a variety of tanks. Land in one of the spots that show kethane and deploy the drills (make sure they touch the ground). Once deployed they will start filling the kethane tanks. They will require good power, of course. You can time warp to make it faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Refining: There is 1.25 and 2.5 m converters. These also require power. Select the fuel choice, and it will exchange kethane to fuel. It works as a reverse engine, generating fuel by using kethane, so if you wish to make liquid fuel/oxidizer it will need to be connected to a tank.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
