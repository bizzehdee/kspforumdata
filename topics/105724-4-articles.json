In other words: do a gravity turn instead of trying to tilt the rocket instantly at 10 km. The unstable pods are a bug, but one can either do shallow reentries, so that reaction wheels can counteract aerodynamic forces, or install the Stock Bugfix Modules (as you probably also did with 0.90).\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, I\u0027m looking forward to 1.0.1 as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T14:58:43Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 02:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by soulsource\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kiro","CreatedById":139123,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T14:12:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe all knew this was going to happen.
