That second payload of probes had the issue, but it was the second probe I tried to control, not first, and not counting the lift stages. It was odd because at first it would just not point in the right direction, it would be 90 degrees off in the same direction every time. MJ could point to a node fine though. I was only able to stop the spin with MJ if I made sure to stop sending kill rotation commands from the flight computer as well. It appeared to me that the issue was specifically a heading calculation error with the node command and somehow a spinning heading on the kill command.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Are feature requests entertained in this thread? I would like a difficulty setting that causes omnidirectional antennas to be able to automatically connect to only the nearest other omnidirectional antenna in range. Each antenna can only have one task at a time. If you want an active relay from A \u0026gt; B through C then C needs two antennas. This way, for instance, if we are controlling a rover on the surface, in order to minimize blackouts it benefits us to built commlink sats with enough antennas to maintain connections with each other (2), the relay back to kerbin from where ever you are AND the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-09T23:45:48Z\u0022 title=\u002209/09/2014 11:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Errol\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"guischmitd","CreatedById":117649,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-10T09:03:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022deepfield\u0022 data-cite=\u0022deepfield\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003ETry installing RemoteTech in a clean KSP and see if that works.
