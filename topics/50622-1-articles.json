Just retract a solar panel when you need to dock to the sides. It also has 7 nuclear engines so it can easily be used as an interplanetary tug, or moved on its own to act as a refueling station there. This one took about 10% of the fuel/RCS inside it to get into a 125k orbit. It can probably be done better but I\u0027m not the greatest pilot. I also got another one into orbit with only ~2% wasted by adding 36 solid fuel boosters, but that looks ugly and it\u0027s trickier to pilot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cYEUURH.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022cYEUURH.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPiloting: 0 will turn off gimbaling on the first stage. You\u0027ll drop your first stage at 10k which is when I start turning east. Be ready to start burning well before apoapsis since you\u0027ll need to start using the nuclear engines before orbit, probably before you have a periapsis above ground. The upside to that is no debris, everything will burn up. If you manage to get into orbit before dropping the last stage, it has a remote guidance unit so you can de-orbit it. It also has a large RCS tank that you can transfer from before dropping it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther controls: 1 toggles the solar panels, 9 disables the nuclear engines once you\u0027re in your desired orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft files below. I\u0027ll include the ugly (solid boosters) version and also just the launcher. The part counts are heavy (666 for just the launcher, spoooky), so be prepared for a laggy launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16399537/KSP/Refueling%20Station%20Mk%2002.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERefueling Station Mk 02\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16399537/KSP/Refueling%20Station%20Mk%2002%20Ugly.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERefueling Station Mk 02 Ugly\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16399537/KSP/Launcher%20200%20Mk%2001.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELauncher 200 Mk 01\u003C/a\u003E - It can\u0027t get this thing all the way into orbit, but I assume it can get at least 200t up there easily\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWarning: by far the weakest points are the adapters between the nuclear engines and the orange tanks.
