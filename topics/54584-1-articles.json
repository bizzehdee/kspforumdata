The problem is, they are quite expensive; second-hand is OK though, but I\u0027d still make to make sure I\u0027d be buying something that covers the subject in detail, and is ideally accessible. (I have a couple of engineering degrees, but would struggle to remember quite a lot of what I did...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if anyone has suggestions for books they have actually read and used, I would be grateful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"christok","CreatedById":93810,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-30T13:18:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t have many books on this topic and I\u0027m very far from finished with them but I suppose I can recommend two. If you want a book on just orbital mechanics of spacecraft, I have and enjoy \u003Cem\u003EOrbit \u0026amp; constellation design \u0026amp; management\u003C/em\u003E by Wertz. It\u0027s very comprehensive but perhaps a little lighter on complicated interplanetary maneuvers such as multiple gravity assist trajectories. It\u0027s a somewhat specialised topic and you\u0027d want a dedicated book if you want to get your hands dirty. The information on interstellar trajectories is fairly basic but there is a decent list of references.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(In the unlikely event that you actually do want to study interstellar trajectories, you can start with \u003Cem\u003EThe starflight handbook: A pioneer\u0027s guide to interstellar travel\u003C/em\u003E by Mallove \u0026amp; Matloff. Even better, the journal of the British Interplanetary Society has for a long time been a major publication for papers on this topic. Robert Forward was one of the early pioneers in this field so you could always just search for his work.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027d like more general information on other aspects of spaceflight as well, \u003Cem\u003ESpace mission engineering: The new SMAD\u003C/em\u003E or the older versions (\u003Cem\u003ESpace mission analysis and design\u003C/em\u003E, AKA SMAD), edited by Wertz, Everett \u0026amp; Puschell is very insightful. It has a chapter on orbital mechanics but is very light on interplanetary flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearch Amazon and astrobooks.com and borrow what you think you need from a library (inter-library loan if necessary).

I would recommend to start with a mechanics text, since they would usually have a good section on central potential motion. I just looked in Goldstein, and it covers central potential in general, Kepler problem, and goes a bit into 3-body motion. If you understand that, you will understand absolutely everything there is to understand about types of orbits KSP considers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut real orbital mechanics goes way beyond that.
