I think it sees them as having some kind of wierd friction due to part clipping defying (our) laws of physics.

I\u0027ve been using girders either clipped into a SPP fuselage to provide a mount for a wheel, or as a structural frame with parts clipped inside it (which I used for example in a small aircraft, and the vtol engines are mounted to the girder). In both cases they turn out to be the hottest part of the craft--either absorbing heat from something connected to it, or generating heat during reentry (and with a heat shield and some other parts between it and the reentry).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe I\u0027ve read somewhere that girders could act as radiators of sorts to pump out LV-N heat, so for a moment I thought at least with the aircraft the absorbing-heat thing was sort of the expected behavior. The reentry thing was bugging me, though--nothing I could do could stop the girder from blowing up (even with a SpaceY 5m heat shield all but covering the cross-section of the craft, and either stock or Procedural fairings enclosing the whole craft). Point is, the first or one of the first things to blow up is a girder that is clipped. (Well, then again, even \u0022exposed\u0022 wheels/tracks also heat up like crazy, even if in a fairing and the cross-section\u0027s wholly covered by a heat shield, but those wheels are also clipped to the girder somewhat...). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe clipping\u0027s making temp calculations for parts go crazy, and for those parts that have certain heat properties, they go haywire?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"monophonic","CreatedById":76902,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T07:39:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you see any indication that the clipped parts might be shaking, even ever so minutely?

And, on another craft, where I have clipped a couple of Near Future static solar panel girders (PX panels) onto a short stock girder, \u003Cem\u003Eplus\u003C/em\u003E a Mechjeb box and a surface scanner, plus mirror-mounted a couple of USI ducted fans (I was making the aircraft for that carrier), it was the girder \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E the solar panels that were pegging the temp gauges (the heat, I assume, came from both the fans and the sun).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not versed in how the dynamics are coded, so I can\u0027t get too technical, but I could break down the possible hypotheses:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ehieywiey is right, and there\u0027s a bug in how the temps in absorption and radiation are calculated when parts clip. Don\u0027t know how that works, though...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIt\u0027s not quite a bug, but it\u0027s a painful consequence of clipping. This would be monophonic\u0027s theory a couple posts back: If a clipped part is shaking within the part clipped, the two should be generating friction. When I spawn the rover on the runway, though, I couldn\u0027t observe any of the flickering or shaking that monophonic asked me to look out for. (Plus, like I said above, I had KJR to stick things together \u003Cem\u003Ehard\u003C/em\u003E. Unless, of course, that could be the issue?)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThis is all intended behavior, and I am being punished for depending too much on girders to serve as my wheel bogies. As the heat experiments in the Add On Development board have seen, girders are one of those parts that could be used as radiators for an LV-N on full (not as good as wings though...). Which means they are designed to absorb and throw off heat as fast as they could. It\u0027s just that in reentry, there\u0027s too much heat to go around.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMaybe it\u0027s because I\u0027m using HyperEdit? (Huh?)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#3 could be the right answer (that it\u0027s not a bug or a clipping issue), but it raises some more questions: then, why didn\u0027t the other girder, up in the rover\u0027s nose, peg the temp charts? (Maybe because of all the parts between it and the heat shield? But, like I observed in one of the pictures above, I had a prior experiment where more girders were mounted on a tank between the heat shield and the rover, and all this still inside a fairing, to serve as a heat soak, which didn\u0027t work.) Sure, maybe a heat shield won\u0027t stop \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E the heat from getting through to the contents, which is kinda counterintuitive (plus, as observed in a heat shield rebalance mod, a dead stock heat shield actually \u003Cem\u003Einsulates\u003C/em\u003E completely the part it\u0027s attached to, which is also counterintuitive... hence the mod\u0027s existence), but then what about all the other parts in between the shield and the girders? Shouldn\u0027t the fairing also be able to absorb some heat, without transmitting it to what it protects inside?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for now (and I\u0027m thinking of waiting for 1.0.3, anyway, just to be sure), the only solution I got is to go with the active braking module in the last few pictures--which also confirms that a lot of the heat that killed the girders is coming during the reentry phase, heat that\u0027s not supposed to be transmitted to the craft ideally. It\u0027s not efficient, though, having to design a vertical drop deorbit module, and an active braking module, plus the skycrane, and send them all towards Duna, Eve, or Laythe (a lot of dV to spend... which I do have in sandbox, but still, the principle of the thing...). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope someone can figure out if this is not supposed to be happening, or this is actually the intended behavior. The advantages of fairings and heat shields is supposed to be that this isn\u0027t supposed to happen, after all... (Unless, of course, girders were not meant to be wheel bogies)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any analysis!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
