I\u0027m just wondering if anyone else has encountered this issue (I\u0027m still playing 1.0.5):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had accepted two contracts of the grand tour type - one of them asking for the \u0022Eve 3\u0022, the other for the \u0022Ike 3\u0022 (if I remember correctly) challenge. The first contract asked for a flyby of Eve, Gilly, and Duna, and the second asked for a flyby of Mun, Duna, and Ike (again: iirc, I\u0027m busy at work right now \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E). So, of course, I sent off an ultra-light probe to visit all of those destinations. Easy-peasy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe strange thing was, that although I still had plenty of time to finish the contracts, and although I\u0027m absolutely certain that none of my craft did visit all the mentioned locations, both contracts suddenly moved from \u0022Active\u0022 to the \u0022Archive\u0022 and were marked as \u0022completed\u0022 (as opposed to \u0022failed\u0022 or \u0022aborted\u0022). At this point, the craft I wanted to use for the contracts had passed by Mun, and had reached an orbit around Gilly, from where it should have continued to Duna at the next transfer window. Even more funny: When looking at the \u0022completed\u0022 contracts only the \u0022Flyby the Mun\u0022, \u0022Flyby Eve\u0022, and \u0022Flyby Gilly\u0022 parts were marked as \u0022complete\u0022, the other goals were still labeled as being \u0022incomplete\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust before I noticed that said contracts had been marked as completed, I had landed another craft on Ike and then switched to the probe planned for said contracts in Gilly\u0027s orbit using Kerbal Alarm Clock.\u00A0 So, I could imagine KSP getting confused by my switch from a craft that had performed a flyby of Duna and Ike directly to a craft that had done all other flyby contract parameters (without going through the Space Center scene).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs said, just asking if anyone else has seen this, as it was quite easy to mark the contract as active again by editing the save file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-06T12:55:13Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2016 12:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by soulsource\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-06T11:29:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYup seen this a lot when switching crafts. Not quite deterministic, though. Not sure if KAC is relevant because since one can still switch craft without going back KSC in stock, I don\u0027t know, and I didn\u0027t dig further why it does this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"soulsource","CreatedById":110576,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-06T11:31:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, so it\u0027s not me going crazy, but indeed it might be a bug.
