I\u0027m looking at half hour 2 man landing, grab rocks and go. Rocketry is not remotely feasible, but I think something more like a deep-sea dive via cable is conceivable all though HIGHLY challenging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off you start with an entire second dirigible comparable in size to the HAVOC one, this one carries only a massive spool of cable, a \u0027cage\u0027 attached to the cable and an anchor on a short cable under the cage with winch. The cage has room for two massive rigid-body suits capable of withstanding the Venus pressure, the suits will need to be super insulated, likely by utilizing a double layer thermos type structure as well as active cooling, the suit will be impossible to move by human muscle power so it will be hydraulically powered by a kind of exoskeleton. Hydraulic fluid and active coolant (possibly the same fluid) will be supplied by a umbilical line no more then 100 m long connected to a large compressor/cooler unit in the cage. The compressor will be powered electrically by electrical lines embedded in the cable up to the dirigible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is ofcourse a crazy inefficient arrangement for actual mobility and practical exploration, it would be vastly easier to just lower a \u0027submarine/tank\u0027 vehicle that the crew never leaves on the cable, but then no footprints, and a flag stuck in the ground by a robot arm is hardly very glorious. So in the interests of pure melodrama and the realization that Venus surface is a location we will go to initially only FOR such drama I\u0027m proposing suits at the end of the cable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOperationally the scenario would involve the manned HAVOC blimp mooring in mid-air with the decent equipped blimp, the decent blimp with be forward with respect to the wind to create a in-line configuration that minimizes wind drag. This is necessary because once the whole cage/cable/blimp must come to zero velocity with the Venus surface and any thing NOT attached to that line and also at zero velocity is going to be hundreds of miles down range by the time the sortie is completed and separating the crew from their return rocket is a bad idea even if it is temporary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crew will transfer to the decent blimp by zip-line while wearing oxygen masks, enter the suits by rear hatches and begin being lowered on the cable. As the cable descends into lower denser and slower winds it will act as a air-anchor and begin to be pulled at an angle from the blimp while also slowing the blimp. This will be accentuated by use of a parachute or para-foil deployed from the cage. By the time the cage is just above the Venus surface it will be moving only a few m/s relative to surface and the Blimp far above will be in nearly full 100 m/s winds which will be putting huge tension on the cable (far in excess of the weight of the cage), this force will want to bring the blimp down so it may be necessary for large air-foils on the blimps to generate more lift, much like a kite. Contact with the surface is made by lowering the anchor from the cage and hooking it to the Venus surface, then the cage is winched down onto the anchor and pinions are drilled into the surface to fully secure everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cable nessary to perform this mission looks to be the largest engineering challenge. Zylon plastic is our highest specific strength material and could easily handle the total distance without breaking under it\u0027s own or the cables weight, but it can only do some of the upper portion of the cable because it losses too much strength above ~200C. A series of materials with progressively higher temperature tolerances would be needed, with some kind of metal alloy like titanium or steal being used at the lowest portion, carbon fiber might be good for the middle section. The suits may need to be made of Inconel, a nickel based super alloy that can take the full heat of Venus surface and not lose a bit of strength.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-27T03:14:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually a \u0022challenge\u0022 to land and return from Venus\u0027 surface is part of the subject of \u0022Venus\u0022 by Ben Bova.
