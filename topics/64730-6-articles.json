It\u0027s probably better to just assume that (basic) radiation protection is baked in to the existing parts, and thus their weights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne way to implement radiation would be to make it only a concern when you get really close to Kerbol, starting somewhere between the orbits of Eve and Moho. This would make Moho a more difficult (and thus potentially more rewarding) destination. Of course, this would still require adding some way of making radiation protection into an interesting game mechanic. If it\u0027s just an extra part you have to slap on, that doesn\u0027t really do much. If it used a lot of power, that might be more interesting. Perhaps something like a \u0022magnetic field generator\u0022 that uses a bunch of power (requiring an extensive solar array even with the increased efficiency) to fend off the radiation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe amount of power required could increase based on how much radiation you were getting dosed with, and perhaps the part itself could degrade over time, so you have to be careful in how you plan your mission to ensure you have sufficient power, and aren\u0027t spending too long in the dangerous radiation. This would also make for a fairly interesting \u0022Sun-Dive\u0022 mission profile, where you try to get a probe (or later, perhaps even a kerbal) into low Kerbol orbit, likely requiring late-game power generation and a very aggressive burn to get close enough before your shielding degrades fully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could also be used elsewhere, for example by making one of Jool\u0027s moons slightly radioactive. It wouldn\u0027t be as harsh as getting to Moho, but your power generation options would also be more limited, so it would add some unique complications to the mission profile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"babale","CreatedById":108874,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-17T19:12:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just wanted to say -- thank you very much for posting this.

Technically this is the second Ham class ship to fly (I\u0027m not sure how much the future trip to Eeloo will use of Ham, I will likely be using the same launch platform and the return capsule but the rest of the structure might be redone). Lemger Kerman will be flying to Duna on a slightly upgraded Ham platform. I\u0027ve add 2 more supply pods to add a degree of safety (8 pods now, up from 6) and of course there is a Duna specific lander mounted on top since the Gilly lander wouldn\u0027t really work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hPzVXiO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022hPzVXiO.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/J4KMijb.png\u0022 alt=\u0022J4KMijb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same process is used to perform an injection burn to Duna as was used to reach Eve. Once the burn is done the injection tanks and remaining fuel (460L x 2) where discarded like before so the solar array could be opened. Since this trip is to Duna monitoring solar performance is very important. The ship is reoriented several times during the journey to keep the panels from being blocked by each other or the rear engines. 2 small corrections are made mid-flight, one a few days from Kerbin at the AN and another a few days before reaching Duna to bring the approach to about 60 km from Duna\u0027s surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Fvsd7Py.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Fvsd7Py.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6tGJc6b.png\u0022 alt=\u00226tGJc6b.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArriving at Duna the capture is with engines to setup a roughly 60km x 60km orbit (to allow 50x warping). I didn\u0027t get the approach perfectly straight so I\u0027m inclined in my orbit. It\u0027s not enough that I\u0027m going to worry about it. The probe Apple 2 can be seen on the surface though it\u0027s far from our potential landing zone. Crew reports and biometric readings are taken in low and high orbit and both goo containers on the mothership are used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0VJdiek.png\u0022 alt=\u00220VJdiek.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/S5EtRA2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022S5EtRA2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mothership goes for half a rotation around Duna (to get past the night side) while preparation are made for the landing. The lander\u0027s supplies are topped up and the batteries checked for charge. The mothership\u0027s probe core is activated and SAS\u002BRCS is turned on to keep it stable. This time I remembered and retracted the solar array - the probe core has lots of battery power (it will last several times longer then the life support in the lander) and this avoids potential damage during docking. Finally Lemger takes a short space walk to reach the lander (the desired placement of a Science Jr prevents an internal tunnel) and detaches. After using RCS to move out of the mothership\u0027s path the engines are lit up and lightly begin thrusting to deorbit the lander. Once the deorbit burn is complete the heat shield can be inflated (it will block the engines).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fgJZDy9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022fgJZDy9.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FbvZGeX.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FbvZGeX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe heat shield turns out to be a bit useless. Descent speed never exceeds 800 m/s and by the time the air gets thicker circumstances have reduced it further. One goo container is used in the high atmosphere and crew related readings are taken there and when it reaches the lower atmosphere. At 18km the navball automatically switches to surface speed and I take that as a cue to ditch the heatshield and begin slowing down. I\u0027ve said before that I consider Duna the most challenging planet to land on - everywhere else you can either use parachutes or just pack enough fuel but on Duna there are multiple chances for your ship to be violently destroyed. The engines are now burning to slow the ship down to an acceptable speed for parachute deployment. Without the heatshield I\u0027m monitoring temperature - the bottom reaches a high temperature of 332 C but no more. At 9km the ship has slowed to just over 400 m/s and the parachutes are partially deployed to start providing me with some free drag. After a few seconds the engines are shutoff since speed is now at 350 m/s and dropping, slow enough I think that I should be safe when they fully deploy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8f8xxbD.png\u0022 alt=\u00228f8xxbD.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KRXphv6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KRXphv6.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qyaqk8t.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qyaqk8t.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe parachutes fully deploy at just under 6km, almost instantly snapping the ship from 330 m/s to 105m/s and pushing the G meter for a brief second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/W2f6bWG.png\u0022 alt=\u0022W2f6bWG.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GEaks6u.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GEaks6u.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/apKjcqm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022apKjcqm.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CZZj1BJ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CZZj1BJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AZrAEh4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022AZrAEh4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship stays in one piece and Lemger seems to pull through fine so the final landing sequence can be executed. With the parachutes open the ship is still falling at 20 m/s - I overshot the canyon I wanted to land on and instead I\u0027m descending toward a 5.5km high mountain where the air is still thin. The lander was only designed for a parachute only landing up to 3.5km so some engine thrust is required to cut the last bit, reducing speed to about 7m/s. My biggest fear about using engine thrust is that it can tip the lander so I\u0027m sure to cut it just before touching down. Even so you can see the lander wants to tip on the steep hill and the SAS kicks in with RCS to keep it planted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rnJLjh3.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022rnJLjh3.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the ground the second Goo container can be used along with crew and biometric reports. The Science Jr is easily access from the ladder and then surface experiments can be run. The lander still has 354 L of fuel (well above the safety margins I set for getting back into orbit - 320L ideal, 252L absolute minimum). Once everything is done Lemger returns to the lander for a nap while the mothership circles back into position overhead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AWl0BDQ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022AWl0BDQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/R143NLl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022R143NLl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the mothership in position the lander heads back up into space. Because of the inclination a single orbit intercept is not possible. Inclination is adjusted on the first mutual orbit and on the second a burn is made to adjust course and bring the two together. Fortunately there is enough life support in the lander to safely perform these operations (it will dock with close to half it\u0027s life support remaining). I did switch between craft so that the mothership could perform some of the burns (specifically the inclination burn) since it had a much easier fuel situation and I want to ensure the lander had fuel to perform the close in burns that required quick attitude control. A consequence of this is that the batteries in the lander didn\u0027t drain in relation to the life support (batteries don\u0027t drain if the craft isn\u0027t focused). This wasn\u0027t a planned exploit and the lander had enough battery power regardless to match its life support reserves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ONNSIoK.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ONNSIoK.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lK9xdKM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lK9xdKM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking was in the dark and I had actually considered but never got around to installing lights on the mothership for this mission. The lander approached from behind, making a slight adjustment so that it would pass beside the mothership and then casually turns around for a braking burn before using RCS to travel the last 10m for docking. I considered making a GIF but it\u0027s dark anyway and it\u0027s about 4 seconds between each shot below, so it would have been really long.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bJXtWnh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bJXtWnh.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eQcS6zW.png\u0022 alt=\u0022eQcS6zW.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GKunika.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GKunika.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2KuAJCy.png\u0022 alt=\u00222KuAJCy.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WBap3Q4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022WBap3Q4.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0AJ3QFm.png\u0022 alt=\u00220AJ3QFm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter docking Lemger doesn\u0027t immediately come back or open the solar array. It seems that with the docking the mothership is now going to dip a few hundred meters into the atmosphere (41,900m) in a few minutes so I\u0027m going to wait that out. After passing safely the sun comes up and Lemger travels back to the mothership\u0027s control pod and tranfers all the science. Monopropellent and life support supplies are stripped from the lander. Once the lander has no more use it is ejected using the decoupler that linked it to the Science Jr and through that to the docking port. This leaves behind the Science Jr and Goo containers in the same configuration as the Gilly trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6wWz2zm.png\u0022 alt=\u00226wWz2zm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solar array can be deployed again and return burn (1750m/s) to Kerbin can be plotted.

The reason is that I\u0027ll also be bleeding off 1200 m/s from my speed by braking into a lower PE like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2P5u54t.png\u0022 alt=\u00222P5u54t.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter burning I still have over 800L of fuel left and about 19 minutes before hitting the atmosphere. Speed is currently 3.9km/s but getting faster thanks to gravity. I begin burning all remaining fuel for braking, adjusting my angle to try and keep the PE roughly on target. With 11 minutes to go I\u0027ve reduced speed to 3.1km/s and the PE is at 30km. I fill up the command pods life support reserve from 2 of the kegs and turn off the recycler. Like before I am going on the assumption that if I wind up in a degrading orbit instead of landing my survival will depend on electrical power rather then life support supplies. Descending over the south pole the rest of the mothership is discarded and the command pod inflates its heat shield for reentry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CA8oTxb.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CA8oTxb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEntering the atmosphere at 4200 m/s the pod doesn\u0027t bleed off enough speed to keep descending, however the skip is only back up to 35km before it starts falling again.

There will be enough fuel to reach Eeloo orbit where the empty tanks, along half a set of empty kegs, will be discarded leaving 500 days of life support (the return trip is faster then the outbound trip but has a larger margin of error to be accounted for - I\u0027m carrying at least 25% more then required to cover it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA second ship, piloted by probe core and powered by RTG, will have departed Kerbin ahead of the manned ship. It will travel to Eeloo and enter orbit. Instead of 44 kegs of life support it will be carrying over 5000L of fuel (roughly equal weight) along with fuel pumps mounted to a pair of side docking points. On top will be a lander of similar size (slightly lighter) then the one that went to Duna. The first ship will dock to the side of this supply ship and be refueled. The pilot will then EVA over to the lander which will remain attached to the supply ship as it is undocked from the manned mothership and carried a short distance away before the lander seperates and goes down to Eeloo. Upon return from Eeloo the lander will dock with the mothership so the pilot can transfer over. The lander, except for the science components, will be discarded and the refueled and lightened mothership will return to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-25T01:13:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStill thinking a bit off and on about the Eeloo ship, looking for enough time to realistically tackle it. As a reference the Ham design is 300 tons into orbit around Kerbin (it was designed for 120 tons to reach Duna or Eve orbit) and a second napkin calculation I\u0027ve done for the weight of a single ship (ignoring some staging) to do the mission by itself was just short of 600 tons which seemed to validate my initial thoughts that a pair of Ham class ships could do it together. The key design issues with the pair of ships are a reliable means of docking and transfering the fuel. If the target ship has any outboard tanks that need refueling then it either needs fuel lines leading \u003Cem\u003Eto\u003C/em\u003E them or each has a seperate docking port. There is then the issue of ensuring I can reliably dock a pair of 100 ton ships one or more times. Even with a lot of RCS thrusters the Ham series wasn\u0027t exactly maneuverable and even a tiny amount of spin carries a massive amount of momentum - docking would need to be perfectly straight on because those magnets wouldn\u0027t have a prayer against those forces. Using multiple docking ports was one possibility but it raised some serious questions about whether it would mess up the operation of the fuel pump, plus it wouldn\u0027t work if the one port that didn\u0027t lock on (as often happens) was the one with the pump.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the idea of a single 600 ton ship I did throw that number into a spreadsheet and came up with a 3 stage lifter (all 3 stages are fully used and discarded in comparison to Ham\u0027s 2.5 stage design) that seems like it would be viable under the new .23.5 rules that make joints roughly equal to the strong nuclear force. It might kill the framerate but it could be worth a shot to simply put the entire ship up at once. Granted if budgets existed it would cost more then all previous launches combined - 84 mainsails and over 300,000 tons of liquid fuel, not counting oxidizer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Death Engineering","CreatedById":68528,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-27T18:04:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think your napkin math is pretty much spot on.

I\u0027m not sure of the exact setup because I haven\u0027t played with the numbers but I\u0027m wondering how much benefit I could get from a probe controlled ship flown out to Duna. A shuttle would then be used to bring a kerbal to Duna. At that range the shuttle could bring enough to refuel the first ship (with Eeloo you burn a ton just bringing the fuel out there) and the kerbal would then abandon the shuttle (and it\u0027s 60-100 days of life support) and move into the fully fueled, fully loaded ship for a trip to Eeloo where there could potentially be a third ship with a lander and some more fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr if I really wanted to I could just go with many ships - deploy a small fleet of simple ships carrying fuel and life support and send them out to Eeloo (they would be small enough that they could dock without lots of pain).

I haven\u0027t done this in stock and haven\u0027t really payed much attention to how the asteroid missions work - so far the bits of information I know are that you can pick an unknown object to track, at which point it becomes persistant, that they are classified by letter with A being the smallest and E or F being the largest, I know that you can attach to an asteroid with the grabber sort of like a docking port and I know that once attached there is a \u0027gimble\u0027 option of some sorts so you can adjust the angle of the ship relative to the asteroid for the purpose of aligning thrust. I also know that asteroids supposedly act like a ship part you can right click for information and consumables can flow between 2 seperately attached items but I\u0027m not sure how that works with relation to the more restricted fuel flow of BTSM or if the fuel processor works on asteroids.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout knowing the specifics of the mission I tried to wing it. I took a Ham class ship and removed the now obsolete solar panels, replacing them with 6 RTGs to power the pod. I then attached a small taxi/asteroid lander. It\u0027s just a lander can with a supply of monopropellent, batteries and a grabber along with a few science instruments. I\u0027ve fitted a decoupler to the grabber since I\u0027m not sure if you can release once you\u0027ve grabbed on so I want to make sure my kerbal can get back to the mothership without resorting to a long EVA. The life support supply has been reduced to 60 days, giving me some time to linger without adding a lot of weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve identified and begun tracking a class A asteroid, OGD-061, which will soon pass through Kerbin\u0027s SOI. Ham 7 is launched into orbit to intercept it, hopefully while it is still within Kerbin\u0027s SOI to make a return straight forward (there is about a 36 hour window for this). One thing I only thought about after launching is that the RTGs could have been placed on the seperator between the heatshield and the recycler. This way the pod would have power right until the final landing sequence was begun after reentry. With a potential high velocity return from Eeloo I want the pod to be ready for a aerobrake return - it seperates but instead of landing it only slows down enough in the atmosphere to get into a degrading orbit. The pod carries plenty of life support supplies, it just needs power to last long enough for the orbit to degrade enough to bring it home (that strategy was used for some of my early probe return missions, making 3 passes through the atmosphere for a soft return). Given the way this mission turned out I regret not being able to test that system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AbpncRO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022AbpncRO.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/28B1LqR.png\u0022 alt=\u002228B1LqR.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship is aligned to match the asteroids path and then a basic intercept is plotted.

Since I haven\u0027t planned this out enough and it\u0027s obviously not going right I decide to call off the mission and bring Lemger home.

Jam 1 will attempt to fufill mission 1 of my asteroid goals. Since only basic equipment is required I fit it on the well used 60 ton launcher, most of the payload is fuel and I have about 6000 m/s once I reach orbit. The outer fuel tanks are on a single stage, I haven\u0027t used any fancy fuel lines since I think I already have enough delta-v. Since it can stay up indefinitely I simply launch the ship into a 100 km parking orbit and then go back to the observatory to find an asteroid. Something I\u0027ve neglected to mention is how much debris is in Kerbin orbit beyond the visible stuff like all the discarded landers around the Mun. I\u0027ve had several close calls where discarded boosters passed less then 8 km from a newly launched ship. Coming up to a 100 km gets me away from most of the debris which is between 70 and 80 km (most lower tech missions made their circulization and injection burns from a low ~74km orbit).

It needs to be class A (no point in measuring the mass of a larger asteroid yet, I\u0027m trying to gather information on the smallest kind for a realistic first capture mission) and I want it to be in close orbit to Kerbin. There is an immediate class A candidate but it is about half way to Duna\u0027s orbit so I ignore it. Several weeks of watching produce a drought of class A asteroids (though I noted several as large as a class E, class F is either very rare or I was mistaken in the scale going that high) but after 45 days a new class A appears and it is an excellent candiate. Kerbal astronomers label the object YSQ-213 and it is following Kerbin closely, it will cross Kerbin\u0027s SOI in about 40 days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Cfp9S3a.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Cfp9S3a.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast time I waited until the object was in Kerbin\u0027s SOI to try and intercept it.

The initial course looks good, even without course correction I\u0027ll be coming close to YSQ. I can also see that OGD-061 (Ham 7) is still within my tracking range too though I expect contact will be lost at some point. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QfGJzzT.png\u0022 alt=\u0022QfGJzzT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can also see that YSQ-213 is on a \u003Cem\u003Every \u003C/em\u003Eclose orbit, even closer then I had originally estimated. The short blueish line at upper left is my probe on its way to leave Kerbin for deep space, while the big sweeping turquoise line (visible now that I\u0027ve selected the asteroid as my target) is where YSQ is going to swing past Kerbin in 5 weeks.

However this new course will take 14 days before I leave Kerbin again. After an inclination burn to bring me within 4000 km of the target I settle in until I\u0027m near the closest intercept point (about 4000 km) I burn to begin canceling out relative velocity until there is a difference of about 100 km. From there a series of small corrections gets my intercept down to 20 km - at the end of each burn I check to see if altering my speed, direction or angle or bring me closer. It\u0027s been 21 days since leaving Kerbin, which means I\u0027ll be intercepting the asteroid at about the half way point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/89A90sC.png\u0022 alt=\u002289A90sC.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Tqn0lLR.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Tqn0lLR.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0EiWwMg.png\u0022 alt=\u00220EiWwMg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom here I can handle it like a docking approach, canceling out velocity and coming in closer and just adjusting as I go.

There doesn\u0027t seem to be any pull or strain. Attach it doesn\u0027t seem like any of my science instruments are useful -they all seem concerned with me being in high sun orbit rather then the asteroid. Right clicking the asteroid itself shows me it has some quantity of material - could this be for converting to fuel with the processor? I also see an option to claim the asteroid. I don\u0027t know what that does so I\u0027m not going to try it until I\u0027ve done everything else I can with it. Unfortunately I don\u0027t have a mass read out, at least not a direct one. Using the ship information on the map screen I can see my ship is now 32.51 tons - without doing a precise calculation of how much the ship weighs without the asteroid that would put YSQ-213 at around 8 tons, much lighter then I expected it to be. Based on the size of my ship, which is mostly fuel (the outer tanks are almost entirely empty), I\u0027d make a ball park estimate that the density of the asteroid is about 1/4 that of rocket fuel. Since kerbal rocket fuel\u002Boxydizer seems to have a density of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/28088-Fuel-Density-KSP-vs-Science\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E5 kg/L\u003C/a\u003E that means the asteroid is only about 25% denser then water if my eyeball measurements are correct (though they could be very wrong, I\u0027m really just making a quick visual comparison and guess). That makes the composition of the asteroid something of a mystery - iron is something like 800% denser then water and silicon (dirt) is still 200% denser. Of course asteroids might be composed of other elements too (certainly things like oxygen and hydrogen are more abundent in the universe) and I went over to Wikipedia to see if there was any information. Apparently my guess for the density of the kerbal asteroid is not far off the density scientists have \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_asteroid_physical_characteristics#Density\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eestimated \u003C/a\u003Efor some (C type) real ones. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pFphxMP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022pFphxMP.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OnygYAw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022OnygYAw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI try clicking Target Center of Mass which I think did something - my target indicator moved a tiny bit though I\u0027m still looking at the negative side. The claw has a free pivot option (this seems to let it flex instead of being rigid) though I have some trouble lining things up. I don\u0027t think that I quite understand this part yet. I experiment a bit with RCS - it seems I can get the whole thing turning though I\u0027m not sure if navigation works. With lots of fuel and nothing else to do I sit in and wait for YSQ to reach Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArriving at Kerbin navigation proves to be weird - I can set a node for capturing, but the blue target wants to move around wildly, it won\u0027t stay in one place. As I reach the PE I burn in a direction I hope is correct. Like I said it should only take a nudge to get into orbit and it seems to do it, though the asteroid is now in a spin. I\u0027m now in orbit around Kerbin at least so I\u0027ve got my second missions objective done. The safest place to try another burn is at the AP, since I don\u0027t risk breaking orbit. Rather then try a node I just burn using the prograde/retrograde markers which seem to be lined up correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EbDI3cC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EbDI3cC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI make a few more burns as the probe passes the PE/AP but they need to be short since it can\u0027t hold steady and thrust needs to be kept low. Once the PE is at 200 km I focus only on lowering the AP. Eventually I tried working on the pivot again and have some success in figuring out how to get it centered. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve got it perfect but it\u0027s closer enough that I can make more realistic burns without going too far off course. Once the orbit is nearly circular I start working on inclination which means keeping the orbit from going too far off in the process. Eventually I get down to a -21 degree inclination going in roughly the \u0027correct\u0027 direction (east to west). It should be possible for a ship to launch and meet with the asteroid without too much trouble. I\u0027ve still got some fuel but monopropellent is running short so I\u0027ll conserve what I have. The next mission will be a manned visit to see if I can extract some science. After that I\u0027ll send up some equipment to start prodding my pet asteroid and see what it can do (things like fuel transfer through the asteroid, if the processor works and if so does it consume \u0027material\u0027 and at what rate).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YD1RO5f.png\u0022 alt=\u0022YD1RO5f.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/042no4e.png\u0022 alt=\u0022042no4e.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlowerChild","CreatedById":74289,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-03T19:22:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust as a forewarning Dave, I know you prefer to avoid spoilers, but in this case it\u0027s an entirely out of game thing that may muck up your discovery process for no good in-game reason:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProcessing of the asteroid resources is the next thing I\u0027ll be working on.

This raises a number of questions I\u0027ll need to find the answers for later: could I have done the \u0027capture\u0027 experiment way out in deep space, is there a matching experiment (and result) for high space, and can it be done with a kerbal involved?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vj3ZN1s.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vj3ZN1s.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter 60 minutes the experiment is complete and I get 500 science! The experiment seems to be \u0027stored\u0027 in the asteroid but I can right click and use the \u0027transfer\u0027 to move it to the command pod. It also looks like it can be transmitted. With the results I detach from the asteroid (testing if the \u0027release\u0027 function on the grabber does what I expect) and then the grabber and fuel pump equipment are discarded before a reentry burn is made and the capsule seperates from the service module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lXpzwkV.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lXpzwkV.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Dn3J810.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Dn3J810.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe capsule performs normally during reentry. I turned off SAS but kept ready to use RCS to see that it was naturally stable.

Jam 1 can be seen here still attached to asteroid YSQ-213 with the discarded Kiwi grabber in the foreground and the Death Star in the background.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XGY1X5T.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XGY1X5T.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first step in this extended mission is to nudge YSQ back into high orbit. We don\u0027t need much, just \u0026gt;250 km to change the biome. Since I sort of figured out how to center the mass near the end of Jam 1\u0027s main mission I can fire the engines at low thrust and stay on target with only a small amount of input. There is enough fuel for everything I have planned (almost 200L) but RCS is low at 26 units and falling. RCS needs to be conserved so rotating the asteroid is done slowly, just a few puffs to get it moving and then let it rotate freely until it is pointing at my planned maneuver. Two burns bring the orbit up to ~260 km. I try to perform the capture experiment again but I\u0027m told the capture experiment can\u0027t be done right now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/51eWvmg.png\u0022 alt=\u002251eWvmg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s usually the message I get when an experiment is not in a suitable biome but there is one other possiblity, it could be that a manned pod is needed for the experiment. To determine that I do one more burn to lower my PE into low orbit again and when I pass below 250 km I try the experiment again - this time it starts just fine, proceeding until I come back into high orbit and it cancels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hAWgqhL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022hAWgqhL.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7tn9j7s.png\u0022 alt=\u00227tn9j7s.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now I think I know the parameters of the experiment - it can be performed by any ship under control, it must be performed in low Kerbin orbit and it takes 60 minutes after which I can transmit the result (500Mbit). The only thing I don\u0027t know is if it can be repeated on a second class A asteroid. Since this would allow for infinite science without showing any progression I \u003Cem\u003Ehighly \u003C/em\u003Edoubt FlowerChild would have allowed this. I think my time would be best spent looking at a class B asteroid to see if I get 500 science or if the science scales with size.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-09T20:59:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJam 2\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe goal of this mission is to grab the next type of asteroid, a class B. I\u0027ve assembled a new ship for this mission, one I hope I can reuse for most or all of the other asteroid capture missions. It\u0027s based on the Ham launcher so it\u0027s carrying a lot of fuel and power and I\u0027ve configured the top in such a way that if one of them is not enough to finish the job of pulling an asteroid into low orbit it can detach most of itself and let another take over. I found during the first mission that monopropellent was in short supply so not only is this one of the few ships I\u0027ve built that uses a large RCS tank, it\u0027s also designed so that the body of the ship can be discarded, leaving only the RCS tank and some RCS thrusters attached to the asteroid. This way if two ships are needed to capture an asteroid the first ship can at least continue contributing RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FWAUDOG.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FWAUDOG.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GEocY4O.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GEocY4O.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter launching the unmanned asteroid hunter into a parking orbit around Kerbin I went looking for a suitable asteroid. That search revealed some potential targets but also turned up something unexpected - a class C asteroid marked RJM-005 that would visit Kerbin in just over a month. Kerbin\u0027s astronomers have spotted a number of class C asteroids but this one was different from the others due to the course it was taking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gYyTPws.png\u0022 alt=\u0022gYyTPws.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith RJM projected to strike somewhere near the south pole action had to be taken. Jam 2\u0027s new primary mission is now to divert RJM from its collision course, with a secondary objective of capturing it safely. An outbound 937 m/s burn was calculated that would bring it within 100,000km of RJM in 21 days. I need to catch up quickly so I can\u0027t dip in and out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI lining up an approach. After the initial burn which used up the first 2 tanks several smaller burns where made over the next 15 hours of flight as it moved away from Kerbin toward deep space. These where designed to refine the approach, bringing it down to under 100 km. Exiting Kerbin\u0027s SOI doesn\u0027t alter that projection, however timewarping does seem to - 5 days from the asteroid I slow down and find my approach is now 3000 km off. A burn is made to bring it to within 900 km and at that point the probe begins to cancel out all but 25 m/s of the relative velocity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/i3UQQvP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022i3UQQvP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point a hard burn is made to flip around the relative velocity to 90 m/s but heading on a course that now brings it within 9 km in less then 20 minutes. There the velocity is canceled out again and another inward burn is made, to bring the probe along a course to within 100m of RJM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XeCQi5K.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XeCQi5K.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApproaching RJM I begin canceling out most of the remaining velocity. However I decide on a different approach then trying to line up a course toward it and juggle adding velocity to line up and braking to prevent to hard a collision. Instead I let the ship drift past the asteroid, in the below screenshot the ship is facing backwards, ready to break its remaining 3.6 m/s velocity relative to RJM. Doing it this way allows me to come to a halt just behind the asteroid, less then 100m away. This makes it much easier to make a slow and exact approach, since I am speeding up to catch it rather then trying to slow down while hitting it. This allows for a nice soft capture. I forgot to take mark of the mass before, but a rough estimate based on fuel puts the asteroids mass in the range of 130 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gsMPweo.png\u0022 alt=\u0022gsMPweo.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/V7i9u8t.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022V7i9u8t.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom here I need to line up the engines with the center of mass. By approach the asteroid like this I seem to have the target designators in a better way then before, making it easy to get it straight. I\u0027ve got enough power to turn the asteroid and the thrust vectoring from 4 engines works well to keep it on course. Altering the asteroid\u0027s path so that it passes 200km from the surface is easy at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/B7U78pX.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022B7U78pX.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArriving at Kerbin the drives are used again to bring RJM into a stable orbit around Kerbin. The fuel in the second set of tank is exhausted, which means 2 fewer engines and slightly less control. Since the asteroid is already in orbit I don\u0027t try to lower that orbit yet, I can wait until it passes around and plot an ideal burn. It will take almost 1000 m/s to put the asteroid into low orbit and I\u0027ve already burned 400 of that. With 3 engines the second burn will take 3 minutes but is still easily possible with the available fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ezSQbZw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ezSQbZw.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GxIf8il.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GxIf8il.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn stable low orbit the asteroid is captured for 1000 science which is beamed back. I can unlock the Science Jr again (completing the one tech 8 node I skipped). While 130 tons is obviously a growth over 8 tons I still think my improved Jam class ship will be enough to capture an E class, I just might need a second or maybe even third to help refine its orbit once captured so the science can be done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/B37tZw6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B37tZw6.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VULBVNp.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VULBVNp.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fmsW1yL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022fmsW1yL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
