While you technically can SSTO with a turbojet, you are about as well off with a SSTo rocket at that point, rapiers or nothing for now. The ideal ascent profile will get you to 10km fairly rapidly (45ish degree climb or whatever your craft is capable of), then level of, maximize speed while slowly climbing, and you will want to at a bare minimum be pulling 1500m/s and climbing at around 15 degrees before you kick in rocket mode/nuke/whatever your space engine of choice happens to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you nolonger benefit whatsoever from intake spam (a single ram intake per engine is overkill).

This is essentially LESS then 1.5 lift rating to 10t mass. Basically wings are useless unless you have a very bad TWR (and if that is the case you can pretty much forget going to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile im not happy with the fact that most of my SSTOs are dead, i have managed to adapt and create a few shorter range SSTOs in stock 1.0.2. For starters, you will want to have far higher TWR then you did before (0.90 days), and teh ONLY viable SSTO engine is the rapier. While you technically can SSTO with a turbojet, you are about as well off with a SSTo rocket at that point, rapiers or nothing for now. The ideal ascent profile will get you to 10km fairly rapidly (45ish degree climb or whatever your craft is capable of), then level of, maximize speed while slowly climbing, and you will want to at a bare minimum be pulling 1500m/s and climbing at around 15 degrees before you kick in rocket mode/nuke/whatever your space engine of choice happens to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you nolonger benefit whatsoever from intake spam (a single ram intake per engine is overkill).
