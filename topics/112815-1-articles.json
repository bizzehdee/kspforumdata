KSP won\u0027t be any different. But to speak to the OP question, games thrown on the mercy of dedicated modders to extend and support, rarely see code rewrites \u0026 modernization, with the same or better quality than the original team of developers could deliver. Whatever quality problems some see in KSP today: modders don\u0027t have access to KSP source code. Not having source code puts a limit on what can be fixed or extended. New content could be created, but as years go by, it would look increasingly dated."},{"CreatedByName":"mythbusters844","CreatedById":72313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T05:35:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E How is Unity 5 so critical?

It\u0027s already a huge success and has been a huge success for quite a long time. Yes, it can be better, but it was beating many full release games from major AAA studios while still in alpha.\n\nIt would be very foolish for Squad to reduce or stop their efforts while it\u0027s still making good sales numbers. Continuing to work on it helps stretch the long tail of sales revenue for it and may, with some luck and making the correct choices, generate future spikes in sales revenues if they come out with some well received major feature updates.\n\nLeaving it up to the mod community alone would be a terrible thing. Sure, that has allowed games from crappy developers to reach levels of success which were not deserved based on the developer\u0027s efforts, but it is absolutely never even a close replacement for an excellent developer continuing to drive the product forwards. The mod community does add value, but continued active development by Squad has the potential to add far more value.\n\nKSP\u0027s success will continue with or without ongoing effort from Squad past 1.0.3 and 1.1. The success should be far greater if they continue \u0022full steam ahead\u0022 for a good while longer, unless they get something horribly wrong."},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T23:17:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Minecraft has essentially stopped development and is still popular.\n\n It stopped development because Microsoft has monkeys in charge of MC now, they fired most of the original devs. And the popularity is declining, on many servers people are still quitting and giving out their passwords."}]}
