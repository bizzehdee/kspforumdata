If you launch when the northbound segment passes overhead (at its \u003Cem\u003Eascending node\u003C/em\u003E), you need to launch to a heading of 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0-desired_inclination plus a couple of degrees to account for Kerbin\u0027s eastward rotation. In this case that equates to a heading of about 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. This means you should lean your rocket toward the 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 mark on the horizon-line on the Navball as you ascend (not the 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 mark that indicates pitch.) If you launch when the southbound segment passes overhead (at its \u003Cem\u003Edescending node\u003C/em\u003E), you need to launch to a heading of 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0\u002Bdesired_inclination minus a couple of degrees. (You always make the correction for Kerbin\u0027s rotation toward 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0.)

Efficiency is good to keep the fuel requirement manageable but oopsies and tweaks are fine. Some adjustments are cheap to make and others are expensive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince KSC moves around the equator in time there are two times per rotation when KSC (and thus the rocket on the launch pad) passes through the plane of the target orbit. You don\u0027t have to launch at one of these two moments but it absolutely helps. If you can be in-plane from launch to final destination the whole time, life is easier and it takes less fuel overall. You can eyeball the situation by focusing on Kerbin and shifting the camera such that the target orbit collapses to a line. You\u0027re looking at the edge of the target orbit. Then you can warp ahead in time until KSC rotates under that line, either side is fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo these are the two launch times that are desired. The space craft leaves the pad co-planar to the target orbit. If the target orbit is inclined 60 degrees you want to launch on about a heading of 30 or 210. The idea is that launching east (90) is 0 degrees inclination increasing to the north (0) for 90 inclination. Going west (270) is 180 inclination and so on. In any case it should be clear to see that 60 degree inclination is a mixture of 2/3rd northward and 1/3rd eastward orbit. The whole confusion about heading and inclination is because the history of compasses is 000 is north increasing clockwise while in math/astronomy east is 000 and increases counterclockwise. Those jokers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe caveat to the above is there are two sides to every orbit and if you\u0027re using the #2 launch location you\u0027d have to go heading 210 off to pad to keep in plane.

Then the task is simply to burn prograde when you\u0027re on the opposite side of the \u0022Ap\u0022 of the target orbit. Prograde burning will inflate the opposite side of your orbit. Inflate your \u0022Ap\u0022 out to the target\u0027s \u0022Ap\u0022 and once out there inflate (or deflate) your \u0022Pe\u0022 to match the target orbit\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your circular orbit after launch isn\u0027t such a nice circle there are more adjustments. The only ideal would to have your \u0022Pe\u0022 post launch be exactly opposite of the target\u0027s \u0022Ap.\u0022 If it isn\u0027t some burning toward or away from Kerbin during your \u0022Ap inflation\u0022 will shift the resulting position of the \u0022Ap.\u0022 Any extra orbit size on the same side as that high target \u0022Ap\u0022 is absolutely fine because you\u0027re going to do that anyway.
