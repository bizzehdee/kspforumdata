To do things similar to the Herbst and Kulbit maneuvers, you need to build up a nice bit of level speed, turn off SAS, snap the nose vertical, cut your thrust to 0 while pushing your stick forward as soon as you\\\u0027re aiming straight up (counter-intuitive, I know, trust me on it though), this will snap force you into a Herbst-esque turn, like so:\n\n![MvLMc.png](http://i.imgur.com/MvLMc.png)\n\nTurn SAS on and crank throttle to 100% to complete this, or, pull your stick back again and you\\\u0027ll complete a very tight Kulbit-ish loop.
