If I am to send my experiment (e.g. materials deck on the mun) therefore getting 20%, if I manage to land back in kerbin do I get the extra 80% or is it lost forever?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-01T04:28:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs I understand it (somebody correct me if I\u0027m wrong), there is a certain amount of science points which can be derived from performing a specific action. Transmitting multiple reports will add little bits toward the maximum possible, and bringing home the whole scientic device will add a bigger chunk toward that total, but you don\u0027t lose anything by using one approach rather than another.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dwight_js","CreatedById":83255,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-01T06:13:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVanamonde has it correct. Each experiment has a max number of science points. You can either do a bunch of transmissions to get full points, or you can return a smaller number of samples to get the full points. Value is never lost forever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are changes coming in the next build. Some experiments will require samples to be returned to get full points.
