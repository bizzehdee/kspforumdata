It has to be in flight. I\u0027m not sure how you got that node to pop up for the ship that\u0027s on the launch pad, that shouldn\u0027t be possible (unless that\u0027s a MechJeb feature). So I\u0027m not sure what to tell you about the obit line after the node.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, regarding rendezvous to something in orbit straight from launch, my habit is to just eyeball the right time based on where the target ship (or station) is. For low Kerbin orbit, I usually launch when the target ship is passing over the continent to the west that kinda looks like India.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom there, well it just kinda depends on a lot of things, but mainly your twr and how quickly you can get to orbit. But honestly, I just eyeball it \u0022close enough\u0022 and if I end up behind my target, I circularize in a slightly lower orbit to catch up. If I\u0027m ahead, circularize in a slightly higher orbit, and let the target catch up to me. From then it\u0027s just another rendezvous using the nodes like normal.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helps.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ToukieToucan","CreatedById":150771,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-07T12:10:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave your AP a few thousand meters higher than the target vessel (Pe needs to be slightly lower than the target Pe) and after one orbit you will notice that the separation will become smaller and smaller each orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif you dont want to wait you can increase your AP so you need to travel further and will take longer to complete orbit (increase AP= Longer travel time = Less waiting for intersect for instance if your intersect is at 150 km and each orbit takes away 2 km you can take away more km with this method)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeware not to take to big leaps though or youll miss it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaking your AP smaller is the opposite\u00A0of\u00A0this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nanother technique I use (not sure if people use it) is lowering your Pe just a few thousand meter (2000 should be enough) then creating a maneuvre node on the Pe and pull the prograde marker till you get an interesect of 5 km, once the burn is preformed its just like a normal rendezvous but just a bit less effiecent but faster than the first technique.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-07T12:13:33Z\u0022 title=\u002202/07/2016 12:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by ToukieToucan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Evanitis","CreatedById":145424,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-07T13:05:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can target a craft by right clicking on it in map-view.
