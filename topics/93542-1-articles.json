It was a pretty simple station as far as the requirements go, the main challenge is you had to have space for 19 (!!!) Kerbals and it needed a processing lab -- I used 1x Mk1 landing can, 1x processing lab, and 4x hitchhiker storage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I built this large station so that I could fly it unmanned, sent it all the way to Duna (it cost somewhere around 200-250k funds). After I start my descent toward the surface from low orbit I realize that my transfer stage engines will not be enough to slow me down in the thin atmosphere, so I hope that my parachutes are good enough to finish the job -- but they aren\u0027t -- my station needed a couple more chutes at least. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had to reload from my quicksave a few times trying different descent tactics. The most useful change was to manually adjust the parachute deployment altitude for all of my parachutes to the maximum of 5000m. But even with this change, they still only slowed down my station to about 23m/s which made for a very loud bang upon landing. After the dust settled, I see the contract icon in the upper right of my screen flashing green with a (1) showing a mission success. Apparently enough of the station was still intact to get credit for the contract. I think the landing struts were the only parts to break.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mission had a payout of 1,200,000 funds -- well worth the adventure and challenge! These new contracts are a nice change and certainly make upgrading the KSC a lot easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"2001kraft","CreatedById":120475,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T16:46:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood job actually, when I attempted my base I made it completely differently.

Just a tip for next time, I suggest assembling the station @Duna, and not in Kerbin/Duna/VAB/SPH(?!!!). It is much easier to dock all the parts on the spot. Just make sure the docking ports and wheel height are all matching up. Other than that, noice. Also, can give a pic of the station?
