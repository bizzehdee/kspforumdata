I\u0027m considering doing another attempt at this with an Ion drive as the main ship, but the prototype I have up as over 380parts and is slugging my machine down a lot, and that\u0027s without the launch booster! I\u0027m assuming a modded fuel tank to hold Xenon rather than tons of the tiny Xenon tanks is OK as long as the proportions of the fuel is right relative to stock?

It\u0027s true when you have an absolutely stock-alike nuke engine but much shorter/smaller, or when you don\u0027t have to bring 100 ion fuel/engine, but only 1 big of each. Or 10/10 of the big ones and you have an extremely good main drive, much efficient than nukes! So, this gives you advantage. So, think of ion engines as a very new engine still under developement and those are the maximum sizes what engineers can do without an explosion. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...So yes, going with a reasonable part number is part of the challenge too... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E BTW your lander(s) should be very small or your main ion engines would take years to take you to Jool and back...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut I have made a Mixed Solutions category too for those who don\u0027t want to follow the rules exactly, or want to use mods heavily!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ziv","CreatedById":91995,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-16T11:33:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECmdr.
