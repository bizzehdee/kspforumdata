Concurrent missions (especially once you go inter-planetary, where missions last months....) will force you to have more than one crew.

Quite expensive to change your Duna ground base crew on a regular basis in career mode. It makes the game more fun and challenging, but it doesnt need a game mechanic in my opinion. Being forced to do things isnt the way KSP works.\n\nAnd i have always two complete lightly experienced crews standing by."},{"CreatedByName":"Rolanvorxariat","CreatedById":117146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T04:33:40Z","Content":"That, my friend, is why i have space stations. i pick crew out of name favoritism, lice Corbrett and Desbrett (Female kerbal versions of Scott and Mark Kelley), who i made the same using tecturereplacer, and Shepke Kerman, who was a good engineer for the KKKP spacce agency. I roleplay, so i have self-imposed rules on the limits on how much time a kerbal spends in space, and the minimum time they spend on the ground (Press conferences, training, family time, etc.).

This has nothing to do with effeciency but all with \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4your jazz\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4, as someone here has put it. You can send out Jeb, Bill and Bob -back-to-back- and noone else for everything you do in the game. When they are currently going to Duna, and you want to visit say Eve next, there is no reason not to wait for their return and send them right off again, afterwards, for the next long-term mission (launching windows provided - and there will be one coming up after their arrival - guranteed. It\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s just a matter of how much extra warping you do). How much time you warp through for doing this has no consequence in any way.\n\nEDIT: And yes: Offtime is irrelevant, if time passes for nothing else, either, except orbits, which repeat, by defintion. That changes a great deal though, if other stuff would be affecrted by time, too. Go figure: Time (as space) only matters as a relation - and that takes two. If you only have one object, there is no point in assigning any location to it. As is with time - if you only have one thing fall through it, it is meaningless. Add another, and bam.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-26T16:19:47Z\u0022 title=\u002203/26/2015 04:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mr. Scruffy**"}]}
