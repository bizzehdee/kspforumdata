When the contract expired it said that poor Svetlana was lost, but she remained in her seat quite happily until I returned it to Kerbin, at which point she was quickly swept away by the Continuity Police never to be seen again."},{"CreatedByName":"MaxwellsDemon","CreatedById":147660,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T13:32:58Z","Content":"I have killed zero (net result).\n\nBy \u0022net result\u0022 I mean that there was one mission where I splashed down with a Hitchhiker can underneath my command pod, and only the pod was recovered-- the occupants of the can were classed as Missing.
