No other mods are installed, and I\u0027m running under Windows 7 64-bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost often the docking autopilot fails to dock. I have tried using the SmartASS docking method, and this also fails in an unusual way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happens is that I will be closing on the docking port, and as I get very close (\u0026lt;10M?) the ship (station) I am trying to dock to will start to roll away from the approaching ship. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen these issues are happening I also notice that my Ap. Pa. orbit markers are not stable. The orbit markers will rapidly jump forwards and backwards along the orbit line. When the game is in this state it becomes very difficult to manually set a maneuver point, and the prograde / retrograde symbols on the navball with also jump around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am fairly new to the game. Is this a know issue, or am I screwing things up somehow?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
