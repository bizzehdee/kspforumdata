I love that game, the port was complete garbage, and thus\u00A0everyone still runs the superior deluxe version which is almost a decade older. You don\u0027t see me trying to\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E defend\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E some scheme because the company behind it made a good game one time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is almost unprecedented in console gaming, afaic with the scope and extent that\u00A0this game remains\u00A0unfinished,\u00A0while\u00A0having\u00A0been approved for commercial sale on console. This is fine on PC where people can cope with/work around a\u00A0type of game which is never designed to be complete. Though now\u00A0I expect this will become the norm on consoles in the years to come, which is an unbelievable turn of events in my opinion. Had the game been polished, and I mean completely polished, a period and process which has never taken\u00A0for KSP (in favor of constant features)\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eprior\u003C/em\u003E to the console release, this would be a completely different story. It\u0027ll probably never happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCompound that with the absent mapping features, the current state of wheels, and the inability to invert flight in a flying game, corrupting save files,\u00A0and you have a story that can\u0027t end well. Not to mention what as has been previously outlined, the update process for the console versions is going to be night and day compared to the short pipeline for\u00A0the pc version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-end rant-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI used the word \u0022haters\u0022 with quotes. When I said haters, I didn\u0027t mean the people who where upset about the ports and giving their feedback, I meant the ones who were really upset and throwing their hate at the game, along with the vulgarity that goes with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP is an ever-ongoing development game. It\u0027s a scheme that is indeed mostly found in PC gaming, and as a matter of fact KSP is a PC game in a lot of aspects. I\u0027m not going to start debating about the reasoning behind the console ports but they are there, as they stand, and our opinion will not change that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really like KSP, and I want people to like KSP. This is why I\u0027ve been \u0022defending\u0022 the ports so far, so that people take the time to do bug reports and get willing to wait for the major issues to be fixed (it\u0027s the same reason that makes me want a console demo). KSP, as a PC game, will never reach on console\u00A0the state it has\u00A0on its native platform; but that does not prevent\u00A0the game from being at least good. I\u0027m not saying it\u0027s going to happen, I have no idea about what will happen in the future for the console versions. I\u0027m just giving it a chance, and right now, I\u0027d say I have 1/2 chances of being right giving it a chance. I\u0027m not telling people that the ports are great because they aren\u0027t, they might get better in the future, or not, I\u0027m just being optimistic on that subject.\u00A0(Of course, as I do not play KSP on console, my opinion is biaised)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d enjoy continuing discussing this, but we are seriously getting off topic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-18T22:39:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222681041\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022143995\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221468849144\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022126740\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gaarst\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, Gaarst said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow.
