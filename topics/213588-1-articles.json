So when you all talk about Delta V in the second half of the burn being easier due to less mass, or the efficiencies of burning prograde and not pointing to target or pointing to target and using\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cabbr style=\u0022border-bottom:none;\u0022 title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003Ehold, I\u0027ll just smile and nod. I understand the concept of what you\u0027re saying, but not the math involved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\nI know how to get to the Mun without using manoeuvre nodes, how to get into an orbit (in transit) if my periapsis is too low and how to circularise an orbit without them too. Getting an orbital encounter I can do in KSP1 - with nodes, not without...not so great in KSP2 in part because of the node system and it\u0027s \u0022intuitiveness\u0022. But that\u0027s not the point - the point is the manoeuvre node is supposed to correctly and accurately calculate these things for me way better than I ever could.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\nI like the fact that the nodes now tell me when to burn, and grab my attention in some way just prior to the burn however, as it stands, every burn I make \u0022trusting the node\u0022 is wrong and I have to fix it manually using what little I know of orbital mechanics. Even getting a circular orbit in KSP2 - starting the node from apoapsis, or even before it - is difficult. I have to make significant correction burns if my intent is for a circular orbit - otherwise I generally just burn out of orbit from whatever kind of orbit I\u0027m in to get where I\u0027m going. \u0022Brute force it\u0022, so to speak.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\nWhat I would like is if the node was \u0022intuitive\u0022 enough to figure out I\u0027m trying to burn for Mun (or any planet) periapsis, or get into/circularise an orbit, or intercept/encounter a target and apply some sort formula to compensate when calculating the burn based on the parameters I\u0027ve set when planning my node - so I don\u0027t need to figure out how many seconds three minutes and 49 seconds), what half of that is and then subsequently realise I\u0027ve missed the start of the burn because I was too slow with my calculations and there\u0027s nothing grabbing my attention to start said burn (in KSP1) - and in what direction to burn in order to make the burn I planned work as I intended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\nWhat I would also like to see is, potentially in the right click radial menu of the node, a button for calculating an orbital circularisation burn based on the current/intended apoapsis (as we all do this A LOT, so this will save us a lot of time) and a button for calculating an intercept of the target (something else we\u0027ll be doing a lot of, I imagine) be that a ship or a celestial body - and if it can\u0027t get us a perfect intercept/encounter, it gets us close enough to whatever we\u0027re trying to get close to so we can do a mid-course correction burn to get us even closer, rinse repeat until intercept/encounter).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\nI would also like to see a way to manually input our desired apo/peri either in our current or desired orbit (at the desired target) and have the manoeuvre node calculate a burn to accommodate that for us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\nIn \u0022campaign mode\u0022, these options would be later-game but in EA sandbox (i.e. what we have currently) they could be implemented and fine-tuned so that come v1.0 release we\u0027re all singing off the same sheet of music. It doesn\u0027t have to be perfect (or perhaps, \u0027perfect\u0027 course plots can be another upgrade) it just needs to get us in the ballpark so we can course correct or establish an elliptical orbit or whatever our plan is for where ever we\u0027re intending to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\nIn KSP2, I feel that automation of the more common navigational manoeuvres should have \u0022quick access\u0022 (circularise, intercept - as this would also cover interplanetary insertion burns) buttons in the manoeuvre node. I also feel that automation of the more repetitive tasks (such as getting a ship into orbit, and/or circularising an orbit, and docking) could (or perhaps as a selectable option, should) be a thing the devs prioritise - especially to make the game more accessible and especially when we have colonies and resource gathering to worry about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\nExample 1: You\u0027ve been manually launching rockets for 20 hours - but since you\u0027ve upgraded to the Level 3 Tracking Station, here\u0027s a series of buttons to help you automatically launch your craft, circularise its orbit and, if need be, calculate an intercept of a designated orbital target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\nExample 2: You\u0027ve been building ships module by module in orbit with varying degrees of success (if you can get the nodes to work for you) for the last 50 hours - but since you\u0027ve upgraded to the Level 4 Tracking Station, here\u0027s a button that will \u0027auto-dock\u0027 you - right way up, every time - to your target, provided you\u0027re within 1000m and your velocity relative to target is 0 m/s. No more twisted, misaligned modules from now on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\nExample 3: You\u0027ve gone to Debdeb and back, six times, and docked landers to your orbiting ships 9,700 times in your 120 hours of KSP2 - but since you\u0027ve upgraded to the Level 5 Tracking Station here\u0027s a button that calculates the intercept of a celestial body and more accurately calculates orbital intercepts from the ground - and also plots the trajectory of an interstellar burn. Good job, you\u0027ve earned it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\nDoes that make it \u0022too easy\u0022? In Sandbox, yeah maybe. But if you wanted the challenge, you\u0027d be playing a career mode.\u00A0And if you\u0027re playing career mode, after doing the same thing a billion times (like you do in career mode), a more efficient way of doing it would be appreciated. You\u0027d obviously have to \u0022do the hard yards\u0022 to earn (and therefore deserve) them by the time you\u0027ve reached the late game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\nPlus, these are/could be optional, with the unchecking of a box in the Settings menu you can still do these things manually either as good as, or perhaps even better than, the nodes can. But they\u0027re there to help players and reduce the micromanagement and monotony of constant launches, orbits and trans-planetary insertion burns and whatever else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\nBut for any of that, we need this manoeuvre node thing looked at because as it stands right now, I\u0027d much rather \u0022do things manually\u0022 (yes, I\u0027m aware MechJeb is a thing) in KSP1 than deal with whatever the hell is going on with KSP2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-27T19:36:56Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2023 07:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Cailean_556\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
