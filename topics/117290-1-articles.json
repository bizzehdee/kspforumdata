The problem is, this works only with the left shift key, which is also the throttle up key. So the scenario is, i\u0027m happily orbiting, want to see the map, shift\u002Btab to scroll back the map focus and, unwantedly, the engine burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan the shift\u002Btab key binding be changed? Ideally to right shift\u002Btab?

I was unaware the SHIFT key acted as a modifier on that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings to be aware of: This is probably low-ish priority since the navball is hidden by default in map view (but you make a compelling point). Also, the backspace key auto-focuses the active vessel (and double clicking on a planet focuses it, but you probably knew that one).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dronkit","CreatedById":67237,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T01:34:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReally? hiding the navball in map view prevents the ship from throttling?
