I envy you! But how did you get that ramp in there? Single use decoupled? The cargo bay door would actually be quite easy to do, BTW and you could get one in there swinging upwards pretty easily. Just build it from the \u0022lock\u0022 (a docking port on the end of the floor of the cargo bay) upwards to where the \u0022hinge\u0022 (the Klaw) is, and the fiddle with the position until it insta-grabs when you undock the port. It helps \u003Cem\u003Ea lot\u003C/em\u003E to put a strut between the door and the plane somewhere near the Klaw so that gravity doesn\u0027t screw with your alignments. Afterwards, door operation is as simple as pivot on/off and some hidden engines (RCS works beautifully) to rise/lower it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
