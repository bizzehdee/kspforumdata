The craft disappeared before exploding inside Kerbin. I reverted back and tried again. When it asks me for the orbital elevation, I usually put in zero and let it set the minimum orbital value, but this time it let me keep it at zero. This resulted in it simply\u00A0floating off of Kerbin\u0027s surface with no view of the ship and no orbital map view either. I tried this a second time (same results) but when I went back to revert and try a third time, the gray screen with all of the buttons to go to the tracking station, revert, save, etc. (can\u0027t think of the name)\u00A0won\u0027t open. I can\u0027t move either and I\u0027m just stuck in space. Is it okay to shut down my computer? I spent a lot of time on the craft so hopefully it has saved,\u00A0 but I don\u0027t know about the game itself.

Obviously that was not what they meant to do, as it results in what you just described. It was corrected in 1.12.2 - you could upgrade to that, or just disable it in the cheat orbit window (remove the checkmark).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aloysious Tasch","CreatedById":213827,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-16T23:46:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you all for your help.
