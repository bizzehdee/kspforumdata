But MANY do not. Many that make amazing constructions in KSP 1, just don\u0027t have a system that can meet that minimum requirement. Not many people have 20xx series cards. Let alone 30xx or 40xx series cards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy? Simple. Those cards cost a lot of money.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoney is the one thing that basically nobody has right now, because we\u0027re spending it all trying to pay for food and fuel to keep a car running so we can go get food and get to our jobs.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA fancy GPU is in the economic goods category of \u0022luxury goods\u0022.

Or a VR headset, gold watch, diamond ring, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of it is stuff that you don\u0027t technically need to live a happy and healthy life. And right now, people are re-prioritizing their spending to focus on \u0022needs\u0022 over \u0022wants\u0022, because of the state of the economy and the continuing shortages of things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally a game that needs an RTX 3080 to run at 1440p... isn\u0027t by necessity a modern game. Look at New World and what it was doing to 3090 cards (it was melting them) simply because of something like the main menu not having a sane framerate cap on it (so the card would just crank out frames needlessly as fast as it possibly could, and I mean thousands of them per second as the main menu is a simple thing to render, and that\u0027s even if you had vsync on which theoretically SHOULD stop that). That and many other things wrong with that game basically killed it and now you never hear anyone talking about it on videos that get lots of views.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t want that to happen to KSP 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think most people would accept it as fact (or a very small logical leap from facts) that the pandemic put a freeze on not just video game development but also the budget people have for upgrading their PC\u0027s.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat means that even a 2060 makes these system requirements seem a bit... out of touch with reality (and I mean that as in \u0022as out of touch with reality as the head of the now bankrupt PC building company \u0022Artesain builds\u0022 was).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reality is that this game isn\u0027t being released initially on PS5 and Xbox series S|X.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe reality is that most of us are stuck with 5-7\u002B year old machines, and the GPU shortages didn\u0027t matter to the majority of us because none of us could afford those \u0022new but you can\u0027t have them because they\u0027re sold out\u0022 GPUs were still far too expensive even AT MSRP, regardless of whatever the prices had become due to rampant scalping and just high demand but low supply.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m not coming in here with nothing but complaints tho. I have solutions.\u003Cbr\u003E\nGet a system that has a GTX 1080 in it but meets the CPU requirements. And see if it gives good enough performance at 1080p and 1440p.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf that doesn\u0027t work, bump the resolution down to 900p or even 720p.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI started playing KSP on a 900p LCD screen way back when, and those are still very affordable (and you can even get reasonably sized very high refresh rate panels at that resolution for not a lot of money, probably).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a 4k 144hz monitor. I\u0027m not expecting KSP2 to be able to run at that resolution with just my RTX 3070 Ti. I\u0027m no fool.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut even if no optimizations are made, further testing with even lower spec hardware configurations needs to be done simply to prevent people from panicking and swearing that they\u0027ll never afford hardware that can reliably play the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS5 and XBox Series S|X aren\u0027t even \u0022cheap\u0022 consoles like the PS4 and XBox One were.
