Depends on a lot of criteria: ISP of the engine, its weight, how you stage those (asparagus is a prime example of this: your rocket as-is, or your rocket \u002B some fuel \u002B some engines, then as-is: you keep the deltaV for the central part after staging, but have a different one for the whole).

If your final Pe Kick raises your Ap to the Mun, that\u0027s still an orbital period of just six hours or so (or is it 12? I forget). Your earlier kicks will result in orbits of no more than an hour or so.

You\u0027re doubling your thrust, as you note. It\u0027s when you start adding more engines that diminishing returns really start to kick in... You need four for the next doubling of thrust, then eight, then sixteen... it rapidly becomes counterproductive, especially when you consider all the extra mass in support structures to hold those engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-06T15:07:42Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2013 03:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by RoboRay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Neomatt","CreatedById":30294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T15:01:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so in this case, it\u0027s the Rocket Equation (from Tsiokovsky): deltaV = Isp of your rocket x 9.8m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 x ln (mass at the beginning/mass at the end).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AfailingHORSE","CreatedById":57657,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T15:04:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIm pretty sure you just really need to go through physics 1 and remember it for this question (I only remember that F=M*A), not a math degree\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
