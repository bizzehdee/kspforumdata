Let\u0027s look at everything that was guessed so far, broken into 2 categories:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E **USI Kolonization Systems** - Bigger than Asteroid mining. Also, this doesn\u0027t sound like a parts-only pack.\n\u003E \n\u003E **Karbonite** - Bigger than Asteroid mining. A superset of it\n\u003E \n\u003E **Karbonite Plus** - Bigger than Asteroid mining.\n\u003E \n\u003E **Freight Transport Technologies** - I have no knowledge of this.\n\u003E \n\u003E **Asteroid Recycling Technologies** - Bigger than Asteroid mining. Well, the same size at least ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E **USI Exploration Pack** - I don\u0027t know this either.\n\u003E \n\u003E **USI Survivability Pack** - Again don\u0027t know it.\n\u003E \n\u003E **Alcubierre Warp Drive** - Never going to happen in stock. I suppose it fits the rest of the criteria though.\n\u003E \n\u003E **Sounding Rockets** - Not sure what coding hooks would be needed for these (which is why I don\u0027t think it\u0027ll be a parts-only pack)\n\u003E \n\u003E **proper navigation lights** - I don\u0027t know what this is so can\u0027t judge on it.\n\u003E \n\u003E **clouds** Keep dreaming.\n\u003E \n\u003E **magic boulder** ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E **light grid** I like this idea but ...

Do you mean making the parts more survivable, or the heat? ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) In any case I can\u0027t see this being it, as that would be part of the whole rebalance that is going to make 1.0.3 take so long. I doubt they\u0027re hire out for that.\n\u003E \n\u003E **changing the re-entry sound effect** Not a coder\u0027s job.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E **pipes for transferring resources between crafts and bases** - This seems to fit the criteria.\n\u003E \n\u003E **landing site approximation a la trajectories** - This could fit the criteria, though what coding hooks would modders need for it?\n\u003E \n\u003E **radiators or some other kind of active heat management** This technically fits, but isn\u0027t all the code for this already in the game? All that\u0027s missing is the parts, and I already ruled out parts only packs.\n\u003E \n\u003E **new rover wheels / Folding/Retractable rover wheels** This sounds pretty good and fits the criteria, but is there anything particularly new here? We have things that fold out, and we have wheels. Marrying the two is new but would it require code that would need hooks for modders?\n\u003E \n\u003E **KSC is now highlighted from space** Cool, and I suppose possible. Maybe something a bit more general like the Waypoints Plus mod?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nOut of the 5 MAYBEs above, I am leaning toward the first in my list.
