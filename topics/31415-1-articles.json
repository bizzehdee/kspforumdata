Played the demo and didn\u0027t think twice about buying right then and there. Now like many of you, I am completely addicted to this game. Rather than list what I\u0027ve managed to do in the game over the last 3\u002B weeks (there\u0027s plenty of other threads for that!), I decided to list a few of the things I\u0027ve neglected or stopped doing since this game came into my life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Stopped playing Xbox - My beloved gaming console hasn\u0027t been turned on since achieving my first liftoff. Previously, no more than 3 days would pass between gaming sessions and that would only happen if I went away for the weekend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Stopped keeping up on current events - Sorry CNN, unless you have breaking news on a new mod or a new tutorial posted on youtube I\u0027m really not interested.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Stopped watching my favorite sports - Yea, the Yankee game is on, but it\u0027s really only background noise. No interest in NBA or NHL playoffs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Stopped painting my Warhammer 40k minis - Just got into this very expensive hobby about a year ago and managed to do a little painting every weekend even if just for an hour or two. It was a stress relief. Now my minis collect dust, while I stress over why my rocket is blowing up at 40k meters with no relief until many hours of design and testing finally gets my rocket into a stable orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Stopped checking Steam for specials - Was a daily habit. Now...? Why bother. Not gonna be playing anything new anytime soon. Took me 2 weeks just to get to both of Kerbins moons and back in one piece. I\u0027m just getting started with this game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did manage to still feed my pets, so I guess I haven\u0027t neglected everything I love. So with that, please share your stories of how KSP has replaced any of your daily habits or other things you love.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bloodbunny","CreatedById":67274,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-05T01:42:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI quit playing Minecraft the day I got this game in April.
