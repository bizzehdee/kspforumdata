So long as there are no SOI changes the process is simple. SOI changes make it only slightly harder. Just use energy. Eg = mgh and Ek = 1/2 mv^2. hover over a point on the orbit and it would give you altitude. From that and your current altitude and velocity the new velocity could be calculated. SOI changes require iteration at the point where the change occurs but is still doable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T15:08:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Orbit class should already handle all of that, you just need to create a display.
