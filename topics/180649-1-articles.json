But maybe you can do this even with a pod...\u003Cbr\u003E\nProbably you have already realized this, but every time the lab\u00B4s got some free space (after a few days in research),\u00A0 you can \u0022review\u0022 the experiments in the container/pod and cycle between them, one by one. So you can chose which ones you want to sendo into the lab and still keep the others. If you have the experiments in your ship, you\u00B4ll be able to add the results to the lab even if you have already sent them back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, as long as you\u00B4re able to run them again.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut I believe you can\u00B4t send just one or a few specific from one part to another. Still, there is a mod from DMagic which allows you to chose WHERE you want to transmit your science to, whether a vessel or the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.
