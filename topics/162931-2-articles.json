Each of the strap-on boosters would be fitted with a single tailfin for passive aerodynamic stability and roll cancellation\u00A0on ascent, and they could be differentially throttled for yaw and pitch control. All would ignite and fire at full throttle on the pad, but the core would throttle down shortly before Max-Q and remain throttled down until booster burnout (similar to a Delta IV Heavy). At booster burnout, they would separate and the core would be throttled back up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe payload could be fitted with a simple HTP monoprop \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E system, providing guidance for the core during the terminal portion of the burn.

Napalm is, of course, much closer to a liquid than to a solid, so the main problem is making sure the fuel stays inside the chamber.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not an insurmountable problem -- after all, we\u0027re just designing, not building, so we can skip over some of the engineering challenges. But we do need to make sure we have a viable approach. It might be worth proposing/investigating some alternate shapes that would ensure combustion pressure keeps the fuel inside rather than forcing it out (e.g., blurring the line between a hybrid engine and a pressure-fed liquid engine). The traditional cylindrical fuel casting has some advantages, like thermally insulating the motor casing, so those issues would need to be considered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, here\u0027s a possibility:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022hybrid-liquid.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://s16.postimg.org/uo02pxzbp/hybrid-liquid.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this design, the pressurant (which could be liquid nitrogen, as shown here, or even really high-pressure air for additional oxidization potential) and the HTP tank are stacked inside the motor where you\u0027d typically have the combustion area. A large lower valve on the pressurant tank forces the HTP down, through a catalyst bed, while a smaller\u00A0upper valve produces head pressure on the napalm. In this way, the napalm column burns from the bottom, but undergoes plastic deformation and flow under head pressure and acceleration, so that the burn surface remains at the same point, and combustion pressures prevent it from flowing out the nozzle. So it\u0027s basically a pressure-fed liquid bipropellant rocket, but with the fuel being stored and \u0022injected\u0022 in gel phase rather than in liquid phase.

The idea is that when its time for separation, the \u0022claw\u0022 opens, releasing the booster. This allows the spring to push the spent booster away from the center core.
