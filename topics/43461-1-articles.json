And some of those parts are collapsed into like groups of 4 or 2 or whatever? okay well lets say some parts are in the wrong order, so you go to rearrange and every dam time you want to move a group of 4 parts you have to click it once to expand it into a giant useless column that clouds your vision before you click again and hold to drag it somewhere else. It is completely useless to me to expand it in order move it. I know what it is and its about 1000059348793486794 times easier if you could just move it without expanding the group of 8 parts into a massive screen hogging column. I can\u0027t express my annoyance and hate for this enough. I\u0027M LITERALLY GOING INSANE TRYING TO PUT THINGS IN THE RIGHT ORDER WHEN IT\u0027S ALL EXPANDED AND HARD TO SEE. Please I made an account on here just to tell you, I checked before I posted but I didn\u0027t see anyone else with this same frustration. Its a massive ui flaw to me as I always rearrange the staging stuff so please for the love of god fix this or something or anything cause i\u0027m going to go absolutely crazy if I have to expand one more gdam thing oh my god.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-22T16:01:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst off you might want to settle down a bit.
