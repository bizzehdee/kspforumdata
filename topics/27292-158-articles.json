I launched another space station the other night, a 700-part station (871 tons) sitting on an 800-part heavy lifter (11848 tons at launch). That station is now in a polar orbit over Eve. Before ditching the booster, every second of in-game time would take about ten seconds of real time; after separation, the ratio dropped to about 4:1. This made the really long burns to and around Eve very time-consuming, and rotating the station between burns took forever, but I dealt with it by just doing something else for a half-hour each time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I don\u0027t really NEED a large station around Eve, since I\u0027ve already got a couple smaller fuel depots there.
