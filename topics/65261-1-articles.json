This is my first post here. Anyway, I downloaded the spherical and toroidal fuel tank pack. I am using the .23 version. I am also using the recommended modular fuel plug. When I right click on the spherical tank to bring up the fuel tank data window there is no response. I have looked all over google and this forum for answers and I can\u0027t find any. This is really bumming me out. Has anyone else encountered this problem? If so, did you find a way to resolve it? Or did you just give up on the mod?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedCowboy","CreatedById":92106,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-09T06:12:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m surprised no one has responded to your thread.
