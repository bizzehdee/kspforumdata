But when i tried that, the target, still in front of me, moved away from me again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had to stay around 940 m/s the whole time, making maneuvering on the navball almost impossible. I could get close to the target, but i could not rely on the navball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know the value on the navball is always positive, i have been using this for all those succesful attempts and i never ran into these high velocity values.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-03T11:55:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre your and your targets orbit in the same plane?
