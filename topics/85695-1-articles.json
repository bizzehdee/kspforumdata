I had the good fortune to see a total solar eclipse about 15 years ago and it was such an amazing experience that I\u0027d love to see another one. Everything went quiet during totality. The street lights came on, the birds stopped singing. It was kind of creepy actually. And I remember there being a lot of towering cu\u0027s around. Watching the edge of the moon\u0027s shadow approach at thousands of kilometers per hour from off in the distance at the end of totality (we could see it coming from the light reflected on the CB\u0027s in the distance) made me feel the smallest and most insignificant that I have ever felt.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-08T21:44:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere are some of my best photos from last night.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/10403058_777378302308132_4670989431430849045_n.jpg?oh=60dcec2d5f463e62698f0242656478e2\u0026amp;oe=54C89EEE\u0026amp;__gda__=1421516976_ff4b312945ff960becff53b186aa0ba6\u0022 alt=\u002210403058_777378302308132_4670989431430849045_n.jpg?oh=60dcec2d5f463e62698f0242656478e2\u0026amp;oe=54C89EEE\u0026amp;__gda__=1421516976_ff4b312945ff960becff53b186aa0ba6\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfa1/v/t1.0-9/10704078_777431268969502_6588079269270445837_n.jpg?oh=a86a4f5bb480be6eaaadbd935c0bf873\u0026amp;oe=54C84661\u0026amp;__gda__=1422194263_3edd9e8d0338b536fe62921a52dc8bed\u0022 alt=\u002210704078_777431268969502_6588079269270445837_n.jpg?oh=a86a4f5bb480be6eaaadbd935c0bf873\u0026amp;oe=54C84661\u0026amp;__gda__=1422194263_3edd9e8d0338b536fe62921a52dc8bed\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/1939809_777404522305510_6882794175987511814_n.jpg?oh=2019d7d5c2e43af5c0669235e274456d\u0026amp;oe=54B9C8BE\u0026amp;__gda__=1425565801_98b99685b9ec26a63571dc62d4a2b3ae\u0022 alt=\u00221939809_777404522305510_6882794175987511814_n.jpg?oh=2019d7d5c2e43af5c0669235e274456d\u0026amp;oe=54B9C8BE\u0026amp;__gda__=1425565801_98b99685b9ec26a63571dc62d4a2b3ae\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was cloudy most of the time, apart from this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aethon","CreatedById":110755,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T01:06:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice Tw1.
