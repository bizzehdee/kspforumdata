Doing that for solar panels can be hard though - the power they generate is sensitive to spacecraft orientation (I\u0027m particularly looking at you, OX-STATs), distance to the sun and whether or not Kerbin is in the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnergy use would have to be broken down - most non-probe craft use next to nothing sitting still, but if you\u0027re running five ion drives while simultaneously using reaction wheels, processing a lab specimen, leaving the lights on, broadcasting science and microwaving a burrito you\u0027re going to get massively different numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"2001kraft","CreatedById":120475,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-17T18:29:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewell, for example the electricity output can be simply calculated as in the best condition, e.g. 45/sec for the OX-STATs. That should make life easier. As of the usage thing, well that\u0027s more complicated. Since most parts have a specific number of what they need to run, like the Stayputnik needs 2/sec electrocharge or whatever it needs, the resource taking can be added up by using simple calculator mechanics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Stayputnik needs 2/sec\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The lights in Mk.2 pax fuselage consume .5/sec\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.
