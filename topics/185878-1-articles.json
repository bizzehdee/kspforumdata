By this I mean, when you are texturing, to get the best looks, do you use images like a collage? and what techniques do you use to make the textures look more realistic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerboNerd","CreatedById":195433,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-07T12:46:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the \u0022realism\u0022 i prefer over-usage of normal maps. I usually use normals for panels, bolts and windows. Just make a plain black thicc line and you\u0027ll get a groove there after you import the image into xNormal or any normal generator. After that, you export the image with the normals and import into unity with a bumped shader.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d rather not take example from me mostly because my texturing is nowhere great. I aid that with bunch of normals and i wouldn\u0027t suggest to do so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
