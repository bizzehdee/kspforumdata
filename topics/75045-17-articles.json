I\u0027ve demonstrated in various other threads that the whole project is not viable economically because the demand is simply not there and their budget estimates are bogus. As for the technology, all REL\u0027s promises are based on the most optimistic figures for each of the components, none of which have been developed into engineering prototypes, let alone tested to see if those figures make any sense. There is zero margin in their design and they are practically reinventing the wheel in just about every area of aerospace design. If any single one of those unproven components ends up being too heavy or underperforms in any way (which they always do when you get to real-world engineering), then payload capacity is reduced and the whole project is no longer viable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf major EU governments suddenly had a revelation tomorrow that SSTO spaceplanes are a major industrial priority, if ESA magically provides funding for billions of euros, if Airbus or BAE Systems got on board if all the unproven technology was properly developed and performs exactly as planned, if there are no budget overruns or performance loss (which is impossible), and if someone invents a new application that actually requires frequent unmanned launches to LEO, then maybe it could fly in 10 to 15 years.
