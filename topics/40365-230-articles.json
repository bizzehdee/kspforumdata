However, there have been real-life proposals to use LOX-augmented NTRs to have significantly greater thrust at an expense of lower ISP. The theory is to take oxidizer and pump it into the nozzle just after the reactor where it combusts with the super-heated fuel, similar to how an afterburner works. A lot of papers on the subject are behind paywalls, but I found \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24372729_Nuclear_Thermal_Rocket_(NTR)_Propulsion_with_a_Kick_The_LOX-Augmented_NTR_Concept\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ean abstract for one paper\u003C/a\u003E that claimed a 440% thrust output with a 45% ISP compared to standard NTRs, very similar to the performance of LFO mode in KSPI thermal rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell i understood the concept, but for some reason game (engineer redux) shows it opposite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst i drained tank from oxidiser in vab (it woudl be dead weight and reduxe delta v) and set nozzle to Liquid consumption.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/P24WB8K.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022P24WB8K.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThan full tank of liquid and ox and nozzle set to LOX\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jP2ZL9o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jP2ZL9o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn first case nozzle shows roughly twice as ISP in comparision to second, but delta v is lesser by 500 m/s for some reason.
