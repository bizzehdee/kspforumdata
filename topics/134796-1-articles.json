For the record I have manually launched the same rockets and gotten them into orbit with little to no issue.

Also, keep your SLT (sea level thrust-to-weight) above 1, but not too far above 1. The autopilot has a feature to limit the throttle of liquid thrusters, or you can limit the thrust of both liquid and solid rockets when you\u0027re in the VAB. Air resistance is the most difficult part of getting to orbit (well, after you figure out a way to create a controlled directional explosion that\u0027s sustainable for several minutes and can be turned on and off at will, but in this game that\u0027s a given really), and the best way of making sure air resistance doesn\u0027t cause problems is to have as low a thrust as you possibly can when\u00A0in\u00A0an atmosphere whilst still allowing your rocket to accelerate. Personally I find it better to limit the thrust on the engines themselves rather than relying on MechJeb to do it, mainly because it leaves fewer buttons to press when you\u0027re in flight and possibly trying to get some good screenshots of the launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMechjeb is also by far the most valuable tool for learning to dock. There\u0027s a lot less micromanagement for docking than for ascent; all you need is the rendezvous autopilot to get close to your target, and then the docking autopilot to attach the two craft together. After some time of watching what Mechjeb does, you learn pretty well how to do it in stock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLanding though, is a bit hit-or-miss with MechJeb. Literally. Most of the time it works perfectly, but if you want to avoid blowing up from atmospheric heating, or you\u0027re in too high of an orbit around a non-atmospheric world, the landing autopilot has issues (although I\u0027ve yet to test it out in the latest version of Mechjeb). My advice here is either ensure that you quicksave before any landing attempts, and you should probably learn to land manually (and don\u0027t trust the spaceplane guidance either when you eventually start making spaceplanes).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, I\u0027ve always found that the best way to get to most places in the Kerbol system is to overengineer. Need 3000 delta-v to get somewhere? Bring 3750. Need to land something colossal on the Mun but have no idea how many engines to use? Add as many engines as you can fit pointing vaguely downwards. As you get better at the game you wont need it, but early in your space career it\u0027s good to have a lot of redundancy in case of mistakes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
