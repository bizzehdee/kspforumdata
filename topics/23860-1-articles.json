As for the flight model, I think it\u0027s fine, leave it be. It works so don\u0027t fix it, now as for the space aspect of the game, they need to add things that affect the landing and surfaces of the worlds we have to play with. Gravity for example although it\u0027s good enough to have fun with, it is a major factor in getting to like our own mercury. And as for Jools gravity, I think approaching Laythe should be tricky due to gravitational tug. Now weather? That\u0027s where the golden ticket lies. Mars has severe dust storms, Venus? A pressure cooker, and the star? Wow, best of all the weather, solar storms that are dangerous, flares, all the good stuff that would make us build redundant systems into our ships. Comets, and asteroids, would be nice, an out limit to the solar system (Oort cloud) as it were with a near impenetrable boundary. Mysterious visitors to the solar system, better scientific equipment, an aricebo type array that has to be built. And finally, extra solar systems, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut tweaking the flight models? Not really needed now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bandit4910","CreatedById":14446,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T18:13:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey are thinking of more solar systems but that\u0027s far far away.(I\u0027m talking official release/after.) They said there wouldn\u0027t be aliens. Weather may or may not happen.(It has a question mark next to it.) Clouds are probably going to come first. Comets can\u0027t happen due to N-Body physics problems with Unity/PhysX. IF they ever add solar storms, they won\u0027t randomly damage your ships as that would get annoying. Gravity is also not going to be tweaked due to Unity/PhysX. Also, as a bonus they will be adding more planets and a Asteroid belt sometime.
