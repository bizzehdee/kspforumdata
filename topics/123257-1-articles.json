When trying to hide some Separatrons inside some boosters, or start an engine in an opened cargo bay, they don\u0027t work anymore after v1.0.0. All of my custom built LAS (which is stuffing some boosters inside a PF fairing) don\u0027t work anymore. I\u0027ve seen people not being able to activate engines in some semi-closed space. Never paid too much attention on that one, but it seems to be there.
