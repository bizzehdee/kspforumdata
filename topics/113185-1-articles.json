Also i can imagine building to be extremely difficult without anything but a mouse. Think of the troubles we already have using a mouse to build with parts not snapping to where you want them and such.

So I went and started learning things, such as delta-v requirements, Hohmann transfers, engine ISP ratings, mid-course correction burns, launch windows, etc. Afterward, transfers were manageable. With practice, they\u0027ve become routine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s still not easy, but by studying and practicing; with careful planning and design, it\u0027s one of the most rewarding experiences I\u0027ve had in a game. The only things I can think of that are more difficult, and rewarding, are ascending in Nethack, and 15% runs in Super Metroid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then, I do like my games hard.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T10:53:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t you stick to all of the other threads full of people whining about this without cluttering up the forum with more?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T10:56:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELots of completely unsupported and unsubstantiated claims there selfish_meme, you\u0027re making assumptions on things you have not seen yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis thread is useless, closing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
