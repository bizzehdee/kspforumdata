Instead, scan the trait\u0027s effects for the required effect.

(nothing against that but something new from time to time is the spice in the kerbol system... ;-)\n\nBut first things first:\n\nI think i got a Bug i have to dig in when i load the container with something the shown mass in the gui goes up, if i unload the part the mass stays the same and does not go back to the mass for the empty conatiner. If i place another objects into it counts the mass of the object on top of the mass that has not been reset for empty container, so if you say place enough objects into and take them out and do this say 20 to 30 times you have a container that has a mass arround ten tons... (KAS is installed if that migth be an issue....)\n\nHave to do a clean install tomorrow and see if i can reproduce just a quick test i noticed this one...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-15T03:51:09Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2015 03:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nightmare**"},{"CreatedByName":"rabidninjawombat","CreatedById":108889,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T04:11:40Z","Content":"Thanks for this so much Kospy \u0026 Winn75!
