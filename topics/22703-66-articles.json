I\u0027m still not sure why it worked before yet there\u0027s a problem \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Enow\u003C/span\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut between asking questions and testing, I\u0027ve come up with some flight observations and at least one work-around for other Eagle Pilots. So listen up, here\u0027s the scoop: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIn-line thrust is not affected by the POGO oscillations.\u003C/strong\u003E Any craft that is the classic \u0022stand on its tail\u0022 and thrust flies and hovers with MechJeb\u0027s Translatron KEEPVERT function just fine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHowever: In-line thrust can be re-defined by a part where you can click on \u0022control from here\u0022.\u003C/strong\u003E Such as another cockpit, a probe, or a docking port. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI always put a Jr. Sized docking port on top of the truss of my Eagles, just in case. In the past I haven\u0027t had to use it to hover. But now it\u0027s going to be necessary to use it if I want to fly with the automatic throttle control that I have used in the past. Most of the time I can fly it manually no problem. But those delicate \u0022trick\u0022 manuevers you\u0027ve seen me do, like flying through the tunnel on the KSP complex or flying the Eagle into the back of a carrier? That\u0027s been made more difficult with this change. Not impossible. But more challenging. Requires more set-up to do and changing from horizontal to vertical automatic thrust control is a bit tricky. It has to be done QUICKLY otherwise you\u0027ll flip out of control. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe very careful about how you place a docking port on top of the truss. Otherwise you\u0027ll wind up with controls reversed and make it harder on yourself to manuever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s an odd thing - but possibly good under the right circumstances: If you have both the VTOL and the Main rear engines on at the same time and turn on KEEPVERT? No POGO effect at all. But as soon as you turn off the main engine, the POGO returns. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne bit of solidly good news: latest update of MechJeb definitely is a LOT more precise in keeping a ship on exactly the right heading with no wobble. It works with the RCS thrusters with much more \u0022Snap\u0022 and holds an Eagle (and any other ship) very solidly on course. And it now has a \u0022Smooth Throttle\u0022 option which increases and decreases the throttle gradually instead of just SLAMMING it to maximum everytime MechJeb fires the engines. Between those two new features, flying the Eagle in \u0022semi-manual\u0022 mode by means of the SURF or Kill Rotation modes just got a lot easier. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso updated for .23 is Kerbal Joint Reinforcement. I can\u0027t recommend this mod highly enough. It really helps damp out any remaining wobbliness in the Eagle\u0027s parts and makes it very solid. It also has done a lot to damp out the \u0022landing gear bug\u0022 though it\u0027s not gone completely. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther testing I\u0027m about to do: Going to see if MechJeb\u0027s autoland feature will work with the Eagle if it\u0027s controlling it through a docking port on top of the truss. Also want to test the PX-2 Shuttle with the updated mods and see how that goes. I\u0027ll have an updated report in about an hour or two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Verdana;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003EWow.

The best way I know to do a suicide burn is to use MJ, or Kerbal Engineer to get your ship\u0027s TWR for the body your orbiting, and just do some math. The way I do it is just guess-stimating the speed and distance.

Though this pod isn\u0027t significantly heavier than a normal passenger pod and therefore doesn\u0027t need them most of the time. I WARN you - activate them only when you REALLY need them. As they suck down fuel FAST. What\u0027s really useful about this pod is that with its docking ports it can neatly serve as a \u0022hub\u0022 between other modules placed down by other Eagles to form a connected base.

The fuel lines are set up to go both ways. Which results in the fuel being drawn from the extra engine pods FIRST, then you can leave them attached as long as needed until you get to the proper altitude and then pop the modules free. Once at a low gravity world like the Mun or Minmus, the Eagle can handle the mass of the Beagle just fine. The launch package is only needed to bust loose of Kerbin\u0027s gravity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OtTy9Jq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022OtTy9Jq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe purpose of the Beagle is to move other modules around. It\u0027s set up so that the docking CMB port on the back will line up perfectly with any of the other modules and move them around. If needed, you can store small rover wheels in the KAS boxes under the fenders and attach them to the module you want to move temporarily. On Minmus I\u0027ve found that the rover has enough torque on its own to push the other modules around without the need for the extra wheels. At least on the ice flats.
