If you are mid flight you cannot adjust keys as you see fit. So a simple suggestion...allow you to adjust control settings mid flight, rather than having to back all the way out to the start menu. A simple suggestion, and even will allow the player to use the settings menu to look up what the default key bindings are. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this is a repost I am sorry. Did a quick search in the search bar above and did not see anything. Thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
