I would like to create my own shaders for KSP, but don\u0027t know where to start because I couldn\u0027t find any tutorials on the subject.

I ran across this while investigating the feasibility of a shader producing a depth map companion image to a regular color screenshot, in order to support non-destructive, post-processing depth of field manipulation. The person in the video literally writes a custom shader on screen.
