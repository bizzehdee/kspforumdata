Funnily enough I finished it today, came onto KSP forum and found this thread. I launched it as one piece. The lander is parked in the background, just past the hill. It docks to the 4 docking ports. I parked at AT Rabbit (courtesy of Frank_G) and my own personal Scout Hovership. Of course, the actual transfer and lander was assembled in orbit. Note I did NOT use cheats or the Hyperedit in the shot. \u002BRep if you like it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust so you all know, I launched it in one piece because launching it in bits would be very annoying to assemble on the surface. Also the lander was part Hammer SRB, part Skipper LF\u002BO engines. And it has no more fuel in it (exactly 10.3 units left which will burn in under 2 seconds). So it was a one way trip for those wondering. Its original purpose was actually to serve as a command base for the Duna system.\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KO0RYdf.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KO0RYdf.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-11T15:31:51Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2015 03:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ryan234abc\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ryan234abc","CreatedById":136492,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T15:51:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dr Farnsworth\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dr Farnsworth\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E \u003Cp\u003EThe first generation fuel transport ship had a massive Kraken hidden in the landing gear.
