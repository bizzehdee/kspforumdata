There are also tons of science points left scattered on different planets but there\u0027s no more incentive to grab them. I\u0027m here to open a discussion about what\u0027s the best way to drive players to grab more science points. What can we do with all the science we get? We can always convert it to cash, of course, but money too are easy to get and flying to Eeloo and back for money just to plant a flag there is not very inspiring. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECertainly the cost of late tech nodes can be increased, but anyway, eventually all tech nodes will be open.

The goal of space programs, at least in their heyday, was exploration to pave the way for colonization of other worlds. Perhaps a set of parts based on future technologies, where you can only unlock them once you\u0027ve gotten a certain amount of science from each planet, would give players that incentive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, you could have the unlock from Moho be advanced radiators/heat shielding, from Eve be a new, lightweight, more powerful fuel, from Eeloo the tech to make an engine that can handle that fuel, etc. It would add a nice little bit of story, and the end game could be you\u0027ve gotten all those techs, you now have the ability to travel to a new star system and explore there\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Spock","CreatedById":116542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T15:31:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are mods that extend the tech tree, but I\u0027m not exactly sure which.

I like a sandbox as much as anyone else, but the \u0022achiever\u0022 part of me also thrives on externally-created goals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been thinking about making a mod that would let you start building a growing monument (e.g., \u0022The Ksingularity\u0022) with endgame science -- a sort of hi-tech version of the \u0022Throne Room\u0022 you used to build in the Civ games, with aesthetic choices about how the direction your monument should take. Unlock the next tech node, choose one of various possible Lego Bricks for the next piece of your monument. Or maybe use the VAB to create this Ksingularity thing, brick by brick. Show it off to others for bragging rights. Or, if RAM or other limitations make a lego-brick system impractical, maybe just an ever-growing 2D \u0022throne room\u0022, but always with choices about how to expand your room, so that no two players ever build the same exact room. I used to love building my Throne Room in the old Civ games, and I was disappointed when the Civ designers removed it in later iterations of the series. I dunno, maybe that sort of thing doesn\u0027t appeal to others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to see more endgame stuff too, and I may try my hand at creating a mod to enhance the endgame.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Baenki","CreatedById":67219,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T22:18:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUse the Science -\u0026gt; Funds strategy with 100% comittment to earn some funds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt won\u0027t be a lot of cash and i don\u0027t think you can use the science you already collected to your account. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut why not.
