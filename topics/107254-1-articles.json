{"TopicId":107254,"ForumId":16,"TopicTitle":"Overhauls for 1.0","CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T19:20:16Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T19:20:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFellow Kerbonauts,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere has been a lot of discussion about all the aerodynamic and thermodynamic changes within KSP 1.0. It makes me pretty excited to see all the discussions about what works, what doesn\u0027t, and people figuring things out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, there\u0027s been a trend on the forum the last few days that seems to be leaning toward animosity. Aerodynamics in particular has always been a polarizing topic between the \u0022realism\u0022 crowd and the \u0022fun gameplay\u0022 crowd. For me personally, it has never been a question of which should win out: Realism or Gameplay. There is simply no possible way to achieve the perfect blend of realism and gameplay that satisfies every single player.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would sincerely like to point out that the beauty of this forum is that we all come together to understand difficult and complex concepts that have been boiled down to a relatively simplistic (and ideally understandable) representation in KSP. Accomplishing this is no small feat, and can be quite the challenge to balance while maintaining some level of realism \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E gameplay. To me, this community has always been incredible because of it\u0027s willingness to help each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I thought perhaps, instead of having yet another thread that goes back and forth about how the game does or doesn\u0027t meet your expectations, I would try to explain a bit about how complex the new aerodynamic and thermodynamic system is, and just how big of an undertaking the system has been up to this point. Perhaps that will lend some insight as to why finding a good balance is quite difficult. This isn\u0027t meant to be a \u0022defense of the system\u0022 sort of post, but more of an attempt to explain how the system works, to the people who love (and hate-to-love) this game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Chr\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EBasic Drag:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThe basic drag system for most parts is based off of a cube system. Every time KSP starts up, it looks into the PartDatabase.cfg file and checks for all the cubes. If a cube doesn\u0027t exist for a part, then KSP generates a drag cube for that part and stores it in the database.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- This has the advantage that you can (generally) look at the shape of the part to figure out what will be less draggy and what will be more draggy.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- However, this also causes issues with hollow parts (such as cargo bays) which have incorrectly built drag cubes.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Parts can also have drag cube multipliers, to adjust the size of the drag cube if the model shape is insufficient to really define the drag.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPhysics.cfg contains several curves in it. One set of curves (tip, surf, tail, mult) controls the level of drag that the cubes produce, by cube face. KSP uses these curves to build a profile curve that is used to calculate the weight of drag that each face contributes to that part. The cube face that points into the wind uses tip * multi, sides use surf * multi, and the back face uses tail * multi (in simplified terms).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe multiplier value is (in essence) a standard drag profile from subsonic through high hypersonic (in KSP\u0027s case, Mach 0.0 through Mach 25.0). This includes the supersonic drag rise in the transonic region, which for KSP is Mach 0.8 to 1.2 (270 - 410 m/s).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPart occlusion is accomplished only through node connections. Parts that are connected to other parts via nodes have the size of that cube\u0027s face reduced by the size of the parent/child part. So surface mounted parts are not occluded from drag. (This is why stuff built with lots of things hanging off suffers a lot of drag.)\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Because of how drag cubes are built, open ended model parts can cause problems. Not all of these parts were adjusted to account for this, which is why there is some imbalance.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EBasic Thermo:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nBuilds off the drag cube system to calculate how much of the part is exposed to the air. This basically sets up how much friction the part is going to experience.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThermo also includes simulation of shock cone occlusion, which deflects heat based on the part that\u0027s out front. This is why the location of surface mounted parts matter. Put them too far forward, and they hit all that heat. Put them too far back, and the forward blunt body doesn\u0027t provide shock cone occlusion anymore.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Balance for this is also tricky, so as to provide occlusion for parts when it makes sense, but not block all heating for the entire craft by mounting an antenna out front.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EBasic Lift/Drag for Wings:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nWings (more specifically, lifting surfaces and control surfaces) are handled separately from all the other parts in terms of drag.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWing lift is based on two curves, a Maximum Coefficient of Lift based on Mach, and a Coefficient of Lift based on Angle of Attack.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Wing lift is based on the V-Squared drag model, but is also scaled by the Cl-Mach curve to account for different levels of lift based on flight regime. Building a system this way has good and bad qualities. First, it simplifies things a bit in the KSP lego world of parts. However, it\u0027s not as complex as accounting for things like wing sweep and aspect ratio.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Balancing this curve also causes weird problems like shuttles that can glide at unnaturally low speeds (because they have a lot of wing area).\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Wing lift from AoA right now is very forgiving in KSP. There is a stall Angle of Attack, but it is quite high. This is also part of why things can fly unnaturally slow and don\u0027t fall out of the sky even at extremely high AoA.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWing drag is based on two curves, a Maximum Coefficient of Drag based on Mach, and a Coefficient of Drag based on Angle of Attack.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- The Cd-Mach curve for wings is higher than that for fuselage pieces. There\u0027s a variety of reasons for this, but the end result to the game player is that if you build a plane with a lot of wing area, you will have a hard time getting through the supersonic barrier. However, once you\u0027re past it, it\u0027s generally easier to keep accelerating...\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: By popular demand, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/107254-overhauls-for-10/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=2165453\u0022\u003Ehere is a more in-depth discussion of the wing lift/drag modeling\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Chr\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, on top of all that, many parts have special cases. As noted above, parts that have open models (such as a cargo bay) can cause issues with part occlusion. Models with multiple cube types (such as parachutes) need to be built and adjusted properly. With all these special cases, I\u0027m sure some of them were missed getting updated. On top of that, with any change to the global modifiers, it throws all of the other parts out of balance. It\u0027s a difficult act to balance. So yes, feedback is more than welcome. But if you want your feedback heard, avoid clouding it with too much angst and frustration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSure, we can have a back and forth on the forum about why the model is built this way and whether or not everyone agrees with it. But really my point in all this is that \u003Cem\u003Ethis is our new model\u003C/em\u003E (like it or not) and perhaps understanding a bit about how it works will aid people in their design process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAs a final note, all of these parts were built to be completely controllable and configurable by the user. No, I\u0027m not saying \u0022If you don\u0027t like it, go install a mod.\u0022 I\u0027m say that if you find something out of balance, try playing with the numbers and posting your findings! It\u0027s the community, working together, that really makes this place awesome to me.

Is that correct?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I also recall some early discussion (an old squadcast, I believe) where ideas were being thrown around regarding how to do aero/drag. One idea that came up was to use the same technique as is used for figuring out how to draw the flame/atmo effects: ie, a camera which is put in front of the craft along the the velocity vector finds the edges, and that\u0027s where flames/shocks are drawn. It was mentioned that this technique might be incorporated into drag calculations, since it\u0027s a good way of looking at the shape and size of the cross section into the airstream. That seemed like a good idea to me... sort of a simplified version of FAR\u0027s upcoming voxelization of craft.

Is that correct?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWings and control surfaces buried inside a fuselage will still generate lift. You can even put flat plates on the front edge of a wing and it\u0027ll fly fine. The comment that you are referring to might actually be in regard to the cargo bays. Just like how engines don\u0027t work inside cargo bays, wings and control surfaces hidden inside cargo bays do not generate lift while the bay doors are closed.

One idea that came up was to use the same technique as is used for figuring out how to draw the flame/atmo effects: ie, a camera which is put in front of the craft along the the velocity vector finds the edges, and that\u0027s where flames/shocks are drawn. It was mentioned that this technique might be incorporated into drag calculations, since it\u0027s a good way of looking at the shape and size of the cross section into the airstream.

This would allow radially attached parts (at least those which don\u0027t protrude too far) to be relatively safe.
