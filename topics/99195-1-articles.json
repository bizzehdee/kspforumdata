I\u0027ve created the risers as a cone with transparent sides (via a PNG), opaque only where the risers are. The cone is a separate mesh from the canopy. When I look at the cone from below, it seems to prevent the canopy underside from rendering. I know that the risers are the issue because without them, the canopy renders just fine from underneath.
