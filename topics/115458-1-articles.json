So the experiments I\u0027ve collected are not duplicates.\n\nHowever, when I walk back to get in the cockpit, it tells me I have duplicates and asks me to dump them.\n\nWorkaround is to only collect once from each device in a single EVA, just don\u0027t understand what I\u0027m doing wrong. Otherwise I could get away with walking to the backend of the plane every-other biome.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-09T06:23:32Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2015 06:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AaronLS**"},{"CreatedByName":"NJP","CreatedById":147695,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T05:07:45Z","Content":"I\u0027ve never really been going around the KSC for biome science, but I\u0027m sure since the biomes are so small a lot of them are pretty similar in the system they act like its two of the same data.
