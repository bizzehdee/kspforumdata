The parts load, but their size is all the default size, and they do not hold the correct amount of fuel. This makes in-flight ships not happy, and craft in the VAB look weird, and not function properly. See image. Weirdly, the editor does seem to know how far the part extends, but the calculation for tank capacity and the display (at the very least) are definitely borked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Bbb3CGS.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/Bbb3CGS.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rosenkranz","CreatedById":57152,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-22T19:46:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EQuestion.

Anyway, I\u0027ve got a bug that just won\u0027t go away... I like to use conic tanks on the bottom of cylindrical tanks to create a fueled adapter when I\u0027m using an engine of a smaller size than the tanks above it, anyway, occasionally when I do this, igniting the engine from that stage shoots the engine and the conic tank its attached to straight up through the rest of the rocket, and out to about 500m in from of the rocket where it catches and starts flying around randomly like its on a bungee cord and dragging the remains of the rocket along with it on a wild ride. This seems to happen most often after I\u0027ve removed and then reattached large sections of the rocket (adding a new engine to my payload for example), and the only way to be sure its fixed is to delete the offending conic tank (and usually any that exist below it) and then rebuild the rocket below. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy guess is this is something to do with the way the nodes between the two tanks are interfacing, but I can\u0027t be sure as I\u0027m not really sure how that actually happens at a technical level. If anyone else has experienced this and / or knows of a fix, I\u0027d really like to hear your input.
