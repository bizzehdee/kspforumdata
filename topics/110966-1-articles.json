I mean alright I get it, some of the capsules are just minimalistic. The Mk1-2 Command Pod is, as is the Mk1 Command Pod. However with both of those you\u0027re crammed into a small space and there were never gonna be a lot to see under any circumstances, but the Mk2 Lander Can is spacious, there\u0027s room to step back and enjoy the models and textures and what do we get? Bare minimum. I understand that doing IVA\u0027s isn\u0027t something the devs are eager to do, but surely I\u0027m not the only one who has thought like this? Especially after the introduction of the Mk1 Lander Can, the Mk2 really really really just pales in comparison."},{"CreatedByName":"waterlubber","CreatedById":119333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T01:58:20Z","Content":"Indeed.
