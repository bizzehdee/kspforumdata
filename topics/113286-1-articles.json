Only one is really feasible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirstly you could launch a massive, multi stage rocket. Burn through Kerbins atmosphere and drop your biggest tanks and engines in the process. Then transition to medium engines and tanks to get into a Kerbin orbit. A nuclear engine will get you to Eve, though I\u0027m not sure which is the best for in-atmosphere. I\u0027d avoid this strategy if possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second and more reasonable method in my opinion is to send a fully functional space station with everything you need (or just extra fuel if you are mod-less) to orbit Eve. Then you send a lighter, more reasonable craft to Eve orbit to meet up with the space station and refuel. You should at that point have enough to land and take off again into Eve orbit for a second refueling. Or you could just get your lander back into orbit and send a third vehicle to rescue the second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that\u0027s just logistics.
