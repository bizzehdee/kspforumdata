Since I have never landed at Eve before I don\u0027t know a lot about it other than it has a really think atmosphere, and higher gravity that Kerbin. Would a space plane or rocket be the base option? Please share some of your designs and tips! \n\nThanks\n\n-Nick\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T19:12:00Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 07:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hornet18**\n  \nAnswered"},{"CreatedByName":"OddFunction","CreatedById":143805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T02:45:45Z","Content":"You have two real options. Only one is really feasible.\n\nFirstly you could launch a massive, multi stage rocket. Burn through Kerbins atmosphere and drop your biggest tanks and engines in the process. Then transition to medium engines and tanks to get into a Kerbin orbit. A nuclear engine will get you to Eve, though I\u0027m not sure which is the best for in-atmosphere. I\u0027d avoid this strategy if possible.\n\nThe second and more reasonable method in my opinion is to send a fully functional space station with everything you need (or just extra fuel if you are mod-less) to orbit Eve. Then you send a lighter, more reasonable craft to Eve orbit to meet up with the space station and refuel. You should at that point have enough to land and take off again into Eve orbit for a second refueling. Or you could just get your lander back into orbit and send a third vehicle to rescue the second.\n\nBut that\u0027s just logistics. You\u0027re going to need specifics on in-atmosphere engines for Eve... because the return-ascent is the hardest part."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T02:57:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ... because the return-ascent is the hardest part.\n\nVery much this. An Eve return mission is built around the ascent-from-Eve phase of the mission. \n\nSpaceplanes are pretty much right out. Jets don\u0027t work there, single stage is virtually (if not still mathematically) impossible, and the thick atmo means lots of drag from those wings. Wings that are dry mass taking away from the large delta-V budget needed for ascent.\n\nA multistage rocket is the most practical ascent. If you can land at high altitude the ascent is much easier. Pick engines with good atmo stats (aerospike, Mainsail), and have a small upper stage to complete the insertion. Drop your landing gear and chutes immediately after takeoff. Leave your return vehicle in orbit so you don\u0027t have to lug it back up. \n\nI don\u0027t have a craft to share as the last Eve ascent I did was under the old aero, with a superwide asparagus design (though the delta-V requirements were higher then, too)."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T03:31:38Z","Content":"Yeah, Eve ascent is a brute. I haven\u0027t gotten around to doing it in 1.02 yet... in 0.9, the smallest I ever got my lander was a bit under 200 tons at the surface-- and that was just to loft a single Mk1 lander can to orbit. (Not to \u0022escape from Eve and return to Kerbin\u0022, mind you. Just to low Eve orbit.)\n\nWill be interesting to see what it\u0027s like in the new post-1.0 world... looking forward to i.\n\nBut basically, what Red Iron Crown said. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAlso: Test, test, test. There are *so* many things that can go wrong with an Eve mission. For example, just landing: hitting the ground at even just what seems like a moderate speed can cause your ship to break apart like a jumble of jackstraws, snapping struts and popping engines off their fuel tanks (this is a combination of the heavier gravity, and the fact that your lander has to be *big* and big things are highly vulnerable to their own inertia). Just trying to come up with landing gear that won\u0027t snap under the strain is a challenge."},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T06:35:59Z","Content":"One tip (from someone who has actually done this a few times now): Land your Eve craft nearly empty of fuel. Take along a disposable set of mining and fuel processing kit and refuel on the surface before lifting. Alternatively, put down a rover probe with refueling capabilities first and use that to refuel your return craft. You don\u0027t have to do this but it means less mass to lift from Kerbin. \n\nYou are looking for about 8500 dV from the surface to 100km orbit. It is possible to do it with less but there is a lot of drag from Eve\u0027s atmosphere and if your craft is anything less than optimal then you will lose dV. \n\nTypical ship mass will be in the order of 150t. So plan to land it with plenty of \u0027chutes and some air brakes. \n\nHere\u0027s a couple of examples that work:\n\n![GPIibhM.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/GPIibhM.jpg)\n\n![jIZ6Qir.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/jIZ6Qir.jpg)\n\n![jt5UO3U.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/jt5UO3U.jpg)\n\nUse hyperedit to land your craft for testing. You will lose a lot of craft in testing and you don\u0027t want to do a whole mission to Eve every time. \n\nYour Kerbin ascent profile will definately not work on Eve. You will want to go straight up for at least 25km and then bank over sharply to gain orbital velocity. Any weak stage (TWR close to 1.0) will kill your lift.\n\nThe atmosphere is very dense near Eve\u0027s surface. Engines with poor sea level thrust will be useless for the first and probably second stages. Even a Poodle as a third stage is marginal. This will severely limit your engine choices.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T06:50:59Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 06:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Foxster**"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T08:33:04Z","Content":"I very recently did my first successful manned mission to Eve.
