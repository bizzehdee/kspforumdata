The problem is that it doesn\u0027t really have any drag when FAR is installed, which means that it\u0027ll still be moving at 1.6 km/s at 10 kilometers after reentry. The only thing that slows it down is turns and climbs, and even when I got it below 100 m/s (which was hard) it didn\u0027t want to stay on the runway.
