The moderators appear to be quite busy moving these threads, but there are quite a few that\u00A0remain there for a while before someone notices and moves it.\u00A0It\u0027s probably a mistake most of the time, but sometimes I see people complaining that \u0022now nobody will read it\u0022 once it\u0027s been moved, which means that there are some\u00A0people deliberately posting their threads in the wrong subforum just to get more views and/or replies.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust wondering if there\u0027s anything that can be done about it, because it does clutter the forums a bit? Is the layout not clear enough? Do people not read the forum guidelines?

The way I see it, if I deliberately place a post in the subforum with the highest readership, I\u0027ll get more views. Eventually someone will probably move it, but I basically get a free\u00A0advert in the high-traffic\u00A0forum that tells everyone the thread has moved, and they can click to view it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not suggesting that this function is removed, and it\u0027s really not a huge deal, so it\u0027s not a big complaint on my part.\u00A0I\u0027m just wondering if I\u0027m the only one who\u0027s noticed it and if there\u0027s anything that can be done about it?
