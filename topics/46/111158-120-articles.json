(That\u0027s pretty important, in case we have any questions.  It also discourages folks from abusing the report system.)\n\nNote that reports include not just  \u0022who reported\u0022, but also a *\u003Cu\u003Enote\u003C/u\u003E* (assuming the reporter saw fit to enter one).  That\u0027s *\u003Cu\u003Ereally\u003C/u\u003E* important, because without that, we don\u0027t have the context of \u0022what\u0027s the problem here?\u0022  Sometimes it\u0027s pretty obvious (e.g. if the reported post is being blatantly abusive, or something)... but a lot of the time, it\u0027s not so obvious at first glance what the issue is, and telling us *\u003Cu\u003Ewhy you\u0027re reporting\u003C/u\u003E* is a real timesaver for us.\n\nOne example of why the note is so important:  Users don\u0027t have all the context that moderators do.  It\u0027s not uncommon for users to report stuff that they simply *\u003Cu\u003Edon\u0027t like\u003C/u\u003E* (but which actually isn\u0027t breaking any rules).  If they report such a post without a note, we\u0027re left scratching our heads-- \u0022did they report it because they think *\u003Cu\u003Ethis\u003C/u\u003E* thing is a problem, which actually isn\u0027t?  Or is there some other problem somewhere that we\u0027re missing?\u0022  Which wastes our time, looking into the matter.\n\nSo... feel free to report posts in any situation where you think a moderator\u0027s attention is required, but we\u0027d appreciate it if you please *\u003Cu\u003Einclude a note explaining why\u003C/u\u003E* when you do so.  Doesn\u0027t need to be long.
