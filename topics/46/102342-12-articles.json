It says bad things about how websites can be run today, and what people expect of them.\n\nAlthough that probably made it more effective as a joke, that decisions like a 140 character limit, tagged age/gender/location, effective up/downvotes (ie, ones that affect the position of a thread instead of simply rating it.), social media integration and charging for basic features all seemed like something that *someone* would attempt or otherwise consider a good idea. \n\nThe least plausible feature is probably the interactive forum assistant (Walt). It would also (assuming an option to turn it off) be the only possibly good one. (Tumblr integration might be useful for image hosting images could be grouped like with Imgur, but it\u0027s blocked in as one feature in line with Facebook integration, so it\u0027s rapidly cancelled out.)\n\nSo as a joke towards the current state and trend of websites, I like this week early april fools, now that I know that\u0027s what it is.\n\n*For the moment, anyway.*"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T23:54:03Z","Content":"No. No. NO.
