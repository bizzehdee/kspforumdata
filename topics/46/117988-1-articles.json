If you upload an image to [Imgur](http://imgur.com/) however you do have an \u0027edit\u0027 option you can tick, and you can resize the image there ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T12:08:12Z","Content":"It\u0027s bad form to resize an image using tags anyway. Either you\u0027re making it larger than the source and it\u0027ll be ugly, or you\u0027re making it smaller than the source and forcing someone to download a (much, in many cases) larger file than they think they\u0027re getting.\n\nI browse the forums tethered to a cell phone a lot of the time. The propensity of PNGs in posts over JPGs is bad enough, don\u0027t make me think I\u0027m looking at a thumbnail that is actually 1080p!"}]}
