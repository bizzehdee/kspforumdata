I click the button to try again and enter a new captchca string for the new image I get. Again I get the response claiming my captchca string didn\u0027t match. I repeat again. By the fourth time I carefully am typing the string in one character at a time, looking again and again and again to verify it\u0027s the same, and it fails again. The fifth and final time I try the audio captchca instead, listen for the string, type it in, and again it claims the string didn\u0027t match and now I figure I\u0027m locked out for 15 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then I notice there was a message in my e-mail.
