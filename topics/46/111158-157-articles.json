I am not a user however I have seen a few requests for assistance, both general and game related, and there is no good place to direct people to who are experiencing issues.  The result I have seen is that while we have a group of highly knowledgeable and helpful members, linux help requests are spread across the forum."},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-17T23:32:02Z","Content":"I think that would introduce a segregation that wouldn\u0027t be needed.  *Most* issues with KSP are OS agnostic - they apply to everyone.  And someone who\u0027s on Linux, posting an issue in the Linux subforum, could easily post an issue that\u0027s not OS-related.  Then they may not get noticed by Windows or Mac users who may know the answer.  Also Linux specific issues are generally (from what I\u0027ve seen) installation or joystick related, and get answered.  The Console subforum makes sense, since this game on consoles is a completely different world than on computers.  I imagine this would also increase workload for the moderators in moving threads.\n\nIf you have some examples of Linux-specific issues that aren\u0027t being answered, I\u0027d like to see them!\n\nWhat would help most is if the topic titles started with operating system - similar to the convention in the mod release threads for KSP version.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-09-17T23:39:26Z\u0022 title=\u002209/17/2018 11:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 17, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Geonovast**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-18T03:25:04Z","Content":"Direct those Linux folks to the PC modded/unmodded support subforums. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-18T06:38:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7 hours ago, Geonovast said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E What would help most is if the topic titles started with operating system - similar to the convention in the mod release threads for KSP version.\n\u003E \n\nUnless there\u0027s a way to enforce it, it won\u0027t happen.
