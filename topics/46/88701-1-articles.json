Since there were no files created using a compiler, and the mod part is ALREADY in the form of a .TXT file (of which a .CFG is just a variant), do I need to do anything besides post the modified part file, and possibly the original version before I made any modifications to it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help here would be greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-27T23:15:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re asking if you need to post source code for a config and textures?
