Also most parts seem to work file upload still doesn\u0027t. The wiki is an important source for new users and experienced ones and images matter. The Parts website needs them badly and the dV map from Kowgan needs an update.\n\nSo please fix it. And if you have no time, no money, don\u0027t know anyone who can fix it: This is a quite large community. I guess you just have to ask and there would be several volunteers to do this in their spare time! And if you fear that somebody from the outside could tinker with other services on the server, just move the wiki to another virtual machine. All it needs is a database snapshot and the mediawiki data directory. That\u0027s it. So pleeeeaaaaasssssssee.\n\nAlso you\u0027re great."},{"CreatedByName":"Rithsom","CreatedById":114646,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T20:05:24Z","Content":"Yes, please fix the Wiki, Squad.

We just need Squad to spend a day or 2 fixing the MediaWiki installation (and it may well be as little as just an hour or 2 needed, in my expert opinion), and then to commit to properly maintaining it on an ongoing basis."},{"CreatedByName":"Mat2ch","CreatedById":139755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T18:29:38Z","Content":"Moved to another forum.

All image processing broke completely around the start of May, and we got a response that it was being worked on and due to the wiki being in a transition/migration state, including MathML stuff. Only cached results of historic image processing are displayed, new images, changed images, and new sizes of existing images are 100% broken. Since then, I\u0027ve identified a number of other broken/misconfigured server things which are detailed on the wiki\u0027s \u0022migration issues\u0022 page linked from the site notice, which serves as our (the wiki community) master list of problems needing looked at.\n\nPersonally, I\u0027d been holding off saying anything outside the wiki\u0027s internal talk pages and the issues page, as we had been assured that a fix was coming. I\u0027ve now stuck my head up here since this thread was opened, as it\u0027s now gone past all reasonable timescales without any obvious movement. It should be obvious from the issues page, but there\u0027s 2 main phases of remedial attention needed: 1) A fast fix to the major visible stuff (i.e. images and MathML), which really should not be difficult to address; and 2) A deeper look at the state of the MediaWiki install to address the more subtle and less visible issues (which are still important), and basically give it a comprehensive health check/cleanup.\n\nBeyond that, we do need some low intensity, general server support on an ongoing basis, so that we can get things like configuration tweaks, MediaWiki extensions, etc looked at without too much fuss. I wouldn\u0027t expect that to be a significant number of hours per month, just occasional collaboration between server admin(s) and the wiki community to make it as good as it possibly can be, and mostly low urgency stuff.\n\n(None of the issues listed have anything to do with caching on the user end, but it sounds like you\u0027ve already figured that out.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mat2ch","CreatedById":139755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T19:25:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I moved it to this sub *and* passed the question along.\n\nThank you for passing it along ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mat2ch","CreatedById":139755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T11:10:26Z","Content":"Up with this thread!
