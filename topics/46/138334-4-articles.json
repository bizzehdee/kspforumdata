It, like Minecraft, is more of a game engine that allows people to build the game they want to play in it, so long as they are willing to contribute a large amount of effort. The challenges of semi-realistic space travel are new enough to most people that this doesn\u0027t get boring for a while (and in this regard I think that KSP is lucky to have been one of the first such games), but once you have learned to land anywhere and understand basic principles of spaceflight, the game quickly becomes boring if you don\u0027t have the drive to pour endless hours of time into construction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(On that note, building spacecraft remains entirely too finicky, fiddly, and inaccurate to retain my interest for very long.

They set the orbital trajectories of the planets, and the heights of their atmospheres, if any. And they provide a movement engine for your rockets to go places in. I\u0027m not saying that this is a bad thing in itself.

And if you want to do anything particularly interesting with them aside from \u0022go places\u0022 or \u0022dock\u0022, you have to download mods created by other players.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yes, I agree that a large part of \u0022the point\u0022 of games like these is for players to build their own spacecraft/vehicles/whatever!

People are talking about the game as though the hundreds of hours of enjoyment they got out of it were entirely due to SQUAD, but I don\u0027t think that this is true.

Still, the game has been out for four years. The range of content implemented in the game remains about the same now as it was in version 0.18. SQUAD has a consistent team of 10\u002B developers? And something like 16 \u0022legacy\u0022 team members that they\u0027ve gone through. They\u0027ve implemented a few limiters that don\u0027t interact with each other - money limits spacecraft construction, science limits parts availability, Kerbal skill limits what stabilization capabilities are locked or unlocked. And they have given the game some degree of graphical overhaul, which is neat - but it\u0027s very limited. Planets are still almost exactly as bland as they were before up close.\u00A0Bugtesting is great, but every release still\u00A0comes with some gamebreaking bug or weird inconsistency in the way parts are implemented that awaits another release or three in order to iron out. It\u0027s been four years... and they seem to have progressed very little from their initial models.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVersion 0.19 in March 2013 was the last major update to parts, with the addition of rover wheels. The last major update to Career mode was in 0.24, in July 2014, with the implementation of Funds, Contracts, and Reputation. Since those two dates the game\u0027s mechanics have remained largely unchanged in their respective areas, aside from various tweaks and new parts. Three years for parts and two for Career. They can\u0027t claim bugtesting as the reason why things are being drawn out for this long and say that stock KSP remains more bug-free than modded KSP when the game continues to break down every time they introduce some small degree of new functionality. I don\u0027t really see mods messing up my game much more than the game messes itself up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-30T20:54:32Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2016 08:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Accelerando\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"I_Killed_Jeb","CreatedById":84817,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-30T20:39:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222551434\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022138334\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462048367\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022543\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Accelerando\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 minutes ago, Accelerando said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, the game has been out for four years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe game has technically been out only since 1.0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deddly","CreatedById":62955,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-30T21:03:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/543-accelerando/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022543\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/543-accelerando/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Accelerando\u003C/a\u003E Whilst I do appreciate where you\u0027re coming from, and I would also like to see more detailed planets and things to explore and discover, I have to disagree with you on what\u0027s happened since 0.18 beta.

I\u0027m also criticizing SQUAD\u0027s contribution as well. While the tools provided do allow for interesting constructions when put together, they are still built off of largely the same movement engine and model of gameplay balance as they were in 0.18. Yes, aerodynamics and re-entry heat have been added, but in lieu of an economic system that makes it matter to your hardware and Kerbals outside of \u0022you don\u0027t have money for new missions\u0022, what do they constitute other than a slightly new flavor of flight control that was already implemented by modders years before the official release? And on that note I\u0027m not saying that we should rely solely on modders for content - very much the opposite.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do like the functionality provided by the full release versus the demo, but that doesn\u0027t really have much to do with any changed functionality or gameplay. It is nice to have a wider range of parts to construct things which are aesthetically interesting and different, and which I could share with friends and other players. It\u0027s also nice to have rockets fly a bit more realistically than before, with aerodynamics and so on. But the difference between 0.18 and the full game, in terms of my actual gameplay enjoyment, is mostly the fact that I have to pay for one and not the other. I like being able to land on Laythe versus having only the Mun to target, but the gameplay between the two is not really significantly enough changed that I\u0027d want to pay $40 for it. Having access to larger SLS parts doesn\u0027t do anything except make certain missions somewhat easier. Having access to more science parts just means I have more things to click to make my science go up. Having access to aircraft parts is nice for about 30 minutes before I get bored by the bland terrain. More realistic aerodynamics mostly means I have to bend my flight trajectories a little more carefully, in lieu of anything else to do in the air. And so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I\u0027ve said, these things are all nice if you intensely appreciate carving out your own challenges, but I still don\u0027t think that that makes them very large improvements in quality. That is why I say that most of the interesting content in KSP (that is, the things that you as a player interact with in the course of gameplay) comes from player contributions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-30T21:22:15Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2016 09:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Accelerando\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deddly","CreatedById":62955,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-30T21:27:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooks like we come at KSP from two completely different angles.
