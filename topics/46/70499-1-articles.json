Whenever someone messages me to ask for help I find I bump into that limit and have to split it over 2 messages. Is there a way that users who have been on the forums a while or have got above a certain rep could be allowed longer messages. perhaps once someone has been here say 2-3 months and not been guilty of any forum offences could they have a larger limit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs that even possible? What do you think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rowsdower","CreatedById":91811,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-26T00:35:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood question.
