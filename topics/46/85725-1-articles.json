I suggest that you make rules that record applicant must upload a savefile to public server and detailed information how others can repeat the result. If someone suspects he can repeat it and release results. I see that this is not suitable for records which need personal skills in piloting, but I think that most of the \u0022fastest speed\u0022 records are records of vessel builders and not pilots.
