I actually started looking into making my own mod site because of this until I realized kerbal space port is by squad.... If the download buttons were links to the resources instead of post requests I could have pulled off a website scraper but I\u0027m thinking they wrote it this way to prevent that behavior.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majiir","CreatedById":7550,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T20:13:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou may be interested in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71133-Community-Mod-Repository-and-The-Majiir-Challenge\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecommunity mod repository project\u003C/a\u003E.

Even a minimal api that standardized reporting of current version numbers of the mods would be a large boon to mod manager developers. This would allow for easy notification of mod updates without having to scrape the site (costing less bandwidth to Squad). Please re-consider adding in an API that mod managers can query for mod information.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
