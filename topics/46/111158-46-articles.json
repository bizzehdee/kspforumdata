Ok. I understand. Would it be,treated as disrespectful for a regular user to play a practical joke on a moderator (provided it causes,no harm to the forums and no vulgarity or anything offensive?\n\nYeah, I agree. We tend not to play jokes on individual users simply for the fact that it can be poorly interpreted. Same goes the other way. Really, moderators play a little fun at each other more because we tend to know each other a bit (from hanging out in the chat). Practical jokes in text form can be taken very badly, so they are generally discouraged.\n\nOn the subject of Green Iron Crown (GIC), as was stated, we create \u0022regular\u0022 user accounts for testing purposes. GIC escaped because we were checking an issue with the reputation system. In the few minutes we spent checking things, a user noticed that something was amiss, and the snowball began.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T03:38:23Z","Content":"Ok, i understand.
