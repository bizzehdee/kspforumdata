I simply go do what I like to do on the forum. I participate in the forum games, I share my screenshots, I welcome newcomers to the forum and the game, and I do try to write my fan-fic. I also approve new member\u0027s posts, which I love doing. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nUnfortunately, I do have to put on the ol\u0027 moderator\u0027s hat when I come across stuff that shouldn\u0027t be here. But it\u0027s not for the reason some people think moderators do that kind of thing. We do it because the community deserves a place that\u0027s relatively free from disrespect and disruption. We have a reputation of being accepting and accommodating. We\u0027re a giant hug-box and have community members of all backgrounds, demographics, and every other box people come in (and I really hate boxes ![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif \u0022:huh:\u0022) people are people).  And when someone disrupts that harmony, we have to do what we can to fix it. It\u0027s why we rely on the goodwill of the community to report what you come across so we can take care of those things."},{"CreatedByName":"dsplaisted","CreatedById":225798,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-18T13:21:59Z","Content":"Why does the \u0022Do not click this\u0022 thread keep getting locked and unlocked?"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-18T13:44:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 21 minutes ago, dsplaisted said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Why does the \u0022Do not click this\u0022 thread keep getting locked and unlocked?\n\u003E \n\nBecause it\u0027s a game.\n\nHappy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-18T15:48:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, dsplaisted said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Why does the \u0022Do not click this\u0022 thread keep getting locked and unlocked?\n\u003E \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever been unlocked."},{"CreatedByName":"kspbutitscursed","CreatedById":227529,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-18T23:42:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7 hours ago, Gargamel said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever been unlocked.\n\u003E \n\ni agree i has never EVER been unlocked since 2013"},{"CreatedByName":"Superluminal Gremlin","CreatedById":221533,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-21T20:49:44Z","Content":"What is the Longest Thread?"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-21T21:21:15Z","Content":"I\u0027m not a Mod but I don\u0027t think anything rivals that\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u002257228\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed5106653967\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/27292-what-did-you-do-in-ksp1-today/?do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:377px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-22T13:08:11Z","Content":"Probably right [@The Aziz](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/150811-the-aziz/)"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-02T13:12:28Z","Content":"There was a question about ignoring users but.. could there be an option to ignore threads?
