I have seen good threads being killed off (and I use that harsh term intentionally) because of nonsensical moderation. Yes, opinions differ and it is a matter of personal interpretation, but it seems a matter of policy. As already mentioned, making new threads for every couch and sneeze is not making things clearer or easier to find. On the contrary. Only in the case of grossly outdated threads a new start is a good option, but that should only happen when a new thread has been made and a relevant link has been posted. Instead, I have seen it happening with threads that were not outdated (which is not the same as old!) and not linked to a new one. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have also explained numerous times that it is a lot less likely for someone to start a new thread than to continue an old one. Like it or not, that is how it works and killing off older threads is costing the community good ideas and discussions.
