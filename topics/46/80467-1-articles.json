The user has to choose what general filter they want to use. The general filter is not what causes the problem most of the time. It\u0027s when a user right clicks on a certain picture or banner and then tries to create a custom filter for that picture or banner when problems arise. If the user takes the time to actually read the choices given after right clicking the desired item to be blocked, he/she will see about 3-4 choices for what kind of filter to create, from blocking almost everything on the site to that one particular item. So yeah, one must pay attention when using ad-block, but ad-block itself is not the problem, the user is. Overall, and IMO, Ad-block plus is the #1 goto item in system protection.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"neamerjell","CreatedById":86054,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-02T23:33:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELike I said \u0022... if you\u0027re not careful, it blocks everything!\u0022 I should have paid more attention before I clicked \u0022Okay\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
