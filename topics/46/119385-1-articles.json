It might be nice for console players to have a place to have discussion (I cannot for the life of me come up with a simple, non-somehow-offensive way to say what I\u0027m trying to say) in a like-minded environment (mod-free environment? idk. Still sounds weird.) But that just makes me think having an area of the forum that\u0027s just for Stock things should exist, which seems kind of silly to me, so maybe tags are good enough. Plus we don\u0027t want to purposefully force anyone out of one area and into another, that\u0027s bad for pretty obvious reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could definitely see wanting to have a small section of the forum where the console versions are the \u0022expected\u0022 version, which might be a bit more welcoming to newer console players. Someone who doesn\u0027t realize the difference between the console version and the PC version might post a thread asking about how people figure out how much fuel they need to get to orbit without using the console tags or specifying they\u0027re on the console (not expecting it to matter), and they\u0027ll get slammed with \u0022use KER\u0022 and \u0022use MechJeb\u0022 posts that really aren\u0027t helpful to them.
