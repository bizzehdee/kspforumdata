Also, one judge (not naming names here) hasn\u0027t submitted his entries at all yet. I\u0027ll send him/her a PM now.\n\nMost of the scores are all-but-settled, but I just want to make sure that everything is properly tallied before announcing the finalists. (There\u0027s a separate and honorable badge for the finalists, which you can take a look at [here](http://i.imgur.com/9yBxIms.jpg). It\u0027s quite nice.)\n\n**Even after the finalists are announced, I\u0027m going to have another round of judging for the Grand Supreme Winners. It will likely be a week or so more before those results come out.** Hopefully, we can get some hype going in the meantime! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI really appreciate all of the judges\u0027 hard work on this. It was quite an endeavor for me to judge the Oscar-B\u0027s, myself. I had a lot of trouble with deciding the second-place entry for one category, for example: there were no less than three entries that were fully deserving of that spot. Let it be known to all of the nominees that even if you aren\u0027t a finalist, your stuff is still *great*. \n\nI would love to 3D-print trophies for all of the winners, but they start at about $100 and there are fourteen categories. I really don\u0027t want to spend some $1,400 on this. Hopefully that\u0027s understandable. (If you can think of an alternate way of doing it or if you own a fancy 3D printer, PM me! I\u0027d love to make that happen.)\n\nSorry for the brief update. I know that some of you were expecting more than this. And trust me, it *is* coming soon.\n\n-Upsilon"},{"CreatedByName":"FireFaced","CreatedById":141290,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T13:39:24Z","Content":"D: What is the estimated time of at least finalists?
