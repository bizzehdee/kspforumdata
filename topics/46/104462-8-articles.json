Be sure to check them out!\n\n~~~\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I would like a full report on why the channels that lost lost. Was my channel playing games other than KSP one of the reasons it lost? If so, that\u0027s rigged. Sorry for this, but I really thought I could get to finals. Also, definite rig with how BaconSpaceProgram got in.\n\nI\u0027m honestly sorry.\n\nI can\u0027t speak for any of the other judges, but I can say that your channel wasn\u0027t bad. However, it could have used a little more fast-paced content, a little more editing on the videos, and perhaps shorter video duration (even Scott Manley\u0027s videos push the boundaries of my attention span sometimes). In addition, while I didn\u0027t count anything against you for having non-KSP videos, some of the other judges might have. I don\u0027t know.\n\nRather than becoming discouraged due to your less-than-optimal finish, I would recommend trying to channel your energy towards making your channel better, so that when/if another Oscar-B ever happens, you\u0027ll be ready to claim a top spot.\n\n~~~\n\nNothing was rigged here, either. If it was, my channel probably would have gotten more than a fourth-place finish from one of the judges and stayed completely off the podium for all of the others ![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif) I do, however, respect all of the other judges\u0027 decisions.\n\nWere the results biased? Perhaps, just because different people like different types of content. Let me interject that judges were not allowed to vote for themselves; this actually put them at a slight *dis*advantage. I, for one, really liked BaconSpaceProgram\u0027s content because it showcased some nice ideas and some beautiful craft in a way that was quite aesthetically appealing. I can\u0027t remember where I ranked it, but it was somewhere in the top four; several other judges liked it as well. So that\u0027s why it\u0027s a finalist right now.\n\nAnyway, don\u0027t be unhappy about this, tempting though it may be. If you want to discuss this further, shoot me a PM, okay?\n\n-Upsilon"},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T01:52:50Z","Content":"OMG I made it into the finals!!!
