(those can get bad IRL)\n\u003E \n\nI was being a bit tongue-in-cheek:  as moderators, we \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eoften\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E have to deal with people who are upset-- usually with us, sometimes with other users.\n\nOur favorite kind of moderating, of course, is when we get to help people-- for example, finding a post that a newbie has put in the wrong place, and moving it to where it will get the right sort of attention and responses.  Or keeping an eye on the \u0022approval queue\u0022 so we can promptly approve the posts of new members who haven\u0027t racked up enough posts yet to be allowed to post \u0022unsupervised\u0022 (a measure that is, alas, necessary because of all the spambots and scammers out there, who like to prey on forums).  Or getting to do fun things like recognize folks\u0027 contributions with Thread of the Month.  ![:)](//s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kerbal-forum-uploads/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nI would say that actually, *\u003Cu\u003Emost\u003C/u\u003E* of our moderating is of this \u0022good\u0022 kind, largely because the overwhelming majority of forum members are kind, helpful, friendly, people.  This is a *\u003Cu\u003Enice\u003C/u\u003E* place, and most folks get along pretty well, and goodness gracious are we moderators thankful for *\u003Cu\u003Ethat\u003C/u\u003E*.  It\u0027s why we stick around.\n\nBut unfortunately... sometimes things go sour.  Even people who are normally \u0022good citizens\u0022 may be having a really bad day or something and can take comments personally, and end up in fights with other members, where tempers raise to the point of folks forgetting about the rules.  Occasionally, not-so-nice people show up who deliberately troll or otherwise engage in hurtful behavior, and those are always un-fun.\n\nSo we sometimes have to step in and correct such folks... and they are *\u003Cu\u003Enever\u003C/u\u003E* happy about it.  Naturally so.  Everyone always thinks of *\u003Cu\u003Ethemselves\u003C/u\u003E* as reasonable; this is human nature and is hardly surprising.  In cases of conflict, it\u0027s always the other guy\u0027s fault.  Which means, in turn, that on those rare occasions when we have to take action to correct a person... they\u0027re generally not going to be happy about it.  We try to be respectful and matter-of-fact, but nobody likes being told they\u0027re in the wrong on anything, and some folks take it better than others.\n\nSo reactions run the gamut from apologetic to mildly annoyed to very angry to incandescent rage-- it really has more to do with the individual personality than with the actual topic of discussion.  Some people have hotter tempers than others.  We get yelled at, a lot.  Which of course we don\u0027t enjoy, any more than you would-- but we knew that was part of the job when we volunteered.  It can\u0027t really be helped, it goes with the territory, and it\u0027s worth it if it means we can help keep the forum nice for everyone else.  It\u0027s why we do what we do.\n\nAs for *\u003Cu\u003Ewhat\u003C/u\u003E* the topic of contention may be-- e.g. politics or whatever-- there are all sorts of things that folks can run up against; and in any case, out of respect for people\u0027s privacy, we can\u0027t give you any examples.  Sorry.  ![:/](//s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kerbal-forum-uploads/emoticons/ZNGIcon1.png \u0022:/\u0022)\n\nHowever, if you just take a gander at the [forum rules](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/guidelines/)... well, we\u0027d prefer to have *\u003Cu\u003Eno\u003C/u\u003E* rules if we didn\u0027t have to, so every forum rule that\u0027s there, is there because past experience has shown that it\u0027s necessary to prevent people from doing that thing.
