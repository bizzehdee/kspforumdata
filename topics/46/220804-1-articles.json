These days there should be better options.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI noticed this because \u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Stamp-O-Tron_Ground_Anchor\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe article for the Stamp-O-Tron Ground Anchor\u003C/a\u003E has a big empty box. Apparently it\u0027s been that way for two years. The person who tried to illustrate the less-intuitive way this part is used uploaded a 7.3 MB\u00A0 GIF, and apparently didn\u0027t realize that MediaWiki can\u0027t create a \u0022thumb\u0022 sized version of large animated GIFs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost MediaWiki installations these days would allow replacing GIFs with a vastly more efficient video format e.g. WebM . But the KSP wiki doesn\u0027t have a video extension installed (and doesn\u0027t allow uploading any video format file).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe wiki \u003Cem\u003Edoes\u003C/em\u003E allow uploading WebP files, and browsers have all supported animated WebP since 2020. So I thought I could fix the Stamp-O-Tron article by uploading a correctly-sized animated .webp. But the wiki doesn\u0027t seem to recognize that WebP is an image format; doing [[File:foo.webp]] etc just inserts a link to the file rather than including it as an image on the page.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t yet tried seeing whether the wiki correctly handles a static WebP image; my guess is that it doesn\u0027t, and that accepting WebP files for upload is currently useless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can tell the Wiki hasn\u0027t seen a lot of admin maintenance in a while - for instance, one giveaway is the boxes that continue to claim uploading files is broken, though it, must have been working for years. I can tell I shouldn\u0027t expect miracles. But I wonder whether the WebP issue might not be a difficult fix.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
