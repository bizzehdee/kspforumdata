KasperVld\u0027s word is final, though. There is no appeal beyond him. Reversals do happen, but are rare. Remember, we are constantly talking things over in a chat while we work, and each infraction requires the approval of a more senior moderator anyway, so it\u0027s not coming from just one person, but rather reflects the effort of the team. For that reason, the seniors have rarely deemed it necessary to un-do a moderation action. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E *1- What is the funniest piece of spam you\u0027ve ever come across on the forums?*\n\nA badly translated recipe. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E ...
