The unfortunate reality is that this format is not suitable for questions that cannot be answered instantly with a direct solution. And because KSP is a complex game - and tech support is a complex topic, too - most questions and problem reports are not answerable like that. You need at least a brief discussion in almost all cases; and moreover, an extended answer discussion often teaches the asking party about additional useful things they never knew before. However, the forum is configured by default to pull posts out of chronological order as soon as votes are cast.
