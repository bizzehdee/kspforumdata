I see people naming these threads, then other people telling them the name doesn\u0027t fit, and not being able to change it, so I\u0027ll tell you here.\n\nYou are able to rename threads in the forum on Windows by:\n\nHold Ctrl\n\nDouble click a thread\u0027s name (only if you made the thread)\n\nEnter the new name\n\nPress \u0022Enter\u0022 or \u0022Return\u0022 or whatever\n\nClose the extra tabs that opened\n\nDone.
