post we add a translation too.\u00A0\u00A0 I don\u0027t trust computer translations any more than anybody else, and if the automatic translation is faulty, somebody who does speak the language will usually speak up and correct us.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut for KSP, most of our discussions in languages other than English outside the \u0027international\u0027 subforums, center around technical issues.\u00A0 Nuance is not a concern really.\u00A0\u00A0 A bolt is a bolt, even if you call it the wrong thing.\u00A0\u00A0 We\u0027ll figure out that you mean the Rhino engine even

on in Croatian, I can always tell when they start talking about work related things, as the English terms for the technical things slip into their conversation.\u00A0\u00A0 After hearing them discuss the exact angle that a particular chamfer needs to be cut at, I asked them what the Croatian term for Chamfer was, and none of them knew.\u00A0\u00A0 They just used the English word for it.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah, while nuance can get lost in translations, we are lucky to be discussing topics that usually don\u0027t deal with it.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 The exact phrasing might be off, but we\u0027ll figure it out, even if we have to resort to pointing and waving.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 In KSP, if it\u0027s in space, then we understand that
