If you guys are like me, you\u0027ve owned KSP for a while now. And in that time you\u0027ve probably watched KSP change significantly, but you probably don\u0027t visit the Steam store page very often. For whatever reason I was there earlier and I noticed, though Squad adds the latest videos to the store page, some of the screenshots are downright ancient. I think one of them is from the demo and I was thinking, man these things are out of date. I wonder when Squad will update them, maybe when the game hits beta or is finally finished and released as such?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-07T13:17:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood question, actually.
