Not a proper solution really as Ctrl-V should work fine.\n\nThis is clearly an issue with my setup though, not an issue with the forum, so I\u0027ll keep looking for a solution.\n\nUpdate... the issues seems to be related to addons I have install in Firefox. If I disable all of them the Ctrl V behaviour is back to normal, as well as a completly different issue I\u0027ve been looking into. The ones I have are the same as in my old Win 7 install (installed using Sync in Firefox) but one of them must be not playing nicely in the new OS.\n\nAt least I have something to look into now.\n\nUpdated update... found out what it was, it was Internet Download Manager. It was set to use Ctrl as a hotkey to force downloading of things clicked on with IDM. That\u0027s the same setup as I had in Win 7, which worked fine, but for some reason in the Win 10 install it breaks my use of Ctrl V in this specific way. Disables the feature now (didn\u0027t use it anyway) and the problem is now fixed.\n\n![58kcKFf.png](https://i.imgur.com/58kcKFf.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-06-23T04:14:44Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2019 04:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by purpleivan**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-23T16:28:07Z","Content":"When I paste a pic into a post it displays as a link until I hit the submit button and then the image replaces the text.
