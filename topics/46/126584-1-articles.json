Snark talking. I\u0027m forced into it because of a cascade of bugs that has gotten me irretrievably wedged. I\u0027m posting on my phone. First I tried to reply to RIC\u0027s post with a quote. Then I discovered that it has a bug on the mobile version, such that no matter where I position the caret, anything I type goes inside the quote box. Then I couldn\u0027t cancel my post because there\u0027s no cancel button anymore. So I tried going back to the forum and reloading the page, and just submitting a non-quoted reply, except that it appears to have remembered my borked state server-side and puts the RIC quote box right back again and won\u0027t let me type anything outside it. So apparently the forum has me by the throat and won\u0027t let me escape until I post this, so I will. Apologies again. Apologies also for the long run-on paragraph, but it instantly auto deletes any newlines I try to insert. By now I forget what my original point was, so I\u0027ll stop here. If any moderator can fix this post so that it doesn\u0027t appear to be a Red Iron Crown post, I would appreciate it.
