Whether they are useful implies that they have a purpose beyond being interesting.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPoint 3, as pollsters, I don\u0027t think that what you\u0027re trying to find out is relevant. If anything this will cause an even deeper level of skew. Better by far to keep the responders blind to your own views beyond the words in the question.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPoint 4, well you\u0027ve got to set some limits otherwise polls are so long and scathing that they feel like an inquisition.

Nobody should feel that creating a poll for whatever reason isn\u0027t an option for them. Polls are an interesting and different way to collect views without getting everybody to write a reply and then tallying up who thinks what. Personally I\u0027m done polling for now because I\u0027m sick of the bad taste it leaves in my mouth when all I\u0027m doing is asking everybody a question. This is what it comes down to - I\u0027m interested in what answers I might get to a question, but I don\u0027t want a long drawn out thread about it that\u0027s bound to be heated, sometimes offensive, and end up spinning off on wild tangents. Polls keep the question to the point.

They could only be more scientific if they were targetted somehow, but on a public forum there is no way to enforce or ensure that your targets actually respond. So, the idea that the information can be used to draw meaningful conclusions is a bit far-fetched, which is why I have generally avoided doing so. Nonetheless, they do constitute a kind of abstract evidence that can help moderate attitudes and quasi-quantify a general mood into something a very little more solid than a vague pervasive impression. Moderation is exactly the opposite of cage-rattling. If the discussions are heated, it is probably more to do with the sensitivity to the topic than the existence of the poll - people would just get heated about it in other threads instead of \u0027here\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t disagree with you here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy thoughts were aimed really at whatever polls that may be created, and wanting to make them a bit \u0027clearer\u0027 in their aims.
