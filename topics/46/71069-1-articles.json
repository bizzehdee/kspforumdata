I find myself checking it 4-5 times per day. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Yet I cannot help but wonder if there is an easier way to find the most recent additions. I find myself pouring through all the pages trying to find the most recent mods, when there should be a way to change the list structure within the forum. It seems to me that there is really no order to the way they come up on page one. I may be an idiot (on certain planets), and please correct me if I am wrong or just over looking and option to display the list in a different way. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E ~Jebadibus~\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-30T21:15:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe forum logic is to show more recent posts first (unless you want to filter threads), so it is not the proper tool for mod updates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, KSP Spaceport actually has that functionality (showing latest additions) but many mods are not loaded there, so you won\u0027t find them all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are some addon managers that would recognize updates, but because mods are uploaded in all different sites, neither those can cover all mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI keep doing the same you do, checking all threads in the addon section, and most new additions or updates are found because I can recognize on the fly that something changed in the thread title, or that a mod author has posted something new. But that takes a lot of time, and I do so also for other reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few addons actually embed some checker, so each of them would connect to a remote site and find if an update is there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jebadibus","CreatedById":105373,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-30T23:14:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the quick response... And that makes sense. Until there is a universal \u0022check\u0022 implemented into all mods, we will just have to comb through it all. And that\u0027s ok... Although by going through them all I always find something new to add to my massive collection of mods... kinda like a kerbal in a candy store.... I\u0027m sure by the time the game moves into it\u0027s final form, some type of mod version check will be implemented with a multitude of options to suit everyones \u0022Mod Adding Needs\u0022.
