I always seem to remember it being most\u00A0relevant first, but now it seems to be always newest first and must be manually switched over to relevance after searching. This means you have to effectively search again, and run into the (presumably) anti-DoS timeout unless you want to sift through pages of irrelevant posts or topics\u00A0with the newest at the top. On relevance first the major threads come first, and these threads are probably what most searchers want, so why was it changed?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr am I being an idiot and it was always that way?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-15T23:19:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooks like it is different.
