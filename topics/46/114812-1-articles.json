This gives them one white bar on their Reputation counter, meaning that they are the famous...\n\n***White Bar Group!***\n\nThis is meant to be a catalog for newbies and experienced forum-goers alike, as to the silliest and most likely to fuss with their profile settings individuals on the KSP forums. If one of these guys stops by to say hello on a thread, or even give reputation, be sure to say hi!\n\nSince they don\u0027t show up on the member list, you WILL have post in this thread for me to find you.\n\nHere they are, in order of decreasing silliness:\n\nn)Mad Rocket Scientist. He made this list, which instantly rockets him up to the top of the list. Because I say so. He is clearly the awesomest guy on the forums, as he\u0027s on the top of this list!\n\nn)Zucal. He first tipped the most awesome Mad Rocket Scientist of as to this feature, so he deserves a sort of sidekick level fame. Builds great craft, too! WHITE IRON CROWN HAS RETURNED!\n\nn)DuoDex. He\u0027s a moderator, so good work on that. He\u0027s on Mad Rocket Scientist\u0027s friend list, so he deserves a passing mention, right after 45nd unit 34th gaffer CGI department secretary to 5th assistant shader. Being a mod sounds like a hard job, so kudos to him for that. Claims that he was the first to use this feature, if anyone can prove that, nothing could change.\n\nn)Kenbobo. Do I know him? He\u0027s the PS4 hypetrain driver. He likes Space oddity, and Star Trek, so he gets some mention. He started the 1.0 hypetrain, so like, *whatever*. Says he\u0027s a \u0022nebraskan that likes corn\u0022 if that\u0027s funny, tell me.\n\nn)SaturnianBlue. I was actually able to type his username without looking, so that means that he\u0027s helped lots on the American rockets project, which, since it was started by me, means that he gets some of the awesomeness that rubbed off of ME!!!!\n\nn)The Laythe Initiative.Dres. Changed his old username, driving me crazy!!!!! His username was hard to type, so I considered removing him from the list, but I realized that he didn\u0027t care about being on the list, so he had to be.\n\nn)Spartwo. He\u0027s a \u0022Militarist\u0022, whatever *that\u0027s* supposed to mean, and he has a bit over 3,000 posts, which clearly indicates that he\u0027s barely worthy of this list. He builds interesting craft, though.\n\nn)Fel. He does... something. And he does it well. If I figure out what he does, I\u0027ll tell you. Pretty sure I\u0027ve never seen him before, so this spot at the bottom of the list is only a bit to high.\n\nn)sal\\_vager. He\u0027s a moderator, he has a awesome avatar, and he... fights fires. Virtual fires. If you see any virtual fires, tell him. He doesn\u0027t have a profile pic, so he obviously deserves the nth spot on this list.\n\nn)Columbia. He has a Space Shuttle as an avatar, which clearly indicates that he prefers cheap American engineering over quality Russian engineering. He\u0027s on Mad Rocket Scientist\u0027s friend list, though, so he has that much going for him.\n\nn)Starwhip. He is clearly extremely cruel to stars and should be abolished from this list. \\*Sniff\\* Those poor, maltreated, stars. What did they ever do to him! \\*Sniff\\* Also, he defiles save files, another reason to not have him on this list.\n\nn)UnionPacific1983WP. Has 24 posts, doesn\u0027t care where he is, and agrees with the majority of living humans that twitter is a is a website on the internet. Clearly grounds for expulsion from this list, except he likes trains, and so does Mad Rocket Scientist.\n\nn)RAINCRAFTER. All caps username? Cheater. But he says that he\u0027ll never get on the light green group, so he deserves our... something. Sympathy? I wouldn\u0027t know, I\u0027m on the light green group.\n\nn)Joshwoo69. Creates backpacks, so that\u0027s nice. Lurks on twitch streams, which I do too. Also, clearly deserving of this nth spot on the list.\n\nn)Overfloater. You didn\u0027t think I could find you, did you? He says he floats over, but if anyone would take the time to explain to him that that\u0027s not possible without a hot air balloon.\n\nn)regex. According to someone else\u0027s sig (the only real to get info) he has as many infractions as a troll! He mostly posts in general, clearly making him a obvious choice for this spot on this list.\n\nn)worir4. He doesn\u0027t blink, and has *Quotes in his sig!* I know, right? Weirdo... He was the hypetrain nosecone, though.\n\nn)LABHOUSE. Since their \u00222\u0022 looks like a \u0022Z\u0022, they gets on this list, with the MRS seal of \u0022semi-approval\u0022.\n\nn)Vagani. Builds cars. That\u0027s right, *cars!* in a game about spaceships! He\u0027s making a movie, with a plot, and a crew. He says his cars were voted best on Kerbin. BY WHO?\n\nn)SpaceLaunchSystem. Makes some replicas... but with ***MODS!*** Burn the heathen. He is a unskilled modder, which is nice for him, I suppose, but, still, MODS? Right? Like, I know!\n\nn)windows\\_x\\_seven. His video made my browser lag, he can\u0027t build a SSTO, PLUS he loves the round-8 tank. Why is he on this list again? Oh yeah, he\u0027s on my friend list. Ahh well, \u0027tis the curse of fame. Said his description was too light-hearted. MWHA HA HA! DIEEEEE! DIEEE! lol omg epic noob! ![:mad:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif)\n\nn)Red Iron Crown. He typed his normal password into the username box, he once impersonated squad, and once made the forums explode with a alter ego with negative rep. Clearly not worthy of the most awesome white bar group, but he\u0027s given me rep twice.\n\nn)Kozak. Used to be called \u0022Waffle Master\u0022, and he used to master waffles, so, if you\u0027re a waffle: Panic, and run, not walk, to the nearest exit/airlock/egress point, etc.\n\nn)LavaCake. Used to think that the mun was made out of cheese. He owns a company that builds cars. And he joined because of another Forumer. TRIPLE THREAT!\n\nn)FireFaced. Says he\u0027s on the surface of Jool, so he\u0027s a liar. If he can give us the EVA report from Jool\u0027s surface, I\u0027d believe him, but until then... E: Now has a EVA report from Jool, supposedly.\n\nn)DMSP. Says it\u0027s spelled DMSP, but I think it\u0027s DSMP. Recently exploded, leaving a expanding cloud of more than 50,000 pieces of debris.\n\nn)Gojira. Likes IRL rockets, and wastes his signature, cluttering up the forums in a extremely rude manner. Now has no signature, wasting the forum\u0027s space even worse! He *says* he\u0027s 17, but... don\u0027t believe everything you read.\n\nn)Yakuzi. He\u0027s a \u0022Spaceplane shaman\u0022 which Mad Rocket Scientist is not, so I should abolish him from this list. Still has a Round-8 profile pic.\n\nn)AlphaAsh. He makes mods to add new bases to Kerbin. *BORING!* Says: I\u0027m a geek, I\u0027m a know-it-all, I\u0027m arrogant. EDIT: It\u0027s Monday. That\u0027s arrogant. Wednesday is obnoxious.\n\nn)Yukon0009. He\u0027s a Weavy Geapons Huy, which means he takes spoonerisms to a whole new level. He lied about his age on the forum sign-up page, and would be banished from the forums, except he\u0027s on MRS\u0027 friend list. \n\nn)Kaboom!. Has punctuation in his user name. Yes, that\u0027s right, *punctuation in his user name*! Would be removed from this list, except he isn\u0027t on it yet.\n\nn)Kuzzter. Makes a graphic novel, which is okay enough for this list, but really, not. We\u0027re only kidding ourselves, list fame 5 sorta. Did some thing called \u0022Eve rocks,\u0022 which I assume has something to do with a rock called \u0022Eve\u0022 on the side of a Welsh mountain.\n\nn)2001kraft. WHY DID YOU DO IT!! AHH! You spelt \u0022craft\u0022 \u0022kraft\u0022 ahh, the pain!! You know, every time you spell craft that way, a \u0022C\u0022 dies. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif) What a monster!\n\nn)Laythe Dweller. Actually requested a blurb! Ha ha ha! He wants this written about him: Nobody really knows anything about this guy. He did something with Krakens, I think. Just another noob. Ha ha ha! As if he could influence what\u0027s written about him! I would remove him from the forums right now, but, like any self-respecting supervillian, I\u0027ll leave him because he \u0022has spirit,\u0022 so he can survive to plot my downfall.\n\nn)CelticCossack51. Every time I see his username, I think of this:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E ![bm3.gif](http://sixtiescity.net/Batman/bm3.gif)\n\n\u003E  So he gets on the list.\n\nn)WinkAllKerb\u0027. That is a weird username. Says he\u0027s mostly grumpy, but not mostly. *Riiight.* \\*Backs away slowly, and adds to list\\*\n\nn)TheMoonRover. Is his avatar a reference to extremely unrealistic movie? Does he really advertise a mod which adds very old parts from KSP? Did he edit that post? Why did he join this group? Is this a question? Wait, who\u0027s writing this? Am I channeling Lemony Snicket? Now I\u0027m confused?\n\nn)K3achas. Actually says he\u0027s a awesome person! Sounds like a superiority complex to me. This is responsible for the paradox in which those with an inferiority complex are the ones who present themselves in the best light possible; while those with a superiority complex may not attempt to make themselves look good. Actually, this cheap knock-off complex probably does nothing.\n\nn)Bev7787. 95% of his explosions are on purpose. His occupation is adding struts, maybe SpaceX should hire him. He would be removed from this list, but his sig says he still supports the go stock movement.\n\n n)xtoro. Captain, we have a strange object on scanners! Go to visual. It appears to be an opinion about rep! Go to red alert! Man battle stations! Prepare anti-matter cannons! Aye aye, sir! Oh no, it\u0027s using it\u0027s rep-is-meaningless cannons! The engines canna take more of this! Shields to full! Prepare conventional ranking cannons! FIRE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We hit it, sir!\n\nn)Lime. Has a BLOG! That\u0027s right, a blog! Incredible! Unbearable! Of all the absurd, inane, insane, illegal, stupid, absurd things, a blog! Oh, wait, I have one. Never mind.\n\nWant to know how much rep you have? Want to be a white bar?
