Just now went and checked my notification history (by the highly scientific method of checking my last ten pages\u0027 worth of notifications, i.e. 250 of them, and seeing how long ago that covers), and it looks as though I get around 17-18 notifications per day on average, at least for the last couple of weeks.\n\nBear in mind, of course, that how many notifications you get also depends on how you have set up your [notification settings](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/notifications/options/).  Not everybody wants to get notified for the same things.  And if you\u0027ve chosen to be notified for things like \u0022someone I follow posts something\u0022, then that\u0027ll depend on how many people you choose to follow, and so forth.\n\nMy own notifications aren\u0027t particularly uniform in frequency over time; it fluctuates quite a bit.  For example, if I happen to post something that\u0027s unexpectedly suddenly [popular](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/181395-surface-area-of-ksp-bodies-in-perspective/), that can pile up quite a few \u0022likes\u0022 in a short time.  Another major source of notifications is people quoting me-- which of course tends to happen only when I\u0027ve been posting something, and my posting habits aren\u0027t super uniform.\n\nPlus, \u0022how many\u0022 notifications can also depend on variables such as how often I log in to the forum.  Not sure if you\u0027ve noticed, but the forum software is designed to reduce \u0022notification spam\u0022 by collapsing multiple \u0022likes\u0022 from various people into a single notification.  That is, say you post something and log off, and then ten people like it, and then you log on.  Instead of getting ten notifications, you get *\u003Cu\u003Eon\u003C/u\u003E*\u003Cu\u003Ee\u003C/u\u003E*,* which says something like \u0022Vanamonde, Snark, Dman979, and 7 others reacted to a post in a topic Why Doesn\u0027t Anyone Like Me\u0022.  Whereas, if you were online and checking your notifications frequently, you would have gotten ten separate notifications for it, since the forum won\u0027t pile someone\u0027s \u0022like\u0022 onto an existing notification if you\u0027ve already *\u003Cu\u003Eseen\u003C/u\u003E* that notification.\n\nAs a moderator, I tend to check the forum pretty frequently on my phone (to clear out the approval queue, if nothing else), which means the forum rarely has the opportunity to \u0022stack\u0022 my notifications much this way.  So I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if that tends to inflate my notification count, compared with some hypothetical forum user who\u0027s not constantly checking things.\n\nOut of curiosity, I went just now and tallied up my most recent few dozen notifications by \u0022type\u0022.  Here\u0027s what the breakdown was (bearing in mind that the \u0022likes\u0022 include some stacking such as I describe above):\n\n- 54% - reactions\n- 18% - moderator stuff\n- 14% - quoted\n- 12% - mentioned\n- 2% - got followed\n\nSo it\u0027s a bit of a grab bag, but for me at least, \u0022reactions\u0022 are the most common by a fairly wide margin.  Actual @-pings are a pretty small minority."},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-19T15:36:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 10 hours ago, Kerbalstar said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E First, is it possible to add a poll to an existing post (that is not a poll), and if so how?\n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 9 hours ago, Vanamonde said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1.
