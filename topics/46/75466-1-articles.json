I have bought a game I actually DO NOT REGRET whatsoever in the slightest. I am having the time of my life, never thought I would be into space and all its travels and complications, yet now I find myself browsing the web until early hours of the morning for any interesting articles related. In a way KSP has helped me find a piece of myself I never knew existed. A hidden interstellar network of neurons I\u0027ve never had reason to process. So for that a big thank you to SQUAD and all affiliates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The forums, It is hard to come across a forum full of mature people who have a love for physics and space travel. It is just so nice to be able to get respectable decent responses from members all looking to lend a hand and help out, or just to share things/stories they love. You guys are great! I am yet to be proven wrong on this point touch wood but I am loving it here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The guys making mods, I am yet to delve into them but from what I hear there is some great work being done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically I just felt I needed to share my appreciation for whats going on here.
