Every Time it is brought up, it is quickly suppressed, and that bothers me a lot. I understand it was made a rule, but sometimes even the thought or words of something related gets taken down. Even in the off-topic section I have seen my fair share of political comments taken down. It just bothers me to the core. IF they made a section on politics, it would let people say stuff about crappy leaders, and let them focus on science and KSP on the different sections.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CommanderSpork","CreatedById":153170,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-24T03:32:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt sounds good in theory. If there was a particular section just for politics, it would stay there and keep it out of the rest of the forums, right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, yeah, but it would do more harm than good. First off, I don\u0027t think Squad wants to have raging political arguments on their forums. Not only does it have nothing to do with KSP, it does not look good for them or for the forums to have that mess going on. It makes the whole board look less controlled and less appealing. A politics section also creates unnecessary rifts between everyone involved. People, especially internet people, are quite\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eenthusiastic\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0about their candidate of choice and can become very bitter that someone else has a different favorite. In real life most people will look past this and agree to disagree because they\u0027re talking to a physical person standing in front of them. Once you remove the physical aspect though, as with\u00A0basically any comment section, internet folks will actually resent each other over political opinions. And this will carry outside of the seemingly contained section - even if it\u0027s not full on resentment, there will definitely be more dislike going around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-24T04:15:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIIRC, there are other forums for politics around the internet...
