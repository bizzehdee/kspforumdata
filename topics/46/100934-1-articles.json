I don\u0027t speak English well too, but I try, I make mistakes like everyone. But that does not mean that they should do a separate forum for Chinese, Polish, Russians, etc. we are here together it is so great. While the English speaking people will not point out meanly spelling mistakes to us ."},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T12:24:24Z","Content":"There is, of course, the International forum. I believe the general policy for foreign-language forums is that if there is a sufficient amount of activity (I don\u0027t really know where the threshold is, if it\u0027s indeed been concretely defined) in the International forum in a certain language, a forum for that language will be created to accommodate those users."},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T21:02:20Z","Content":"I\u0027m a native speaker of Mandarin, but my writing/posting in said language is terrible, so I wouldn\u0027t be able to moderate an official Chinese subforum very well.\n\nI know of a number of unofficial Chinese KSP forums, but based on my observations, most of the posts essentially boil down to people redistributing outdated mods, as well as other people \u002B1ing the first group of people - I\u0027ve seen very few, if any, users in these communities talk about orbital or gameplay mechanics in the same way the main KSP Community does (I might be wrong, but perhaps their perception is that KSP is just another game to them).\n\nThe few who do venture into these official forums, mainly for support issues, also get frustrated quickly due to their inability (not just language-wise) to articulate the specific details of the issue - I seldom see them sharing / interpreting log files or screenshots, for instance.\n\nEssentially, based on my observations, I\u0027m not sure if a Chinese subforum is justifiable if most users are just going to \u002B1 each other most of the time."},{"CreatedByName":"Rich","CreatedById":17874,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T21:21:35Z","Content":"There was a thread for Mandarin speaking players, though it has not seen any activity in about 2 months (l[ink](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24675-Chinese-%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87/page4)).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-28T21:37:42Z\u0022 title=\u002202/28/2015 09:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Rich**"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T22:02:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E There was a thread for Mandarin speaking players, though it has not seen any activity in about 2 months (l[ink](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24675-Chinese-%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87/page4)).\n\nI think I\u0027ve read that thread before.\n\nMost of the posts are referrals to other unofficial Chinese KSP user forums, or complaints about the lack of Chinese-language articles on the official wiki."}]}
