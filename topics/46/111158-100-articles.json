It\u0027s not as detailed as you might think-- after all, the forum rules stay the same, it\u0027s not like there\u0027s anything special and different to do. Mainly it\u0027s just to make sure we\u0027ve got enough hands on deck to cope.\n\nAlso bear in mind that although we do try to keep an eye on things, we can\u0027t be everywhere all the time.

It\u0027s hard to overstate how valuable (and vital) that is.\n\nThat said... actually, I\u0027ve been very pleasantly surprised by the last day or two. We\u0027ve had remarkably little work to do.
