Sometimes it works, oftentimes it doesn\u0027t. I\u0027m trying to reply to a 5 point post, and 1 and 2 split as per the above statement, and the rest don\u0027t. With forum source as a thing, I could just throw formatting tags in, but instead I\u0027m stuck with a series of annoying choices to try and make it look the way I want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026lt;EDIT\u0026gt; So I just went back to my window, and hit enter twice, and split them all.

Sometimes the \u0022hit enter twice\u0022 works flawlessly, other times I slam enter 10 times and I just get returns added to the quote, and I feel like throwing my keyboard.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeems like an online editor could not possibly care about when the 2 enters happen, but if it does, my guess is that it\u0027s looking for a \u0022double click\u0022 within a certain time interval, and latency might be to blame. Minus a time constraint, it seems like I should be able to hit enter, go get a cup of coffee, hit enter again, and the quote would be split.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-23T17:48:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI split quotes by quoting twice and removing the excess manually.\u00A0 Trying to use the \u0027features\u0027 of this disaster of a forum software is just going to leave you frustrated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-23T17:49:13Z\u0022 title=\u002208/23/2016 05:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-23T19:04:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe trick, as far as I can see, is that the enter that splits a quote must be made on an empty line between two paragraphs. If you are at the end of a paragraph two hits of enter does the trick (one to make the blank line, one to split). If you are splitting a paragraph, you must hit enter twice (once to make a new paragraph, then another to make a blank line), then move the cursor up to that blank line and hit enter again to split.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can also select text in the posts anywhere on the page and hit the \u0022Quote this\u0022 button that appears, only the selected text will be quoted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ryan Edward","CreatedById":169387,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-26T08:03:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthanks for making this thread!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
