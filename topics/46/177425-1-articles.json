Additionally, if you need a rocket built for you, simply post in one of the existing threads asking the \u0027Company\u0027 to design and build you a rocket/craft.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if you made many craft they could be shown there under one banner, or you could work as a group. Also, you could make requests to have craft built by the \u0022companies\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I believe it was started before rules against role-playing were instituted on the forums, and so it was removed from public view entirely during the forum update (the moderators likely have a copy of it). Strictly speaking, the entire concept was based around roleplaying, however many people were upset by the decision to remove it,\u00A0especially since some of the older threads were entirely wiped because (unlike active threads) the OPs were not active during the grace period to copy their threads over. I believe there were some actual examples of rule-breaking happening in some of the older threads too, and the rule against roleplay makes sense, but many of the threads were simply showcases and requests, although that was allowed to continue in the spacecraft exchange, minus the roleplay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/23840-zekes/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002223840\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/23840-zekes/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@zekes\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0said this about it, which I think is pretty much what everyone thought:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well this is a large blow to me and I\u0027m going to try to come up with some two cents to say about it, if I end up just blowing hot air in circles feel free to ignore me.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Rocket Builders have been dying. It\u0027s gone on for the past year, and I\u0027ve been discussing it with a lot of other people. It was a great fun place a few years ago, but now it\u0027s hollow, the companies mean nothing anymore, there are no engineers working for them, and partnerships don\u0027t have a meaning (if they ever did at all, it\u0027s been lost on me).\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNevertheless, I feel a certain nostalgia to the place that really is tied to KSP. I started on the forums because of SSL and Giggleplex, and their companies. My own company was based off of SSL, and For the past 3 years it\u0027s been where I hang out and enjoy KSP the most. Now, granted it\u0027s had it\u0027s ups and downs and I am partially responsible for a lot of the downs, but for better or for worse it was a part of me, of KSP. Just deleting the Rocket Builders will tear out three years of my life, three years of KSP conversations, of working to build up a community, of the past glory days of massive craft releases and conversations between builders. Getting rid of the Rocket Builders means things that i have worked on, names that I built will be lost. I\u0027m quite sure most of you have at least heard of Zokesia Skunkworks through the years. But now that\u0027s *POOF* gone. Three years of legacy just deleted.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHow can I go on playing KSP knowing that most of the things I\u0027ve built, most of the things I\u0027ve spent my time in will be gone? I have put in hours and hours of work into running and managing my Rocket Builder Company, and I imagine the moderators see us as nothing but an annoying subforum, but Please at least understand we put so much time into what we built. So much time and memories will be gone if you just delete our forum. I say \u0022our\u0022 forum because I really never felt part of the rest of the KSP forum - i\u0027m not a modder, I\u0027m not a craft competetor, I\u0027m not a troubleshooter, I\u0027m not a greeter or game player. Or at least that doesn\u0027t mean as much to me as the RB forum does.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo if you\u0027re going to delete it, remember how much love, time, and effort some of us have put into it. Remember that without my company there is little reason to play KSP apart from the occasional craft release. I\u0027m just sorry after all these years our forum\u0027s only achievement is being a nuisance to the rest of the forum and that we\u0027re not fit to continue on existing, or ever having a record of existing, in the future of the community.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nRespectfully,\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nZekes, CEO and Founder of Zokesia Skunkworks.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was not as badly affected, as I had joined much more recently, and never did very much collaborative building.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried to backup the entirety of the subforum (there were only 25 pages) to the internet archive, but with only 7 days between the announcement and the wipe, I was only able to archive some of the larger threads.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that, some of the people (like myself) moved their threads to the spacecraft exchange, but since it used to be more busy, they would only be visible when a new craft was released, and served just as showcases. Which, in many ways, was fine, but it was never the same. Personally, I mostly made replicas of real world or fictional vehicles, so it worked fine.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever,\u00A0even later I and many of the serious replica builders\u00A0began to drift away from the forums, or at least from replica building. I got burned out on KSP, and that, combined with college, meant that I stopped looking at the forums for a while. Even now I only have time for this tanks for summer break, and once school starts in a few days I\u0027ll be less active here. I think many others have had similar experiences.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short, it is a\u00A0forgone conclusion that all forums will die, and the KSP forum is no exception. At the time of the removal, the rocket builders, as a smaller part of the forums, was already dying. While that meant that objectively, it impacted the forums as a whole less than if it was very active, it still felt like it was being killed instead of being left to die in peace. And I cannot complain about rules against roleplaying, since it is almost impossible to moderate it, I and many others were sad over the loss of what was, even if it was already gone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHopefully that\u0027s a mostly unbiased and clear explanation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-09T01:52:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts demise was due primarily to the roleplay

Its a rule that makes sense for the forum given the complications it could pose. When I spent time in the rocket builders I had a hard time understanding when someone was being legitimate or not. It\u0027s unfortunate but makes sense and should probably stay. Could always go on some private forums and do it where people won\u0027t get confused.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is a collaboration thread like the rocket builder\u0027s can\u0027t exist without some sort of assigned roles and hierarchy... Like... so and so... build this by this deadline... etc. even if it doesn\u0027t have to do with roleplay.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA simple solution could be to just keep these discussions through private messages or emails\u00A0while later posting progress on these projects in the threads themselves.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis sort of thing is already possible on the spacecraft exchange.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem though is\u00A0that in a high volume scenario a lot of stuff gets pushed off the front page of the forum if you have people repeatedly posting in these rocket builders megathreads. If you had like 12 of these threads going on at the same time with a continuous presence on the front page\u00A0lots of personal showcase threads would be pushed off and not many people would get to see them. That\u0027s why it would make sense to make two separate sub-forums in this event in my opinion.
