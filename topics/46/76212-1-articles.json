After looking through the FAQ section of the forums, I still can\u0027t figure out how to post images from my own computer (I have some screenshots of a FAR aerodynamics boxplane that I made and want to post). The FAQ talks about images in attachments, but the box at the bottom of my screen says that I may not post attachments (Can anyone post attachments, for that matter?) I know how to post images from ULRs, so the only way I can see to post images would be to upload my images to other websites, then link to the image ULR. So, what do I do to post images that I have taken?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-28T23:43:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vaporo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vaporo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI know how to post images from ULRs, so the only way I can see to post images would be to upload my images to other websites, then link to the image ULR.

You can upload directly to the main page, to include making albums.

They do give you a \u0022delete\u0022 link that you can copy and paste somewhere (like into a word document), then you can use that link later if you want to delete a picture that isn\u0027t in your account.
