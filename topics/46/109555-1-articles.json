I remembered just now that that was supposed to redirect me to forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com, but it\u0027s strange that the browser didn\u0027t warn me that I was stepping down from HTTPS to HTTP for all this time.\n\nWhen I tried connecting to the forums (the subdomain) through HTTPS, the connection is simply refused.\n\nSo why is there SSL for the entire KSP main website but not the forums? Just too expensive to buy a cert, or is there a technical complication?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T19:54:41Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 07:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by longbyte1**\n  \nCaps filter is being dumb again"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T15:06:48Z","Content":"It\u0027s come up before, but it\u0027s not high priority at this point. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Fel","CreatedById":57121,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T17:17:03Z","Content":"I wonder though.\n\nI use a mild-security password for my KSP Download account and a zero-security password for my forum account; I consider forums to be easily hacked and very bad security over all; regardless of using SSL or not. Hence why I detest when forums get full of themselves and try to make you create a \u0022secure password,\u0022 forum security is notoriously bad, if someone wants to attack the server and get a copy of the hash table, they likely can. And since fast hashes are likely in employ (again, forum \u0022security\u0022) it can easily be broken.\n\nDoes SQUAD consider the frivolous nature of forum security as reason not to bother with SSL, or is it purely a cost issue?"}]}
