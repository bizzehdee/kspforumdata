Currently it\u0027s in play for the Skyrim workshop, but there\u0027s no reason to believe other publishers and developers won\u0027t be quick to jump on the bandwagon. It\u0027s also having as big a backlash as one might expect of such and has stirred up a massive debate about both the feasibility and, for lack of a better term, *ethics* of the idea.\n\nConsidering there\u0027s been plenty of discussion about whether or not KSP could someday get its own Steam workshop, I think this merits a question put towards Squad with a request for a very clear answer: *in the event* that Kerbal Space Program does gain Steam workshop functionality, and that as of such time publishers and developers have the option of allowing users to charge for access to their workshop items, would you allow such monetization of the Kerbal Space Program workshop? Yes or No?\n\nIf you answer \u0022Yes\u0022 to the previous question, then please answer the following question: what percent, out of 100% total, would you delegate to the user as their cut of the item\u0027s sale? For reference, Bethesda is giving workshop uploaders 25% of all workshop item sales."},{"CreatedByName":"vfernandez84","CreatedById":107377,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T22:45:23Z","Content":"KSP modders earning money from their mods?

On this site and Curse, the modding rules allow donation links but specifically prohibit them within the game and all mods must have their source code, if any, freely available for inspection by players/other modders (regardless of license). Therefore, Squad is highly unlikely to allow monetization of mods through Steam Workshop.\n\nRest easy, friends.

For one- I have little desire to have them and when I do want them I want a LOT of them. Besides KSP has a history, a community and a system that works best for mods being free.\n\nNow I have no issues with mods making money and if I could- I would donate to some of the groups that make mods. Donations are what make the mods go round the most. \n\nSo- no. This is not for KSP...
