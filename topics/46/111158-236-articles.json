And yeah, I am vocally saying I do not like the changes but also want tor remind folks that our guys who handle this stuff for T2/Squad isn\u0027t where our anger should be focused. And yes, now that you mention it, I was quite happy with the the pre-update software. But even where I work, there seems to be this love of redesigning end user interfaces for no other reason than ***because we can***.  That, quite possibly is the *worst* reason to change a user interface system - even if it is just forum software.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, ColdJ said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I also think the choices for names of the ranks is going to greatly annoy some real world people who work in the space industry.\n\u003E \n\nThis is a forum for a game.
