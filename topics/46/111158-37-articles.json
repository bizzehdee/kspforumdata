Be helpful, be positive, be constructive. Nothing demonstrates concern for a community\u0027s well-being like a willingness to volunteer your time and brainpower to helping new (and some not-so-new) members with any questions they may have and encouraging those who have shown particular skill or ambition in creating add-ons or fan content. Demonstrating maturity and thoughtfulness in your regular posting activity is also a major advantage.\n\nNone of this means you can\u0027t have a little fun from time to time, of course ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Is giving a poster a heads up about potentially breaking a rule to give them a chance to fix it if they didn\u0027t realize it was wrong considered backseat moderating?\n\nIn my own assessment it\u0027s all about context, really, and particularly whether or not it appears to be in good faith. Something like \u0022Hey, you forgot to put a license up for your mod download, might wanna fix that\u0022 will most likely get a pass; something like \u0022OMG necro / rule-breaking content, mods plz lock!\u0022 will typically get a PM or a yellow card at least, depending on how much of a pattern you make of posting like that.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E What is your favorite forum section?\n\nI\u0027m rather fond of Gameplay Questions and Tutorials, the Spacecraft Exchange, and Fan Works and their associated subforums, largely because they\u0027re such great showcases of all the best aspects of the community as a whole (creativity, helpfulness, celebration of others\u0027 accomplishments).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Wow, actually... From someone that has ran forums before and have been a moderator in a few forums, that is not necessarily true. In the case of the now-nonexistant unofficial forum we had running for SimCity 3000, I did get my first taste at moderating - we had a lot to do - like make sure we enforced Maxis\u0027 rules on mods, policing the comments, etc. What I liked about being a moderator is it actually gave me more of a reason to surf the site, to solve problems while they were small, and to just get the opportunity to help shape the forum.

I would jump on the opportunity, if so granted, to get back into moderating a forum - providing it is a forum for something I enjoy or have confidence in (such as the ongoing development of KSP). \n\u003E So, no, for me it is not about getting a funny colored name or some sort of icon to indicate I am a moderator (in fact, in the forum for SC3000, I do not even think I ever uploaded an avatar ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)), about using the skills I have gained by moderating in the past, helping the forum and the support for the game expand to its fullest potential, and at the same time, the ability to give back to a community that has given me so much.\n\nI don\u0027t think Supernovy meant that wanting to be a moderator necessarily means you\u0027ll be a bad moderator by default (though the way it was phrased may not have made it apparent). Rather, making an *unsolicited* request to become a moderator sometimes sets off alarm bells because people can get the impression that they want to be a moderator for the wrong reasons. It\u0027s not something that\u0027ll automatically disqualify you from ever becoming a moderator henceforward and forever, of course, but it is something we take into account when we do make selections to fill open moderation posts (though it\u0027s not necessarily weighed quite as heavily as general forum behavior).\n\nEDIT: Oh hey, a few others popped up:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Do you feel like becoming a moderator has limited your time to making posts and commenting on things unrelated to moderating?\n\nMaybe *slightly*, but I\u0027ve always been rather tight-lipped when I\u0027ve felt I can\u0027t say something that someone else has already covered well enough before me.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Do mods ever give infractions to each other, if warranted? How bout as jokes? What is the best joke you\u0027ve played on another mod?\n\nNot infractions *per se*, but if a moderator misbehaves or appears to have gone off like a loose cannon, we do have ways to address them. I can\u0027t remember any particular incidents where a mod was ever explicitly asked to leave the team off the top of my head, but a few have left over policy decisions they disagreed with and could not enforce in good faith. (No, don\u0027t ask for names or details.)\n\nAs for jokes, the funniest incident *I* remember was the one time that everyone in our Devious Lair of Fiendish Deviousness private moderator chat changed our usernames to something that looked like an absent member\u0027s nickname in order to mess with their head when they logged in. Of course, by the time they *did* log in, we all had already forgotten which name variation belonged to whom, which led to rather more confusion than we had intended.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-29T03:06:25Z\u0022 title=\u002209/29/2015 03:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Specialist290**"},{"CreatedByName":"DuoDex","CreatedById":107061,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-29T00:01:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Do mods ever give infractions to each other, if warranted?
