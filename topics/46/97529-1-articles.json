It looks like Curse has no section-specific search function. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that partially defeats the purpose of a search function: either search and get many irrelevant results, or manually search (browse) the section that might contain the content you are looking for. Both take much more time than need be, which in this case made me stop searching.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurse is in many ways better than the previous mod website, but this particular problem is similar to the major inconvenience for which Spaceport was derided.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-23T13:54:05Z\u0022 title=\u002201/23/2015 01:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rkman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jadedcat","CreatedById":110413,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-24T13:29:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe search function is scheduled for an overhaul.
