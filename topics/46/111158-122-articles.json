Sometimes, though, we don\u0027t inform everyone who may have seen the post.

However, with free speech comes the responsibility to assure that what you are saying, especially within  a forum setting such as this forum, are within the forum guidelines established by the forum owner. Free speech ends when you begin using a product (such as a forum) that is not intended to be a \u0022free speech\u0022 zone. The purpose of this forum has always been to 1) promote the Kerbal Space Program on its various platforms, 2) to give those who enjoy it a place to discuss the game that\u0027s \u0022official\u0022 and controlled by Squad or its designees (moderators), 3) to create a setting where a KSP community  could develop. And because of these goals and Squad\u0027s ownership of the forum, we still have free speech within set boundaries.\n\nWith that said, the thread in question (which I also will not mention) was done with the probable intent of quickly achieving either popularity or readership. Personally, I think it was a younger forum user who has become enamored with a certain part of history  -- mainly the military hardware of that era -- and put no thought into the social or moral aspects of the leadership in question. And it backfired in a mighty way. Yes, the thread did get attention but probably not the attention intended.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, Just Jim said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Wow...

If I think it\u0027s offensive, I will report it. If it is questionable, I will report it. Otherwise, if I just don\u0027t like it, I ignore it because it\u0027s probably my personal opinion regarding the content. As a professional historian, it is my responsibility to educate when facts, events, or people come into question and it is within my ability to provide guidance through an answer.\n\nAnd this is where I ask a moderator to clarify what I have come to understand ( [@Dman979](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/123837-dman979/), [@Vanamonde](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/27914-vanamonde/), or maybe even [@Red Iron Crown](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/12858-red-iron-crown/))  From previous conversations I have had with other moderators (the same ones who\u0027ve awarded me most of my infractions), a removed post that was liked - at least in the old forum, will not change the author\u0027s post count or reduce the likes the user has.

One thing is, for example, \u0022this is a subject we don\u0027t allow discussion because people get personal\u0022. We lock these up, and there\u0027s no further action required. A different situation is, \u0022we don\u0027t allow this content to *be* on the forum, because its very existence is highly offensive and/or harmful to others\u0022. Adult content, for example. We can usually getting by just editing the post, but sometimes we hide it entirely (and let people know in the thread). This is similar, only on a thread-wide scale.\n\nNow, while I agree with [@Kuzzter](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/111501-kuzzter/) that transparency is ideal, in these cases I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a good place to announce the action: there\u0027s no thread left for a post to be made in, and a forum-wide announcement would just draw more attention to the undesired subject and not serve any true purpose, since the people who might complain about the thread gone would most likely have been warned about it already (that is my opinion, other moderators\u0027 might differ)\n\n[@adsii1970](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/89014-adsii1970/) Ha.
