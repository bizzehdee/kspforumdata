You\u0027ll need hardware that runs 24/7 (it\u0027s amazing how quickly things break when they don\u0027t get one minute of downtime), reliable forum software is expensive and needs to be updated on a continuous basis (because of virusses and malware) and bandwidth isn\u0027t, contrary to what many think, free either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no problems with ads. They help providing a service for free that wouldn\u0027t be there (or that needs to be paid for otherwise). And when those ads are well behaved, like the ones I see right now (did Squad complain with the Ad provider?) I have nothing against it. It\u0027s when ads try to draw clicks by pretending to be something different than they are that I dislike, not ads in general.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
