The top is way too cluttered with links; it is a bit overwhelming at first and not really friendly to people not familiar with the forums. In all honesty, there needs to be less links.

When I first registered on the forums here it took me all night to figure out where the private messages were.

This was running SMF forum software on a Nearly Free Speech host. Great forum software for the user, as it had a rather simple bar with the inbox and the user control panel on the top left side. But, it was a pounding migraine of an admin panel, as it took a rocket scientist to figure out the admin panel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
