Do you really think that it\u0027s worth manually auditing every page just to put a banner on instead of updating everything properly though?\n\nActually, that\u0027s exactly what we routinely do (add an \u0022outdated\u0022 banner if we can\u0027t immediately fix it) for cases where there\u0027s a significant issue needing to be addressed. You can add the following to the top of a page which is in need of attention:\n\n    {{Outdated|* Short but clear description of what\u0027s needing attention* Another point* Each line beginning with a \u0027*\u0027 is a new bullet point* Use as many or as few bullet points as are needed, but try not to turn the notice into a long article in itself.}}\n\nN.B. If you\u0027re not used to editing a wiki, please always use \u0022Show Preview\u0022 before saving any changed. Also, don\u0027t be afraid to ask for help at: [http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Kerbal_Space_Program_Wiki:Helpdesk](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Kerbal_Space_Program_Wiki:Helpdesk)\n\nIf you want to audit the entire wiki for outdated information, please go right ahead and do so. Please don\u0027t add {{Outdated}} for trivial or unimportant things, or if you\u0027re not certain if a page really is outdated. Preferably only add it where you know with reasonable certainty that something is no longer accurate or complete. If you know the current information and could just correct the wiki as quickly as adding the notice, then just do that. Or, you can do both, e.g. I\u0027ve been known to fix what I can immediately fix, but also add {{Outdated}} for the stuff I can\u0027t immediately fix. Do not add {{Outdated}} to \u0022template\u0022 pages, unless you know how to do that without it actually being included in the template itself.\n\nFor cases where you are not sure about something, or a page that is too complex for you to edit yourself, leave a message on the \u0022talk\u0022 page (there\u0027s a \u0022Discussion\u0022 link top left of every page, and every page has its own talk page). I can\u0027t speak for every volunteer editor, but I personally would prefer if you didn\u0027t leave a message saying only \u0022is this up to date?\u0022 (and nothing else) \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC if you see a specific problem, please be specific in what you tell us, and it\u0027s much more likely to be fixed. If appropriate, you can both add {{Outdated}} with a summary of the problem to the main article, and leave a more detailed message on the talk page.\n\nAs far as I\u0027m aware, the basic stats on parts showing in the \u0022infobox\u0022 on the top right of every part page have been automatically updated by a wikibot using the game\u0027s own .cfg files. The tables listing many similar parts with their stats are being steadily updated by volunteer efforts, as and when one of us looks at one of the tables and decides to update it.\n\nEdit: Also, that was me that added {{Outdated}} to \u0022Tutorial: Walkthrough for Ye Compleat Beginner\u0022 mentioned in the first post of this thread. The article simply needs much more work than I was willing to do at the time (and I\u0027ve never been motivated to return to it, as I\u0027ve been working on other stuff).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-02T13:57:36Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2015 01:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Murph**"}]}
