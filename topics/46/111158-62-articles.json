Because then, we have to act as firefighters, and fighting such wildfires are difficult whilst still keeping discussion of topics going. Furthermore, often times with such contentious issues us, moderators ourselves are having the same discussion. I think as a general rule, if there has been a controversial topic on the forums, it\u0027s also been controversial to us moderators. \n\nI for one think it\u0027s a strength of the moderation team. With such a close knit group, it\u0027s easy to fall into groupthink and I like to think we fight against that as much as possible."},{"CreatedByName":"Andem","CreatedById":155578,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-27T03:36:21Z","Content":"What was so inflammatory about RPing that it got banned from the forums?

(But please don\u0027t take that as a license to ask mods to open up a thread that\u0027s been locked down.  We don\u0027t lock down threads lightly, and if it\u0027s closed, it\u0027s closed.)\n\nIn fact, it\u0027s sometimes a handy option to temporarily lock a thread.  For example, suppose a thread is spiraling out of control and needs some surgery-- i.e. not bad enough to permanently lock the thread, but perhaps it needs some extensive pruning, something like that.  That sort of operation can take a bit of time to clean up, and it gets messier if folks are posting to the thread while we\u0027re in the midst of cleaning it up.  So a convenient option is to lock the thread, get it tidied up, and then unlock it again (usually after the mod posts a \u0022let\u0027s keep it nice, folks\u0022 message, or similar).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, Spaceception said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E What does my profile look like from a Moderator standpoint?
