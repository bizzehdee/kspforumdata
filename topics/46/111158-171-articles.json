If I use the quote button or mark some text to quote the section, it will always be added to the \u0027new post\u0027 editor, not in the \u0027edit post\u0027 editor. If  just add an empty quote and copy\u0026paste the text there, the autor of the original message will not be pinged and the quote also doesn\u0027t provide a link to the post so I would like to use the other options.
