Another malicious advertisement?"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T17:46:33Z","Content":"No, the advertisements are disabled on this forum.

I had a similar problem a few weeks back. McAfee picked up a few things, but that didn\u0027t get rid of it. I downloaded Malwarebytes Anti-Malware Scanner (free) and that got rid of it in two scans (keep re-scanning until your problem is fixed or it fails to pick up any more threats)\n\nAlthough I\u0027m sure I\u0027ve seen AdBlock say 1 or 2 ads have been blocked even when I\u0027ve only been on the forum, but I never saw ads on the forum before I got AdBlock (or a forum account for that matter)"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T19:00:54Z","Content":"I\u0027d say it\u0027s on your side as well. I\u0027ve never had this happen, but then again I\u0027ve got AdBlock."},{"CreatedByName":"dryer_lint","CreatedById":162541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T19:43:37Z","Content":"Weird. I\u0027ve been browsing a couple of sites and it\u0027s only happened twice today when I opened the KSP forums.\n\nI\u0027ll let the scan finish. Thanks guys!\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nHmm. I re-enabled AdBlock (I forget why I ever disabled it) and now, where the popup used to be displayed, it shows \u0022one ad on this page blocked\u0022.\n\nInteresting."}]}
