Squad doesn\u0027t own twitter. Squad *does* own the forum. Ignoring the one channel they actually have full control over seems pretty damn stupid. If a new player is looking to find information about why their game suddenly stopped working the way they expected it to, would they be more likely to come to Squad\u0027s official web presence, or go to a third party source, such as twitter, reddit, or the Orbiter forum to find out what\u0027s going on?\n\n(Maybe they should hire a marketing firm to run some things for them.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T05:01:56Z","Content":"While these are marketing blunders of the first order, it\u0027s important to keep in mind that Squad is a software company and has no background in marke.... ooooh, wait..."},{"CreatedByName":"Deddly","CreatedById":62955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T19:19:47Z","Content":"Just curious as to whether any of you who are critisizing their marketing strategy have any experience of marketing yourselves? Personally I do not have experience in that field, but it seems that most companies these days make frequent use of social media and do not always include the same information on their own web site. \n\nFor the record, I dislike social media and use none of them, but I can see that they can be used very skillfully in marketing. Squad stands to benefit if they can get you to post on Facebook or Twitter instead of the forums. How? Because when you post something about KSP, all of your \u0022friends\u0022 or \u0022followers\u0022 are automatically linked in, which is free advertising. This, in my opinion, is why the Kerbal Countdown competition is not open to forum entries, and allowing some news to be released via social networks only encorages everyone to follow them and draw even more attention to what is said there.\n\nWhether we like it or not, I can\u0027t fault their marketing"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T21:03:45Z","Content":"The other thing to note is that the format of social media such as Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr etc. all lend themselves to short, easy to digest, off-the-cuff comments and musings, which is why SQUAD would post there more frequently. \n\nOn the other hand, the KSP Forums is primarily perused by dedicated fans of the game, and any posts SQUAD makes here would need to be more substantial to satiate forum members\u0027 demands - since substantial posts take non-trivial amounts of time to compose, SQUAD wisely chose to lean more towards social media to maximise exposure in the shortest amount of time, and then summarize it in their weekly Squadcast / Devnotes."},{"CreatedByName":"Norpo","CreatedById":113342,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T21:08:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E -snip-\n\nThis is what I always thought, writing \u0022Yes, resources will work the way you described it\u0022 in reply to a Reddit post is a heckuvalot easier than writing a detailed report on how it\u0027s going to work, neatly format it, and slap it in a Devnote tuesday.

Unless some random user makes a thread saying, \u0022Maxmaps made a tweet, discus,\u0022 it **doesn\u0027t get posted here**. \n\n***At. All.***\n\n**That** is the problem. They want a twitter? That\u0027s OK! But you can\u0027t release bits of info here and there (such as things like heatshields for example), without making a post **here**.\n\nThe common defensive argument is, \u0022it would be counter-intuitive for Maxmaps to make a post on twitter and then come here to the forums and make a post here every time he wants to say something.\u0022\n\nBut there\u0027s a really easy solution to that. See the \u0022Now streaming\u0022 tab on the forum page? How hard would it be to add a \u0022recent tweets\u0022 tab or a \u0022recent reddit posts\u0022 tab?!\n\nThat would solve **all** of the issues. For Kod\u0027s sake, I didn\u0027t even know there was a contest going on because SQUAD only said there was one **exclusively on twitter!** Same deal with the heatshields and fairings. Have you seen an **official post here on these forums** that say anything (ANYTHING AT ALL) about those things? I sure as hell can\u0027t find it. I found out about those things when some random user created a thread for them.\n\nI don\u0027t work for SQUAD. Why should I have to scour the internet looking for bits and pieces of info, gather them all up in one place (the ***official*** place) and then say, \u0022for your convenience, look what I\u0027ve done!\u0022\n\nIt\u0027s a giant pile of Malarkey and we all know it. \n\nSQUAD, I love KSP.

Ok, I suppose you could say there\u0027s an excuse for that. I don\u0027t think it would be out of order to *also* post that kind of thing in the forum.\n\nHowever, there are other incidents that don\u0027t make sense.

Later, someone posted a link to Harvester\u0027s comment on the Orbiter forum that explained the version had been intentionally removed.\n\nIf you were a new player, and were not aware of the way Squad posts information everywhere, where would you look to find out why your game wasn\u0027t working? I would expect that players would first come to Squad\u0027s official website to find out information about Squad\u0027s own game. It would never have occurred to me to start looking around on a website owned by someone other than the company responsible for the game, much less a forum for a completely different website. We aren\u0027t talking about a minor annoyance here. We\u0027re not talking about a release update that removed it. We\u0027re talking about players being completely sideswiped with the inability to run their game being met with what appears to be complete indifference from the company they bought it from.\n\nThat\u0027s some serious Grade A male bovine fecal matter.\n\nSimply put, yes Squad\u0027s spray-and-pray marketing on social media might get potential customers\u0027 attention.
