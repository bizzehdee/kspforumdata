(I\u0027m fairly well known as a modder, for example.  If they had said to me \u0022you\u0027ll have to stop modding\u0022 when they asked me if I\u0027d like to be a moderator, I would have said \u0022no thank you.\u0022  Not gonna give that up!)\n\nBecoming a moderator just gives us extra powers:  we can ban users, hand out infraction points, move / edit / remove other people\u0027s posts, approve posts from the queue, etc.\n\nThat said:  although there\u0027s no *\u003Cu\u003Etechnical\u003C/u\u003E* limit preventing us from doing whatever a regular user does, we do feel *\u003Cu\u003Emorally\u003C/u\u003E* constrained.  \u0022With great power comes great responsibility,\u0022 and all that.  We\u0027re very mindful that our \u0022superpowers\u0022 put us in a perceived position of privilege, and we really don\u0027t want to create the impression that we\u0027re throwing our weight around.  So we have to be careful.\n\nFor example, one cannot both *\u003Cu\u003Emoderate\u003C/u\u003E* a thread and *\u003Cu\u003Eparticipate\u003C/u\u003E* in it, because that creates a conflict of interest.  It would be really unfair for me to be *\u003Cu\u003Earguing\u003C/u\u003E* with you, if I\u0027m also \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eediting\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E what you say.  So we\u0027re careful not to do that.\n\nFor example, I can (and do!) argue in threads here all the time, since I have been known (ahem) to have opinons.  ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022) But I\u0027m scrupulously careful to make it clear, in such cases, that I\u0027m just speaking as a  *\u003Cu\u003Eforum user\u003C/u\u003E* rather than as a moderator.  And if there\u0027s a thread where I\u0027ve been active as a participant, and then something pops up there that *\u003Cu\u003Edoes\u003C/u\u003E* need moderating...
