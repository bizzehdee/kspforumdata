When the forum is in that \u0022lockdown\u0022 state, I\u0027ve also noticed that the \u0022Share Post\u0022 button is misbehaving.  Instead of giving you a link directly to the post, it refreshes the page as if you\u0027d clicked on the link it\u0027s supposed to give you.\n\nNo amount of cache clearing and refreshing brought me out this time.  Had to restart Firefox.  And it\u0027s not like I had the forums sitting open all night, I had just launched FF this morning and the forums were instantly in this mode.  I absolutely hate Chrome/Chromium, so I hope this bug can be identified and fixed.  If the staff here needs any debug information from when it happens again, I\u0027ll be more than happy to provide it."},{"CreatedByName":"DarkOwl57","CreatedById":161624,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-07T13:45:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 12 hours ago, Geonovast said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I had to hard refresh a few times just to get the ability to post this back.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nGetting posts back?
