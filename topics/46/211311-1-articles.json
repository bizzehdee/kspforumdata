Only recently, within the last few years, have I become involved in creating the thread announcing the monthly Thread of the Month and the annual Thread of the Year. Since my involvement, I will be the first to admit I\u0027ve gradually made a few changes to both the Thread of the Month and the process used to select them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is my hope that this guide will answer a few questions about how the moderation team goes about using the nominations we receive from the community for the Thread of the Month, and the expanded categories nominations are filtered into. There are also some other things that I\u0027d like to share with the forum community that goes into the decisions made when the Thread of the Month is prepared. Each major part of the decision making process is explained in this guide. For those of you who strive to create a thread worthy of the Thread of the Month recognition, I hope it helps answer many of the questions I\u0027ve been asked over the past couple of years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll start the guide by explaining the categories and then I\u0027ll address the other major points used in turn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#3498db;\u0022\u003EThe categories explained:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the changes I wanted to do to the TOTM was to highlight more of what the community was offering each month - and the best way to do that was by creating categories. Currently, here are the categories we use for each Thread of the Month and a brief explanation of what each category is (most of this is copied off the Threads of the Month):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003EFan-fiction, Mission Reports, and Kerbal Space Program-inspired Creative Works:\u003C/u\u003E \u003C/strong\u003EThis category features a thread that, while not directly Kerbal Space Program related, is a creative work, fan-fiction, or other presentation related to the game. If you write fan fiction, do KSP-themed doodles, paint, CGI, or Lego dioramas or craft, or anything else that is creative arts-based and associated with Kerbal Space Program, this is the category where your thread might be featured if it is nominated.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EForum Member-Created Challenges and Missions:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E This category contains missions and challenges created by you, the members of our gaming community. Many excellent missions and challenges threads are created that expand our fun with the game and press our skills, creativity, and sometimes, luck beyond what we get accustomed to. Let\u2019s face it, we all have our go-to design basics and vehicles we like to use. So sometimes, a good challenge can cause us to think of another way to achieve our goals. Ideally, these challenges and missions should be original or older challenges from the forum. Still, they cannot be modifications of official challenges from \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/66485-squad/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002266485\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/66485-squad/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@SQUAD\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0 or \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/210281-intercept-games/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022210281\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/210281-intercept-games/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Intercept Games\u003C/a\u003E as released on official KSP social media platforms. \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#c0392b;\u0022\u003EThis category will probably be divided into KSP and KSP2 subcategories.\u003C/span\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003EGame Support/Game Mod of the Month:\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EThis category features either help with the game (stock or modded) or mods that add quality-of-life gameplay improvements to Kerbal Space Program. \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#c0392b;\u0022\u003EThis category will probably be divided into KSP and KSP2 subcategories.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGeneral community thread of the month:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E This category features a thread that adds to the community and doesn\u2019t fit the game support/game mod categories.

Most of the more recent cinematic posts have been posted in one thread rather than their creators creating a new thread. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with it; it just meant those creators did not receive the recognition they deserved. A change was made, and for this category only, the TOTM became a Post of the Month\u00A0 (POTM)\u00A0 - with a unique graphic.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHonorable Mentions:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E Just as it says on the TOTM, sometimes it\u2019s a challenge to choose which threads will receive the honor of being selected as the Thread of the Month for our five categories. We get so many good nominations each month to choose from, but we limit it to one for each type. Threads nominated but not selected as a thread of the month become honorable mentions. Honorable mentions will automatically be reconsidered for future TOTMs.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a thread is nominated, it is categorized according to its kind. Any thread that does not fit one of the easy-to-identify ones is put in the General Community Thread of the Month. When we first began the categories, there were times when we would list more than one as a \u0022thread of the month\u0022 for that category. Over the past couple of years, we no longer do this. There is now only one thread of the month per category. All other threads nominated for the same type will be listed in the \u0022Honorable Mention\u0022 category.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#3498db;\u0022\u003EWhat makes a thread a Thread of the Month:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the header of this post, there\u2019s an image containing five points. These five points are important guidelines to determine the difference between an honorable mention and a thread of the month. I want to explain those a bit to give you insight into what we look for in the nominations.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe value of the thread to the forum community:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E Of the five guidelines used, this one is the most important. We consider the value the thread brings to the forum community. Since we have various categories in the TOTM, this becomes easy. The categories allow us to consider nominations of the same kind rather than having to choose just one thread of the month over a variety of threads \u2013 even if they were totally different.\n\u003Cul type=\u0022circle\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf a forum game is nominated, it will always be listed as an Honorable Mention.

But because many of you have asked, here\u0027s the answer to the question\u003Cem\u003Es \u003C/em\u003Emost commonly asked about thread nomination:\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#27ae60;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003ECan I nominate a thread again if it was an honorable mention already?\u003C/em\u003E \u003C/span\u003EYes, and I encourage you to do so. Since the most recent changes to how we do TOTM, there can only be one per category and we receive a lot of really good nominations. There are some months where we have only a handful of nominations. So, please, yes, renominate honorable mentions you feel are worthy of a second (or more) look - unless they are a forum game.\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#27ae60;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003ECan I nominate a thread again if it has already received TOTM? \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003ENo. In the past there have been some mistakes made and threads have earned more than one TOTM. I am working on a side project to track TOTMs so this does not happen again. If you feel a thread is worthy to be considered of additional recognition, you may always nominate it for Thread of the Year (TOTY).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#27ae60;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003EI\u0027ve made this really nice thread.

We also ask that forum threads be nominated without \u0022favors\u0022 (if you\u0027ll nominate mine, I will give you a bunch of likes) as this takes away from the value of the TOTM. Threads of the Month should be meaningful and the nomination should come because someone notices your thread and thinks it has value and NOT because you asked them to nominate it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#27ae60;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003EI\u0027ve already nominated one thread this month.
