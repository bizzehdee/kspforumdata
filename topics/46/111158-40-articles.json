Being the person who creates a particular discussion thread does not, in itself, give you any special rights to what goes on in the thread you created. The initial post does help set the tone and topic of the following discussion, but it\u0027s still a post just like any other.\n2. That being said, many threads are created for a particular purpose, such as maintaining a central discussion thread for whatever content (tutorial, add-on, fanwork, forum challenge, etc.) that the thread\u0027s creator has made and wishes to share. We\u0027ll generally be willing to cooperate with the thread creator to help keep these threads on-topic, since it\u0027s good for the OP, for the discussion, and the community as a whole.\n\nThat\u0027s why we often lock threads or try to creatively shuffle thread \u0022ownership\u0022 on request. It\u0027s not so much because they actually own the thread, but the matter of who has the first post in a topic can be helpful to other users trying to figure out who\u0027s \u0022in charge\u0022 of whatever project is being worked on.
