I ask this as seriously as I can, and brace for a potential firestorm and blow back at me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy do people have issues with people posting to threads that are old? I myself posted to a thread that was 2 years old, but, it contained subject matter that, I was seeing just the other day. I decided, and I will stand by this decision, no matter what anyone thinks, that I was in the RIGHT to post to THAT thread, seeing, as, I was experiencing inexplicably BLURRY graphics. Let me explain. I wanted to use the STOCK 3 man command pod, and so I chose it. I took 1 look at it in the VAB and was floored that, aside from now being in .25, NOTHING had changed. Yes, my mods were and still are not updated, but, this was in a fresh game, and only 1 part out in the open. A stock 3 man pod. It was blurry as all get out. The VAB, 100% in focus. Same with all the other sundry objects, all in full focus. Not 1 setting was changed when this was experienced. I found a thread that contained a similar issue, and joined in. I knew it was 2 years old, but, why make a 2nd thread when one exists? 1 person was helpful, the rest of the posts were incredulous that I had posted in such an old thread. I caught flack from all sides for it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally see no problem with doing this, and cant fathom why everyone else seems to. Please, explain why this is such a taboo thing to do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Felsmak","CreatedById":27187,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-14T09:11:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBasically, it\u0027s just considered to be a little annoying. They take up space on the front page, where they start to compete with newer threads for the attention of the forumgoers.

It\u0027s just that a thread that hasn\u0027t received any new responses in a long time (over three months) is considered to be dead, and it\u0027s then expected to just sink towards the bottom of the forum and rest in peace. Become part of its history, if you will. So even if there is an old thread on the topic that you want to discuss, you\u0027d still be better off just creating a new one instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, of course, there are the people who\u0027ve just learned that reviving old threads is \u0027not okay\u0027 and simply go along with it to come off as more experienced than the person they\u0027re criticizing.

Your case was that you started the game after updated and only the Mk. 1-2 cockpit (a stock part too) was blurry for one run only. As you can see, it wasn\u0027t really relevant to the topic.
