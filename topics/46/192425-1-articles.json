Except there is a problem. I\u2019ve lost my password and unable to recover it. I\u2019ve tried resetting password through wiki page but I didn\u2019t get password reset email\u00A0(I believe I lost a connection to KSP wiki server). But when I tried again. This appeared.\u003Cimg alt=\u00229-CF17-B40-57-C8-4-C3-D-BFD5-063-B0-BE06\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002247.44\u0022 height=\u0022485\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.ibb.co/qJ51SFP/9-CF17-B40-57-C8-4-C3-D-BFD5-063-B0-BE06176.jpg\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, in the next day. I tried again. But no email ever reach my inbox, not in junk, or any even in any\u00A0other folder. I\u2019ve checked all email in this week and a week before. Sadly, there is no mail from KSPwiki at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre there any other way round or nothing can be done?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
