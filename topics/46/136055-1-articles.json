I think the last time there was a call for KSP streamers, one had to have over 100(?) followers and 10(??) regular viewers per stream. While the numbers may be incorrect, the truth is that the more traffic you get and the higher your numbers are, the better. (Note: View counts generally improve with\u00A0good commentary, reading the chat, having music playing in the background, using a camera to capture your face, and streaming for longer periods of time.)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0026gt;\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0(Often) appropriate content.
