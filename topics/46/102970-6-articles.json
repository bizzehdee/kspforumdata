I think it happens because someone doesn\u0027t really know if a mod is good or not until they try it, at which point the browser might be closed and they would have to make a point to come back and rep them for it. Whereas with craft, videos, and other fanworks the gratification is more immediate and thus more likely to be repped on the spot. So, to anyone reading this, go rep your favorite modder right now. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThat said, most modders I\u0027ve interacted with care little about rep, prestige among modders is not formalized with a score.

Nor is it on the forum in general really, some of the posters whose opinions I most respect do not have a lot of rep.\n\nI agree, reputation is not as valued among modders as it is in other groups, which gladdens me. Attaching value to post numbers or reputation scores has always seemed a race to the bottom, on whichever forum it may occur. However, it does seem a little ungrateful that the folks that spend a lot of time learning tools and then creating high quality content seem less recognized for their work (be it in the form of reputation or otherwise), while people (and I am slightly exaggerating) slapping a couple of craft together get lots of accolades. Though hardly an all encompassing scoring system, a more balanced result would just be a little token of appreciation to modmakers for their efforts and work.\n\nThough I expect it is, for a large part, just a misunderstanding of the efforts involved in creating original content. You see the same in the professional world, where less initiated are generally fairly blas\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9 about things that take a huge amount of experience and/or work to get to that point. A photographer is just a guy that presses a button, which we can all do, and a graphic designer is just a guy with Photoshop and Illustrator installed on his computer, which most of us could do, right? If someone can do it in a couple of hours it cannot be of much value, can it, while forgetting the years of dedication it took to get to that skill level.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-08T19:06:08Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2015 07:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Camacha**"},{"CreatedByName":"Columbia","CreatedById":135031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T19:10:09Z","Content":"Imagine, modders literally have to delve in to learn, understand and do everything for a single purpose: Satisfy the needs of a community. \n\nI don\u0027t use mods too frequently, but I really appreciate their work.
