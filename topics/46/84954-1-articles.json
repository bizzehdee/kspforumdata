There is however one exception to that: do not suggest the feature to be implemented. That\u0027s what the [thread=36863]What Not To Suggest?[/thread]-thread tells you. Why? Because it\u0027s already been suggested many times, because the devs are aware of the fact people want female Kerbals in the game and because it\u0027s been confirmed to be coming to KSP in the future. Suggesting to implement female Kerbals is therefore without function. It\u0027ll only needlessly fill up the forum and that is why it\u0027s on the list. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to post any updates you hear about the feature, or how you think female Kerbals could look and sound.
