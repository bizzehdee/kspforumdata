So, the bit about \u0022queuing kicks in at 5 points, temporary ban at 10, permanent ban at 25\u0022 doesn\u0027t have to be all one warning-- if a user racks up multiple warnings before the expiry time, the points add up.  Conversely, a user who gets a 2-point warning today and a 3-point warning a few months from now wouldn\u0027t get queued, because the 2 points from the first warning would have expired long before the next warning arrived."},{"CreatedByName":"adsii1970","CreatedById":89014,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-20T13:31:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 12 hours ago, The\\_Cat\\_In\\_Space said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E How do the warning points work?

It\u0027s to warn the user that the posts being made are running afoul of the forum rules. While Snark is right in the explanation of the standard times for how long the points last, moderators do have the *option* of **extending** how long the points remain active.\n\nThe extension is normally applied to someone who chronically breaks forum rules as a means to ~~coerce~~ I mean, gently nudge them into changing their posting habits. Extending how long points last can mean that if a user is not careful, enough points can be accumulated over time to merit moderation of all future posts, a temp ban, or possibly a perma-ban."},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-20T20:45:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 3/15/2019 at 2:57 PM, Gargamel said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t believe there is.
