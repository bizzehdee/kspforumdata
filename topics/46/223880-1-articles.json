Discord is not meant to be a permanent repository for images or posts. Everything shared and posted there has an expiration point. It can be the date of the post or the amount of data shared within the stream (what is the deciding factor is the age of the post and/or the amount of data within the conversation stream.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe have this issue on the campus where I work with online college students where I work. Students do not seem to realize the more data they dump into Discord, the more it shaves off the stream\u0027s older history. So, rather than copying and pasting or saving relevant parts of the conversation for her personal use at a later time, she assumed it would be there for her to use at a later time. Nope, the more conversation there is, the more likely something will get lost as the conversation progresses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AdrianDogmeat","CreatedById":210605,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-02-27T18:22:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224369030\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022223880\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221709048642\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022179753\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geonovast\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Geonovast said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to Kerbal Network.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis sounds like something on Discord\u0027s end.\u00A0 I don\u0027t know if Discord servers have privacy settings to prevent hotlinking to images uploaded to it (IMO if they don\u0027t, they should), but that could be a factor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would recommend using an actual image hosting service for sharing images instead of Discord.\u00A0 It might work to some degree and they might allow it, for now anyway, but that\u0027s not what Discord is for and therefore you can\u0027t really count on it always being a thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah I didn\u0027t know what category this belonged in\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
