They proceeded to spam the forums with very ungainly images. Unfortunately, I was one of the moderators with the stronger stomach so I had to go through the whole forum along with others deleting the images. The person kept making other accounts for that night. I think it was like 3 hours dealing with some jerk. I work, go to school, go to church, and generally have responsibilities outside of the forums.
