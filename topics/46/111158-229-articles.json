For a few reasons:\n\n- There are several of us, so we share the load.  The amount of moderating any one moderator needs to do is... well... *\u003Cu\u003Emoderate\u003C/u\u003E*.  (Ahem.)\n- The only thing that really *\u003Cu\u003Eis\u003C/u\u003E* quite repetitive (on a frequent, daily basis) is approving posts in the queue (e.g. from new members who haven\u0027t made enough posts yet to get unqueued).  But that\u0027s literally just a quick glance and a few mouse clicks, so it\u0027s not much of a \u0022burden\u0022.  Plus, for me, at least, any tedium is easily offset by the little endorphin bump of \u0022oh yay, someone new to the forum!\u0022\n- Other routine stuff, like moving threads to the right section, is *\u003Cu\u003Ealso\u003C/u\u003E* generally just a few mouse clicks... and also doesn\u0027t come up all that often.  Most users do the right thing most of the time, even new ones.  And people tend to learn pretty quickly.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 5/14/2021 at 8:36 AM, FruitGoose said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E because the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221. Original Post(er).

When your only \u0022view\u0022 of a person is a few typed words on a screen, it\u0027s really tempting to read things into it that simply aren\u0027t there.  For example, just because they made a mistake doesn\u0027t necessarily mean they\u0027re lazy-- much more common is that they\u0027re simply clueless, which is only to be expected from someone who just arrived in a new place and doesn\u0027t know the ropes.  (They\u0027re quite often grateful and/or apologetic afterwards, even though they haven\u0027t really done anything wrong.)\n\nOr, for example, the person may just be a *\u003Cu\u003Ekid\u003C/u\u003E*-- this is not an adults-only forum.  But you can\u0027t see how old they are when you\u0027re reading the post, so if you\u0027re looking at something that a 10-year-old wrote and picturing someone in their 20s or 30s writing that, it would be easy to get annoyed; but that would be missing the mark.\n\nSo, the key to all of this is to be unflappable, to force oneself not to leap to conclusions about people\u0027s motivations and attitudes, and just view it as \u0022there\u0027s something out of place, nudge it back where it goes, no biggie.\u0022\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 5/14/2021 at 8:36 AM, FruitGoose said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Can you quit or is it like a gang thing where you sign up for life and Snark threatens your family if you try to leave?\n\u003E \n\nI find that it\u0027s more efficient just to keep talking at them until they agree to stay just to shut me up.  ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif \u0022:sticktongue:\u0022)\n\nSeriously, though... people do have lives, and sometimes they move on with them (we\u0027re all just part-time volunteers, after all, it\u0027s not like we\u0027re on a contract).  Moderators do come and go, over time.  So from time to time a moderator will leave, and from time to time we add new ones to make up for that.

I think that\u0027s a big part of why so many other people like it, too.

But it mostly boils down to this:\n\n- Approve posts from the queue\n- Respond to user reports\n- Flag spammers\n\nEvery once in a while some problem will pop up (either because one of us happened to spot it, or more often because some vigilant user issued a report), in which case we deal with it as may be needed.  Examples of common scenarios are a user cluelessly posting something in the wrong place, or putting a giant log file into the forum, or posting a mod but forgetting to provide a license, that sort of thing.\n\nOccasionally there will be a dust-up when someone is \u0022coloring outside the lines\u0022 (such as when an argument becomes heated and people start making personal remarks), in which case we step in as needed to clean things up and cool things down.  That\u0027s easily the least fun part of moderating, but fortunately it doesn\u0027t come up all that often, since most people here are pretty well-behaved as a rule."},{"CreatedByName":"HyperDraco","CreatedById":188993,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-15T15:58:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, Snark said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Speaking for myself, I like it a lot, which is why I\u0027m still here at this unpaid \u0022job\u0022 after more than five years.  ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022) \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E What I like about it:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - I enjoy helping people.

This serves a dual purpose.  First, it lets people know (who might otherwise not have gotten the memo) what\u0027s going on with that site; and, second, it helps prevent further spread of references to the site in the forum.
