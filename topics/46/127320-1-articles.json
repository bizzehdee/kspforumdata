I see no real reason to have it on ones profile anyway - infractions and warnings should be a private matter between you and the forum moderators - but having it up front and centre in eyecatching black on white feels a little bit insulting to be honest, even if the the number of warning points is a big fat zero.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSK.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-08T20:03:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as I know these are private.
