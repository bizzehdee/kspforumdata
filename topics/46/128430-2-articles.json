A big part of my time here is spent looking at text. For some reason, I found that reading things on the old Forum was much easier than reading things here. I\u0027m not entirely sure why - contrast, maybe? - but I feel as if this should be improved when possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI \u003Cem\u003Elike\u003C/em\u003E the system that alerts you to new posts (though I think the sound should probably be removed). There was at least one time I created a post on vBulletin, refreshed the page to see if anyone else had posted, and lost\u00A0a good chunk of it by forgetting to copy it beforehand. (I don\u0027t know if there\u0027s a \u0022restore saved post\u0022 option here, but I certainly hope so. Maybe I shouldn\u0027t pass judgement on that just yet.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sure there\u0027s a way to embed YouTube videos, but I haven\u0027t found it yet. There may also be a way to embed Sketchfab models, coubs, and the other things one could embed on the old Forum... but somehow I slightly doubt it. Given, I used the Coub-embedding feature exactly twice and haven\u0027t even downloaded the Sketchfab program... but I know there\u0027s people out there who have used both more than I have.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s been a bit of unhappiness about the \u0022Like this\u0022 button, but personally I... well... like it. It\u0027s much, much clearer than the Reputation button on the old Forum, for one thing:\u00A0gone are the days when new arrivals have to ask how to give Reputation. I wish the button didn\u0027t show the world who \u0022liked\u0022 the post, though I honestly don\u0027t mind much; I often said\u00A0that I was\u00A0giving out Reputation in my posts before this upgrade. The term \u0022like this\u0022 \u003Cem\u003Edoes\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0hearken to Facebook, but again, you could easily argue that it\u0027s more intuitive for the newbies than the whole \u0022give Reputation\u0022 system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sure there\u0027ll be more things that come to mind as time passes, but these are my thoughts for now. The new Forum has its ups and downs, but I think I\u0027ll certainly be able to live with it. I do wonder why the KSP team decided to upgrade, though: I would have thought that the new and improved Forum would have had a distinct advantage over the old one, but I can\u0027t really see it at the moment...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Upsilon\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beale","CreatedById":70533,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-30T14:34:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222300762\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022126588\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221448882867\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002235713\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BigNose\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, BigNose said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe old forum had a much more \u0027homey\u0027 feeling, right now it feels sterile like a hospital.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fact that \u0022friends\u0022 are now \u0022followers\u0022 really says everything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHate, hate, hate\u00A0the move to a WYSIWYG editor also.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBleh.

I shouldn\u0027t have to introduce people to the forums by telling them how to post pictures.

I hated having to manually check every thread I\u0027ve posted in to see if that post was an answer to my question or just banter. The mobile site was, to quote John Oliver, \u0022Repurposed Bovine Waste,\u0022 and when I used desktop on my mobile (as that was\u00A0the only way I could browse and understand what was going on), I had to constantly zoom out to enter links in weird dialog boxes. When people quoted a wall of text to reply with a one-liner, I always ended up scrolling past the quote.
