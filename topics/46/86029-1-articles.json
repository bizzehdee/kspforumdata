Imgur album-views on the KSP Forum have been so buggy for me as of late that I basically have to avoid any posts that use them. They cause a run-away formatting bug that results in the length of the page (and the post they\u0027re in) to increase forever. Possibly the formatting enforced by the Spoiler tags (however you\u0027ve implemented that) is interfering with the album-view javascript in a new and interesting way?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I get different reflexes entirely:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- On iOS, the album in the Spoiler tags appears with 1/10th sized images.
