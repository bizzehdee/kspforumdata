As a forum-goer?\n\nWe used to have a thread called \u0022Count to 50 before a moderator posts\u0022, people would count up to 50, and the score would reset to zero whenever a moderator posted. It got a little crazy with coordinated mass-posting and so on. That was great, we moderators even created a separate game where we\u0027d get points for resetting the count, and the closer to 50 it got the more points the person who stopped it got. \n\nAs you can imagine, it got a little out of control and was eventually shut down."},{"CreatedByName":"Columbia","CreatedById":135031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T11:36:12Z","Content":"On an average basis, how many threads do you have to moderae a day?
