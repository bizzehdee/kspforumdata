It worked fine when most mods were just parts, and there were relatively few plugins around. Nowadays, however, it seems like every mod requires a plugin, and as a result the forum is filled with relatively unhelpful prefixes. Would it be possible to get more options for said prefixes, such as \u0022Contracts,\u0022 \u0022Overhaul,\u0022 \u0022Science,\u0022 \u0022Propulsion,\u0022 \u0022Tweak,\u0022 etc. to help with navigating the forum?\n\n(my apologies if this has been suggested before)"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T10:13:58Z","Content":"Maybe, though we may end up with tags no one uses, or a situation where people want multiple tags which vBulletin doesn\u0027t seem to be capable of.\n\nIf someone can come up with a short list of tags that enough people agree on then it could be done."},{"CreatedByName":"simon56modder","CreatedById":119640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-23T18:42:07Z","Content":"I would like to see it, love and support this idea.\n\nSomething a bit like the Curse mod types ?"},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T23:33:56Z","Content":"I have to concur the you OP.
