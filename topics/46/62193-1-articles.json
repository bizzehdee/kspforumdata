To the best of my knowledge, the quick-reply boxes use Javascript and variations and libraries thereof. Make sure JS is enabled in your browser, and you might want to try a hard refresh (Ctrl\u002BF5, or Shift\u002BClick the Refresh button) to get it to reload them. Only other thing I can think of is that you might have to clear your browser\u0027s cache.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sjwt","CreatedById":9268,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T05:05:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been using chrome on these forums for years, and I have on the very odd occasion seen this, but a hard refresh seems to clear it, if you are seeing it a lot, check to see if a new plugin or one you dont recall installing is showing up, another option is try turning off all your plugins access to incognito mode and see if that isolates the problem to your plugins.. Once I tracked this down to a plugin that seemed to install its self on the back of another program but most often its down to when I was getting extremely crappy internet access with high pings and lost packets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EuSouONumero345","CreatedById":40840,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T12:14:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, you know what happened, so thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
