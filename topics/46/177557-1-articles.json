There are many images, or embedded tweets that take a while to populate, even with my 40 MB connection.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you\u0027re at the bottom of the page wanting to do a quick reply, but as new images load, it scrolls away from you. In general, I\u0027d like my computer to NEVER take focus from where I have it. No window should even pop up in front of one I\u0027m working on, and in the case of browsing, if I have scrolled myself to the bottom, I want it to populate the page above me, while leaving my focus on the bottom of the page where I have chosen to put it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a way to force this behavior, or has anyone found a firefox or chrome plugin to do this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-14T23:54:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWay back in the day, the Opera browser was designed for slow connections.\u00A0 It would load all the text first, including formatting, and then placeholders for the images, so even if the data wasn\u0027t there, it would still have loaded the size of the image.\u00A0 The page was instantly usable and never shifted, depending on your connection, you might have to wait a bit for the images to load.\u00A0\u00A0 That was their selling point as being different than netscape and IE.\u00A0 I would hope to think they still do that, but I haven\u0027t played with it in a very long time.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
