You\u0027re in the clear, a certain piece of ferrous headgear has ten times that number last I heard from it.\n\nSpambot posts are frequent (ish). We have a tool that if you go back several pages you can see in one of technicalfool\u0027s screenshots - it is called the Spam-O-Matic and is very efficient at dealing with spambots (who we see because new users must have their posts approved by a moderator). Let it suffice to say that should the Spam-O-Matic be turned on you, you would cease to exist.\n\nThere are several \u0027secret\u0027 sections of the forum, quite a few of which are archive forums from before vBulletin was a thing. The others I am not quite at liberty to talk about, I think, but there are sections for the various Squad types, streamers, experimentals testers, et cetera. \n\nIf you want to unnerve KasperVld ask him about \u002767\u0027 or \u0027ireland\u0027. You did not hear this from me. EDIT : If he tells you, please share it with me.
