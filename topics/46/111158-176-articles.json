There\u0027s nothing beyond the stock planets in the unmodded KSP. This is why so many folks (including myself) use mods to make it more interesting and to have the \u0022deep space exploration\u0022 ability.\n\nOnce you\u0027ve downloaded and installed [Kopernicus](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/181547-161-2-backports-kopernicus-kittopiatech/\u0026tab=comments#comment-2602496), there\u0027s a whole host of other mods which will become usable in your game. Some add planets to the Kerbol system, such as Outer Planet Mods, while others add entire new solar systems \u0022out in space.\u0022\n\nHere\u0027s the first mod you will need to install to make any of the planet packs or solar system packs work:\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed4478414112\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/181547-161-2-backports-kopernicus-kittopiatech/\u0026tab=comments\u0026do=embed\u0026comment=2602496\u0026embedComment=2602496\u0026embedDo=findComment#comment-2602496\u0022 style=\u0022height:313px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nI hope this helps to steer you in the right direction.

However, the concept of going beyond the system doesn\u0027t have to remain boring or an excursion into nothingness. Now I am not familiar enough to know how the console game works, but back when the PC version was .24, I actually made a \u0022Deep Space K\u0022 space station way out. I mean, it would take three hours of x4 speed to travel to it. It gave me lots of practice with intercept nodes, docking, course correction burns, etc.\n\nMight that be possible in the console version of the game? You may not be able to go as far out as I could on PC, but even one that\u0027s out there some distance could be fun."},{"CreatedByName":"Mikenike","CreatedById":196142,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-27T15:12:53Z","Content":"Yeah you\u2019re right adsii, I should do a deep space station, got any ideas on the DSS and what I should launch it with?
