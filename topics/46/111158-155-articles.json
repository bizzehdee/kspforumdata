Remember, we\u0027re regular people, with families, jobs, etc.-- all kinds of IRL responsibilities that naturally need to take precedence over moderating, which after all is just an unpaid volunteer hobby we do in our spare time.  People\u0027s life circumstances change, they get busy with other stuff, and they need to move on-- it happens from time to time, which is why we need new moderators once in a while to replace them.\n\nIt\u0027s generally not a *\u003Cu\u003Efrequent\u003C/u\u003E* thing, since as a team we value stability and we\u0027d prefer not to make someone a moderator if they\u0027re not going to stick around for at least a reasonable while.  We prefer low turnover, if possible.  But it\u0027s not at all unusual for a moderator to move on after a few years--  for example, I\u0027ve been a moderator for about two and a half years now, and several of the mods who were around when I joined have since moved on (with new moderators coming on board to take up the slack).\n\nAs I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll understand, naturally we don\u0027t discuss the circumstances of specific individual past moderators in a public forum, out of respect for their privacy.  Accordingly, a personal reference in your post has been removed-- please respect that.
