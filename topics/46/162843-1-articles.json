comes along much later with a similar issue and reads a post from you, and follows a link to your profile, they wouldn\u0027t be getting the same list that was present at the time you asked your

unlikely to happen.\u00A0 Explanation below, with my usual caveat that I\u0027m not speaking on Squad\u0027s behalf \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E(since I don\u0027t work for Squad; we moderators are just volunteers who help out with the content in the forums)\u003C/span\u003E:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first thing to bear in mind is that \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003ESquad didn\u0027t write the forum software, and doesn\u0027t own the source code\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 It\u0027s a third-party product, produced by another company entirely.\u00A0 So it\u0027s not as if Squad can just add whatever feature they want, the way they can with KSP itself.\u00A0 They\u0027re a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ecustomer\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of the forum software, the same way that you\u0027re a customer of KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich means that a lot of the same semantics apply:\u00A0 it doesn\u0027t necessarily have all the features they might want.\u00A0 If there\u0027s a missing feature or a thing they wish it did differently, they can always ask the producer about it (just like you can ask Squad for new KSP features)... but that\u0027s just feedback from one customer among many, and there are no guarantees.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe forum \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eis\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E somewhat customizable, up to a point-- in KSP parlance, it\u0027s \u0022moddable\u0022.\u00A0 There are various add-ons (some free, some not) that can be used to enhance the forum.\u00A0 The problem is that now we\u0027re talking about \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Efourth\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E-party software:\u00A0 the add-ons are made by some other entity (often just \u0022some guy\u0022), not the actual authors of the forum software, so you don\u0027t necessarily get the same sort of guarantees of quality and reliability that you\u0027d get from a commercial software producer.\u00A0 And that matters, a lot, because if Squad installs an add-on for the forum software, it affects \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eall users in the forum\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, which means if they ever installed a lemon, it could be a Very Bad Thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tolerance for risk is therefore a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elot\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E lower than when, for example, you\u0027re deciding whether or not to install a mod for your KSP.\u00A0 This means that adding a new add-on to the forum is something not to be done lightly-- it has to be done very cautiously, and generally only when there\u0027s a really strong need for something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other thing to bear in mind is that this is \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eespecially\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E true if the add-on in question is one that \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eallows users to store information\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E in some way.\u00A0 Because then, once you\u0027ve installed it, it becomes a really huge deal if you ever need or want to \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Euninstall\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E it, because the moment it becomes available, thousands of users start putting their personal content in it, and if you ever remove it \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E(or if you ever need to install a version update that may be incompatible, or if the add-on author just abandons it and it breaks with a forum update)\u003C/span\u003E, you\u0027d be nuking thousands of users\u0027 personal content, which would cause mountains of grief for the users and a lot of ill will.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot to mention the fact that \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eany source of user content is also a source of abuse\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Sad to say, there are toxic trolls out there.\u00A0 Add a new way for someone to tinker with what\u0027s in the forum, and you add a new way for somebody to abuse it, which means we moderators need to \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Emoderate\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E it.\u00A0 And if it\u0027s some fourth-party add-on, there may not be good ways for us to moderate the content unless the add-on author took the trouble (and had the design skill) to make it nicely moderatable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd in any case, all of the above \u0022is it wise to install the add-on\u0022 discussion is predicated on the assumption that \u003Cem\u003Ethere\u0027s actually an add-on that does exactly what you want\u003C/em\u003E, which isn\u0027t a given.\u00A0 There are a fair number of add-ons out there, but not an infinite number.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo... that\u0027s why this suggestion seems likely to be a non-starter.\u00A0 To summarize:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nForum feature suggestions are less likely to be acted on than KSP feature suggestions, because (unlike KSP) Squad doesn\u0027t write the forum software.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNew forum features are (in a limited fashion) available via add-ons, but have to be treated very very cautiously.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe particular feature you suggest would involve adding \u003Cem\u003Euser content\u003C/em\u003E, which would make it an especially risky class of add-on, even if it exists.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAnd in any case, it\u0027s less of a \u0022must-have\u0022 feature, because \u003Cem\u003Ethe forum already has something like that\u003C/em\u003E-- it\u0027s called a \u0022signature\u0022 and I can see that you\u0027re already using it.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022
