It won\u0027t find *\u003Cu\u003Eyour\u003C/u\u003E* posts, unless you use your own name in your post, which most people don\u0027t.  For example, a [search for \u0022Geonovast\u0022 in this thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/search/\u0026q=Geonovast\u0026type=forums_topic\u0026item=111158) only shows two hits, one of which is by someone else.\n\nIf all you want to know is \u0022did I post in this thread *\u003Cu\u003Eat all, ever\u003C/u\u003E*\u0022, then that\u0027s an easy question to answer.  Just go to the \u0022list\u0022 page and look at the little blue-or-gray symbol that appears next to the topic title.  If it\u0027s a circle, you\u0027ve never posted there.  If it\u0027s a star, you have.\n\nIf what you want to know is \u0022find me all of *\u003Cu\u003Emy\u003C/u\u003E* posts\u0022, then you can *\u003Cu\u003Ealmost\u003C/u\u003E* do that... sort of... but not perfectly, unless you know a key word to search for.  Here\u0027s what you can do:\n\n1. Go to the search box at top right\n2. Choose \u0022This Topic\u0022 in the drop-down\n3. Type a search term in the box\n4. When the search results page comes up, it has all hits on that search term for *\u003Cu\u003Eeveryone\u003C/u\u003E*\u0027s post.  You just want your own.  So you need to narrow it down.\n5. On the search results page, click the \u0022More search options\u0022 link.\n6. On the \u0022Content Search\u0022 page, click \u0022Search by Author\u0022.\n7. Put your name into the relevant box/\n8. Run the search.\n\nVoil\u00E0, you now have a search for \u0022all of your posts with *\u003Csearch term=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003C/search\u003E* in this thread\u0022.\n\nFor example, here is a search for [all posts by Geonovast in this thread which contain the word \u0022moderator\u0022](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/search/\u0026q=moderator\u0026type=forums_topic\u0026item=111158\u0026author=Geonovast\u0026search_and_or=or\u0026sortby=relevancy).\n\nThe problem, though, is:  what if you don\u0027t *\u003Cu\u003Ehave\u003C/u\u003E* a search term?  What if you just want a search for \u0022all posts by Geonovast in this thread\u0022?  That\u0027s where it\u0027s kinda annoying.  What you\u0027d \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Elike\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E is to be able to just leave the \u0022search term\u0022 field blank-- except that the darn search form *\u003Cu\u003Ewon\u0027t let you do that\u003C/u\u003E*.  It insists on filling something in, there.  ![:mad:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif \u0022:mad:\u0022)\n\nAlso:  no, you can\u0027t cleverly trick it by putting in one of the common use-them-all-the-time words like \u0022a\u0022 or \u0022the\u0022 as your search term, because some clever soul somewhere has helpfully disallowed that term and removes it from search terms.  For example, if I search for [Geonovast posts in this thread that contain the word \u0022a\u0022](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/search/\u0026q=a\u0026type=forums_topic\u0026item=111158\u0026author=Geonovast\u0026search_and_or=or\u0026sortby=relevancy), it gets zero results, which is obviously wrong.  Ditto [\u0022an\u0022](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/search/\u0026q=an\u0026type=forums_topic\u0026item=111158\u0026author=Geonovast\u0026search_and_or=or\u0026sortby=relevancy).  [Searching for \u0022the\u0022](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/search/\u0026q=the\u0026type=forums_topic\u0026item=111158\u0026author=Geonovast\u0026search_and_or=or\u0026sortby=relevancy) finds a couple of results, at random as far as I can tell, but is obviously wrong.  How incredibly frustrating.\n\nOn the other hand, picking a slightly-less-common-but-still-fairly-frequent term, [such as \u0022can\u0022](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/search/\u0026q=can\u0026type=forums_topic\u0026item=111158\u0026author=Geonovast\u0026search_and_or=or\u0026sortby=relevancy), turns up five hits.\n\nSo what it boils down to is that no, as far as I can tell there\u0027s no simple way to \u0022just show me all my darn posts in this thread\u0022.
