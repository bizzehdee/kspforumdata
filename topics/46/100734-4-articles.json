If you think they\u0027re dumb, they want to hear it, preferably in that way. regex (in this thread) implied that he is this way. If regex treats most people the way he wants to be treated himself, then... well... he\u0027s already doing that. But many people take offense at his directness. Presumably, he could take offense at more positive ways of speaking, wondering if you think he\u0027s stupid by treating him as if he needs handled with kid gloves.\n\nThat\u0027s just 2 very obvious examples of where treating someone how you would want to be treated could go awry.
