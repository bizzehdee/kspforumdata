They tend to start new threads in high traffic areas promoting products or services, though some are more sophisticated at evading detection and will copy the text of an existing post into a new one in the same thread with a commercial link inserted (tricky to catch in the queue as it looks like an on topic post). I guess the point is to get people to their website, or increases their search rankings by having links point to them. Most of the are actually bots, yes."},{"CreatedByName":"adsii1970","CreatedById":89014,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-29T20:30:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 11/25/2016 at 5:37 AM, Red Iron Crown said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 0-point warning -\u003E Warning with points -\u003E Placed in the moderation queue -\u003E Temporary ban -\u003E Permanent ban\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E But that is very much subject to circumstances and severity of the matter.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **[Edited by adsii1970 for the relevant content I wanted to reference]**\n\u003E \n\nAh, so far I have only been in that first category... 0 point warnings.
