That means images appropriate to a ongoing discussion won\u0027t be questioned anymore for possible application of a rule that was never intended to curtail all ways of expressing a legitimate viewpoint in pictures.\n\nIf the content isn\u0027t appropriate to a discussion, all of the rules in section 2.2. \u0022Forbidden Content\u0022 apply to images too. What is objectionable with reaction images is actually described in those rules, e.g. 2.2.d about rudeness or harassment, or 2.2.m about unnecessarily boosting post counts, with something that does not contribute in any way and actually distracts from the true subject in a thread (if not even worse)."},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-03T09:56:27Z","Content":"So, a simple image response (with no other text) is now OK?"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-03T09:57:57Z","Content":"Could be OK if appropriate to a ongoing discussion, e.g. it helps others understand a concept."},{"CreatedByName":"Frybert","CreatedById":97766,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-03T11:34:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, Dman979 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So, a simple image response (with no other text) is now OK?\n\u003E \n\nThey are no longer banned outright.
