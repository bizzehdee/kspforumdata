I was just wondering what those writings between the username and the profile pic are? For example for me there reads \u0022bottle rocketeer\u0022 and some people have other \u0022names\u0022, i know they are fun and meant to be so, but could someone provide a bit more in-depth explanation about those (e.g why are they there, what do those little balls under the writing mean and so forth)? I know, my english is a bit broken, i don\u0027t speak it as my main language.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-23T08:18:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nG\u0027day \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/189458-kspguy77/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022189458\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/189458-kspguy77/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@kspguy77\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth are basically ranks.\u00A0 The top one (bottle rocketeer) can be modified in account settings/edit profile/member title.\u00A0 The dots relate to how many posts you have made.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-23T13:38:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00224daScreenshotat20171202.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022543\u0022 src=\u0022http://u.cubeupload.com/Geonovast/4daScreenshotat20171202.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
