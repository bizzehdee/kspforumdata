The occasional member that posts what might be a considered a rude note either due to English not being their first language, or because they are trying to be particularly vehement in their their post is usually quickly steered by the other members in a thread to a more polite, constructive feedback path.\n\nI feel in some part that is due to the diligenent and mostly thankless job of the moderators.  I thank you for all you do to keep things running smoothly.\n\nBut last night seeing both a very rude post and seeing that it was made by a moderator, brought me cause to look for the report mechanism for the first time. I kept looking for something with the word \u0022report\u0022 in the interface and I completely missed the little Flag link.\n\nThank you again, and have a happy New Year!!!"},{"CreatedByName":"Merkov","CreatedById":165068,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-28T12:56:28Z","Content":"Speaking of posts being reported and whatnot, I have a silly little question: when posts are removed by moderators, do rep points/likes associated with those posts not vanish as well? In the incident to which I think [@mcortez](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/153791-mcortez/) is referring, I had a few posts that were eventually removed (not unreasonably) but had each received a couple of likes. I remember noticing at that time that my rep had just broken the 100 mark, and I expected it to drop below that again when the thread was cleaned up. Looking at it now, though, it seems like I still have those few extra points, which I found surprising. \n\nNot that rep/likes REALLY make any difference to anything, but I was just curious."},{"CreatedByName":"monstah","CreatedById":95210,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-28T13:26:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 31 minutes ago, Merkov said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Speaking of posts being reported and whatnot, I have a silly little question: when posts are removed by moderators, do rep points/likes associated with those posts not vanish as well?\n\u003E \n\nJust made some MODERATING FOR SCIENCE!.
