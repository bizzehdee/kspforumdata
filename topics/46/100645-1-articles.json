It bugs me too because it multiplies the loading time severely, which is a really big problem if I ever have the foolhardy urge to try and visit the KSP forum on my work computer (Internet Exploder 6, nuff said). Also if I happen to be listening to music or something it gets weird when I suddenly start hearing Maxmaps\u0027s voice or some such despite not (intentionally) having any videos playing.\n\nThat all said, this might be a Twitch issue rather than a KSP devblog issue. Maybe Twitch doesn\u0027t provide the option of embedding videos without them autoplaying."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T04:45:10Z","Content":"Moved to Kerbal Network."}]}
