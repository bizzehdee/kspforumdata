It gives me a \u0022This webpage is not available\u0022 and under that is says \u0022ERR\\_NAME\\_NOT\\_RESOLVED\u0022\n\nand clicking more details gives this:\n\n \u0022The server at **forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com** can\u0027t be found, because the DNS lookup failed. DNS is the network service that translates a website\u0027s name to its internet address. This error is most often caused by having no connection to the Internet or a misconfigured network. It can also be caused by an unresponsive DNS server or a firewall preventing Google Chrome from accessing the network.\n\n**Access a cached copy of** [**http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum.php**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum.php)\n\n**Go to** [**http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/**](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/)\n\n**Search on Google**\u0022\n\nLike I said, it works fine on my laptop. And it worked fine on my desktop. I was on the forums on my desktop, my wifi cut out for a second, and when it came back and I reloaded the forum, this error started coming. Please help, I use the desktop for forum browsing while gaming."},{"CreatedByName":"ghostbuzzer7","CreatedById":138096,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T01:48:32Z","Content":"This typically happens to me whenever a power surge comes around.
