They post mostly just inane words, with links to what they are advertising. Can\u0027t see any spam in the modqueue, so no examples. Some have semi relevant things to say, often with a link at the end. I would say most users on the forum are human, even us mods. Don\u0027t know about unique users on the forum per month.\n\nNow this is where it gets fun. First, allow me to describe it in pokemon battle format:\n\nA wild spambot appears!\n\nGo, Modkip!\n\nSpambot uses spam!\n\nIt isn\u0027t very effective...\n\nModkip uses Spam-O-Matic!\n\nIt\u0027s super effective!\n\nSpambot is banished from the forum!\n\nModkip gets satisfaction for winning!\n\n\\*ahem\\*\n\n\u0022But what is the Spam-O-Matic?\u0022 I hear you ask! We can tick posts, and can perform a list of actions to said posts. Ranging from Delete Post, to Move Post, and many in between. Spam-O-Matic is one of these, and is my personal favourite. We tick the post, proceed with the action, and it then removes the spambot from the forum. Aspiring mods can look forward to their first squishing of a bot.\n\nHope this helps."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T23:19:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E How often are you called upon to examine the post of a Curious George, only to have it be a spambot?\n\nCan\u0027t speak for the other mods, but I get at least a half dozen a week, sometimes substantially more. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Can you show us an example of what their messages look like?\n\nNot a specific one, but most of them are your typical spam email-like content.
