One way to do that is in [this thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122939-The-Name-Change-Thread-%28WARNING%21-ONE-TIME-ONLY%21%29). Alternatively, you can PM one of the moderators and we\u0027ll pass the request along as needed.\n\nAlso, moved to the Kerbal Network and closed."}]}
