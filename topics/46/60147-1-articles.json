We could call this simply \u0022Add-on Releases\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe benefits of this would be that threads are only bumped when the add-on\u0027s developer makes changes - so that all the back-and-forth discussion (which we\u0027d still want) has its own place. As a result, checking for updates becomes much easier as it just requires a quick look at the forum to check recent bumps in that area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems like a simple solution that could be implemented before we get an in-game version of Spaceport that automates everything.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-17T22:52:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t really work much with the technical side of the forums personally, so I really can\u0027t judge how feasible this idea would be myself. However, one thing I\u0027ve found that helps is to subscribe to the threads of the add-ons I actually use (through the \u0022Thread Tools\u0022 dropdown), then periodically check my subscriptions (\u0022Quick Links\u0022 -\u0026gt; \u0022Subscribed Threads\u0022) and compare version numbers. Most add-on creators do tend to update the version number in the thread title when they make a new release, and a few are even polite enough to include a release date as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know it\u0027s not exactly what you asked for, but I hope it helps all the same \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aphox","CreatedById":32691,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-18T03:17:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve considered this idea in the past, but after asking a variety of mod creators, it was decided that it wouldn\u0027t be a good idea.

It\u0027s easier for them to manage it all in one place instead of having to find a dedicated support thread buried somewhere in another forum. Easier for us to moderate, too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
