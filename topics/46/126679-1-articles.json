I think that the forum should be made MUCH wider. It would be a step towards the better style of vBulletin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-30T20:31:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt does feel like there\u0027s more wasted space than before.

The old one was far too wide, I found it impossible to read. Now, all the text is in my field of view, and it\u0027s sooooo much easier to read quickly.\u00A0There\u0027s a reason that books are taller than they are wide. Reading the old forums was like trying to read a paper written in PowerPoint.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-01T01:41:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m finding it depends on which computer I\u0027m using. On my home desktop it looks pretty decent as-is. On my work computer, which has a lower pixel density monitor, I find that I need to hit Ctrl-minus to zoom out a step to make it look good, which I didn\u0027t need to do on the old forum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
