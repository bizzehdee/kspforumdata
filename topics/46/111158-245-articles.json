I was just pointing out that not having a post since yesterday was nothing to fret about, even if they or I or both of us were possibly having a harmless joke. When I joined there was lots I didn\u0027t know (not that that has changed greatly) and so I started topics in hopes of getting answers. Generally, even though you could see that over one hundred members had viewed the question, they never got replies. Some of those questions I have answered through my own experimentation, others I have dug back through years of threads and found where it has been discussed and mostly answered. Sadly there are times when a member who is still quite active could have directed me to the relevant previous discussion, but chose not to. That is why if I see someone ask a question that I have experience with I do my best to either answer it or point them in the right direction, I prefer to treat others as I would like to be treated. It is just the way I am."}]}
