Warnings are usually 0-5 points now, with 5 resulting in queuing. Under vB they were typically 5-25pts, with 25 being a queuing and 0-point warnings being handled differently.\n\nI think I may be the mod with the worst warning/infraction history, I had three warnings and one serious infraction before becoming a mod.
