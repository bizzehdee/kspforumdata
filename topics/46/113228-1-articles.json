It would also mention that additional console sales would help PC development.\n\n3) There would have been a separate Dev Note (linked to in the announcement), reassuring the community that the PS4 port will not affect PC development. It would also mention that 1.0.3 is still very much in development and everybody is working hard to get it released. It would also mention that Flying Tiger (the company doing the PS4 port) have already supported Squad in doing the Unity 5 revamp. \n\n4) HarvesteR himself would have assured the community in the Dev Notes that PC development of KSP would always be the main focus and that there will be no dumbing down of the main game to accomodate console input or performance issues.\n\n5) The community would have congratulated Squad on their efforts, reacted happy to the mention of 1.0.3 and the fact that new money will help the development of their favorite game.\n\nBesides 4 and 5 all the relevant information was provided, but only in tidbits scatterd across 3 different platforms (Forum, Twitter, Reddit).\n\nAnd I am still hoping for 4 to happen, so 5 could be possibly reached...\n\n*Update: 4 happened! See Edit below.*\n\n**The lesson here is: Communication is key. It\u0027s as simple as that.**\n\nEdit: [THIS](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/345-KSP-and-Unity-5)is what would have alleviated everybody\u0027s concern. Thank you, HarvesteR!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E No, not by any means. Our UI overhaul will indeed support development of a console-friendly UI, but that will be for the console version only. The PC UI will work just the same as it does now, maybe even get a few improvements for itself in the process. ![k_smiley.gif](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/smilies/k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E Remember, KSP is a PC game being ported to run on a console. The port is branching *off* the main PC development code, not the other way around. We did need to work together for the Unity5 part though, because that affects everyone.\n\u003E \n\u003E Cheers\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-17T21:43:52Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2015 09:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ShadowZone**"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T17:12:44Z","Content":"It\u0027s easier to just post the announcement on Twitter, though."},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T17:14:17Z","Content":"As well as stuff like *how* the game is going to work on PS4.

(Bloodborne uses the left and right clicks for different purposes.) You could easily emulate a mouse with left and right buttons using it; no one has done this that I know of, but it\u0027s clearly designed for it. (It\u0027s less clear how you\u0027d do mouse dragging.)
