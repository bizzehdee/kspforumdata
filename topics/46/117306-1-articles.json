Will you give me a Steam Key?**\n\nIn general no. The option to transfer KSP Store licenses to Steam is only available for those who bought KSP before it originally came out on Steam, March 20th 2013. Note that if you do qualify for a transfer and choose to do it, the process is OPTIONAL and IRREVERSIBLE. If you transfer your purchase to Steam, you will no longer be able to download or update the game from the KSP Store. To move to Steam, log in to your KSP Store profile and you will find the button to start the process next to your download link. If you can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t see the button in your profile it means you purchased the game after it was on Steam and you are not eligible, no exceptions, please don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t insist."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T11:12:34Z","Content":"As Daid mentions, if you bought before it was available on Steam you can transfer it over.
