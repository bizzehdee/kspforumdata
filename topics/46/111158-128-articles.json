Yes, that is exactly how it\u0027s handled. Each of those words that have been deemed as \u0022nonexistent\u0022 within our happy little forum community have  other words which replace them.

Even with historical terms, such as the one you were using to represent the sociopolitical situation of World War II Germany.\n\nBack when I first joined the forum, it was explained to me by [@Red Iron Crown](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/12858-red-iron-crown/) (and yes, I know he is no longer active but is surely missed) the reason is that certain historical terms have also become quite abused by contemporary society. And when it is not referred to the historical term, most folk use it for shock value or as a way to shut up those who they disagree with. And to be honest, I agree with that sentiment. That era of human history needs to be studied and remembered, but never bantered around until we forget what happened.\n\n***Now I have completely forgotten the question I was going to ask...*** ![:0.0:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif \u0022:0.0:\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-14T20:29:28Z","Content":"About the blacklist.
