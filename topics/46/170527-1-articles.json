Right/left trigger are typically used to accelerate and decelerate respectively in almost any game, they are reversed in KSP. As is the up/down control (positive/negative Z axis, aka. normal/antinormal). Pushing up on the joystick pushes you down and vice versa. I was thinking, best case scenario, a squad staff would get a hold of me or someone else with a lot of console experience to remap the buttons. Get rid of switching between LIN and ROT altogether, which would free up X for switching between them. Leave the ROT controls on the left joystick and triggers, and change LIN controls to use the D-pad for directions and X/square for accelerate/decelerate in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E (the other two buttons typically used for that on console games).

Nothing as advanced as \u0022make your way to Duna fully autonomously from the launchpad, taking the most efficient route,\u0022 but more like you can preprogram commands via a fully upgraded Tracking Station/Mission Control (make one of the less useful facilities more useful) or a remote pilot and have them execute at a certain time/place in their flight, such as manuever nodes, running science experiments, etc. Kinda like Custom Action Groups that the probe can execute automatically later (like they do in real life).
