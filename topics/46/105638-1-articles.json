It\u0027s not perfect but a burn of a million meters per second begins with the first spark. Thanks to all the editors who got it to the state it\u0027s in, and if some of the long-timers can proofread my linking and formatting that\u0027d be great. I plan on getting in there and doing revisions where I can but I feel like there\u0027s a crisis of confidence in the community in terms of who feels qualified to write with authority on the minutiae of the systems. In my case I was mostly just transcribing RoverDude\u0027s forum comments on the lab into an article."},{"CreatedByName":"xZise","CreatedById":59798,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T19:42:40Z","Content":"Feel free to add stuff which need to be fixed to [http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Kerbal_Space_Program_Wiki:Tasks#Version_1.0_release](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Kerbal_Space_Program_Wiki:Tasks#Version_1.0_release) so that it can be kept central.\n\nMy bot has already updated all part infoboxes (the box on the right when you look at a part) and they should contain valid values. If you find parts where the infobox could contain more information feel free to contact me on [my talk page](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Kerbal_Space_Program_Wiki:Tasks#Version_1.0_release). The bot also created [new pages for all new parts. There might be still text inside the part pages which is not accurate anymore, but unfortunately I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s possible to mark pages which has been checked and are accurate with 1.0.](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Category:Part_pages_created_by_BobBot)\n\n[And as the bare pages are already finished I think anyone is able to write something important. We don\u0027t need the same text for a bunch of pages but it should be something special related to the part. So instead of explaining what a fuel cell does in all part pages which are fuel cells just explain it in the general fuel cell page. This might mean that part pages are relatively short but I think that is okay. The main advantage is when something general about fuel cells changes, that only one page needs to be updated instead of updating the same part in all part pages.](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Category:Part_pages_created_by_BobBot)\n\n[Also feel free to edit stuff. If you preview it before submitting it and make sure that it adds at least something it\u0027s better than nothing. I (and certainly others) regularly go through the changes and polish stuff up.](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Category:Part_pages_created_by_BobBot)"},{"CreatedByName":"Columbia","CreatedById":135031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T20:05:43Z","Content":"Wait, you\u0027re allowed to edit pages without an account?\n\nThanks!"}]}
