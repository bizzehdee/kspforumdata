And what does being in the media group involve?\n\u003E \n\nHi [@CAKE99](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/150099-cake99/)\n\nBasically, the he Media Group is a collaboration between Squad on one side and Twitch streamers and YouTubers (collectively \u0027influencers\u0027) on the other. The objective of this collaboration is to foster a relationship that both sides profit from: influencers have access to exclusive content such as new versions of the game before they are released, which they can use to promote their channels. In return, Squad profits from the additional media attention this concentration of video releases generates.\n\nYouTubers and Twitch streamers who wish to qualify for membership of the Media Group must:\n\n.. be in good standing with the KSP Community and SQUAD.\n\n.. be 18 years of age or older.\n\n.. have a gaming PC capable of showing KSP in the best quality.\n\n.. have the necessary software to record and edit videos, as well as a good working knowledge of said software.\n\n.. make videos or stream at 720p/30fps or better\n\nWe also take the quality of the content and number of subscribers/followers into consideration.\n\nExceptions can be made in exceptional cases on Squad\u0027s discretion.\n\nIt\u0027s also important to note that as a member of the Media Group, you have to agree to a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) with Squad. This means that any information disclosed between Squad and you in the context of the Media Group is not to be shared with any third-party that is not a member of Squad or a member of the Media Group.\n\nYou can contact me or Badie to learn more about it.\n\nI hope this will clarify your doubts ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Andem","CreatedById":155578,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-14T19:39:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 8 minutes ago, UomoCapra said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E .. be in good standing with the KSP Community and SQUAD.\n\u003E \n\n[@NOELonPC](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/151224-noelonpc/) must not fall into that category I guess..."},{"CreatedByName":"UomoCapra","CreatedById":167737,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-14T20:02:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 minutes ago, Andem said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@NOELonPC](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/151224-noelonpc/) must not fall into that category I guess...\n\u003E \n\nI don\u0027t know the reason why he wasn\u0027t included in the Media Group back then.
