I take no joy in applying punitive measures, especially when it\u0027s someone I\u0027m friendly with on the forum. Even when it\u0027s well deserved and we\u0027ve tried every other avenue, I still feel a bit of \u0022sorry it\u0027s come to this\u0022. I think if someone enjoyed infracting or banning people they wouldn\u0027t be well suited to being a moderator.\n\nAn exception is spammers and duplicate accounts, they get no sympathy, pity, or mercy.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E One of my infractions was for a reaction image, and the mod even said \u0022even though I agree with the sentiment, and thought it was kinda funny...\u0022 \n\u003E IDK if they felt \u0027bad\u0027 per say, but they still slapped me with 5 points ![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif)\n\nThat\u0027s one of the rules that we discuss semi-regularly, actually. There are many times when a reaction image is both appropriate and funny, but when reaction images are unrestricted it leads to every thread with a large craft filling up with that 50 megapixel \u0022Mother of God\u0022 meme image, and many other memes get overused, too. It wouldn\u0027t be fair to allow some and remove others (how could a user know what will be moderated and what will not?) so the blanket ban on them was enacted.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-15T10:49:00Z\u0022 title=\u002206/15/2015 10:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Red Iron Crown**"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T10:53:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Also, in all curiosity, have you ever felt bad for banning/giving an infraction - Or is it part of the job?\n\nI hate it, I absolutely hate it, I wish I never had to do it and that a PM or post in the thread was always enough to keep things smooth here, seriously that\u0027s all any of us should really need to do.\n\nBut there\u0027s rules and some people don\u0027t like rules, they mostly boil down to \u0022don\u0027t be an ass\u0022 but some people don\u0027t even like *that.*\n\nSpambots are shoot on sight though."},{"CreatedByName":"DuoDex","CreatedById":107061,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T11:49:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Supernovy\u0027s tent.
