I wouldn\u0027t want anyone to feel bad about having their thread reported for something simple like being in the wrong subforum.\n\u003E \n\nJust to add on to Frybert\u0027s excellent explanation:\n\n- There\u0027s nothing whatsoever negative about reporting per se.  \u0022Report\u0022 does not mean \u0022accuse\u0022.  It simply means \u0022get the mods\u0027 attention for something.\u0022  It can (and often is) used to report inappropriate content, but it doesn\u0027t have to be.  For example, you can report your *\u003Cu\u003Eown\u003C/u\u003E* post, if you need help with something you can\u0027t do yourself (e.g. \u0022I accidentally posted and want to delete this\u0022).\n- Reports can actually help the mod staff by giving us extra pairs of eyes in the forums.  We can\u0027t be everywhere all the time.\n- Reporting inappropriate posts can be especially useful because there are some types of posts that can kick off firestorms, and it\u0027s a *\u003Cu\u003Elot\u003C/u\u003E* better for everyone concerned (moderators and forumgoers alike) if those can be spotted quickly and nipped in the bud before they spiral out of control.\n- Another example: if you report a post for being in the wrong subforum... you\u0027re not just helping your fellow forumgoers (by reducing noise in the \u0022wrong\u0022 forum), but *\u003Cu\u003Eyou\u0027re actually helping the person you\u0027re reporting\u003C/u\u003E* because now their thread will live in a better home where it\u0027s likely to get more of the right sort of attention.\n\nSo you\u0027re doing everyone a favor by making an appropriate report."},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-17T12:29:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7 hours ago, Snark said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \\*snip\\*\n\u003E \n\nThanks, I hope to be a more helpful forum user now."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-17T12:38:07Z","Content":"This isn\u0027t the right thread for this post but I\u0027m not sure what would be and it\u0027s small enough that I don\u0027t want a new thread for it ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nWhoever is responsible for the new \u0022Recent Activity\u0022 page\u0027s extra buttons, filters, and options being right on the page and easily changeable, thanks!
