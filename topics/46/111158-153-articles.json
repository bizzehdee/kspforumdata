Users want freedom.  Freedom is good.  So as moderators, wherever possible we try to let people just do what they want to.  Less moderation is better moderation.  Our preferred reaction, to any situation, is to *\u003Cu\u003Etake no action\u003C/u\u003E* where possible.\n\nThat said... certain patterns of user behavior cause problems for *\u003Cu\u003Eother\u003C/u\u003E* users, and therefore aren\u0027t okay.  So that\u0027s why there are [forum rules](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/guidelines/), so that users know what is or isn\u0027t okay.  As with moderator activity, rules impinge on user freedom, so we believe fewer rules are better, and we try to keep the rules to a bare minimum and only include the specific things that bitter experience has shown us we *\u003Cu\u003Ehave\u003C/u\u003E* to have.  A rule only makes it into The Rules if it\u0027s clear that not having it is worse for everyone than having it.\n\nSo, to get back to your original question:  People post all kinds of stuff.  Some of it\u0027s serious; some of it\u0027s silly.  What\u0027s interesting for one person may be cringe-worthy for another.\n\nAnd honestly, there\u0027s so much user traffic that we few moderators simply don\u0027t have the bandwidth to get emotionally invested in what every new poster posts.  ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)\n\nSo, when we\u0027re working through the approval queue, we generally don\u0027t *\u003Cu\u003Ecare\u003C/u\u003E* much about the content-- there\u0027s too much of it, we can\u0027t afford to care.  All we do is look it over to see \u0022does this break any rules?\u0022  And if the answer is no, we approve.  And if the answer is \u0022yes\u0022, then we\u0027ll address as appropriate (usually with a friendly PM, since most cases involve people who are simply clueless rather than malicious and there\u0027s no point beating them up over it.)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 36 minutes ago, CatastrophicFailure said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E so full of leet-speak expletives you\u2019re not even sure where to begin\n\u003E \n\nYes, in that particular case, that would be rule-breaking (2.2.g for profanity, 2.3.b for l33t-speak), so we\u0027d hide it and drop them a friendly note explaining what the problem is."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-30T21:08:02Z","Content":"People tend to be on their best behavior in their first few posts, so we seldom find problem posts in the new member queue.
