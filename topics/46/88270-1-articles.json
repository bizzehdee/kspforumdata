Now, most places, this is no problem, you can even have 1 character posts. Not here. The stupid 10char limit makes it annoying when I can\u0027t just make a short response, but requires short posts to have 10chars on the end of them. Now, I can see why this exists, to prevent short message spam, but there\u0027s the 5 minute duplicate limit too, which basically solves it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, what I\u0027m asking is if the 10char limit can be removed, or if it\u0027s built in.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-23T02:41:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIndeed.
