Thanks, Yukon! I\u0027ll send a small chunk of Reputation your way...\n\nThe reason I originally created the trophy so small was to showcase an actual Oscar-B tank as the top of it. Sorry if some, such as Majorjim, found it a little underwhelming ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Oh, and Yukon, if there aren\u0027t any Oscar-B\u0027s on your big ol\u0027 trophy, it might be nice to add one...\n\nAnd now, a brief moment of remembrance for Logan...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E R.I.P Upsilon Aerospace\u0027s Computer. It will be greatly missed.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E R.I.P. Logan\n\u003E It will be greatly missed. My computer is getting close to R.I.P, so yeah!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Please accept my sincere regrets for Logan\u0027s untimely passing. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif) What are going to name your next machine? BTW Yukon\u0027s trophy replica looks pretty good to me, I\u0027ll use that unless you\u0027ve got any objections? \n\u003E Cupcake...\n\nI\u0027ll interrupt the remembrance here (sorry, Logan) to state that my next machine will likely be named William, after William \u0022Bill\u0022 Kerman. It\u0027s funny to note that the original three astronauts\u0027 full names may actually be William, Robert, and Jebediah...\n\nAs for the trophy, feel free to use Yukon\u0027s, no objections here!\n\nOkay, back to remembering Logan...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E My computer is named Vall. \n\u003E - I was first naming it after the planet and not the kerbal xD. But I guess it works both ways. She will remember Logan forever... He never gave up! He stood for what is right all up until the end! Today marks the passing of a being. A friend. A brother. RIPIECES\n\n\u003E \n\u003E **\\*starts writing concession speech\\***\n\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9Kappa\n\nActually, I have a fairly good concession speech planned:\n\nLogan was born at some time during the year 2012. He lived a happy, fruitful and productive life. The images, videos and posts he created touched the lives of thousands on this Forum and around the world. He will not be forgotten.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/QuNhTLVgV2Y?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n~~~\n\nOh, and katateochi, I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if you had a trophy soon ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Your videos are excellent.\n\n-Upsilon"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T09:33:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Where is the Best Video Overall winner??
