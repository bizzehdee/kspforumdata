This might turn people off from trying the game, they might think it could be some scam perhaps, or maybe they just don\u0027t want to to through the trouble of sending the email first. What is the reasoning behind this? I\u0027m trying to see if I can put the demo on this computer to demonstrate to some friends, and i ran into this minor thing that might become a problem in the future. It just complicates things.\n\nOn the bright side, the Email is sent out really quickly, within a second. So that\u0027s neat.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-27T21:18:06Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2015 09:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun**"},{"CreatedByName":"robopilot99","CreatedById":102126,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T17:13:04Z","Content":"Yeah I wanted to check out the new demo today and discovered this.
