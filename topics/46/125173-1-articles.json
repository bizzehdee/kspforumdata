I have noticed that even after all this time when i open curse and click find supported games the Curse Client still does not recognize KSP as a supported game. Has anyone else ran into this or could it be a setting on my end? Also why does it seem that mod support is waning for the game... Are we switching platforms for MODS access or are mod devs just stopping the support?\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kreutzkevic","CreatedById":146514,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T07:36:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve noticed that the Curse thingy never really was accepted by the mod dev community.
