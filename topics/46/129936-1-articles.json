By not giving rep to those you feel have made a great post, there is no encouragement offered for them to continue to make contributions to the forum. What I mean by this is that yes, there are those that get rep for mundane things, and it encourages them to continue to do mundane things. Then there are those who truly deserve to stand out in the crowd because they are doing extraordinary things, or perhaps they are contributing in broad ways to the body of knowledge of this forum, or otherwise contributing in very meaningful ways to the game. If this latter group is not given the rep they rightfully deserve, then what\u0027s to separate them from the mundane who are often the benefactors of rep for making a joke?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"monstah","CreatedById":95210,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-15T19:00:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222363329\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022129936\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221452878440\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022110959\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alshain\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Alshain said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLol, it isn\u0027t the fact they ripped it off from anyone, it\u0027s the fact it isn\u0027t hidden.\u00A0 The old reputation system didn\u0027t broadcast it to the entire community when you gave someone rep.\u00A0 It was discrete acknowledgement of a great post.\u00A0 This system says \u0022Look at me I LIKE this.\u0022\u00A0\u00A0 Sorry, no.\u00A0 You will never see my name next to that button anywhere on this forum.\u00A0 Just like Facebook, it is too ostentatious.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere will be my name in some of your posts, however \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I understand and agree with your analysis, even tho I disagree with your conclusions (i.e., \u0022I will not do this myself\u0022). The way I see it, this system didn\u0027t add anything new nor it removed anything old, it just exchanged the ammount of clicks (in the wrong direction, in my opinion and it seems yours, too). Let me explain:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn one hand, you can\u0027t add a message along with the Like, as you previously\u00A0did with Rep. However, as I see it, a message is just a message. You \u003Ci\u003Ecan\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0write a subsequent message telling the person why you liked the post; it\u0027s just more work. The previous forum gave you such option then and there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, there\u0027s the \u0022Monstah likes this\u0022 thing. I could be wrong, but I remember that in the old forum you could dig that information up; it was buried somewhere in the person\u0027s profile (a page full of links to the posts that were given rep to, and by whom). Now, however, that information is broadcast on the posts themselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, one information didn\u0027t disappear, and the other one has always been around; however, the information I find more interesting (why I repped) is now hidden a few clicks away, so that it feels like a separate task I might not be inclined to go through; conversely, the information which I and you find irrelevant and perhaps invasive is now broadcast for everyone to see. Definetely not what I call a move in the right direction, but then again not something that offends me into not doing it anymore. As adsii1970 just said, if someone says something I find informative, useful, entertaining ro whatever, I feel it encouraging to give them a Like, even though I would\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eprefer\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eto give a Rep (and a message) instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
