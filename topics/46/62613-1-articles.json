Now it is in the right place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the issues with spaceport is within the software. It\u0027s not something Squad is wqishing to spend time on fixing, and for understandable reasons. As you said, Spaceport is a total mess. The people who made it pretty much wrote it all wrong, and it\u0027s built over WordPress, which is about the worst choice in that case. That said, fixing the spaceport is something that would take more resources than creating a new one. It\u0027s beyond the point oif non return. This is why N3X15 was working on SP2. However he was fired in early December and no one really knows what\u0027s going on now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the uploads, this is indeed a problematic thing. It\u0027s not necessarily people smashing buttons. The upload function is broken and often results in multiple pages of uploads. I usually get around to clean it all at least once a week. I\u0027ll get to it when I have some time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I\u0027d ask you to chill down, watch your language, and patiently wait for a resolution to the situation.
