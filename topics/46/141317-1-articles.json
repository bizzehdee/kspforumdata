There were some modders that had the attitude that if you use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, then somehow you are not smart enough to play KSP. Then there were those modders that insisted that many people are too dumb to understand how KSP works and that if they cannot figure out how to manually install mods, then they should either just play the game vanilla or don\u0027t play it at all. It was really disheartening and at the same time, a turn off about this forum for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have seen the same name-calling and assertions made about those who play with MechJeb and to be honest, I was very vocal about my feelings - Kerbal Space Program is a stand-alone game that is basically a big sandbox full of neat and shiny parts.\u00A0 It is up to the individual user to define how they want to play the game, then simply do it. Mods, for whatever reasons, are more akin to tools. Sure, you do not absolutely need tools to have a garden but it sure makes it easier, or more rewarding, etc. So I am very careful on the forum to nurture and encourage the novice player as well as the seasoned player who simply enjoys their game a bit differently than I do. As that great painter on National Public Broadcasting used to say, \u0022it\u0027s your world, and maybe here you see a happy tree...\u0022 so go with whatever vision you have for KSP and most of all, never, never tell someone that because they use this mod, they use that mod, or that if they do not understand how the program works, then somehow they are unworthy to even have the program downloaded on their computer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222631391\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022141317\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221465959298\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002227914\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 6/14/2016 at 9:54 PM, Vanamonde said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPeople have the right to be negative, as long as it doesn\u0027t actually break forum rules.

However, they also should *ideally* not make broad comments as I have seen on the forum for the last six months. I read in one of the forum support threads (and I do not remember which one, to be honest with you), where someone actually said they \u003Cem\u003Ehated\u003C/em\u003E newbies because they do not know how to ask questions. To keep from getting another infraction, I simply closed out Firefox (yeah, this preference has even been trashed on the forum), got up from my desk, and folded a basket of laundry. At some point or other, we were all newbies once.

With that assessment I will have to agree. About the only areas of the forum this happens in are the modded and unmodded support threads, the current threads about \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, and a few other support threads.

It is disheartening to find a thread that appears to be answering my question and as I read through the thread, find comments from \u0022experienced\u0022 users that belittle the original poster or those who have genuinely offered advice to help. It seems to be a growing thing on the forum since the release of 1.1. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222630471\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022141317\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221465916327\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257144\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Otis\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 6/14/2016 at 9:58 AM, Otis said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA true and wise leader is able to overcome negativity and respond with a clear and level head. It\u0027s not necessarily productive to be positive and cheerful all the time, nor is it productive to be overly negative.

As I mentioned, I did walk away from the forum. NO, it is not practical nor possible, and probably not even desirable to be cheerful all the time. However, there is enough hostility and rudeness in real life that I try to show a little bit of compassion and respect when dealing even with the most novice KSP forum/player. I think there has only been about five posts of mine that have been remotely rude, and one was aimed at a guy complaining about all the mods broken with the 1.0 (Beta than ever!) release. He was so critical, so rude, and well, my last post was that if he didn\u0027t want to wait for the developers to patch the game and address the bugs, Steam was having a sale on Goat Farmer Simulator (at that time, it was on sale).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVenting can be done in a number of ways. Making blanket statements that put other forum members down, that is demeaning, or whatever other form of veiled personal attack you wish to call it. Venting can be done in a way that is creative and therapeutic.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do not think moving them to a sub-forum will help. Stricter enforcement of forum rules won\u0027t work as it is a big forum and there are many different nationalities and many people simply do not understand the basics of the English language or chat room/messaging basics. What would make a difference is the average forum member treating others the way they\u0027d want to be treated...even if it is only in the written word.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deddly","CreatedById":62955,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-27T14:58:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222649724\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022141317\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221467032860\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002289014\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022adsii1970\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, adsii1970 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003E...the level of hostility and abuse of the community by a few hot-headed and opinionated forum members is beginning to be over the top. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds bad, \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/89014-adsii1970/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002289014\u0022 href=\u0022%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/89014-adsii1970/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@adsii1970\u003C/a\u003E!
