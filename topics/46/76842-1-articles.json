It is ugly and unnecessary, and replacing asterisks with hearts is like replacing beeps with, I don\u0027t know, bird tweets.

You get to be so creative sometimes that speaking with the most politically correct language you can still bring your opponent to its knees. The F, S and other curse words are now mainly used as a quick way to say \u0022oh I hate what happened and I\u0027m actually quite angry about it\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI own a YouTube channel, but actually never gave a single [f word] about what curse words I say because it is part of me, part of my commentary, and I don\u0027t want to start to search for politically correct other words because 3 people will get mad at me because I said that. (I never actually checked what my channel rating is)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, TL;DR I don\u0027t like censorship very much, but I understand why it is here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
