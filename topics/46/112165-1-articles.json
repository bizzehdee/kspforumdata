I\u0027ve tried [td style=valign:middle] and [td=valign:middle] and also vertical-align for both, along with numerous and increasingly kooky ideas. Could I just insert some blank lines to get it approximately correct? Sure. But if I were the kind of person to live comfortably with that, I wouldn\u0027t be nearly obsessive enough to still be playing KSP after more than two and a half years.\n\nI also saw posts here and there on the web saying that it can\u0027t be done, and others showing how it can be done, none of which worked for me. Anyone know how?\n\nMore generally, is there a reference for the codes you can use on this site? I looked in the forum FAQ and the sticky threads here and in the newcomer\u0027s forum, as well as the bbcode help page, and didn\u0027t see anything relevant."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T12:47:08Z","Content":"Can\u0027t help with your alignment issue, but you can find a list of supported BBCode tags [here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/misc.php?do=bbcode)."}]}
