Didn\u0027t know where else to put this question.\n\nSay I post something in a thread, then leave to do other stuff. I\u0027ll come back later (or the next day or whatever), usually through my \u0027Subscribed Threads\u0027 page, and the thread will now have dozens of new posts in several pages. I want to go to the first post after mine so I can continue the discussion, which means backtracking from the most recent post of the thread. There must be a better way! I\u0027ve been on other forums that have an option to show the first unread post, but I can\u0027t seem to find it.\n\nThanks in advance for the help!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-27T17:58:21Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2015 05:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DuoDex**\n  \nadded prefix"},{"CreatedByName":"Lhathron the Elf","CreatedById":118706,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T16:15:40Z","Content":"I believe there is a little arrow button next to threads that does that...
