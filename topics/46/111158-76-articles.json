Also, for some odd reason politics seem to be coming up a lot these days, can\u0027t imagine why.  ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)  So it\u0027s worth a few notes on the subject:\n\nIn general, this forum tries to be a \u0022hands-off\u0022 place, for the most part:  i.e. as much as possible, just let people say what they want to say.  The forum guidelines were written with that in mind, and the moderators generally aim for a policy of \u0022the less moderation, the better.\u0022  So the rules that we *\u003Cu\u003Edo\u003C/u\u003E* have are generally there for very pragmatic reasons:  they\u0027re there because bitter experience has shown that Bad Things happen if they\u0027re not.\n\nSo, politics is one of those areas that has proven to be untouchable.  It\u0027s been shown consistently over the years that it\u0027s simply not possible to have any significant mention of politics without it quickly blowing up into a massive flame-war where nobody wins, because people feel so strongly about these things.  And since politics have nothing to do with KSP itself, we can draw the line there with a clean conscience that we\u0027re not impeding the free discussion of KSP, which is what this forum is about.  If people really want to talk politics, there are plenty of other forums where they can do it.\n\nSo, that raises the interesting question:  just what **\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E** considered \u0022politics\u0022, then?\n\nWell, in this context, we pretty much have to treat it like art:  hard to define, but \u0022we know it when we see it.\u0022  What constitutes \u0022politics\u0022 is a very fuzzy boundary that\u0027s hard to sharply define (for one thing, a lot can depend on context.)  So that\u0027s why the rule is deliberately left fairly vague:  to give the moderators reasonable latitude for judgment.  Basically, **it\u0027s politics if the mods think it\u0027s politics**.\n\nYes, that is, unfortunately, arbitrary.  Unavoidably so.  Because that\u0027s unavoidably arbitrary, we try to take care against the vagaries of individual judgment.  In particular, we try to avoid making such decisions individually:  if a moderator notices something that seems excessively political, they\u0027ll consult with other moderators before taking any action.\n\nWell, okay, I hear you ask, in that case, how do moderators \u0022judge\u0022 this, typically?\n\nBasically, it boils down to:  \u0022does it have a high potential to erupt in a flame war?\u0022   Which rules out just about anything political, given how high passions generally run about these things.  Please understand:  when the moderators enforce these rules, it\u0027s not because of any opinions on politics, or any concern about the issues in question-- simply that they lead to toxic exchanges in the forums that don\u0027t benefit anyone.\n\nSome concrete examples of stuff that fits that description:\n\n- Making pretty much any reference at all-- even in jest-- about specific candidates in current elections, in any country\n- Making generalizations about particular countries\n- Discussing the rightness or wrongness of just about any governmental action-- laws, budgets, etc.\n\n**Those are just a few examples and not intended to be an exhaustive list.**  And even those examples are a bit vague:  everything depends on context, and the nature of the individual post.\n\nThe \u0022it depends\u0022 dictum also bears not just on what the content is, but what the moderator response is after tidying up.  For example:  An innocent user, with a clean record, who happens to make a casual politics-related joke because they didn\u0027t realize it was out of bounds, and clearly meant no harm by it?  Probably just a gentle reminder \u0022please don\u0027t do politics, even in jest.\u0022  An angry political rant dropped like a bomb into an otherwise non-political thread?  Probably something a bit harsher, especially if the user has been warned for it before.  It all depends.\n\nSo that\u0027s the deal from the moderators\u0027 perspective.  How does this apply to you?  Here\u0027s what the mods would like to request of all the users:\n\n- Please, just don\u0027t do politics here, okay?  There are other places for that.\n- If you see someone else doing politics, please **don\u0027t respond**.\n- If someone seems to be posting stuff that\u0027s over the line, **don\u0027t call them on it** (that\u0027s \u0022backseat moderating\u0022, it\u0027s against forum rule 3.2).  Instead, just **report the post**, along with an explanatory note, and let the moderators take care of anything that may need taking care of.  It\u0027s what we\u0027re *\u003Cu\u003Efor\u003C/u\u003E*.\n- I know that all of the above sounds vague and hand-wavy.  Can\u0027t be helped, I\u0027m sorry.  If you have more specific questions about specific instances, please feel free to privately message any of the moderator staff and we\u0027ll be happy to weigh in (with the understanding that, due to privacy concerns, we can never discuss moderator action against a user with anyone other than that user).\n\n**TL;DR:**  Politics are against the rules, but there are some light edge cases where you might get away with it.  Don\u0027t try."},{"CreatedByName":"Andem","CreatedById":155578,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-30T19:22:47Z","Content":"This isn\u0027t really a question, but props to the moderation team and SQUAD for making this forum such an incredible place.
