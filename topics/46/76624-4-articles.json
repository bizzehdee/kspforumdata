Any possibility of REVEALING the problem?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThing is, with problems such as these, it\u0027s not always easy to pin down the problem based on the symptoms. It\u0027s easy to tell when you haven\u0027t fixed the problem, because it keeps happening. On the other hand, even when you have fixed the problem, there can easily be a reasonably long period of uncertainty while you\u0027re basically just waiting for the problem to re-occur. Such is life for a sysadmin. Then add in end-users who think that explaining in minute detail how much the problem is inconveniencing them, presumably because they think this results in a quicker fix (seriously, it doesn\u0027t), and you arrive at the reason so many of us earn the BOFH label.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow on the other hand, in nearly 20 years of server-managing, I\u0027ve rarely held it to be a good idea to invoke need-to-know, unless there is a serious need for secrecy. There\u0027s a fine line between saying nothing, and looking like you don\u0027t know what the problem is.
