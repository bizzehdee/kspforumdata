That\u0027s not how the post hyperlinks work. Each post in the entire forum has a unique ID. As an example, your last post just now has an ID of 1709257. These IDs are what\u0027s used with the post hyperlink. By referencing IDs like 2 and 5 and 17 and in between, you\u0027re actually linking to completely different posts -- these posts are some of the oldest in the entire forum, and even I don\u0027t have access to where some of those are kept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe numbers in the top right of posts are just the number of a post in the thread, and are not immutable. You\u0027ll need to copy the hyperlink (each post number is hyperlinked) from it (right-click -\u0026gt; Copy Link Address, or the equivalent if you use a different browser to me) and get the ID from that hyperlink.
