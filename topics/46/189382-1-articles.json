A mod said deleting your profile is impossible and, alas, closed the thread before anyone could reply (hence this thread).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m somewhat puzzled why we can\u0027t delete our profile on the KSP forums, especially since you can on other Take2 websites, as per their \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.take2games.com/privacy/#8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPrivacy Policy\u003C/a\u003E. So it appears to directly infringe \u003Ca href=\u0022https://gdpr-info.eu/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGDPR regulations\u003C/a\u003E - which state that any EU internet user has \u0022The right to be forgotten\u0022 or \u003Cspan\u003E\u0022The right of erasure\u0022 on the internet. \u003C/span\u003ESince the KSP forums are providing services and store personal data (at least an email address, I take it an IP address, but who knows what else?*) of EU users, they are bound by EU regulations. So if we can\u0027t delete our full profile, can our personal data removed/deleted at the very least?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot trying to start an excrement storm here, but if personal data is currently not removed upon request of an EU user, \u0027KSP forums\u0027 and their owners are liable to GDPR regulation infringement, which can result in a lot of misery that no-one is waiting for.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/66485-squad/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002266485\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/66485-squad/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@SQUAD\u003C/a\u003E and forum mods, it would be immensely appreciated if you could give us a bit more feedback on why we can\u0027t delete our profile/personal data, other than: \u0022\u003Cem\u003ENope, I\u0027m sorry, but that is not something this forum does\u003C/em\u003E.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo start, could you please answer the questions below, though I\u0027m sure my fellow forum users will have some more:\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. In neglect of deleting profiles/accounts, how do you warrant that a user\u0027s personal data is deleted within 30 days upon request?\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. What personal data do the KSP forums store?\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. Is this personal data distributed/used in any way or form outside of the KSP forums?\u003Cbr\u003E\n4.
