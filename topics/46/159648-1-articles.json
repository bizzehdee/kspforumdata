This leads seemingly very long edits as I usually put most of the info in spoilers, and since I can\u0027t close them, I have to scroll through every piece of text in spoilers to get to what I want to edit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis gets pretty irritating when I have to navigate through spoilers-in-spoilers and whatnot to find which part I want to change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s even getting to the point where things are starting to get laggy, which is immensely infuriating as the lag makes me scroll past the bit I want to change, etc etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo is there a way to close these spoilers so I can directly go to the place I need to change? Is it even possible?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
