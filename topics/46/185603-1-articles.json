Then if you closed the notifications and re-opened they\u0027d all appear as followed links (non-bold text).\u00A0 I kinda liked this behaviour. If you have 15 notifications, those 15 would be bold and if you chose to ignore them all, then when you next got say 2 notifications only those 2 would be bold.\u00A0 That made it easier to see what was new.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow all the links in the notifications remain bold unless you actually click on them.
