I believe Imgur works. Upload it there, and then when you view the page on Imgur with your (full) image on it, right click that image and \u0022copy image location\u0022 or (if that\u0027s not available) open it in a new tab. That new tab will contain the link to the image and not the \u0022imgur page.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy \u0022kind of\u0022 with HTML, you can\u0027t enter it directly but you CAN write an HTML page, open it in a web browser, copy the page (not the source) and paste it into your signature. I did this for the table that is in my signature, before remaking it when I got a bit more comfortable with the wonky way the forum implements formatting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suggest trying to make your signature using the tools provided, it\u0027ll make it much easier to modify it later.
