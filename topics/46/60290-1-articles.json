Now, for fun, I kerbalized that. Unfortunately, it also changes the initiallism to, well, you can probably guess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKnowing people would be offended, I spefically, in QUOTE tags so it would be noticed and in the first line of the post, stated that the KKK initiallism was a side effect of my attempt to humorously kerbalize the name and that I was in no way attempting to make a racist reference. Now could I change the name? Yes. Would that make it similar to a semi-active, often overlooked collab? Yes. Would that help my popularity? probably not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, even with the disclaimer blatantly obvious, I have at least two people who got annoyed by it and there is about 3-4 comments (including a response to one of them by me which was slightly blunter than I probably should have been) discussing nothing but that. IN the interest of clutter, I\u0027d like to have them removed please as they serve no purpose to further the thread and simply stir controversy which I specifically stated was in no way my intention. If people are offended, I am not forcing them to open the thread, comment in it, or otherwise join the project and I\u0027m sorry they feel that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was attempting some kerbalizing humor that ended up hurting some seemingly sensitive people.
