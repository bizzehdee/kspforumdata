I had a few people who were following me who had later become banned from the forum. In full disclosure, three of them were banned before I became a moderator. I\u0027ve noticed that since the forum update, those people are no longer appearing in the \u0022following\u0022 part of my profile page. Also, there were a few people who have been inactive for over two years - and they are also no longer appearing in that section of the forum profile.\n\nIf a forum user selects the option to log in anonymously, then the last date of their forum activity will show on their profile as the last day they logged in without selecting that option. I do not think this would have any bearing on them being considered as \u0022inactive\u0022 since all this option does is hide your current status. The forum\u0027s database still logs your activities to include the last time you were active even though it is not visible to the forum members. Every website which has some sort of log-in feature has a database. In WordPress, for example, there is a SQL database that literally is the brains behind the website. I am extremely confident  Invision web software uses a similar database system.\n\nIn all honesty, I know there will be some who feel this is a bad thing. I do not, although I hated seeing [@sal_vager](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/16426-sal_vager/) and a few others disappear out of the list of those following me. However, the forum is not a competition to see who can have the most followers or most likes. It is a place where we can share experiences and fellowship around a couple of common things - our enjoyment of Kerbal Space Program as a game, the enjoyment of the fellowship on this forum, and spaceflight and space exploration.\n\nIs removing inactive followers really a bad thing? No, I do not think so. I am sure with the way the software is designed that ***if*** those people ever come back to the forum and return to some sort of activity status, they will reappear. It\u0027s not like their profile or any of their content was deleted out of the forum\u0027s database.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, Mikenike said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@AlamoVampire](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/78020-alamovampire/), can\u0027t say they nuked them, but all my followers are active in the community so, I don\u0027t know.
