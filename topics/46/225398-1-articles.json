It is not something intended for commentary.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt is a testimonial to share with all of those who were instrumental in assisting me through the darkest days of my life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is something I find myself pondering in those transitory hours where sleep eludes me. What does KSP mean to me? That is a very simple question with an incredibly complicated answer. I wanted to ask those of the community with a higher-than-average emotional attachment, the same question.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI am not asking for folks to elaborate at great length about some specific aspect of one singular title.\u003Cbr\u003E\nRather, how has KSP: the IP, forum, craft exchange, Discord mod community, or maybe just the quirk of one Jebediah Kerman contributed in some positive way to who you have become?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you feel so inclined, please share your account of what KSP means personally.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps it is something simple. A friend of mine was experiencing a grade school child pulling away due to a lack of shared interest. My friend was always a Lego aficionado, and that semblance allowed a transference childlike wonder once experienced playing with Lego Space or Blacktron model sets.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis love lead to him actively building space themed dioramas with his son.\u00A0To this day they still build dioramas of whatever missions are ongoing.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor those of us with mental health issues, it is easy to develop a significant attachment to those things which help us through darkness, but this game has touched such a broad spectrum of lives its insane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith myself, it is the forum. This space is an example of something becoming greater than the sum of its parts.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe forum is a truly wonderful place. How many places do you see a community transcend national borders and similarly overcome the gap in age and education?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI first laid eyes on these beautiful little frog people due to an ad on a mobile game \u0027Spaceflight Simulator.\u0027\u003Cbr\u003E\nI was immediately captivated by these idiotic space cowboys. I wanted to learn more and the interwebz provided one heck of a rabbit hole. I gravitated to the fanfiction and really learned a great deal about the Kerbal perspective. An unwillingness to accept reality no matter how harsh, a desperate drive to see and do more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found other stories as well, tucked away in some of the more obscure nooks of these hallowed halls.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey are stories where disadvantaged individuals scoff at circumstance. Young teens in impoverished countries learned to code through a love of modding this wonderful game.\u003Cbr\u003E\nPeople in menial dead-end jobs found a game that nurtured all the geek dreams they held most dear and inspired many to attend higher education.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis forum was instrumental in saving my life. This is not\u00A0 NOT hyperbole, nor exaggeration. But the simple truth, from the eyes of a bi polar junkie.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt was these wonderful stories of accomplishment derived from an inspiration supplied by these little frog peeps. So many hopeful testimonials.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou see, when I first saw that ad come across my mobile screen, I was living in a tent under a bridge. Being among the indigent population breeds an inner contempt that burned like the sun next to the candle of past self-recrimination. At this point, any computer seemed to be an extravagant luxury well beyond my ability to obtain. Something I obviously did not deserve. Those times I could snag wifi or afford to top up my phone card were spent lurking in this magical realm. Under that long-lost email, I was able to discover ... \u003Cstrong\u003Ehope.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this is the singular component of life that most people take for granted. Hope is a such a simple thing when taken at face value, but all together lacking in the lives of many.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI am predisposed to view hope as a dangerous commodity. Hope leads to disappointment, which leads to despair, which leads to darkness that ends in unhealthy coping mechanisms.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI realize, this probably sounds cheesy AF to those uninitiated to the struggles of mental illness.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSometimes it is disproportionately difficult to \u0022pull ourselves up\u0022 or even \u0022touch grass.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nSome days every single ounce of energy that can be mustered up through willpower alone is consumed by mundane tasks like going to work or brushing one\u0027s teeth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis forum also helped me to believe in myself again, which is priceless. I got in touch with professionals equipped to provide the proper help. You do not go from a tent to the White House. To even set such a lofty goal is a deadly act that promotes disappointment (a tricky way for the self-hate to justify itself) and leads to despair. I went through a couple of years of \u0022small goals with small rewards\u0022 for self-image repair. All the while, I watched this place blossom... as a guest and outsider.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMan, I wanted to play Kerbal so F*ING bad. Becoming part of the Kerbal community was a significant motivating factor. Almost 3 years ago, I got my first computer in over a decade. Kerbal was everything I had hoped it to be. In those hours where darkness threatens to swallow me, I turn to my career game on KSP1 or come to this forum to read/engage with those I have come to cherish.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou see... I \u003Cem\u003Elove\u003C/em\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003Eyou all\u003C/strong\u003E. Even those of you that irritate me. All of those folks who have challenged someone else... and it resulted in pages of educational material, MUAH... For all those who write detailed bug reports or play devil\u0027s advocate to those who do.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSpecial thanks to\u00A0all those wonderful modders \u0026amp; to the forum managers, also to those guests who hit the site traffic metrics without ever \u003Cem\u003Ebelonging\u003C/em\u003E. All those kids who were inspired to touch the stars... To the janitor now working in aerospace...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEt cetera, ad infinitum.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDear Forums,\u003Cbr\u003E\nThank you for more than I can ever say.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-10T22:48:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNice idea for a thread. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E As it concerns the community, it has been moved to Kerbal Network.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-11T00:41:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI grew up loving space, and spaceflight. I saw Star Wars in the theater and parents today would be shocked at how young I was allowed to watch people shooting each other and blowing each other up. I was *just* old enough to enjoy it but not old enough to realize that yeah, the Stormtroopers executed Luke\u0027s aunt and uncle in cold blood and one of them was running away on fire when they died.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time I was 10, I was reading hard sci fi like Asimov and Heinlein, and before I could drive I\u0027d read the first 3 Dune books, and while those were all great what I really found myself drawn to were the ones with realistic space flight, where travel times and moving targets meant complicated trajectories and multi-hour or -day burns to both speed up and slow down. I devoured the first two of Niven\u0027s Ringworld books (the third turned me off early and I never finished it) the entire Heechee Saga by Fredrick Pohl (Again, I was too young for a lot of the themes the first time I read it, but I still loved it), and one of my favorites was The Integral Trees - again by Larry Niven.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Integral Trees is like a primer for orbital maneuver planning. It takes place in a ring of breathable air orbiting a star, where there is no ground and the \u0022Integral trees\u0022 are up to 100 km long, and stay aimed at (and away from) the star by tidal forces, catching organic matter in their endpoints in the wind that blows by because that air is orbiting the star slower or faster than the tree itself. Amazing thought put into those things. And the people who lived in this \u0022smoke ring\u0022 know how to navigate it, not because of orbital mechanics but because of a mantra: \u0022East takes you Out, Out takes you West, West takes you In, In takes you East, Port and Starboard bring you back.\u0022 They learned Orbital Mechanics not by studying the sky, but by living in it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway mumblty-mumble years later, I\u0027m watching this Minecraft player on YouTube and he starts a new series where little green Minions launch themselves into space or explode trying. I was instantly transfixed. What a PERFECT mix of silly goofy fun and real, honest to goodness orbital mechanics. A friend of mine said it best when he told me, \u0022It\u0027s as if someone asked me to describe the perfect game for me, and then they made Kerbal Space Program.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI didn\u0027t get a career because of this game, or decide to try to become an astronaut or rocket scientist. It didn\u0027t get me to look at the skies more (I already did that!) or appreciate the cosmos (I did that too). What it DID do was allow me to participate in it in a way that I never could before. It was tangible. I wasn\u0027t imagining what it was like to go to another planet. I was DOING IT.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m going to be frank here: The failure of KSP2 isn\u0027t that big a deal to me personally (though for literally everybody involved on all the sides of everything I wish it had done better) because I always knew I wouldn\u0027t play it anywhere near how much I played the original. Apparently if you do something for 10 thousand hours, you\u0027re an expert at it. Well I\u0027m an expert at Kerbal Space Program and KSP2 can\u0027t teach me much more about orbital mechanics. Sure it could have applied those orbital mechanics in a unique way, but I\u0027ve reached the end of the learning curve and - for me - that learning curve (which was more like a learning precipice) was where I derived my enjoyment of the game. Now that I know how to do everything I wanted to learn from the game... it\u0027s a bit boring, if that isn\u0027t blasphemous to say.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd it\u0027s okay that it bores me. I got TEN FREAKING THOUSAND HOURS before I got bored. I orbited through a Mun arch. I landed inside the Tylo cave. I used Tylo to get a better encounter of Tylo (something my brain still refuses to believe is reasonable). I\u0027ve flown on Jool and glided a dragonfly across Duna. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannh\u00E4user Gate. Oh wait wrong monologue. Anyway you get the idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve said before that really the only thing keeping me here is the community, but also tethering me to this forum the sheer mass of ten thousand hours of experiences that I can\u0027t really share with many other people than those here, and those who have left here never to be heard from again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that\u0027s my KSP testimonial; what it is to me. It\u0027s not a game, really. It\u0027s a learning tool. The purpose of KSP to me was to learn how to play KSP and I did it. It took a hefty fraction of my life but I did it and now that I have all those skills... I don\u0027t really have much to do with them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich is kinda sad when you think about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
