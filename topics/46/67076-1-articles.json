The forum menu does not look very professional when used that way, with elements overlapping and covering each other. I don\u0027t really mind as I rarely use these menus but I thought maybe I could mention it happens.

Chrome tells me that it\u0027s set up as a horizontal list. The reason it overflows like that is because the navbar has a fixed height, which only permits a single row of buttons. It\u0027d take some fiddling, but if anyone has access to the CSS, (do you? I seem to recall you have at least some control over stuff here) it should be posisble to work out an alternative formatting that won\u0027t break so thoroughly. Apart from the fixed height, there\u0027d probably need to be some padding added to the right side of the navbar so as to prevent any items on the navbar being allowed to render underneath the searchbar... Eh. All depends, I guess.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
