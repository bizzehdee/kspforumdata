There are a lot of very popular threads that I have posted in in the past that I no longer have any interest in.

It\u0027s how I use every forum and it\u0027s a very productive, clean, easy, and compact way to keep up to date without all that mucking about with subscribing. I have a bookmark that is this url:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003Eforum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/search.php?do=getnew\u0026amp;contenttype=vBForum_Post\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis url takes me to a \u0022search\u0022 of all threads that have updated since the last time I\u0027ve visited. Those I\u0027ve posted in have a symbol next to them. Those I\u0027ve not do not. I peruse ALL of those links by name to see if I want to read them, but I pay special attention to those marked as \u0022you posted here\u0022 because someone may have asked a question, pointed out a fallacy in something I said, or whatnot and I\u0027d like to see and deal with that as appropriate. However, many times threads devolve and are no longer useful, or I commented on them months ago and they are very popular yet not of interest to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I were to only utilize the subscription feature, I\u0027d not have a link to all new posts. If I were to utilize the subscription feature and also use this link, I\u0027d double the pages to view and still see the threads I don\u0027t want to see. So subscriptions are at best redundant and at worst restrictive, and are work to set up and maintain to boot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027d like to keep using the forum as I am, with the added option to hide certain threads from it so I they don\u0027t keep bugging me. Is it a horrible thing that I can\u0027t live with any more? No. Is it an annoyance I\u0027d like to do without? Yes. I\u0027ll still browse the forums regardless, but I\u0027d be a little happier with something like this in place \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-18T10:53:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAhh I see what you mean now. Indeed vBulletin does not have this option, and I can\u0027t find a mod that accomplishes this either. Plus, installing a mod on the forums brings the same problems as installing a mod for KSP: when it comes time to update your software, mods may be broken. However, I did manage to track down a solution for you: Greasemonkey. Greasmonkey is an addon for Mozilla Firefox, which is also supported up to some degree by other major browsers such as Chrome and Opera and allows you to run scripts that alter websites. Someone made a Greasemonkey script that should fit your needs here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://userscripts.org/scripts/show/120455\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://userscripts.org/scripts/show/120455\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know if it works!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-18T11:17:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESeems to do the trick.
