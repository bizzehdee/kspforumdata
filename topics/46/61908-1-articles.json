It has happened in the past that they would allow people to submit their own applications whenever there are openings, but as far as I have seen recently, all nominations are done internally by already-assigned moderators. Admins are a bit of a different piece of the pie, and I\u0027m not 100% sure how that goes, myself, but at a guess I\u0027d say they\u0027re the few who were probably approved by someone directly involved with Squad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a few other positions -- Global Moderators (blue-names) have a few extra privileges, and they\u0027re just moderators who\u0027ve been around a while and are level-headed enough to be considered for promotion. Some Globals are also Admins -- I think, for example, sal_vager has a blue-name, but he\u0027s an Admin in addition to being a global moderator. Rowsdower is our current Community Manager, and he\u0027s directly assigned by Squad. He handles the general PR and works with the moderation team. There will be a few people with Administrative access that you\u0027ll rarely (or almost never) see around, as well; those folks are on Squad\u0027s payroll, to the best of my knowledge. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll forum staff have to be 18 or older, as we have to legally agree to a NDA.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Souper","CreatedById":86003,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-02T05:40:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWait...
