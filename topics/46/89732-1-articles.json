I\u0027m not even sure what you mean with the Kerbal XP system and upgrade of buildings remarks, but both systems seem fine additions from where I\u0027m standing. Adding modders work makes sense. No point in redoing all of the work themselves just to end up with a product that looks identical (Porkjet just nailed the stock look while making MK2). This is faster, allowing Squad to expand the game more quickly, and is great for the modders as well, as they get something to put on their resume or even some money (understandably the details on that are kept private). And maybe some modders have left lately, but that happens all the time. On the other hand we\u0027ve gotten some new modders and mods in the recent months (BahamutoDs work, that weather mod, etc.). Don\u0027t worry about Squad running out of money either. They\u0027re virtually always among the 50 top selling games on Steam and when they do a sale it always makes the game get into the Top 10. A game with those numbers is enough to support Squad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-08T14:40:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm, I\u0027ll see if I can find some time to gather a few statistics.
