Usually forum systems make excessive use of the database cache which is held in memory. The most common searches are stored there, for example: all threads of the first page of a sub forum, all posts of the most recent threads, etc. - in short all data which will be accessed several thousend times per day. This data is updated in a fixed intervall (usually a few seconds or minutes) to further reduce the amount of work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you change the way how the searches are done you can easily break this high performance system.

Don\u0027t bother doing any of the joins between posts and threads tables. Just search the posts themselves, and don\u0027t bother culling out the multiple posts mentioning a word in the same thread, and it would let you see a list of the POSTS containing the search term and when you click on them you get taken to the link to that post within its thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
