There really shouldn\u0027t be that many situations that are outside of an existing thread, but if there is, you can PM any of the mods you do see around regularly and we\u0027ll get to it as soon as we can.  If it\u0027s urgent, and doesn\u0027t pertain to a particular thread, you can always report any thread (one of the pinned locked threads is probably a good one) and any moderators that are on will see it."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-13T19:31:00Z","Content":"That\u0027s not disabled for moderators.

A zero point warn is just a formal reminder of our rules. 1-3 points means it\u0027s getting more serious. 5 points means your posts require moderator approval before they\u0027re visible for a while because we want to keep an eye on you. 10 total points earns you a 1-week ban because you did something significantly harmful. If you get up to 25 points that\u0027s a permanent ban. However, the points expire after a while. So the penalties only apply if you have that many *current*, non-expired points."},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-15T05:58:47Z","Content":"I usually see the streamers on twitch thing.
