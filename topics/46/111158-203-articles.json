First, you must prepare your body by shaving everywhere and covering yourself in peanut butter. Then there\u0027s the physical, where you are tested for endurance and agility by running a 10km obstacle course in subzero temperatures while carrying a backpack full of wet sand. After that, you must write a 1000-word essay about the spirit of the KSP community and how you will preserve and protect it. That done, you move on to the Reverse Captcha, where you must read 1000 posts and determine which ones are spambots, miss more than one and you\u0027re out. Finally, after you have completed those tasks, you must submit your moderator registration fee of $1000 in cash to UomoCapra and he\u0027ll make you a moderator.^[^^1]^\n\nSpoiler\n\nIn my case, I was approached by [@Darth Badie](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/149302-darth-badie/), who asked me if I was interested in being part of the moderator team. I said yes (after asking a bunch of questions), signed an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Non-Disclosure Agreement\u0022\u003ENDA\u003C/abbr\u003E, and was given a whole bunch of moderator permissions and access. We very much throw new moderators in the deep end and make them learn how to swim!\n\nWe have a few things we look for in moderators:\n\n1) Minimum age 18 years old, for legal reasons (tropical years, not siderial). \n\n2) Have a good understanding of the English language. A second language is valuable but not required, a number of our mods are unilingual.\n\n3) The person is expected to have been contributing for a long time in a positive way to the community and shown a willingness to adapt to and abide by the rules. Post count and rep points don\u0027t count, but a hard-earned good reputation and the respect of others is vital.\n\n4) The prospective moderator must be friendly and have a desire to help others. \n\n5) Must definitely not have any craving for position or power. \n\n6) Must be willing to do thankless tasks in their free time that very few people, if any, will ever notice, and to occasionally be on the receiving end of unkind, abusive messages whilst being able to keep objectivity and without responding in the same manner.\n\n^[1]^[Adapted from the original by Red Iron Crown](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/103121-how-does-one-become-a-moderator/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=1799822)"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-10T18:56:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 minutes ago, Dman979 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Finally, after you have completed those tasks, you must submit your moderator registration fee of $1000 in cash to UomoCapra and he\u0027ll make you a moderator.^[^^1]^\n\u003E \n\nOoh ooh when do you get your keys to the Forbidden Library?"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-10T19:23:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 26 minutes ago, CatastrophicFailure said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Ooh ooh when do you get your keys to the Forbidden Library?\n\u003E \n\nThose - we do not speak of.\n\nOr so a friend of a friend told me..."},{"CreatedByName":"HansonKerman","CreatedById":185809,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-11T00:29:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 5 hours ago, Dman979 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4) The prospective moderator must be friendly and have a desire to help others.\n\u003E \n\n4.5) be high spirited and funny for at least most of the time.
