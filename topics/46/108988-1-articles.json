I rarely play games except for KSP, and a couple others that aren\u0027t on steam, so I\u0027d rather just do away with it. Will I have to re-buy the game, or is there an option to download it directly from SQUAD after purchasing on steam? Can I just transfer the whole KSP directory over? Will that work cross-platform? (New computer will be Linux, old one is Windows)."},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor831","CreatedById":68286,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T00:59:32Z","Content":"You probably should email KSP support. See here: [https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/en/?page_id=23](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/en/?page_id=23)\n\nI\u0027ve heard them to be quite reasonable about these kinds of things, but obviously I can\u0027t speak for them. There also might be technical reasons that would hinder moving you off of Steam, as I seem to recall something about that not being a simple thing. But really, emailing them directly would be the best way to get an answer."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T09:32:25Z","Content":"As you bought KSP on Steam, you will need to use Steam to re-download or update the game, Squad does not allow for licences to be transferred from Steam to the store.\n\nHowever you do not need the Steam client, [**there is a command line version here**](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD) that can download, install and update Steam games.\n\nYou can also back-up your current KSP install and copy it over as it is not tied to Steam by DRM."}]}
