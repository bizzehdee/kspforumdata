That\u0027d enable us (users who compose music, soundtracks, etc) to embed these tracks in the streamlined and accessible way that the SC widget makes possible. Would make it easier to show, share, and discuss our sounds, as well as having them as signature -- all without having to leave the page we\u0027re on. (and side note here: The sound community on this forum could use a little help \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway , creating this custom [soundcloud] or [sc] tag seems to be pretty straightforward, as explained in 5 steps \u003Ca href=\u0022https://blog.soundcloud.com/2009/07/28/soundcloud-player-in-forums-5-step-guide-for-soundcloud-bb-code/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would look something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aO4D2jS.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022aO4D2jS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T23:59:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing them as signatures mightn\u0027t work if the widgets are too tall... but yeah, I agree this\u0027d be pretty cool.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eurybaric","CreatedById":33541,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-01T09:20:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENah, it\u0027s quite customisable.
