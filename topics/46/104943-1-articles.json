I\u0027m going to buy KSP right now, but I wanted to use Danny2462 referral link, so he receives a bit of money. But, the URL to buy KSP has changed, do referral links work anymore? Can admins add an auto-redirection to new link when we visit the old page?\n\nI don\u0027t know how to set the URL so it works correctly.
