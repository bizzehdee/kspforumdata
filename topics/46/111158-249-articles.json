In a rate of 1 out of 10, how hard it\u0027s to be applicated to be a Moderator?\n2. Has a forum controversy happened in here? (that\u0027s not involved with the Dres existance dispute)\n3. A necropost with nice (up-to-date) content or info is still considered a pointless necropost?\n4. I see that my Profile link has numbers before my name, however i\u0027m curious about which forum user has the 69 number on it.\n5.

I\u0027m currently developing a mod, but i\u0027m still struggling to find the appropiate License, i suppose that a CC-BY-NC-ND License will make it much more restrict to any community patch for it? but a CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 will make things like that happen, but it will risk my models and stuff to be used on other mods without permission. Is what i said true? Also Which one is appropiate for my Planet Pack and my Visual Mod?\n2. An CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 means that i\u0027m able to release modifications of it(for example, i have variants of Jupiter Textures which i took from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E-Textures), but i\u0027m not sure if full authorization is required to release it.\n3. What is a Source code? and do i need to provide such code on every mod i release?\n4. Is Curseforge still relevant?\n5. I have another mod(in dev) with music(that needs Soundtrack Editor), however, the composer of the music i bundled has all of them All Rights Reserved, which means that i need to contact with him for the use of his music, if so, maybe i\u0027ll talk to him for permission?\n6.

This is one of the friendliest places on the net.
