Some of us are here for a variety of personal reasons, and for me, being a part of this forum and being a contributor to the health to the forum outweighs the forum\u0027s contribution to the mental load I already carry. But each moderator is different and I am sure as other members of the moderation team respond, should they decide to, you\u0027ll see a variety of answers on the stresses and reasoning for being a member of the moderation team.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 10 hours ago, ShuttlePilot said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Wouldn\u0027t it be difficult to moderate the forums almost every single day?\n\u003E \n\nThere are times when I will step back from the forum for a few days at a time. The most is normally three days. It\u0027s a combination of things - there are a few things I never do when I am not feeling my mental best:\n\n- Discipline a child when I am angry or in a bad mood\n- Discuss serious issues with my spouse when I am in a bad mood\n- Grade papers when I am in a bad mood\n- Moderate this forum when I am in a bad mood\n\nI ***know*** I can be extremely difficult to deal with when I am in a bad mood. I will grade students\u0027 papers much more harshly than I usually would if I am in a bad mood. I will ground my daughter with more severe restrictions than probably would be considered fair under normal circumstances, and I am less tolerant of other things as well. So, with that being said, it is in everyone\u0027s best interest when I am having one of those ***bad mood*** kind of days for me to take a step back.\n\nIn fact, I posted a status update because I recently took a step back for a bit longer this time. I had a few real-life things going on and simply needed to get my head into a better, more stable and happier place.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 10 hours ago, ShuttlePilot said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I couldn\u0027t take this, how do you even. Just tell me your secrets how are you not dead from this much moderating. Or is it a relaxing job? (I don\u0027t think so).\n\u003E \n\nAs [@Gargamel](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/64714-gargamel/) said, most of the work is light housekeeping - approving posts from new forum members, moving threads around, splitting off-topic posts into new threads, and merging parallel threads. The thing I hate doing is having to play surgeon to someone\u0027s post. I am a freedom of speech guy but there are forum guidelines for a reason.  I don\u0027t go looking for moderating work to do, but wait until it is reported by another forum member before I even consider doing anything. And as Gargamel said, we use mod chat to discuss the moderation actions that need to be taken. Nearly all the serious (disciplinary) moderation action taken is discussed and a consensus is made from the available members of the moderation team.\n\nThere are aspects of being a member of the moderation team I absolutely enjoy. I really enjoy doing the TOTMs each month. As you may have noticed, I have made it one of my regular monthly \u0022duties.\u0022 It takes the pressure off the rest of the moderation team knowing it will be done and they don\u0027t have to agree which one is going to get stuck doing it. I also enjoy approving and interacting with newer forum members - I\u0027d like their first interaction with a member of the moderation team to be a good one rather than one of those dreaded \u0022hey, you can\u0027t do that...\u0022 interactions.\n\nOverall, I\u0027d say that it\u0027s a mixed bag. From my perspective, it\u0027s mostly good things that happen. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Admiral Fluffy","CreatedById":210816,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-16T01:11:33Z","Content":"Why can\u2019t we see when the mods were last online?  \n\nCertain members too like Red Iron Crown."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-16T02:01:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 49 minutes ago, Admiral Fluffy said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Why can\u2019t we see when the mods were last online?  \n\u003E \n\u003E Certain members too like Red Iron Crown.\n\u003E \n\nBecause it\u0027s a setting one can turn off.
