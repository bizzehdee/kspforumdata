There\u0027s a lot of inter-moderator chat and consultation as well, which helps to keep our practices more consistent with each other.  So if a moderator were to go \u0022out on a limb\u0022 at some point (i.e. take an action inconsistent with the forum rules, or inconsistent with our commonly accepted moderator \u0022best practices\u0022), then the other moderators would likely notice and comment on it anyway.\n\nSo if you get dinged for something, in general there\u0027s a fairly high probability that it\u0027s what any moderator would do, and less likely to be the vagaries of an individual moderator.  (Of course, that doesn\u0027t mean that an individual moderator couldn\u0027t make a mistake once in a while-- we\u0027re all human!

(Not necessarily always, but quite often.)  So in general, if a player receives a warning, it\u0027s quite often what other moderators would be likely to do, too, not just an individual\u0027s judgment.\n\nAlso, in general:  if a player doesn\u0027t understand the moderator\u0027s reasoning behind a particular warning, the appropriate venue is to private-message the moderator.  If that doesn\u0027t resolve the issue (for example, if the player takes issue with the moderator\u0027s judgment and believes the moderator to be \u0022in the wrong\u0022), then the appropriate venue for that is to private-message the moderator\u0027s supervisor, as laid out in the thread that I linked.\n\nSo if you have a \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Egeneral\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E question of general interest (e.g. \u0022how do moderators make decisions about what action to take?\u0022), this thread is the right place.
