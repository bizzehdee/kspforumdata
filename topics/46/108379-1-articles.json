Need that 123Mb mod hosted somewhere with no ads? I\u0027ll do it for you at no charge.\n\nWhy, you may ask? Because too many times in the past have I been lacking online storage space without a catch. I want to make sure that anyone who has material that benefits the KSP community gets a chance to share their work.\n\nSo if anyone\u0027s interested, drop me a line, and we\u0027ll see what can be arranged depending on the requirements.2\n\n----\n\nPS:\n\n- This isn\u0027t necessarily restricted to mods, but anything KSP-related.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-09T10:47:57Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2015 10:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jarmund**"}]}
