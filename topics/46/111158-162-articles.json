When you post, that number is increased by 1.  Unless you post in The Lounge, then it\u0027s not increased at all.  When a post is hidden (AFAIK they\u0027re never removed, if a mod removes your post, it\u0027s simply hidden) or moved to The Lounge, the system isn\u0027t going to bother scanning the users of the content to adjust their post count.  So if you have a thread that starts in The Lounge and is moved elsewhere, your count wouldn\u0027t increase.\n\nLikely the same process for rep."},{"CreatedByName":"Chel","CreatedById":176173,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-23T23:36:18Z","Content":"Is there a specific time that the Reaction counter resets for the new day, allowing you to react again for the next 24 hours?"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-24T01:30:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, The\\_Cat\\_In\\_Space said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Is there a specific time that the Reaction counter resets for the new day, allowing you to react again for the next 24 hours?\n\u003E \n\nI think it\u0027s whenever your 25th oldest reaction turns 24 hours old."},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-29T03:02:46Z","Content":"Some posts have been removed.
