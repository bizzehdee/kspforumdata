After the success of the Positive Forum Movement, the forum became a peaceful place. BUT I WANT CHAOS! So, just keep these things in your mind and I believe we can make a difference.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. If someone attacks you (or someone else) for your opinion, spelling, design or anything else, insult them using the dirtiest word you\u0027ve ever seen.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. If someone picks at you for something small and insignificant they don\u0027t like you doing, something that\u0027s not even against the rules; just insult them.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. If you feel strongly about something, just give others the feeling that you think your opinion is more important than theirs.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. If you see someone \u0022put out a fire\u0022 by replying well to a provocative comment, just be rude.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Most importantly, no matter how you are treated by someone else, treat them the way you think it\u0027s rude.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn conclusion: just be rude.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWill it work? No doubt about it. Even if a single person does this just one time, it will make a difference.
