State what you would like your name changed to.   The moderators will see if that\u0027s available.  If the name is not already taken by another user, and it meets our Forum Guidelines, it should be approved, and will be changed in short order.\n\nYou are only allowed 1 (one) name change.  It can be hard to keep track of who is who if everybody keeps changing their name.   So think wisely about the change, it won\u0027t be undone.\n\n*------ End Moderator Edit.
