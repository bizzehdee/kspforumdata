I don\u0027t intend to start hostilities so please nobody go yelling at me, its just that the perspective adsii posted here does not feel accurate to what I and others feel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I think adsii is misunderstanding a lot of the community\u0027s anger. There were initial concerns about the rush into a very expensive early access and plenty of people were angry, however, thats not the main source of anger these days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason people are liquided off is that they kept pushing KSP2 as though it had a future, long after the take-two games executives would have known what was to come. It\u0027s one thing to launch an over-priced under-cooked early access title. It\u0027s another thing altogether to continue pushing it, continue trying to get people to buy it when you know that it won\u0027t make it any further than it is now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve worked closely with executives at large companies before. If the Take-Two executive team has any level of competency at all, they have been aware that this was going to happen for a long time now. You don\u0027t shut down this many studios on a whim, particularly not the one studio working on your largest project. Yet there has still been no public statements by Take-Two and they still have the game listed for at full price on Steam.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-06-23T03:53:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nComment moved to its own thread.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-06-24T05:38:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRefer to this:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u002289014\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed6911095689\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/225214-community-discussions-the-original-june-totm-introduction-and-my-original-comment-in-the-op/?do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:197px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
