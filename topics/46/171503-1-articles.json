Is this a re-occurring problem or something that only affected older albums? Does it also affect images posted from Imgur? Should I avoid using Imgur albums to prevent similar problems from occurring in my threads,\u00A0or should I switch to a different photo sharing site? Your insight will be appreciated. Thanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adsii1970","CreatedById":89014,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-28T16:59:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few years back, and to be honest, I cannot remember if it was two or three years ago, Imgur underwent a complete overhaul. Older threads which were no longer maintained by the original poster simply were never updated to reflect the new Imgur album links. If you really want to find the album, you might try searching Imgur\u0027s contents for stuff either relating to KSP (it is a long search), by user name (and hope they used the same user name), or maybe even by the thread name (I name all my albums after whatever it is I am posting). Other than that, I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any real way to see what is missing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was so bad that for nearly six or so months, we could not even link albums to the forum because of the instability of Imgur.
