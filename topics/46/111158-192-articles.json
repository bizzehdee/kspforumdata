[@Snark](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/125662-snark/) sat on the sofa on the other side of the room, telling Gargamel it wasn\u0027t a very smart idea to be merging threads one-handed while sitting on top of a vending machine.\n\n\u0022Oh, quit complaining, Snark!\u0022 Gargamel shouted as he began to merge the threads.\n\nJust before he opened the special moderator box to actually merge the threads, [@Dman979](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/123837-dman979/) walked into the moderator lounge and shoved Gargamel off the top of the vending machine where he was sitting while trying to merge the two threads. Technically, Dman979 was enforcing the rules while [@Vanamonde](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/27914-vanamonde/) was away. Vanamonde has some pretty strict rules about moderating - and the first is never moderate when hungry. So, having  eaten a K-Snack from the vending machine to satisfy his hunger, Gargamel decided that sitting on top of the vending machine while moderating would be a good idea and worth the risk while Vanamonde was away. But that brings us to Rule 35: the tops of vending machines are not to be sat upon (now we all know why).\n\n\u0022I\u0027ve told you a hundred times, Gargamel, quit showing off in front of the new moderators\u0022 Dman 979 shouted. But as Gargamel fell, the threads slipped from his hands, hit the floor with a loud ***splat*** **** and began oozing and coalescing into a giant puddle in the middle of the floor of the moderator lounge.\n\n\u0022What are you all doing?\u0022 was what Vanamonde said as he flung open the moderator lounge door and took his step inside. He had no idea of the unfolding drama waiting on the other side of the door. But before Snark could proceed to tell him to be careful, Vanamonde ended up head down and feet up as he fell into the spilled and unmerged threads, now puddled in the middle of the floor. From that point on, myself, [@goldenpeach](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/34566-goldenpeach/), and [@Starhawk](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/131400-starhawk/) began to try and sneak out the back door of the moderator lounge, not wanting to suffer the wrath of the angry banana.\n\nBut right as goldenpeach started to turn the doorknob, Vanamonde yelled, \u0022where do you three think you\u0027re going? You didn\u0027t stop Gargamel from showing off, so now you get to help clean up this mess\u0022 as he pointed to the mess surrounding him from the poorly managed threads still oozing on the floor.\n\n[@Supernovy](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/29617-supernovy/) had an idea we all thought was sheer brilliance at this point. He went into the closet next to the vending machine where Gargamel had been sitting and pulled out the industrial wet/dry shop vac we keep handy just for forum messes. This could be why he is a lead moderator, but that\u0027s a story for another day. Anyhow, about the time he was plugging in the shop vac, [@St4rdust](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/196576-st4rdust/), one of our community managers, was stopping by to show us her latest forum announcement. She flung open the door with great excitement which hit Supernovy on the backside, knocking him into the liquefied oozing threads and on top of Vanamonde. The two slid across the room, spreading the ooze from the two trashed threads everywhere.\n\nFor those of you who are not moderators, you\u0027ll never understand how dirty and difficult moderation can be. Especially when you\u0027re trying to merge threads and something goes horribly wrong. Yes, a badly merged and damaged thread has the viscosity of 5W30 motor oil. And that\u0027s why Supernovy and Vanamonde slid with great speed across the moderator lounge floor.\n\n***How does this explain how the \u0022likes\u0022 disappeared?*** Well, see, what most do not know is when you hit a like button, there\u0027s a machine in the moderator\u0027s lounge which we must make sure has plenty of supplies. Think of it as a 3D printer but that it pounds out forum likes for your enjoyment. Well, earlier that morning, Snark had filled up the cartridge in a similar manner to how a laser copier\u0027s toner cartridge is filled. So, when Vanamonde and Supernovy slammed into the forum likes contraption, it made a loud banging sound and we all stood - paralyzed in fear - as we heard the sound of grinding gears, a brief whiff of ozone, and a faint trail of white smoke arise out of the machine. And to make matters worse, when Supernovy tried to stand up, completely covered in ooze, he grabbed the cartridge to steady himself on his feet. But when he did that, we all heard the terrible sound of thick, hard plastic snapping. Our likes contraption was now out of commission. \n\nHad it not been for much overtime on behalf of Squad\u0027s maintenance department, who shall remain pingless out of respect, and his patience with the moderation team (we were all too busy pointing fingers at Gargamel and blaming him for it), our likes contraption would probably still be broken. Whatever could not be ordered had to be either 3D printed, and if that failed, super-glued and duct-taped. So folks, show them some love!\n\nAnd in case you were wondering, there were a few of us moderators which had kept a few extra likes in our lockers. That\u0027s why many of you saw us tossing out likes when the rest of you couldn\u0027t. We had our own stockpile of likes handy. But then Vanamonde, sensing the rising frustration on the forum, issued Rule 61: moderators can not keep a secret and hidden stash of likes.  \n\nAnd that\u0027s the truth about why the forum lost likes for a while... ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Deddly","CreatedById":62955,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-15T19:14:02Z","Content":"Truth\n\nNotice how I\u0027m conspicuously missing from this story.
