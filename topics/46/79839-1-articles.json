I paid for it long ago and haven\u0027t used it in a while. However went on there today and once it loads it\u0027s simply black on white Silhouette of the editor and doesn\u0027t respond to selection at all, nor is there any models displayed. Yes, I have the most current version of unity and web player. Wonder if anyone else is having this issue and if there\u0027s a fix or is it just the application itself?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T14:29:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can confirm it\u0027s not working.
