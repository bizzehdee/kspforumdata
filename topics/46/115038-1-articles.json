I can\u0027t cope with this !\n\n...\n\nHello,\n\nCan anyone tell me how to approve comments that were posted on my blog ? I\u0027m sure I\u0027m missing something obvious, but well, I didn\u0027t find.\n\nAs a regular paranoid and (averagely effective) tidy-up maniac, I had the \u0022Moderate comments before displaying\u0022 box checked in my *Permissions \u0026 Privacy* settings.\n\nI noticed today I had a few comments submitted here and there since early June... (my apologies to the people who posted these nice comments.)\n\nSo where\u0027s the \u0022approve comment\u0022 button ? : )\n\nThanks for your forthcoming answer."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T16:15:22Z","Content":"Hi Plume \u0026 Akakak, the option to allow members to moderate their own blog is disabled, sorry, please feel free to notify a moderator when you need comments moderated, or use the report button to notify all moderators currently online ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T16:21:19Z","Content":"I manually approved all the comments I could find there.
