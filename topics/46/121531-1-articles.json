Also, they legitimately actually know have and play(ed) the game, as opposed to being generic hired moderators.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI imagine that for the forums of some games for larger companies that they might just hire people to be moderators, who may or may not have had any actual interaction with the game before they were hired as moderators, so there\u0027s that. Sure, a lot of large companies have good hired community managers, which can help a lot, but if the moderators are chosen haphazardly, and maybe even required to spend a certain amount of time on the forums (i.e it\u0027s their job and they\u0027re not doing it just because they want to), then that could result in moderators simply not giving a care.
