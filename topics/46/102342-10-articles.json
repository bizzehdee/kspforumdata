I think to start I\u0027ll quote a reply I wrote to someone who messaged me about this.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m reading the threads, and honestly I hadn\u0027t anticipated people would take this post as seriously as they did, and in retrospect it would\u0027ve been better to post this closer to April 1st, the references weren\u0027t that strong in the announcement.\n\u003E That said, this isn\u0027t just a joke, I tried communicating a message with the premium accounts that would pay modders, YouTubers, streamers and all those people that invest so much time and skills into this community. We often watch their videos and use their mods without thinking twice, and while they volunteer their time I think that we, as a community, should perhaps realise that those people mean a lot to us, in different ways, and that we should support them. \n\u003E \n\u003E Maybe I\u0027ll post this later in those threads as well, but my hope is that some people will take that away from all this, and hopefully realise that Squad would never, ever do something as ridiculous as was announced in that post.\n\nAfter the first reactions came I realised that people actually thought it\u0027d be possible that a company in the games industry would in fact do something along these lines, and that\u0027s a sad realisation. However, I understand that when the April 1st reference isn\u0027t immediately clear then of course this announcement becomes a ridiculous proposition. I do hope that most people realised that Squad would never do this sort of a thing, and that we support our community, and like I said in the private message I hope we can all look back at this, and realise that perhaps we can hit that donate button for our favorite mod or YouTube channel ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nIn light of the easy confusion I\u0027ve added a small print to the announcement post and removed it from the articles. \n\nP.S.\n\nWe do plan to update the forums in the future, as we discussed in the devnotes a while ago. That\u0027s still very much a thing but of course we\u0027d be looking to improve the community, rather than to destroy it.\n\nP.P.S.\n\nvent all you wish ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-20T23:26:54Z\u0022 title=\u002203/20/2015 11:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KasperVld**"},{"CreatedByName":"AbhChallenger","CreatedById":106911,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T23:24:44Z","Content":"This was a very VERY poorly planned Joke. ![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Yakuzi","CreatedById":85181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T23:26:14Z","Content":"AAAaaaaaaha!
