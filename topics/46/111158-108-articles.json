Troll posts something obnoxious, somebody responds to it, troll hides own content, other people see an apparently nonsensical situation, hilarity ensues.\n\n(Sure, it\u0027s possible for a troll to *\u003Cu\u003Eedit\u003C/u\u003E* their stuff after the fact, but at least they\u0027ve got a *\u003Cu\u003Epost\u003C/u\u003E* there, and everyone knows that editing is a thing, so the potential for mischief is considerably lower.)\n\nBasically, it boils down to \u0022allowing people to say things publicly that they know they can completely erase does not tend to encourage good behavior.\u0022  Yes, the 99% use case is that it\u0027s decent, law-abiding users who have perfectly legitimate reasons for wanting to hide their stuff, and we\u0027re sorry.  We know it can be occasionally irritating.  But this is one of those cases where it just takes a few bad apples to spoil the cart.\n\nThe usual way to \u0022delete one\u0027s own content\u0022 is to just report your own post and say \u0022delete please\u0022.  We pretty much always honor such requests.  (And if you\u0027ve said something that you *\u003Cu\u003Eurgently\u003C/u\u003E* need to make-it-didn\u0027t-happen and don\u0027t want to wait for a moderator to actually remove it, you can just edit your post down to a \u0022nvm\u0022 while you wait.

It\u0027s not any special kind of moderator power, anyone can do it-- it\u0027s a standard login option.  It makes it so that the forum doesn\u0027t track your \u0022last logged on\u0022 date.\n\nIt all boils down to this:  Do you regard the fact that people can see when you\u0027re logging on as a *\u003Cu\u003Epositive\u003C/u\u003E* (i.e. better engagement, the social-media thing) or a *\u003Cu\u003Enegative\u003C/u\u003E* (i.e. \u0022it\u0027s nobody\u0027s business but mine when I\u0027m logged on\u0022-- the privacy thing).\n\nAnybody can choose for themselves which they prefer.  As for me, I prefer the privacy.\n\nOf course, every time I post something, you can see *\u003Cu\u003Ewhen\u003C/u\u003E* I posted it, which obviously means I had to be logged on at that time.  Since that\u0027s publicly visible for all the world to see, it seems kinda silly that the forum software doesn\u0027t go ahead and update the \u0022last logged in\u0022 timestamp every time one makes a public post, but hey, *\u003Cu\u003EI\u003C/u\u003E* didn\u0027t write that code.  ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-26T04:04:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, theonegalen said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Is [@Snark](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/125662-snark/) a boojum?\n\u003E \n\nIf you find yourself [softly and suddenly vanishing away](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Hunting_of_the_Snark#Fit_8), then you\u0027ll know.  ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)\n\n(Or else you could just look at my forum title, which has been sitting there in plain view for well over a year...)"},{"CreatedByName":"theonegalen","CreatedById":71012,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-26T04:06:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 minutes ago, Snark said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If you find yourself [softly and suddenly vanishing away](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Hunting_of_the_Snark#Fit_8), then you\u0027ll know.  ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E (Or else you could just look at my forum title, which has been sitting there in plain view for well over a year...)\n\u003E \n\nAh, I\u0027m on mobile, so all I see is \u0022Moderator\u0022."},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-27T18:34:28Z","Content":"If I always have a tab open with the forum but am not always using it, does it still show me as being online?"}]}
