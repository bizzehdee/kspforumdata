No matter what you do, it won\u0027t work.\n\nExactly this. I have moderated in other places and the two modes sort of bleed into each other. You become more aware of what your personal posts sound like, but it becomes far easier to insert ~mod stuff~ into opinion posts and opinions into things that should be impartial. Adding fonts or colors makes you lazier about which is which, and makes you stand apart as part of ~scary ban-hammer people~ instead of another member of the community that also supervises."},{"CreatedByName":"Megan","CreatedById":145770,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T08:06:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This is a primary reason why I avoid personally commenting in contentious threads...\n\u003E I\u0027m not sure if that really answers it for you.\n\nBut that\u0027s a sad thing.

I am sure there are plenty examples of where moderator thoughts are questioned as official stance. I don\u0027t know if there is a way around this, but we do discuss this sort of thing from time to time. Also, please don\u0027t interpret my statement about font color to mean we have some sort of official stance against it. A couple moderators do use different color text (or have used) and some of us try to preface posts with \u0022my personal thoughts.\u0022 Also, some of us share via PM or within side channels on IRC when asked.\n\nIronically, part of what makes a user appealing as a potential moderator is how they interact within the community.
