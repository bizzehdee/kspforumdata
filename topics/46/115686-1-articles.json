At the moment we\u0027re dedicated to support the Twitch streamers that (as Cantab pointed out) put in a lot of time and effort into showcasing the game. There are many interesting streams out there, for example Das Valdez is currently streaming live from the USS Intrepid aircraft carrier, talking to all kinds of people from the museum there to astronauts. The Twitch Thursdays may not be the most popular edition of the Daily Kerbal, but that\u0027s okay. There\u0027s good quality content out there for the people who are willing to give it a go. I have thought about introducing a \u0022Spaceflight Saturday\u0022 in the past, to talk about current events in space exploration, but currently I don\u0027t have the time in the day to write an article every week.\n\n**Whether you supported this suggestion or not, thanks for participating.**\n\n**-x- OLD POST BELOW -x-**\n\nI\u0027ve been looking at the amount of views and replies of the Twitch Thursdays on The Daily Kerbal, and from what I\u0027ve seen it gets the smallest amount of views and replies on the section, compared to the others. It\u0027s the only section that didn\u0027t reach more than 1k views on the first page (11th June 2015). Have a table comparing the first page\u0027s Daily Kerbal news:\n\n![lPjJj8p.png](http://i.imgur.com/lPjJj8p.png)\n\n*(Feel free to check if the table\u0027s accurate, I might have committed typos. Also, stuff might have changed since I made this table.)*\n\nOn a Video Wednesday topic, I\u0027ve read this:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E If anyone is looking for a good KSP series idea, simply start reviewing and showcasing popular craft published by users on kerbalx.com. Call it \u0022This Week on Spacecraft Exchange\u0022 or something.\n\nNow, from what I\u0027ve seen, the Twitch Thursday is the one that gets less views, not Video Wednesdays, so why not adapt it, maybe even review crafts from the Spacecraft Exchange instead of KerbalX (because it\u0027s unofficial and stuff; this doesn\u0027t mean I don\u0027t support that site)\n\nMy suggestion is, run an experiment replacing the \u0022Twitch Thursday\u0022 with the \u0022Spacecraft Thursday\u0022 for one or two weeks, compare the results with the Twitch Thursdays\u0027s views and decide whether to keep it or not.\n\nI\u0027d like to receive some public feedback on this. Feel free to reply.\n\n23th July Update: SQUAD does not seem to care about this. Twitch Thursdays are still roaming the Daily Kerbal\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-17T21:21:15Z\u0022 title=\u002208/17/2015 09:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by windows\\_x\\_seven**"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T02:47:10Z","Content":"I\u0027d love a Spacecraft Thursday."},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T02:54:13Z","Content":"This I might pay attention to.

Every time something like this is started (Sal\\_vager\u0027s craft of the month, KSP starter pack, spacecraft exchange video series, etc.) people have only been unhappy with who is chosen, and how they have their craft presented. I think I would be just as unhappy as anyone else if my craft wasn\u0027t picked, after all, I have all spent hours on my crafts, and I would feel like mine should be chosen.\n\nThe other problem is this: Majorjim, Rune, Zucal, and a few others I\u0027m too lazy to mention build the absolute BEST craft on the forums, and they make the most of them, too. I\u0027m afraid that only they would be chosen (and people would be unhappy because of it), not because they don\u0027t deserve a showcase, but because they DO!\n\nAnyway, that\u0027s just my USD $0.02."},{"CreatedByName":"windows_x_seven","CreatedById":112926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T22:33:16Z","Content":"Challenge Thursday, maybe?\n\nThe problem you stated also can happen in the current Daily Kerbal, in the Modding Mondays, Fan Art Fridays and Video Wednesdays people can get pissed because of not being chosen. \n\nScott Manley isn\u0027t always featured in Video Wednesdays, and Nassault isn\u0027t always featured in Fan Art Fridays, for example.
