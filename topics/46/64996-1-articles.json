Albums have to be manually assigned and deliberately inserted into posts. You should be able to use pictures uploaded to Steam easily enough, just make sure you get the direct link to the picture (It usually ends with a filename and an image extension like \u003Cstrong\u003E.png\u003C/strong\u003E or \u003Cstrong\u003E.jpg\u003C/strong\u003E or something like that) and not the link to the page that shows the picture. Clicking on the picture will sometimes take you directly to the image itself (use that link), or you can right-click on the picture and choose \u0022Copy image URL\u0022 to grab the direct link to the image. Just hit Ctrl\u002BV (or right-click and select Paste) to insert the link to the image. Be sure to wrap it in \u003Cstrong\u003E[noparse]\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022%7Boption%7D\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022%7Boption%7D\u0022\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E[/noparse]\u003C/strong\u003E tags to make it show the image instead of a link to it, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft files are essentially big blocks of text, so any regular file host will do, or you can open them in a text editor and upload the contents to a site like \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.pastebin.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.pastebin.com/\u003C/a\u003E (there are hundreds like it, use whatever works for you)/\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerpenWolf","CreatedById":83222,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-06T23:01:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the Info!!!
