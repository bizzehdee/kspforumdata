Some threads are still relevant, so reviving them doesn\u0027t harm anything. But in a periodically updated game like this in which new versions can render the contents of old threads misleading, it\u0027s better to close the thread so that players are not being confused by and acting upon old information. In other words, it\u0027s a judgement call and not something automation can take care of for us. But don\u0027t feel bad about it if it happens to you, because it\u0027s not intended to be a punishment. It\u0027s just a matter of keeping the forum moving along effectively.
