Certain cliques could end up running the show here, and that\u0027s not what we\u0027re after.   Our entire [forum ethos](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/100734-the-positive-forum-movement-updated-4-december-2015/\u0026page=1), and it\u0027s [rules](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/guidelines/), can be simplified down to \u0022Just be nice to each other\u0022.
