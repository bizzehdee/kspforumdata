I would often rep posts I disagreed with if they were well-reasoned and argued, and I\u0027d say as much in the comment. Now if I like a post it is strongly implied that I agree with what it says, and worse, that perceived agreement is public so everyone who reads it thinks I agree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really miss rep comments, probably more than any other feature of vB.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-21T22:32:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the ease of giving it has also made it a bit less of a marker of how well known/liked you are.
