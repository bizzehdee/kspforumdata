I felt like there was no good in the world. However, I was acquainted with Kerbal Space Program (possibly my favourite game ever). As a result, I was soon exposed to the forums as well, to see if it is worth it to stay here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I saw is the most helpful, kind, respectful, intelligent and loving community, possibly on the whole internet. People helping each other out with questions (something that, let me tell you, does NOT happen in stackoverflow) and being generally kind with each other.
