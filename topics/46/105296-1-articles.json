Looks like a de-leval nozzle.\n\nUnfortunately, you can\u0027t just download the demo, you have to send an e-mail first, which complicates things somewhat.\n\nI especially like that the site now includes a little blurb about Kerbal\u0027s history. They should have a picture of the Kerbo-Log and a brief description of it, as well.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-27T20:44:05Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2015 08:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun**"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T20:50:57Z","Content":"The new website is a bit flashier and graphics-heavy compared to what I prefer, but it\u0027s not bad.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Also the Mods button links you to Curse instead of [Kerbalstuff.com](https://kerbalstuff.com) , so that\u0027s a bit weird.\n\nThis makes perfect sense, since Curse / CurseForge is the official KSP add-on repository, while KS is an unofficial alternative run privately."},{"CreatedByName":"BagelRabbit","CreatedById":95028,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T20:55:54Z","Content":"A brief letter to SQUAD about the website:\n\nDear SQUAD,\n\nIf you scroll down to the bottom of the KSP website, there\u0027s a picture of a rather nasty-looking (sorry) rocket made in some older version of the game; it even has the red launch tower behind it. Also, there\u0027s clouds in the \u0027atmosphere\u0027 above it. Clearly, this isn\u0027t the version of KSP that we know and love.\n\nI\u0027d love to see Kerbal Space Program properly represented on the Kerbal Space Program website, which means a rocket made in a version of the game less than a year and a half old. Also, no clouds.\n\nWould you mind at least considering these changes? Other than that, I love the new website and am looking forward to playing KSP 1.0.\n\n(By the way, sorry if this has already been mentioned. I just got back from college and haven\u0027t had time to read the entirety of this thread yet.)\n\nSincerely,\n\nUpsilon"},{"CreatedByName":"WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;","CreatedById":78047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T23:55:04Z","Content":"It\u0027s new ; ) wich mean it\u0027s not old ; ) wich also mean it\u0027s different to what we were used too ; ) I feel like it won\u0027t be too hard for me to get used to this one ; )"}]}
