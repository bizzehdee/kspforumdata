I couldn\u0027t tell where it should have been posted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyhow, my idea is a general tidy up of the MOD RELEASES area, to avoid confusion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA sub area should be created for old OLD addons, and the main area should be exclusively for 1.1.3 mods. Hunting down mods for that version is getting harder and harder due to all the clutter, and some posts don;t even have version numbers in the title, and hey, I hate see posts about a mod for version 0.23 every now and then because some cannot figure out when DEAD is DEAD!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would actually make using that area much more easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen 1.1.4 is released, then the 1.1.3 area becomes a sub area and 1.1.4 is the new main area.
