It doesn\u0027t need to be HarvesteR but there needs to be an official response at some level.

Take the resources for example: Squad has confirmed that resources will be coming to the game, and they may have an idea about the outlines of the feature, which parts will it use, and perhaps the devs really like the way some mods implement scanning (purely an example), but all this does not mean they know exactly how stock ISRU will turn out. Work on these kinds of features has often not begun yet and so giving any in-depth commentary can only backfire in the future, so the only thing they can really say at this moment is \u0022it\u0027s planned\u0022 or \u0022it\u0027s a cool idea\u0022, which are both not very satisfying or useful answers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour request for a \u0022yes/no/maybe\u0022 type of answer even ties into this.

A thousand threads a day wouldn\u0027t change what the dev\u0027s have planned for KSP, and likewise they wouldn\u0027t notice if we never posted on there again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee, the problem is that the suggestions board is an artefact from the days back when suggestions could actually be put into the game. \u003Cem\u003ECan anyone list a suggestion \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ein the last two years\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cem\u003E that has been implemented?\u003C/em\u003E As in: Squad read about a \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Esuggestion\u003C/span\u003E, said \u003Cem\u003E\u0022hey, we never thought of that, great idea!\u0022\u003C/em\u003E and implemented it? I can\u0027t think of a single one. And with the game declared \u003Cem\u003Escope complete\u003C/em\u003E, there isn\u0027t anything more to add to the game except for parts/content and whatever little features HarvesteR has been mulling over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, I predict that the suggestions subforum will eventually devolve into a ridiculously large list of parts requests for people to flame each other endlessly over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, again, why are we debating over suggestions to put to the devs when the devs have neither the time, budget, nor inclination (understandably) to engage its community?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we sit right now, all we do is continue to cling to the illusion that our own participation in the suggestion subforums has some meaning or relevance. Let\u0027s acknowledge its pointlessness and repurpose it for more constructive activities towards a game that we all love and feel passionate enough about to take the time to participate in its community. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T07:24:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ejust here to support the release of an official roadmap. 2 months ago or so, when we were super dissapointed with the lacking dev notes, rowsdower said he would look into that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny progress?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
