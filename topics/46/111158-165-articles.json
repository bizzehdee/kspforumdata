When this occurs, the lower-level mod will have a list of \u0022Mods that integrate with this mod\u0022 with links, which are inevitably links to other forum posts.  Unfortunately, most of these links seem to be broken, yet the mod forums do exist, but I need to do a search to find each one rather than use the handy (broken) link.  This is inconvenient, but obviously workable because it at least tells me what mods to look for, but as a new player this is also confusing to me and makes it difficult for me to track down all the information.\n\nMy first question:  why does this happen?  Maybe I am doing something wrong.  Maybe the page is simply not updated.  Maybe the website changed the way it references threads.  I know this game has been around for some years, so as time goes by, stuff changes, and some of these forum posts are crazy long.

One of these was the infamous April 2013 incident where a significant number of threads and posts were actually lost during the upgrade, while the more recent one involved changes to how thread URLs are formatted.\n\nAt the end of the day, mod authors are ordinary people with real life obligations and commitments, and while they may have time to update their mods, they might have accidentally overlooked the fact that their links in their \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.

[@Tolnorus](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/193400-tolnorus/), I suggest you may have some luck with the \u0022search the forum\u0022 feature (click on the little magnifying-glass icon at top right).  If you\u0027re looking for the thread of a particular mod, I\u0027d suggest doing the following:\n\n1. Go to the [Add-on Releases subforum](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/forum/34-add-on-releases/).  (That\u0027s where all mod threads are located.)\n2. See the \u0022Search\u0022 box at top right?  Click in the text-entry part of the box.  This causes a \u0022search\u0022 menu to pop up.\n3. In that menu\u0027s \u0022SEARCH IN\u0022 section, choose \u0022This Forum\u0022.  This restricts your search to just Add-on Releases so you don\u0027t have to wade through unrelated stuff in other areas.\n4. In that menu\u0027s \u0022FIND RESULTS IN...\u0022 section, choose \u0022Titles Only\u0022.  Not only does this greatly speed up the search, but it also really helps filter the search results, because you\u0027ll only find threads *\u003Cu\u003Eabout\u003C/u\u003E* the mod (e.g. its main release thread) rather than threads that merely *\u003Cu\u003Emention\u003C/u\u003E* the mod.\n5. Type the name of the mod in the search box and execute the search.\n\nIn my experience, that generally does a pretty good job of finding errant mod threads.  Sometimes you\u0027ll need to do some figuring out *\u003Cu\u003Ewhich\u003C/u\u003E* of its threads is the current one-- sometimes they go through multiple threads when a mod gets handed off from one maintainer to another.  But in general, I\u0027ve found that this is a fairly efficient bit of spadework and can usually track down what you\u0027re looking for fairly quickly.\n\n(Unless you\u0027re looking for a mod that\u0027s *\u003Cu\u003Eso universally\u003C/u\u003E* used by other mods, *\u003Cu\u003Eand mentioned in their thread titles\u003C/u\u003E*, that it becomes practically impossible to find the needle in the haystack.
