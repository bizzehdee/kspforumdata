In fact, there\u0027s a whole little moderators-only subforum where we store these things. They are not deleted because we want to keep a record of our member\u0027s conduct for future reference: merely moved to this internal storage. That being said, neither is it a common thing for us to do, and we don\u0027t do it for whimsical reasons. It\u0027s a last-resort-kind-of-a-situation for threads which are so full of offensive material or built around such a problematic subject that there\u0027s no salvaging it. (Replies to a removed topic would be, of course, senseless.) \n\nHiding a post from public view, or even deleting it (which we only do with spambots anyway) does NOT change the forum members\u0027 post count or like count. You keep those no matter what happens to the posts themselves. \n\nIt would be nice if we could inform each person who posted in the thread when we do this, but there are several reasons that we don\u0027t. For one thing, as soon as we point out that something was removed, what happens is exactly what you\u0027re seeing here. Human nature being what it is, everybody wants to ask what was removed, which goes nowhere because it\u0027s something we can\u0027t discuss openly or it wouldn\u0027t have needed removal in the first place. If we didn\u0027t want to do it publicly we could send PMs, but that\u0027s simply a lot of PMs to post and dispatch. And last but not least, we do not advertise that something was removed because we do not want to encourage mass-shaming of the forum member who posted the troublesome content. You can see in this thread that there\u0027s already been some speculation about and attributing of motivations to the person in question, when in fact all any of us actually knows is that the content was posted. Does it really matter why? Moderation has always been a confidential thing, and we won\u0027t discuss the actions we do or do not take toward another person any more than you would want us telling others what we said and did to you. \n\nAs for Red Iron Crown, real life demands and other interests have recently drawn several people away from the moderation team.
