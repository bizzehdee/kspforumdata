All well and good, right? Well, not so much. You see, naturally this leads to it getting extremely competitive, and people don\u0027t like to lose and so forth. You inevitably end up with situations where just about everyone is breaking the rules of the game in order to win, and/or taking the game from that thread and allowing it to encroach upon other parts of the forum. Things like deliberately spamming others\u0027 threads in the Spacecraft Exchange in attempts to discredit them or make them look bad, etc., all for the sake of the game; some people could even go so far as to starting semi-separate wars and fights over PMs, which literally \u003Cstrong\u003Ecannot\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0be moderated directly unless one of the participants deliberately brings a moderator in, and even then the moderators could only be getting part of the story.\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:22.4px;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:22.4px;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:22.4px;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;float:none;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003ENow, naturally, moderating such a thing is a hellish nightmare (N.B.: I was not a mod way back then) since each thread tends to have its own rules, which first of all nobody\u0027s really following too closely, and second of all are very poorly worded and leave a large amount of loopholes. The forum rules are all well and good, but inevitably at some point the users and players of the game start to get it in their heads that since they made the game, they get to dictate the rules within that thread and that the moderators should stay out of it. I\u0027m not 100% sure if this exactly happened here, but I\u0027ve seen it happen in other places often enough to say that it\u0027s fairly likely it did. So simply keeping everyone to the usual rules of decency and civility is practically impossible unless we want to be handing out infractions and bans every other day.\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:22.4px;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:22.4px;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:22.4px;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;float:none;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003EOne of the major reasons this tends to spiral out of control is that people start to identify too closely with their characters within the roleplay and forget to clearly draw a line between the game and the rest of the usual forum interaction. It \u003Cstrong\u003Eall\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0becomes part of the game, to them. If it was only one or two people doing it, it\u0027d just be a matter of reminding them every now and again to keep it within the confines of the thread and the game, but... it tends to be the case that when one person does it, everyone just sort of picks it up and runs with it until serious infractions start getting handed out.\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:22.4px;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:22.4px;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:22.4px;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;float:none;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003EPeople don\u0027t draw the boundaries well enough, and it has long since been decided that if roleplay is to happen, it should not happen on these forums at all. At least if the roleplaying is on a totally different website, people will be better able to draw the correct boundaries between roleplaying and correct forum etiquette and interactions with other people. All it takes is one single person to overstep the boundaries of the thread and then suddenly either everyone thinks it\u0027s okay, or simply does not want to be left behind in the game by \u003Cstrong\u003Enot\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0following suit... and then \u003Cstrong\u003Eeveryone\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0is doing it.
