I would have thought that after the release of 1.0 and subsequent popularity spike, SQUAD would have arranged more grand official competitions. Instead, it seems as if they\u0027re creating fewer and fewer. Maybe that\u0027s why I\u0027m doing things like the Oscar-B\u0027s and [my attempts to organize a Kerbal-Kon](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/126651-Kerbal-Kon-2015-Can-We-Make-It-Happen): as a desperate attempt to keep the Hype^tm^ up.
