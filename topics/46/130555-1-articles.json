Additionally, I tried to type in the editor and again, nothing happened. I even tried to insert an\u00A0image into the editor and once again, nothing happened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this point, I am at a loss of ideas. The only idea I have is that since\u00A0I made this signature before the 2015 forum migration, it might be a bug with the new forums. So, could anyone tell me what is going on here? Is this a bug in the forums, or am I just missing something? If it is a bug, then is there a way for a moderator to remove the content from my signature so that I could edit it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RA3236","CreatedById":150734,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-23T21:18:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you tried writing something below it, Ctl A and Delete?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: or just Crl A?
