Console, PS4, etc). It depends on someone noticing that detail in the first place. Up until recently, it was assumed that every question or issue was for PC. Changing the size or shape or the color (tagging or badges or sounds and flashing lights, actually that lost one might work) of whatever will tell people who are reading the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221. Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it. 2. Overpowered. A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E which platform the issue is related to won\u0027t do much to break that habit. Not quickly, at least. Which is why I suggested a separate forum for console. It\u0027s like when people drive to work and don\u0027t remember the trip. Or installing a door and the knob is on the opposite side as the light switch (personal experience) so it\u0027s behind the door when it\u0027s opened. Ya STILL reach for a light switch on the wrong side of the door that\u0027s not there!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy contrast a separate forum would be like having to go through a completely different door to answer questions of different platforms. It\u0027s conscious action as opposed to autopilot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-22T04:20:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027m saying, guys, is that no matter how useful this might be, I do not know of a way to do it.
