Just now I tried searching for something, and instead of using the function 3 or 4 times to get the result, I had to attempt it at least 10 or 12 times due to the cooldown. Specifically, I searched for oneweb, then clicked the \u0022in content titles only\u0022 link (this counts as another search), only to realize I should search for one web (space included), again titles only link. I still got too many results so I tried \u0022one web\u0022, and this is where I started hitting the cooldown. You get my point. The number of legitimate searches can quickly add up, even for a genuine search of one concept.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know why the mechanism is there, it\u0027s just that the cooldown starts way too soon. Give us 15 or so unimpeded searches before cooldowns start. That should give us enough attempts, presumably without bogging down the system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPretty please?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-28T21:53:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid you get an error message?
