Not meaning to start a war of words, but each one is so different it would literally be like comparing oranges, apples, blackberries, etc. I\u0027d go with wider genres (Science Fantasy, Science Fiction) as your focal point. \n\n\u003Cu\u003ENow for my personal opinion and to answer your question:\u003C/u\u003E \n\nAs fun as Star Wars is - it is science fantasy. I prefer science fiction by far. And the more nerdy the science fiction is, the more I enjoy it. I want to see a discussion of known science fact followed by futuristic speculation. Some of the older science fiction, such as the old sci-fi movies and serials of the 1950s and 1960s did just that. While there have been a lot of good newer releases, such as *The Martian,* I believe the science behind the movie *2001: A Space Odyssey* will remain a science fiction classic for a while longer yet."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-17T00:36:05Z","Content":"Please wait for that thread before posting in it. ![:/](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon1.png \u0022:/\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Spacetraindriver","CreatedById":149403,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-17T04:03:39Z","Content":"Has any flame wars ever erupted or do you guys close the thread at the slightest threat of (the forum version) total nuclear war?
