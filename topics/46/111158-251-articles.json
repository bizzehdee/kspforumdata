Are you saying that you have a bookmark that used to work, and now when you get there it says \u0022no such thread\u0022?  Or are you just typing stuff in the search box and not finding it?\n\nIf it\u0027s the latter, that doesn\u0027t necessarily mean that the thread is \u0022missing\u0022-- it could just be that you don\u0027t have the keywords quite right.  Also, my observation has been that the forum\u0027s \u0022search\u0022 function isn\u0027t super robust and it can often be difficult to find what one is looking for.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 19 hours ago, Admiral Fluffy said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Probably got deleted.\n\u003E \n\nThis seems pretty unlikely to me.  Note that the *\u003Cu\u003Eauthor\u003C/u\u003E* of a thread doesn\u0027t have the ability to delete it.  The only people who can remove threads are *\u003Cu\u003Emoderators\u003C/u\u003E*, and we rarely do that, and basically never to mod threads (generally this only happens to spammer threads, or really toxic threads that were on forbidden topics from the get-go, that sort of thing).\n\nThere have been a (very) few cases where some modder got unhappy for whatever reason and left the forum, and chose to make their threads difficult to locate afterwards (e.g. editing the subject and \u003Cabbr title=\u00221. Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it. 2. Overpowered. A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u00221.
