As commented back when the 0.24 release was still a few days away the 502 errors are caused by the forum\u0027s server being overloaded with work. It cannot handle the amount of traffic the forums are generating and the huge database that it maintains of all your lovely contributions. There are a few solutions to this problem: you can upgrade the server, separate the front-end and database into two different servers, change forum software and so on. Squad is currently looking into different options, but most likely is that the current server will be upgraded. Rest assured that they are aware of the problem and that it\u0027s being worked on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NASAFanboy","CreatedById":57300,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-25T18:17:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHopefully, it wouldn\u0027t cause the April 2013 incident.

The 502 errors just indicate that the server has no time for your request and not that it\u0027s losing data.
