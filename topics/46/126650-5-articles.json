First off, SQUAD has been talking about this migration for a while now. They decided on a platform a while ago. I remember seeing hints of a new forum in 2014.\u00A0The car here does in fact have seats (User accounts), tires (Connections to the Web), a wind shield and roof (Security, unlike vBulletin), lights (search tools, which I think are far better now), an engine (the server isn\u0027t a steaming puddle)\u00A0and it even has some new things like automatic transmission (auto-parsed post and video links), a log of gas mileage (ability to easily see who repped a post), customizable heads-up display\u00A0(custom subscription feeds), Bluetooth connectivity (A mobile site that actually works), and a digital speedometer (high-resolution avatars). The only issue is that you need to redo your auto insurance (subscription feed.) Just because you don\u0027t happen to like the color? Here\u0027s the thing. They\u0027re still installing everything, including various add-ons.\u00A0To keep going with the car metaphor, they\u0027ll probably be\u00A0putting in a new stereo (sketchfab embeds) and a dashboard GPS (Themes or some such.

I understand the old software may have had security issues and outdated functionality, but aesthetically it was a HECK of a lot better than the new one... I also realise there are just as many people who actully LIKE the new look, if not more, than the those who want the old back...

What would Squad say then, if the tables were changed on them overnite?... How would it feel for those of you who LIKE the basic, Kerbally, cartoony look?...
