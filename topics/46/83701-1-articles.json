Everything that gets posted on there gets pushed into the daily kerbal section sometime after. I haven\u0027t heard many major complaints over its format, so I\u0027m not really inclined to make changes there now, but I will definitely note this. OP, as Chris suggests, your best bet may be to catch the notes when they are posted here in the forum or over on /r/kerbalspaceprogram. The format is much less intensive and hopefully, if your system isn\u0027t giving you any major headaches, you should be able to read through the notes with little effort.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EdFred","CreatedById":108599,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-05T12:06:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing that might be an issue: It\u0027s not the monitor(s), it\u0027s not the website, it\u0027s not resolution, it\u0027s your eyes.
