The same goes for any other retailer who may offer KSP.\n\nSteam are extremely quick with updates."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T19:13:34Z","Content":"Not sure about you but I have a lot of GoG games (GoG 4 lyfe!) and their updates have always been a bit patchy (heh), with some patches appearing in a day, others after a few days.\n\nGotta be a little patient that\u0027s all ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAlso, moving to Kerbal Network!"}]}
