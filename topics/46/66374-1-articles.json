Most days, it ends up being around 4:49pm ADST and lasts for approximately three to six minutes. I don\u0027t recall what the official thing on it is, it\u0027s something to do with the web host that Squad\u0027s got their servers on. It is, as Kasuha says, most likely just a daily maintenance thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"6.forty","CreatedById":97939,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-21T07:07:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI must have a terrible sense of time.
