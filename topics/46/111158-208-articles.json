So anything KSP and non KSP related were are jumbled together.  Since most of the KSP related ones from back then are woefully outdated, there is no reason to keep them going.   And due to migrating the forum to new software a couple different times, the formatting on most of them are messed up.  Also the forum rules have evolved since then, and there\u0027s some content from way back that wouldn\u0027t be allowed today, which is part of the reason we have those rules.\n\nIf there\u0027s a topic worth reopening for discussion, then start a new thread on the topic, and link the old thread.   But let\u0027s not go digging up old threads just for the sake of it, if it\u0027s a pertinent addition to the thread, or you have a topic of conversation that an old thread has relevant arguments to, then by all means, start a new one and link the old locked thread. \n\nIf you think there might be an issue with an old thread you\u0027d like to link, just report it, and explain what you want to do with it, and we\u0027ll get back to you on it."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-03T04:50:10Z","Content":"If they\u0027re locked, no new posts would bump them to the top so over time they will be left behind by newer and more active threads."},{"CreatedByName":"cart324","CreatedById":206592,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-16T12:06:53Z","Content":"Hello I would like to hold various competitions named KCP in this forum using BDAmory.
