Interestingly they all seem to relate to the terrain system, which I have discussed a lot with Sarbian. In my own game I sometimes see distortions in the terrain (see picture below) after moving to 0.23 and the log that you quoted contains exceptions all related to terrain vertices and \u0022PQS\u0022 which I do not understand, but believe is related to the celestial body / terrain system. In my own game I sometimes see a log saying \u0022PQS Duna: Restarted\u0022, at which point the terrain visual distortion disappears. Finally on your report that a part of your craft magically exploded - I once had a similar thing happen in testing - one of my engines exploded when I was 1000m AGL. When I checked the flight report (f3) it said that the engine had impacted the ground, which sounds a bit like the terrain had momentarily rush up to mee the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I have my suspicions that there is something wacky going on with the terrain system.

It was at night so I\u0027m not sure but I think I could make out mountains in the distance but there was no KSC buildings or land there, the flag had dropped to sea level.

When it was nearly out of fuel, the Kraken blew it up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went back to the VAB for another lander, put it in a 71KM orbit to try the landing again.

One really large crack ran from the touchdown point beneath the VAB and could be seen from several thousand meters up.

Worked just fine again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime to finish it off (there were no Kerbals on this flight, it has an RGU under the three man pod).
