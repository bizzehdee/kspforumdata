Steering, rotation and suspension can be taken care of with other parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen it done with robotics parts (Sasquatch has a few videos on YouTube, and there were others I can no longer find due to their age), though they of course handled oddly due to using makeshift parts, floppy suspensions made out of hinges, too much or too little grip, and infinite torque causing them to twist and break.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the pneumatic properties, something akin to the balloon landing systems (such as Chickenkeeper\u0027s) might do, as they have the ability to compress and rebound.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"coolitic","CreatedById":79738,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-10T20:52:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust stack some SAS models (preferably pretected by something) and keep rolling to have some make-shift wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Serratus","CreatedById":12069,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-10T20:59:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat would be a good idea it the physics system wasn\u0027t crumbling already. Adding even more more collision and physics calculations before serious optimisation would break planetside exploration for many ppl. Including me for that matter.
