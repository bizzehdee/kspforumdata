We\u2019ll be uploading the competition to YouTube later this year.

You may not clip engines, and there is to be NO craft file editing; the exception to engine clipping is\u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12pt;\u0022\u003Eif your fighter is heavily detailed. In that case,\u00A0you will be allowed to clip engines in,\u00A0but the craft may not go over 800m/s as a result of the extra engines\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Craft are to be loaded out before submission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. For our\u00A0sake please keep the part count per craft\u00A0below 200, we\u2019re trying to avoid having crappy frame rates for the sake of recording.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6.

These\u00A0should actually be fighter aircraft, whether they\u0027re a replica, concept aircraft, or original design. Aircraft which do not look like they could be a proper fighter will be ruled out. This is solely because it\u0027s unfair if a low-quality aesthetics aircraft that is absurdly performance based goes against a high-quality aesthetics one. Only the highest quality designs with a lot of effort put into the aesthetics of it will be accepted, nothing more, no less. After all, this competition is to showcase the\u00A0hard work and talent that\u00A0stock builders put into their craft to make them as beautiful and as high-performing\u00A0as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-04-07T16:54:42Z\u0022 title=\u002204/07/2019 04:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EApril 7, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by moonsparkejo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EUpdate on Engine rules\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzerknoef","CreatedById":90599,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-07T14:36:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEngine clipping would go a long way for making realistic craft actually viable...
