Between the fusion reactors and the thermal hybrid turbojets you can go prety much anywhere. Even after an ISP cap that was implemented with the most recent version those things in rocket mode have better ISP than anything in stock asside from an ion. They also work in airbreathing mode in any atmosphere as they are just sucking in atmosphere and heating it up for reaction mass instead of needing the O2 like stock turbojets. could probably make one that could do a couple landing/orbit trips on any body before needing to refuel depending on your payload to fuel ratio.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Voyager55","CreatedById":70945,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-01T01:44:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you guys for all the input, and great ship design SkyRender, don\u0027t mind me using it?
