When I was doing the experiment, with a TWR that is very low, like 1.5, you actually burn for a very long time. If you go straight horizontal for, say, 10 seconds, you can maintain altitude. However if you keep in that direction, you\u0027re altitude rises significantly over the course of the burn, so I had to go from pointing at 40 degrees to 5 (eventually 0, but the stupid hill :/).\u003Cp\u003EAt a high TWR of like 12, I would\u0027ve just started at 7 degrees and stayed there. Is this the \u0022lift\u0022 arkie is trying to explain?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Can\u0027t do video as I\u0027m using a laptop and KSP is a RAM beast, but I think you can get my flight path from this post. Basically I just minimized apoapsis as much as I could for 90% of the burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for posting this, Greep, because it\u0027s a perfecting jumping off point for some other points I kinda wanted to make.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, I believe that the \u0022lift\u0022 arkie is trying to explain is increase in altitude along an ellipse as you move from Pe to Ap. The problem is that there is no force being applied to move you upward, it\u0027s just gravity pulling you down, so there\u0027s no \u0022lift\u0022. You\u0027re moving upward because you have velocity in that direction from earlier in the burn that gravity hasn\u0027t canceled out yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really think the source of deviations from minimum predicted values are due to violations of the assumptions. Specifically, the first one: altitude gains due traveling \u003Cem\u003Earound\u003C/em\u003E the planet. As you pointed out, these low TWR burns are very long. If my math is correct, your burn lasted \u0026gt; 5 minutes, and you traveled ~ 120 km during the flight. That\u0027s more than 30 degrees longitude change on the Mun. Yeah, that\u0027s going to violate this assumption. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd even with that rather \u003Cem\u003Eegregiously\u003C/em\u003E violated assumption, the error is \u0026lt;2% at worst, even if that example is believed to be accurate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that invalidates the model in your, mind, fine. I\u0027m done trying to convince people otherwise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other point is exactly yours, Greep, RE: TWR. If the thrust limiting was removed from the engine, my model predicts the req\u0027d dV drops by ~ 100 dV! That\u0027s the one of the primary points of this model: Increasing TWR saves dV to a point, then levels out. You stop seeing really improved returns after TWR ~ 2.5-3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeeping the thrust limited does not seem like a \u0022practical\u0022 change. \u003Cem\u003ESomeone\u003C/em\u003E in this thread, who may or may not have designed a vessel similar to yours, has previously gone off on a tear trying to say this model would only show benefits for completely impractical vessel that no one would design, but is now using vessels designed to increase dV costs, which sure seem impractical, to invalidate that same model...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-25T20:08:15Z\u0022 title=\u002212/25/2014 08:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by LethalDose\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
