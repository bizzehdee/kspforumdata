I\u0027m working on a set of \u0022mass simulator\u0022 parts which would allow their mass to be adjusted by adding or removing ballast in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E. However, it seems that the UI slider is limited to having 10 steps, which is much too coarse for the parts to be of much use.\u00A0I\u0027ve found other tweakables\u00A0having as many as 200 steps (thrust limiters on engines), but there doesn\u0027t seem to be any reference to this in their config files. Additionally, I\u0027ve found references online\u00A0to a property called \u0022stepIncrement\u0022, but it seems like it\u0027s only accessible from plugins.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-27T03:44:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nstepIncrement should be accessible with a plugin - but not through the config file (unless I\u0027ve missed something).
