I re-posted this in the add-on section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recently downloaded the Soviet Modpack, by Bobcat, which includes the MIR space station. It had custom parts that looked \u003Cem\u003Eexactly\u003C/em\u003E like the parts of MIR. Not stock parts, but mod parts that look absoluttly perfect. I then proceeded to look for a similar modpack for the ISS, finding nothing. So here\u0027s what I\u0027d like to see, call it a challenge to the modders if you like. I would like to see a mod pack for the ISS, International Space Station, hopefully to the same quality as that of the MIR space station in the Soviet Modpack. Having seen what has been done by this community, I have faith that you will either create a modpack as I had mentioned, or find one that exists that i failed to find. I don\u0027t mean to come across as rude, this is merely a suggestion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope that this succeeds, I have faith in this community.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-23T18:46:15Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2013 06:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by sciencepanda\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"musicpenguin","CreatedById":57938,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T16:09:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWrong section. post in mods section.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tommygunyeah","CreatedById":57083,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T16:15:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs musicpenguin said, check out the Add-on forum and have a look there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the mean time, this could help you get something like the ISS...\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/kosmos-tks-spacecraft/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/kosmos-tks-spacecraft/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sciencepanda","CreatedById":15485,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T18:37:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am sorry.
