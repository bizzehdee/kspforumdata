Here is mine:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first real docking mission. Previous to this I did a successful intercept with two manned ships between Bill and Jeb. Now it\u0027s Jeb\u0027s turn and he gets the privilege of the first docking attempt with the Kerbina Target Vehicle. His first launch missed the entire intercept and had to be aborted. This is the second launch. It stands ready to receive Kerbinai 8. His brother Bill was a pro on the Kerbinai 7 mission. I guess because Jeb was flying this time, that\u0027s why all the fuel was used up. He made a command decision to use his remaining fuel in a Dock or Bust maneuver... that daredevil. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, he used up all liquid propellant to get the darn thing to within 10km, and had to RCS the rest of the way. Keeping the rest of Mission Control on their... um... feet, as usual, he manages to connect with the KTV... but tail end first, in the dark, and pointing the wrong way. Gene Kerbin at KSC smacks his head. Jeb doesn\u0027t lose his cool though, as he maneuvers away from the KTV, and KSC reorients the KTV south. Jeb thrusts the craft around for a docking maneuver. Docking then proceeds but not without a number of wild guesses at which way the craft will fly since the RCS is not perfectly balanced. Finally he levels out, and with only 7 units of RCS left, he thrusts forward and coasts to a perfect magnetic docking, causing Gene Kerbin to fall into his chair with a sigh of relief. Jeb was able to transfer fuel from the KTV to his ship and both ships were able deorbit successfully. Jeb grinning all the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img209/37/ll.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ll.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-18T04:35:46Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2013 04:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by inigma\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CosmicX1","CreatedById":35008,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-16T17:26:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen trying to dock the \u0027Cosmic docker\u0027 to the \u0027Cosmic-station\u0027 (I know.
