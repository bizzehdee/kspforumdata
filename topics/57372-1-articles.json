Why didn\u0027t they just explore everywhere at once? Why do we have so many spacelab missions and so many mars rovers?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause we don\u0027t know what to look for until the mission is planned, right? First the scientists think up something they want to find out, then the space guys send something up to find it. I hope this can be simulated in KSP\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebasically, once in a while, there\u0027ll be a mission that says something like [observe mystery goo behavior over long periods in high kerbin orbit] and that will require a manned flight (observer) with a goo container in space high above kerbin for say 15 days. the data gained from that would then be much higher than just random data we collect from anywhere. These \u0022quests\u0022 may repeat themselves from time to time, but mostly are randomly generated with region, equipment, manned/unmanned, duration, and whatever other variables there are\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to encouraging multiple missions to otherwise the same area, this encourages long term installations in regions of interest such as the ISS, since the same equipment may be used multiple time in the same area\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheCanadianVendingMachine","CreatedById":59684,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T23:36:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlanned in the form of Contracts.
