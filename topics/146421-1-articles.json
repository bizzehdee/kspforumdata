It\u0027s only about the look.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy main problem is due to personnal choice,\u00A0appearance and aerodynamic reasons I tried to place 4 Whiplash and 4 Nerv in tandem but the Whiplash explode due to overheating each time. When I\u0027m making ground test on the runway I can run the Nerv at full power with just the ramjets overheating just a bit, but when I\u0027m reaching 15-16 km of altitude and ignitiate the Nerv all ramjets explode istantly due to overheating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried to shut down the Whiplash first, back the throttle to idle then ignitiate the Nerv and spool them up slowly but the result is still the same. I have place two large radiator on the engines section to see if it would make a difference, same result :\u00A0Ka-boom!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI remember seeing some \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E concepts here and on KerbalX where peoples succeed to built those tandem Nerv-Whiplash engines, even calling them something like \u0022Next Generation Propulsion\u0022 or \u0022Nuclear Turbo-ramjet\u0022 but I can\u0027t find them in the database.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould you help me by explaining how you build them ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"foamyesque","CreatedById":2982,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-23T19:39:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you post a screenshot of what precisely you mean by \u0022tandem\u0022?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"XB-70A","CreatedById":144985,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-24T00:31:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI finally found\u00A0the solution after many attempts.
