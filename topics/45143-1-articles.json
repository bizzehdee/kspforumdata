I tend to turn everything on and leave them. This prevents me from accidentally turning them off. Because of this I use the right click menu.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome players like to retract their solar panels when docking, to prevent accidental breakage. Also, since antennas only extend once binding them to a key could be useful, especially if you attach lots of pretty panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of remote-tech, I don\u0027t think it does anything to interfere with key bindings. The only thing is that in general, probe cores use more electricity. Additionally, they are completely dead if they run out. The only way to recover is to go send up a ship with a Kerbal to extend the panels, or do whatever needs to be done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-06T20:45:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Action groups\u0027 (a group assigned to a specific # key) will toggle all items assigned to that action group on each separate flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, you launch \u0027station\u0027 where action group 1 (key #1) toggles solar panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou then launch \u0027power module\u0027, with its own solar panels toggled by action group 1 (key #1).
