I know IRL a while back they thought about having a solar sail that would move because of the photons hitting the solar panel.. I really don\u0027t think it would get effected in this game.. but thought I\u0027d ask.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-29T23:21:57Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2013 11:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Dewm\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T21:33:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s counter intuitive but that\u0027s the way orbital dynamics work. To speed up you\u0027ll need to put on the brakes (burn retro grade) and get your craft in a lower orbit. To slow down you\u0027ll need to throttle up (burn prograde) to get to a higher orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a vacuum the shape of your craft does not affect speed. Panels extended or retracted does not matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn real life there is indeed the solar wind but you\u0027d need several square kilometers of sail to gather enough force to move a craft.
