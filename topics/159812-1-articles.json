The log tells me that I igot 200k funds instead ...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically I am playing a game in the Galileo System in 6.4 scale. As a tech tree I am using the Engineering Based Tech Tree and contracts come from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E (modified) and the Historic Mission pack.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a save, which seems to be OK, until I enter the Contracts Building or start my rocket - or presumably have a scene change. Before that I researched at least 2 new nodes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat really made me get interested, was the ingame log telling me this: \u0022Awarding 200000 funds to\u00A0player\u00A0for contract advance\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I igot those 200k bucks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone encountered something like this before? And of course I know that may save might be heavily corrupted due to all mods.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a wys to find out, which part of the perstent save file could be worth a repair?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
