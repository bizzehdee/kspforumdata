(I had no mods installed) Also for some reason i coulnt load many planes because the file for small landing gear was gone. I dont know what to do to prevent it. all I can think of to fix that is to redownload the game. But i dont know how to transfer all of my other game saves to the new version. thank you very much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Trenton\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
