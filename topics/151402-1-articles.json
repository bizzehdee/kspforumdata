I don\u0027t understand all the advantages of the flying wing design as apposed to conventional fuselages or other alternatives. Another concept I really enjoy messing around with is the lifting bodies that NASA was experimenting with slightly before they came up with the space shuttle. Things like the Martin Marietta x-24 and the similar Scramjet Drones that are more modern are my chief inspiration here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne big problem I have is that I don\u0027t totally understand the advantages of both designs, so some help here would be much appreciated. Both in reality and in game. I have some basic questions about the fundamentals of where each design is most effective (such as general altitude) and why. I usually end up relying on the fact that I appreciate well engineered machines and that if it looks really cool, then it probably works well too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo here is the actual idea I had:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing the idea of the swing wing, which briefly explained is that the wing changes angle to improve performance at different speeds, I want to create a flying wing aircraft where the wings would swivel forwards (Probably using a mod like infernal robotics) to create the profile of a lifting body aircraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, Here are some conclusions I have come to:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is in no way practical in real life, I totally understand that, but this is Kerbal, and all things are at least attempt able. I don\u0027t understand the intricacies exactly of what I am suggesting, or even if it can be done, which is why I am leaving it here as a discussion point, for some peer review. I look forward to any advice or input given and will have some paper concept drawings added eventually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Ja3k\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordKael","CreatedById":154046,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-03T16:22:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe easiest way to explain the differences between a flying wing and a regular fuselage/wing set up would be to build one and see how it flies. For example, take the very simplest flying wing set up for stock: Mk1 cockpit, the largest areoplane wings (FAT-455) and fuel/engines. This design, with the addition of a vertical stabilizer, flies rather well below Mach 1, with variable \u0022best\u0022 altitude dependent on what engine you\u0027re using.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use this design with a \u0022whiplash\u0022 engine for long range scouting of low atmo planets, as I\u0027ve found that there is a great mass/lift ratio, resulting in lower take off speeds on Kerbin, which translates to a better flight in a lower density atmosphere.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-03T18:01:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a mod for variable geometry wings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe mod itself doesn\u0027t provide any actual wings; it\u0027s just a resource for other modders, but \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/71992-11-sxt-lacks-stock-extension-sxt-25-10apr16-basic-11-compatibilty/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ESXT\u003C/a\u003E provides a wing that utilizes it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t give you a good overview of how \u0027flying wing\u0027 and \u0027lifting body\u0027 differs, and probably this forum is not the best place to get the answers - I can suggest \u003Ca href=\u0022http://aviation.stackexchange.com\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eaviation.stackexchange.com\u003C/a\u003E as the right site to ask.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegardless, all MK2 parts act as lifting surfaces on top of their normal function, so if you\u0027re thinking of something funny like a wingless plane with just hull for lift, that\u0027s where you should be looking.

As it turns out, flying wing orientation is very stable at subsonic speeds. Unfortunately, there is a basic design pitfall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe core of the fuselage for a flying wing sits almost exactly in between the wings, which are swept back slightly and translated down in order to provide a center of lift behind and below the center of mass. By using an infernal robotics rotatron(?) and rotating the wings forwards the center of lift suddenly changes to way out in front of the center of mass. I figure this is because in game, all the wings provide the same lift regardless of orientation relative to their motion. So a wing upside down and backwards does the same job as one in the \u0022correct\u0022 position (I might be totally misunderstanding a game mechanic, if so please correct me). I don\u0027t know how to overcome this, so any advice would be nice. As I am still rather new posting on the forums, I don\u0027t quite know how to get the pictures added yet, but they should be here in less than 48 hrs for anyone interested.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"suicidejunkie","CreatedById":155878,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-04T16:45:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn game, IIRC, all the wings are just flat boards, symmetrical top to bottom, so flipping them over doesn\u0027t affect anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost (but not all) wings in real life are not symmetrical, and deflect air downwards when level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GluttonyReaper","CreatedById":59429,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-04T16:45:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure how well it plays with Infernal Robotics, but \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E is always a good option if you need more aerodynamic accuracy. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
