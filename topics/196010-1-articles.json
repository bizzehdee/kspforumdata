I managed to put the craft back into orbit, but by then I only had ~700 m/s of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E left, which is not enough to return from the Mun. However, apparently it would only take me ~250 m/s of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to transfer to Minmus, and from there I could do some gravity assists and burns to try and return back to Kerbin. I tried messing around with manuever nodes, and got an encounter with Minmus, but I was unable to get a gravity assist that could lower my PE a meaningful amount. How can I get an gravity assist that will help lower my PE enough that I\u0027ll actually be able to make it with the remaining fuel (or a totally different way to make it back that does not involve the cheat menu)?e\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!

It won\u0027t take that much fuel to get your PE into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere.

the movement of mun around kerbin. this way, all your orbital velocity around mun will be converted into orbital velocity to lower your periapsis once you are in kerbin orbit. a single burn of 250 to

is more than enough, now if you are in an highly inclined orbit like an polar one you might have to wait until your orbital plane matches up with mun direction of travel, at this point making an node who have you escape the mun and lower you \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E around kebin should send you back.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow if you had 200 m/s
