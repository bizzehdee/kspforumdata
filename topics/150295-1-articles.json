Since I\u0027m not the biggest fan of simulators I didn\u0027t expect to be drawn in this fast and deeply, but lo and behold if I didn\u0027t have last year of vocational school and other social responsibilities, I\u0027d be playing it non-stop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy 10 hours have passed as such:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nFirst 2 hours spent flying one engine rockets and or blowing up the faculty buildings (sorry scientists and engineers).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThen for 3 hours collecting data and unlocking new parts to toy with, also made my first airplane and took it for a joyride (landing is okay except the tail is too long and always breaks on touchdown).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAround my 6th or 7th hour I achieved orbit and started setting up a satellite network, gotta get paid yo.

the piloting like that only works when the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E system is engaged, so make sure that is turned on. \u00A0Further, while telling the pilot to keep the craft oriented in a certain direction relative to its velocity can be a great help at coming into an efficient vertical landing, you want to be quick to change \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E back to standard holding fixed orientation as your velocity gets close to zero. \u00A0When the velocity gets near zero, the orientation markers on the navball will start to rapidly shift, completely inverting if you switch to the opposite direction.\u00A0 So if the pilot is trying to keep the ship pointed in a particular direction relative to velocity when you get to that point, they will start swinging the nose around seemingly wildly, often over-correcting due to inertia and rapid directional change. \u00A0Since this is likely to happen as you are getting close to the ground, you might not have time to recover and fix the orientation of the lander before touchdown, and if the lander ends up sideways it can be difficult to get it back upright without damaging it further. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E defaults

button (typically \u0022T\u0022 on your keyboard.) \u00A0Do that when your descent is vertical and starting to get slow and you will avoid an unexpected \u0022correction\u0022 by your pilot.
