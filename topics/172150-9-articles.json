Looks like the new DLC Squad and Take Two have been working on is nearly upon us.

I was initially wary about the whole idea of there even being separately purchased DLC for reasons that become obvious when looking at some \u0022Tripe-A\u0022 titles of the last decade. We all know that Squad is a good team though, and even if I had a few reservations about a third party acquiring KSP\u00A0at first, I\u0027ve come to accept Take Two\u00A0as very trustworthy with this awesome project kept afloat by such a lively and friendly community.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, I\u0027m not big on marketing or software design, so if the rest of this sounds like I\u0027m pulling words out of a hat it\u0027s likely because I am. Call me paranoid or pessimistic, but Kerbal Space Program, while still an arguably obscure videogame,\u00A0seems\u00A0to be falling into the trap\u00A0of divide-and-conquer style exclusive content. One of the great things that has kept Kerbal Space Program relevant and alive for so many years is the endless sea of community-made plug-ins and add-ons that allowed users to almost limitlessly modify their gameplay experience and do things that would be impossible with the limits of the development capabilities and interests of Squad.

Modding will become a nightmare, plug-ins will not only need to be updated to be compatible with updates on the base game but potentially with DLC content as well. It is almost without question that some modders will either abandon or avoid compatibility maintenance for anything but the core game. Worse yet, perhaps a very useful and interesting mod comes along\u00A0but for whatever reason it only works side-by-side with a particular DLC, and immediately tons of players are barred from downloading something that would be free if not for the fact that they cannot afford or are not interested in said DLC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpeaking of which, I am thoroughly impressed with the dev team\u0027s work on the mission maker in Making History. I have been learning \u003Ca href=\u0022http://sidefx.com\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESideFX Houdini\u003C/a\u003E as of late which uses similar UI structure and it makes me happy that more and more software is using node-based programming. However, I am admittedly disappointed in the decision to allocate resources to creating historical parts. Don\u0027t get me wrong, the DLC parts are incredibly well-made and beautifully textured as usual, but\u00A0I feel this was the job that the modding community had been taking care of for a very long time already, with countless\u00A0add-ons already featuring similar parts. Spending so much time on replicating early space missions as a part of the stock game seems almost... dry. Part of the fun of stock KSP was that the parts you had at your disposal were vaguely similar to motors and pods and tanks used in real life but with their own design of originality to them, so that any replica mission you carry out will automatically have its own Kerbal twist to it, which is really charming. If you\u0027ll all allow me the liberty of ignoring the other features (since mission-making will likely be a relatively niche endeavor), charging $15 for something that can be acquired for free through mods seems a bit cheap on Squad\u0027s part. However I have a lot of respect for the KSP development team and doubt they would consciously stoop to the level of Electronic Arts. While Ubisoft is driven\u00A0by greed, Squad is driven by passion, and that is what makes KSP so different from other big game titles. The devs are loving of their work, but they are not stupid. Money is definitely a consideration to be had, and I am by no means\u00A0forgetting that. Everyone\u0027s gotta eat, of course.

but\u00A0I feel this was the job that the modding community had been taking care of for a very long time already, with countless\u00A0add-ons already featuring similar parts. Spending so much time on replicating early space missions as a part of the stock game seems almost... dry. Part of the fun of stock KSP was that the parts you had at your disposal were vaguely similar to motors and pods and tanks used in real life but with their own design of originality to them, so that any replica mission you carry out will automatically have its own Kerbal twist to it, which is really charming. If you\u0027ll all allow me the liberty of ignoring the other features (since mission-making will likely be a relatively niche endeavor), charging $15 for something that can be acquired for free through mods seems a bit cheap on Squad\u0027s part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA fair point.\u00A0 Though, the fact that it\u0027s \u0022official\u0022 actually makes things \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Enicer\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E from a modder\u0027s / player\u0027s perspective, because it means it\u0027s likely to be adopted widely enough to get good support from modders.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo take the example of my own IndicatorLights mod I mentioned earlier.\u00A0 There are a bunch of new parts in \u003Cem\u003EMaking History\u003C/em\u003E, some of which are appropriate for decorating with the sort of indicators I have in IndicatorLights.\u00A0 So of \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ecourse\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E I\u0027m going to instrument them, so that anyone who uses IndicatorLights will get all the extra goodness on the new \u003Cem\u003EMaking History\u003C/em\u003E parts.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0 ...But there are lots and \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elots\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of excellent parts mods out there, which I haven\u0027t bothered to add compatibility patches to, simply because I don\u0027t have the time and I don\u0027t happen to use those mods (and in many cases may not even have heard of them).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if nothing else, the existence of DLC does provide the opportunity to have at least a somewhat-standardized set of \u0022official mods\u0022 that are likely to get a higher level of support from the modding community than Random Modder\u0027s Mod would.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could be wrong about any or all of the foregoing, of course.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0 But, my initial reaction is one of cautious optimism.\u00A0 I\u0027m not seeing any particular cause for alarm, and I see no reason to assume the worst without some sort of concrete indications thereof.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ty Tan Tu","CreatedById":167214,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-09T02:19:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are few people writing mods for\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EColossal Cave Adventure\u003C/em\u003E.

non-issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat does \u003Cem\u003EMaking History\u003C/em\u003E have in it, taken for all in all?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nMissions (the ability to design and play them)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA bunch of new parts\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s it.\u00A0 How does that interfere with me as a modder?\u00A0 None of that will have \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eeven the slightest effect on any of the mods I\u0027ve written\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 It may give me new \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eopportunities\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E-- for example, I have my IndicatorLights mod, which adds little indicators to various parts, and I\u0027ll want to add some config to decorate the new \u003Cem\u003EMaking History\u003C/em\u003E parts with them too, sure.\u00A0 But that\u0027s because I \u003Cem\u003Ewant\u003C/em\u003E to, not because I \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E to-- if I didn\u0027t, it wouldn\u0027t break any of the functionality I already have.\u00A0 And it\u0027s exactly the same work I would have had to do if they\u0027d included all those parts in the stock game rather than making it DLC.\u00A0 The fact that it\u0027s packaged as DLC makes not one \u003Cem\u003Ewhit\u003C/em\u003E of difference to me, as a modder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then there\u0027s the brand-new functionality stuff, the mission builder.\u00A0 Well, a modder might want to go and write a mod that tinkers with that.\u00A0 But, again... doesn\u0027t really matter that it\u0027s a DLC.\u00A0 The modder writes code that works with the product that ships, and that\u0027s it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs it, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ein principle\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, possible that there could be some combinatoric grouping of possible DLCs that could complicate life for modders?\u00A0 Sure, in principle, I guess.\u00A0 However, nothing I\u0027ve seen so far gives me even the slightest cause for alarm.\u00A0 KSP is already game with a rich ecosystem of mods out there, and people who write mods often need to deal with \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eother\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E mods (e.g. producing compatibility patches, where appropriate).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe already \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ehave\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E a fairly well-defined process for doing this kind of stuff, and frankly, dealing with DLC from a professional developer (where they\u0027ve got a well-defined release cycle and have to keep things stable and backwards-compatible and all sorts of other stuff that mod authors don\u0027t have to worry about) seems to me to be \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eeasier\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E than dealing with mods from Random Cool Mod Author.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that\u0027s fairly unlikely.\u00A0 And even if it were to happen, it seems like a self-correcting problem:\u00A0 if there\u0027s a major need for a large chunk of the gameplaying population that\u0027s going unfulfilled, somebody\u0027s going to get around to writing a mod to address that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain:\u00A0 hypotheticals aren\u0027t real.\u00A0 If we start from \u0022What\u0027s the worst possible thing that could hypothetically happen?\u0022, then of \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ecourse\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E we\u0027ll be able to come up with extremely scary scenarios.\u00A0 But that\u0027s not super productive, and we\u0027ll likely end up scaring ourselves over stuff that never happens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA much more productive approach is to consider \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eactual examples\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Can you come up with one that seems plausible?\u00A0 It\u0027s okay if it\u0027s imaginary, but get specific.\u00A0 Give an exact example of a hypothetical DLC, and what problems you think that might cause in terms of compatibility.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m having trouble thinking of one, myself.\u00A0 Because what DLC generally does is \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eadd new stuff to the game\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Any given mod will either work just fine in stock-- in which case \u003Cem\u003Eeveryone\u003C/em\u003E can use it-- or else a mod is focused on working with some specific thing from a DLC (e.g. a mod for the mission builder in \u003Cem\u003EMaking History\u003C/em\u003E), in which case the mod is completely irrelevant to anyone who doesn\u0027t have that DLC and therefore won\u0027t be missed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m having real trouble thinking of an example in which anyone gets left out in the cold because they need a mod and they can\u0027t get one because DLC.\u00A0 Doesn\u0027t mean one doesn\u0027t exist, just that I\u0027m having trouble thinking of one off the top of my head.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022

point.\u00A0 Though, the fact that it\u0027s \u0022official\u0022 actually makes things \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Enicer\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E from a modder\u0027s / player\u0027s perspective, because it means it\u0027s likely to be adopted widely enough to get good support from modders.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo take the example of my own IndicatorLights mod I mentioned earlier.\u00A0 There are a bunch of new parts in \u003Cem\u003EMaking History\u003C/em\u003E, some of which are appropriate for decorating with the sort of indicators I have in IndicatorLights.\u00A0 So of \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ecourse\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E I\u0027m going to instrument them, so that anyone who uses IndicatorLights will get all the extra goodness on the new \u003Cem\u003EMaking History\u003C/em\u003E parts.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022

\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elots\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of excellent parts mods out there, which I haven\u0027t bothered to add compatibility patches to, simply because I don\u0027t have the time and I don\u0027t happen to use those mods (and in many cases may not even have heard of them).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if nothing else, the existence of DLC does provide the opportunity to have at least a somewhat-standardized set of \u0022official mods\u0022 that are likely to get a higher level of support from the modding community than Random Modder\u0027s Mod

As were my suspicions, much of what I wrote is out of my own characteristic paranoia about big businesses. The word \u0022DLC\u0022 makes me very nervous, especially if it\u0027s touching a project I love. DLC used to be just some french fries that you could order with your burger if you wanted, but nowadays DLC determines what kind of burger you are going to get in the first place based on what you can afford and what system you use, and sometimes even just luck.
