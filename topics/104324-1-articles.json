It\u0027s a service compartment, and it would look really bad on a plane.\n\nI don\u0027t know how to make it more clear. I\u0027m looking for something that looks just like the Mk1 fuselage, but is a cargo bay. Similar to the way the Mk2 Cargo Bay looks just like the Mk2 Fuselage/Tanks.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-20T05:32:22Z\u0022 title=\u002204/20/2015 05:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"Roxette","CreatedById":84963,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T17:42:38Z","Content":"Done.

It\u0027s doesn\u0027t mesh as well with the stock fuselage as I\u0027d like but it\u0027s definitely the best I\u0027ve seen, so in lieu of a better option coming forward, I will take it.

I do like the elevator doors, rather than the hinged doors.\n\n![screenshot144.png](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v445/Alshain/screenshot144.png)\n\nEDIT: Except there are no attachment nodes on the front and back for the small stack batteries or monoprop tanks, like the stock ones have. The stock cargo bays I think have 2 attachment nodes almost on top of each other. One to attach a fuselage piece from the outside, and another to attach cargo on the inside as shown below.\n\n![screenshot145.png](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v445/Alshain/screenshot145.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-20T18:14:42Z\u0022 title=\u002204/20/2015 06:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"Roxette","CreatedById":84963,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T18:35:08Z","Content":"ok, I\u0027ve pushed v 1.01 with added secondary attach nodes...
