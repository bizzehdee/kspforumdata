This means it has issues understanding how 2 or more bodies with significant influence affect another body, or each other. Because of this, when you are using conics in situations such as above, you get funky patterns like this. That same reason explains why there are currently no Lagrangian points in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-02T03:56:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, that\u0027s not the case.
