While out drinking one evening with Bill, he sketched out a rocket ship design that would push Kerbonauts so far into the danger zone that if they survived, nothing would ever scare them again.\u003Cp\u003EThe scientists and engineers, already knowing Jeb\\\u0027s value (they cloned his brain for the MechJeb, after all), quickly drew up the plans and put the Kerbal Propulsion Laboratory to work. Jebediah\\\u0027s Scream Machine was born!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I did have to do some CFG editing to get this thing off the ground, now that I\\\u0027ve done it a few times, I think I can revert to the original CFGs with a slightly different configuration. I found out quickly that the MechJeb was NOT up to the task, so everything had to be done manually, with MechJeb assisting only in Roll control. This design could ONLY get into orbit with throttle below or at 3/4 ... anything above that, it would spin out of control and promptly shake itself apart (even without the CFG edits, this monstrosity could only be handled manually).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did three launches total (well, 8 actually, but I don\\\u0027t count the first five screwups). Under acceleration, it handles like a dream. Without acceleration, you\\\u0027re just a flying brick. And I could NOT warp during any of the phases past x2, so it took almost real time to get to the Mun. Under extreme warp, the ship explodes if you sneeze (attributing this to the momentary lag experienced when going up or down in warp ... the ship would begin to wobble immediately, and fly apart ... autosave was the bane of my existence as well, on the first 5 flights, until I got a feel for when they\\\u0027d happen and could prepare for it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did get Jeb and crew back in \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Emore or less\u003C/span\u003E one piece, but the reason I ultimately named it the scream machine was Jeb actually screaming the moment of launch. We won\\\u0027t discuss how Bill or Bob reacted (I was certain they were going to pop out of my monitor to choke me to death).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the booster stage was jettisoned, flight became even harder. It had a tendency to fly out of control in a pitch spin, so I had to keep adding thrusters and thruster fuel just to get to the Mun. Landing was a bit ... interesting, and out of the three successful attempts, only the pictures below were 100% flawless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext week, Jeb\\\u0027s Scream Machine v2.0 will take to the skies ... bigger and \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Emore Kerbally delicious\u003C/span\u003E better (and without the CFG edits \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CVwQa.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CVwQa.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hnKL1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022hnKL1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yiyCm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022yiyCm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: I need a wider Launchpad ... pre-design phase is showing I don\\\u0027t have enough room for v2.0\\\u0027s preliminary trials\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thobewill10","CreatedById":6148,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-26T00:25:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor your wider launchpad, you should use \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=2750.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EProject Kerbylon\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wired2thenet","CreatedById":18275,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-26T00:38:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Thobewill10\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Thobewill10\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor your wider launchpad, you should use \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=2750.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EProject Kerbylon\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOOOHHHH!
