The game loads to the front page using 2.6GB of RAM which isn\u0027t horrible considering the number of mods I have installed. But when I load my game, just getting to KSC brings that up to 3.0GB. I can usually load one craft which brings my RAM usage up to around 3.3GB. Trying to switch to a second craft or just going back to KSC or the VAB will then usually result in a crash to desktop.

The CO2 Scrubber on the Apollo CM, even when you stay focused on the craft, removes 1527.001632 CO2/day which is only 99.5%. Discounting system errors, that should still give you 100 days worth of CO2 \u0022capacity\u0022 before you run into issues, so maybe that one is fine. But I wanted to make sure that the scrubber really was supposed to have less then a 100% efficiency. Mainly because having less then 100% (or even just 100%) means you can never really reduce the amount of CO2 that has built up which we know (from Apollo 13) isn\u0027t accurate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) 3 Kerbals use 1775.52 O2/day (0.00685 * 3 * 60 * 60 * 24). The LOX-O2 generator produces 1784.1062592 O2/day which is actually 0.48% more O2 than is used. Between the fuel cell and the LOX-O2 generator (which both need LOX), we need 20.36906784 LqdOxygen/day. Plus however much boils off each day. The Apollo SM only comes with 265 units of LqdOxygen which is just over 13 days worth (again, not including what will be lost due to boil off). The Apollo CM has room for 14days worth of food and water but only has 14.5 days worth of O2 and that excludes the boil off losses. Shouldn\u0027t the CSM come with a bit more LOX for emergencies?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) As far as I can tell, the CSM uses 238,118.4EC/day (antenna, command, lights, CO2 scrubber and LOX-O2 generator). The Fuel Cell produces 190,080 EC/day. Which means we use 48,038.4 EC/day more than we can generate. Assuming you launch with full EC, you have 100,800 EC in batteries. Meaning there is only about 2 days worth of electrical power available on the CSM. You could turn off the antenna (which is about 27.2% of the power) at which point the fuel cell produces plenty of power to keep the batteries charged. But wasn\u0027t the antenna left running all the time? Shouldn\u0027t the fuel cell be able to handle leaving the antenna running for the duration of the flight?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wobulator","CreatedById":138071,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-14T02:21:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have two questions.

I thought the onboard guidance (in game terms, the SAS and RCS) kept them angled properly to take full advantage of the lifting body design and to keep the astronaughts facing the sky. If I don\u0027t have attitude control during reentry, the capsule does aim more or less in the correct direction, but it tends to roll resulting in slightly higher Gs during reentry and leaving the kerbals either laying on their sides or face down. The extra Gs hasn\u0027t been enough to be a concern so far and I know the position a Kerbal is laying during maneuvers isn\u0027t actually relevant. But I play RO for the realism and it just doesn\u0027t seem realistic that the Apollo CM should be coming in sideways (from the crews perspective) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Lilienthal\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Lilienthal\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EActually no.
