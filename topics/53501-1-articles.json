What I didn\u0027t take into consideration is that my fuel is very low and I have no electricity to steer my vessel. Jebediah is now stuck on the Mun and I have had no luck getting another rocket over there as the last 4 attempts have all resulted in failure. I am looking for a hopefully simple way to get Jebediah back to Kerban if possible.
