Bummer...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not THAT big a deal without nodes, thanks to the target orbit being displayed in the map and the tolerances being fairly loose. Just coast to about where your Ap/Pe/AN/DN seem to be and burn at low throttle while observing the results. The tolerances on the orbits really illustrate the \u0022close enough for government work\u0022 thing. I\u0027ve had contracts complete when still at least 5^ off the specified inclination because my Ap and Pe were pretty close.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
