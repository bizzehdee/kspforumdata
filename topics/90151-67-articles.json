I totally understand that real spacecraft use RCS for rotation, rather than \u0022magic reaction wheels\u0022, and I think it\u0027s admirable that RO encourages us to do the same. Unfortunately, MechJeb seems built on the assumption that stock-like reaction wheels are present. When you\u0027re under thrust (and using a vectoring engine), this isn\u0027t a problem, but any time you\u0027re not under thrust (e.g. trying to orient to a manoeuvre node) it\u0027s a giant mess. Firstly, RCS needs to be enabled manually or it will sit there forever doing nothing. Second, once RCS mode is on, it spends far more fuel than is necessary, thrusting continuously (rather than an initial burst of thrust, patiently waiting, and then a final burst to stabilize, with perhaps a small correction or two if needed midway). Third, once the orientation is correct, it will continue to waste fuel indefinitely, making tiny oscillatory changes around the desired heading. Also, MechJeb has a tendency to make large shifts to heading during engine start/stops, which results in large and undesired rotations at the beginning or end of burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far as I can tell, all of this is a result of the fact that MechJeb assumes it has stock engines and reaction wheels, meaning that it thinks everything is infinitely throttle-able (including rotation), and that applying rotational torque is basically \u0022free\u0022 (since electricity in stock isn\u0027t very hard to come by, this is generally an okay assumption), as well as assuming that most craft will have enough torque to rotate to any desired heading relatively quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince none of these assumptions hold in RO, we have problems, especially with large craft.

Once you\u0027re near the end of the turn, turn the RCS back on to stop the rotation. As for docking using Mechjeb, you are absolutely right. Mechjeb goes crazy with RCS! However, I don\u0027t think a \u0022fix\u0022 would be as easy as it sounds for Mechjeb to use RCS properly.
