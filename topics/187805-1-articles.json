The only powered things that work when a craft is unloaded in the stock game are relays, and they just work for free. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E looks like it works unloaded, but actually the game runs a little simulation whenever an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E part enters the physics bubble and catches the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E craft up to real time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, if you are depleting energy a mod is doing it, and it seems pretty likely that the mod doing it is TAC LS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
