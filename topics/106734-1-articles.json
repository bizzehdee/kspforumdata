Sorry for spelling mistakes, I\u0027m a terrible transcriber. I try and clarify what is an actual quote from Max (if it\u0027s wrapped in \u0022quotation marks\u0022, it\u0027s the best transcript of an official Squad member you\u0027ll find on the web), and what is a summary from myself as I\u0027m aware I switch between the two with 0 notice. When I say \u0027Squad\u0027, I mean \u0027the relevant people who are currently developing the game\u0027. As always, this is just a transcript of an off the cuff vlog of a non-native english speaker - some details may change or be entirely incorrect. Some mentions of 1.0.1 have already been noted in the patch notes, I know this - this is summarizing the Squadcast ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n**Squadcast Summary for 2015-05-02** - [**Watch it here!**](http://www.twitch.tv/ksptv/v/4585539)\n\nMonday morning, Max is picking Romfarer from the airport, then later, Kasper and Mike - they\u0027ll be planning the year for KSP and having a general vacation. Also, skydiving.\n\n\u0022OMG we\u0027re out.. I don\u0027t know what to say, except I\u0027m completely exhausted in every way...\u0022 - everyone at Squad is super pleased at the 1.0 release of KSP, but it\u0027s also been a tough week on them. Max is amazed at the [PCGamer review](http://www.pcgamer.com/kerbal-space-program-review/) - 2 points behind HL2! Incredible stuff.\n\nUpdates 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 added a part and a few bugfixes/rebalances. \u0027Chute drag has been tweaked in 1.0.1 so they\u0027re not so OP. Deploying them early will now actually make them ignite so watch your re-entry corridor!\n\nUp until 1.0, not a dime was spent on marketing but with 1.0, they did a bit advertising on Youtube but had a few requirements - the youtuber had to be themselves (just do whatever, bugs and all), and had to include a paid-for disclaimer.\n\nTwitch chat asks about drills and heating... why no radiator part? Max: \u0022...that would have been more complex, for now tied to engineer skills... not 100% sure it will stay that way, but for now we think we\u0027re OK.\u0022 Max seems to be describing how it is in the patch today, heating problems are gone, and engineer skill affects the drilling yield. So, Max implies that they are OK with the change, but, leaves open the possibility of looking at the heating idea, later. (thanks @basic.syntax for this bit)\n\nOld gravity turn (45@10k) really doesn\u0027t work, what is needed is a gentler turn earlier. Really does help.\n\nKSP 1.1 news! Some things Squad can\u0027t share, but at the moment, updating to Unity 5, x64 support, more info next week. Has U5 been tried? Yes, it shows cool stuff, but more thought and effort is needed to give the KSP community what they deserve. Preliminary testing shows promise though. \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV display that was promised will probably be available in 1.1. Aerodynamic overlay too - it turned out be very easy to add on to and ended up eating a lot more of Squads time than desired. \n\n1.0 was held back almost a month or so - it got to the point where Squad were like \u0027yeah, we should probably release this...\u0027\n\nNext week, keep an eye on the social media - lots of news and discussions about the future of KSP.\n\nAnd that concludes Squadcast 02/05/15, see y\u0027all later!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T22:14:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 10:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ObsessedWithKSP**"},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T00:47:37Z","Content":"Sweet info about 1.1!

And OWK was here, all along. I should have just clicked his name somewhere for latest posts, lol. I can offer a 2nd PoV and a couple extra quotes for you guys.\n\nI think folks are getting the wrong impression about the drills and engineer skills. I don\u0027t know if OWK heard or meant it that way... its not what I heard in my viewing.\n\n*Question about drills and heating... why no radiator part?*\n\n*Max:*\n\n...that would have been more complex, for now tied to engineer skills... not 100% sure it will stay that way, but for now we think we\u0027re OK.\n\nMax seems to be describing how it is in the patch today, heating problems are gone, and engineer skill affects the drilling yield. \n\nSo, Max implies that they are OK with the change, but, leaves open the possibility of looking at the heating idea, later.\n\nHere is some excruciating detail on Max\u0027s 3rd launch, because some great jokes came out of it:\n\n3rd launch is going for a speed or distance record, using a liquid engine and stack of 8 FL-100\u0027s under the capsule.\n\nIt didn\u0027t go so well. Max began a gentle gravity turn at 8000m, \u0022It\u0027s not like we\u0027ll get an orbit, but may as well try to get as far as we can\u0022\n\nWhen he hit 10,000m an old habit kicked in, he pushed it over some more, a bit too hard this time, and suddenly the rocket tumbled end over end.\n\n\u0022Fins! Why didn\u0027t I get Fins?!\u0022 Rough explanation about why the old 10K turn doesn\u0027t work anymore.\n\nParachute deployed around 6000m ... hopes to recover to try again. Water landing coming up.\n\nA single parachute wasn\u0027t enough for the weight... whole rocket hit the water around 35 m/s, and vaporized.\n\nMax was shocked. But he recovered composure, and went back to the VAB.\n\nNo more Jeb. Val, you\u0027re up next... Because... no reverts!\n\nRechecking the same design for the next attempt, he noticed a very important part was missing: no stack decoupler under the capsule.\n\nI\u0027m not describing the 4th launch. It ended better... Val survived.\n\n*Max reads Twitch chat:* \u0022You might be a good game designer, but you suck at engineering!\u0022\n\n*Max response:* \u0022I\u0027m not even a good game designer... I\u0027m the *PRODUCER*!\u0022\n\n*Kofeyh on Twitch chat:* \u0022Max is being efficient: he\u0027s already murdered Jeb, to ensure he can\u0027t murder him in the future.\u0022\n\n*Max:* \u0022Kofeyh is just full of wisdom as usual. Kofeyh has caffeine and wisdom to spare.\u0022\n\n Unity 5\n\n\u003E \n\u003E We have tried Unity 5, our experimentation so far shows cool stuff, but we need to ... dig waaay deeper before we can actually say \u0027yeah, this works great.\u0027 So for now, (your) optimism might be a huge boost... might be a tiny, tiny boost - we\u0027re still gonna give it our absolute best! Because that\u0027s what you guys, as a community deserve.\n\nAero overlay\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ... we couldn\u0027t get it done in time. We did a bunch of design passes on it, and it seemed like the kind of feature that the more work we put in it, the more work it would **allow** us to put into it... so... the aerodynamic overlay will definitely be coming in 1.1. As will the Tier 0 buildings.\n\nMaxmaps is very happy with 1.0 changes to \u0022World\u0027s First\u0022 contracts. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m so glad we did that.
