Maybe it would be a large unmanned craft with at least one probe lander attached to it. The main craft would get low and high-space gravitational measurements of the entire planet, while the probes record atmospheric data and get science from different biomes. You don\u0027t have to do something like this, but this is one mission idea I\u0027m planning on doing soon-ish.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IncongruousGoat","CreatedById":157062,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-04T02:00:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDefinitely Laythe, because it\u0027s hands down the most interesting destination.
