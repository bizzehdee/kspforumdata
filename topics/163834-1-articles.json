I checked to make sure my nuclear engines had stopped and even decoupled them from my ship. Still accelerating. As soon as I lost my encounter, no more accelerating. I have quite a few mods installed. Here is a list: TacLifeSupport,\u00A0TweakScale, Kerbal Alarm Clock, Scatterer, NearFutureSpacecraft, KerbalReusabilityExpansion, KerbalEngineer, DMagicOrbitalScience, [x] Science!. The version of my game is 1.2.2. Do any of these\u00A0mods cause\u00A0this? Is this a known bug? Please help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-29T05:28:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to Tech Support (Modded Installs).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might want to upload your output.log file and link it here as well, so that people can better help you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
