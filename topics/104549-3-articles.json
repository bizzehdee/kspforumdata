Prayers to you.\n\nSide note: The next time you see or talk to your doctor, ask if it\u0027s ok (or *when will it be ok*) for you to start taking probiotics. I would think after you\u0027re off the antibiotics. Antibiotics kill the bugs, but they also tend to kill the good bugs (in your gut) as well; Probiotics will help replenish the good bacteria (flora) and help with recovery and in general help keep you healthy.
