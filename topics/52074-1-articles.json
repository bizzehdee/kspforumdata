The game runs fine at first, no lag whatsoever, but after 2 or 3 flights, if I enter the VAB or SPH, the framerate drops significantly to something like 10-15 fps (but only in VAB or SPH, the normal game runs fine). Sometimes the texture of the building is missing, or the building model may not be loaded at all (so it\u0027s just the background and some frozen kerbals). After this point, the game is very prone to crashing to desktop, especially during SOI transition or timewarp. Is it because of the add ons? Is there a way to prevent it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T09:12:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like a resource leak to me, try removing one mod at a time until the problem solves itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, dropping a bug with mods in Gameplay Questions, see what you did there. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T12:04:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is a resource issue from too many mods.
