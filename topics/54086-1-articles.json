Jeb frowned at him and turned away while the coffin was lowered into the ground. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe team had reviewed the data. Launch went fine, gravity turn perfect, the problem was the module weight. The control pod was far lighter than the command pod used for the manned flight. Analysis of the operation indicated that orbit would never be achieved due to this increase in weight. Engineers pointed out that the drop in TWR was acceptable but didn\u0027t factor in the reduction in flight time that would mean all three stages would be fully committed to orbital insertion, rather than using the last stage for circularization and de-orbit. The result was a parabolic sub-orbital trajectory that resulted in a very steep re-entry angle. The craft didn\u0027t survive but a few seconds once atmospheric interface was reached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETomory was 26.

Jeb, how do you suggest we proceed?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022A few things. I\u0027ve been looking at the preflight engineering analysis for the Mk 1 command pod by Kerlington. Has anyone looked at this data? The in house remote pod that we built is good for 3400 degrees, all around.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EZofort, the lead engineer spoke up, \u0022That\u0027s because we were unsure of attitude during re-entry Jeb.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I figured, thanks. Anyway, the Kerlington is only good for 1700. Re-entry angle is \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ecritical\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E for structural survival. So, sending a kid up with no control is a death sentence. Only fully checked out pilots that pass \u003Cem\u003Emy\u003C/em\u003E standards will be considered for future missions. Next, I don\u0027t know who approved a contract with Kerlington but these clowns caused nothing but problems for nearly the entire Air Force when they managed the P-82 project. Bad design, very difficult airframe to manage. Looks like not much has changed. Drop them.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Jeb, it\u0027ll take nearly 90 days to pass another option through appropriations!\u0022 Bill exclaimed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Bill, you built the remote pod in house, let\u0027s do the same with our command pods.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Bill we can manage that. As a matter of fact, before Kerlington was brough on, we started schematics for a command pod. We though that was going to be the path forward with that unit\u0027s success and all...\u0022 Zofort stated, twiddling his thumbs and staring down at his steno pad. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Alright then, Bill?

Another 10 days after that and we could be ready for flight.
