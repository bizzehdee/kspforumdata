Remember to off load your reports and samples into the command module and go back for more. No rocket necessary, just a Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELater, it is still about the Kerbals. Probes are OK, but if you want points, you NEED a Kerbal for the EAV reports and samples. You can get allot of points by EVAing around a planet and collecting reports while over biomes. This works for Kerbin, The Mun, and Minmus. Samples are the same, they are worth allot of points and need to come from each different biome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDO NOT transmit things, always try to land the craft, at least the pod back at Kerbin. You can EVA and collect results from experiments if you do not feel you can land with the modules intact.

Remember that each biome supports fouir experiments of each type at two or three altitudes and there are Lnear\u0022 and \u0022far\u0022 space locations too. If getting all the science points is the name of the game, builld a lander with 4x goo 4x jr s8 thermometer etc and keep sending it to the moon and bringing it back.

There\u0027s a decent bit of science to find in the biomes if you\u0027ve got enough equipment. Find somewhere you haven\u0027t been, land, EVA, grab the report while holding the ladder, store it, climb down to the ground, report, surface sample, climb back up, then board. Now you\u0027ve gotten more science out of a biome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, Kerbin, the Mun, and Minmus have biomes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELabs are only really good for purging your experiment cans so that they can be reused. For the effort to design and build a rocket/spaceplane to take the lab with you, and the extra two Kerbals that have to be deposited from the Crew tab because it\u0027s not a cockpit, I\u0027ve found it to be more trouble than it tends to be worth. Build your design to be a one-shot wonder, fly, land, get your science, get back to Kerbin, and recover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrew reports and EVA reports and Surface Samples don\u0027t take up \u0027space\u0027 in your cockpit, so you can theoretically collect reports and samples in your cockpit. If you have to ditch a stage that has science gear on it, EVA, gather your science experiments, and put them in your cockpit. You\u0027ll get a fair amount of value, rather than losing out on it, or wasting precious time/electricity/science by transmitting it back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your design contains parts that you fear might break on landing, do the same. Better to not get 100% than to certainly get 0% for destroying it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbes are pretty fairly worthless. For the amount of time and effort, you might as well yank the probe core off and plunk on any of the manned cockpits/capsules, or do a daring space mission with a Kerbal in a command chair.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of command chairs, last I checked, a Kerbal sitting in one could benefit science by technically being \u0022in EVA\u0022 and having access to an EVA report. On a rover with a seat mounted low enough, you can do a rolling Surface Sample, speeding up your science hunting. Combine that with having a Kerbal in a cockpit/capsule and you can get EVA and Crew reports simultaneously. So it can be advantageous, albeit risky, to hurl a Kerbal into space riding a chair while his best buddy flies in the cockpit. If you need a reason to do it, just think that Jeb bet the guy in the \u0027hot seat\u0027 wouldn\u0027t do it. Now you\u0027ve got an instant daredevil.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-24T13:17:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe capsule on the launch pad, 7 points, enough to unlock decoupler and goo capsules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuborbital flight with 2 Goo capsules, 50 points when you also do eva in space, reports, eva after landing and collecting surface sample on Kerbal.
