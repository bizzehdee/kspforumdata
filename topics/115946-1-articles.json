They\u0027re pretty all right. The only thing is that they make things in their vicinity explode. It started with reaction wheels onboard both wings exploding when switching to the plane or timewarping. Then they started causing other nearby ships to explode..I just tried landing one at the KSC and as I was coming in (I was still airborne and pretty far still), I started seeing explosions at the rocket hangar. It had moderate damage when I arrived...\n\nSo...what?\n\nMods I have installed:\n\nMechjeb\n\nKER\n\nAstronomers visual pack\n\nstage recovery\n\nchatter\n\nalarm"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T02:14:37Z","Content":"Pictures?
