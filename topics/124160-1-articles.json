Now, I have that 10m heat shield that I won\u0027t need anymore. What would be good uses for it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have thought of the following possibilities:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Atmospheric probe: I jettison the shield before I circularize my orbit, so the periapsis lies within the atmosphere and the shield will plunge into Jool after two or three more orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Laythe probe or lander: If I\u0027ve got a massive heat shield, I can land a whole base on Laythe!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Impactor: Leaving stuff in outer space without any use to it is uneconomical. Let\u0027s smash the whole thing onto Tylo!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Orbiter or Probe: The heat shield can become an independent probe or supply station capable of aerobraking to drastically change the orbit.

Personally, I\u0027d just let it go-- dead mass is dead mass, if it\u0027s served its purpose then discard. For example, the atmospheric-probe idea: yes, you could do that... but you could just as easily do the same thing with a specialized (and tiny) atmospheric probe/lander that you release at the same time as the heatshield, which would do the same job \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eand\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E would have the advantage of being small and light, so you could actually land it on the surface with a small chute and get useful science out of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeat shields are good for, well, shielding heat. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E Once they\u0027ve served their purpose and you don\u0027t need them for that anymore, then they\u0027re basically just dead weight.
