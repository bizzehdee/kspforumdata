Now I know little on how something like this might work and the challenges that come with it. But wouldn\\\u0027t be fun to hook up with friends, land on the mun or minmus together, build a space station, cooperate. You would each have your own launch pads. The other rocket\\\u0027s command module would have distance and the friend\\\u0027s name displayed over head. Maybe in the very distant future you could mine materials together on other planets for the completion of missions as long as you made it back. Maybe building a moon base could be possible in the future and once enough resources were collected (or money), you could each build a moon base, so as to each launch rockets together from a mun base pad. I think a multiplayer feature (of course in the very distant future) would add some fun to this game.
