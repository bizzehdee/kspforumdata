I like to think the main three orange suits are brothers, so if Val has an orange suit, that probably means she\u0027s their sister. If having her be sister is too much because she was never in KSP until now, then cousin maybe?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-22T17:41:36Z\u0022 title=\u002203/22/2015 05:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun**"},{"CreatedByName":"kujuman","CreatedById":28299,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T18:19:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Interesting how they named Valentina after a historical figure but not Jeb, Bill, or Bob.\n\nInteresting\u0027s not the word I\u0027d have used. Naming a starting Kerbal after a historical figure makes it different to kill her than the other Kerbals. It would be absolutely appropriate to add her name to the easter-egg name list, but the starting 4?
