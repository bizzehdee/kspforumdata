I\u0026#39;ve got Mk1 cockpit and liquid fuel fuselage. I can attach wings Type C or Swept Wings. I can put a J-20 Juno basic jet engine on the back. How can I attach an air intake? I only have a Small Circular Intake. There are no attachment points on the wings or fuselage. Only way I can figure out is to use a Modular Girder Segment on the wing and attach the air intake to that. Pretty ugly and heavy. I see a lot of pictures of things stuck on wings, but when I move it all over the wing it never wants to stick. I\u0026#39;ve tried turning off the angle snap but doesn\u0026#39;t make any difference.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fluburtur","CreatedById":152556,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T22:09:35Z","Content":"\nI usually use the alt\u002Bf12 menu to put on noclip in editor and put the small structural cube on the back of the wing, make sure it is aligned and the put the tank, the engine and the intake. May be considered cheating but it works.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T22:33:56Z","Content":"\nSurface attach a structural fuselage piece, stick the intake on one end \u0026 the engine on the other.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ben the ever Curious","CreatedById":173314,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-05T22:44:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow do you surface attach a structural fuselage piece?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-05T23:04:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a rather old thread, and that info is somewhat out of date. It works with fuel tanks now, too. You just grab a fuel tank or structural fuselage part in the editor and hold it next to the wing -- when it turns green, it\u0027ll stick right where it is. Generally, you want to turn on 2x symmetry so that everything is attached in balance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ben the ever Curious","CreatedById":173314,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-05T23:54:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\u00A0 That did the trick, I ended up using some of the small fuel tanks.\u00A0 Is there anything special to link a wing fuel tank to a main body fuel tank?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-06T00:03:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222911913\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022126195\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221483660482\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022173314\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ben the ever Curious\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 minutes ago, Ben the ever Curious said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there anything special to link a wing fuel tank to a main body fuel tank?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, they are automatically all linked, except for a few rare\u00A0circumstances where you may need to add Fuel Ducts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
