In the atlantic and baltic, they faced a submarine threat so most were given an increase in surface firepower and more depth charges.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T01:14:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might be able to dig the info out of photos:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.navsource.org/archives/04idx.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.navsource.org/archives/04idx.htm\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
