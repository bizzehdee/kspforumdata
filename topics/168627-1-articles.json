I have a simple but intricate question on how would you think it\u0027s the best way to schedule science data gathering on a kamikaze probe burning on a gas giant atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use remote tech, I love the additional difficulty in it, but I think I hit a wall here. When I want to send a probe to a gas giant I can\u0027t get the science before the probe is destroyed due to signal delay. Is there any way to automate or trigger the science gathering from the probe itself?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you have any ideas on how this task can be done in a efficient way.
