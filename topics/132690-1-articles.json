AFAIK the only noteworthy visual change\u00A0we should be expecting in 1.1 is the rebuilt UI.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPixel lights (e.g. spotlights) are pretty computationally\u00A0expensive by their nature, especially on integrated laptop chips, where fillrate is in short supply. You can reduce the \u003Cstrong\u003EPixel Light count\u003C/strong\u003E in your settings (the only setting that would affect this), though with the obvious consequence that the lights will look crappy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt some point in the future, I believe there are plans to take advantage of Unity 5\u0027s physically based rendering (which will make everything look AMAZING), but that will definitely not be happening in 1.1 (and, if anything, is likely to put more stress on the graphics hardware).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-22T17:12:27Z\u0022 title=\u002202/22/2016 05:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 22, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by StarManta\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
