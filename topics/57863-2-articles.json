That would be ideal, in my opinion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe turrets would have limited range of articulation, I\u0027d suggest, based on their function: a point-defense turret would have 360 degrees rotation with the gun being able to \u0022rise\u0022 180 degrees from the horizon.

This is where the bullet effects are spawned, and the bullet itself spawn a little bit in front of it, to avoid clipping issues. Also, the hitbox should preferably be nowhere near the \u0022MuzzleLoc\u0022. try to keep the models fairly low poly, since KSp generally speaking isnt super graphics anyways, so lower polys allows mounting more guns without framerate issues.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
