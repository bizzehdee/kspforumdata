But if someone goes beyond that, say burning until the end of stage 5, that could add another 100 seconds (I believe the total burn time for stage 5 is about 120 seconds), and much more if you continue burning with the orbiter stage (another 120 seconds, I think).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might be better for comparing total flight time if everyone collected the data until you completely run out of fuel.

The rules change for parts the game decides are obviously scrap that is falling to the ground, and I forget exactly what the distances and whatnot are.

I just put the FPS results on the first page, they scale nicely with clockspeed, but I guess Crossfire just doesn\u0027t work well with KSP. I didn\u0027t put up the frametime results there, but they are interesting, too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are the frametime data together with the framerate data:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/CPU%20Test/data%20sets/1090TFrametime.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u00221090TFrametime.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe framerate mostly matches the frametime data until it gets up to 60FPS. After that you get those ridiculous 5ms frames, which I\u0027m pretty sure are meaningless as far as what you actually see onscreen. When I throw out the frames under 10ms and take a 5-frame moving average you get this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/CPU%20Test/data%20sets/927fc137-0b49-4604-af41-71c2638cb868.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022927fc137-0b49-4604-af41-71c2638cb868.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, the frametime and framerate data match up for most of the run. But when you get to the end the framerate data includes all those high speed frames, so it looks very high. Without those high speed frames you get something more like 60FPS. Maybe this always happens when you get above your monitors refresh rate. It\u0027s probably best just to turn V-sync on and not worry about it. Those slow frames are another story though. Those are around 200ms per frame, which causes that noticeable stutter. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor my purposes none of this really matters though. It\u0027s the low frame rates during the initial stages that I\u0027m most interested in. When you look closely at those stages you can clearly see about a 10% increase in performance going from 3.2 to 3.6GHz, and another 10% for the FX 6350 at 3.9GHz.

During idle/2D/desktop usage it stays at 350MHz and during 3D or other GPU intensive tasks it switches to 1000MHz. Pretty much all GPU\u0027s do this; some have three modes and some have a turbo mode where the clockspeed is increased beyond the regular high speed limit based on power and temperature limits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s nice to see how the i3 matches up with the i5. The major difference here, I think, is that the mobile i3\u0027s don\u0027t have any turboboost mode, whereas the i5\u0027s can increase their speed to 2-2.3GHz. You can see how that relatively small increase in performance has a big impact on total simulation time. The i5-2467M gets to stage 5 around 3 or 4 minutes before your i3, even though the difference in frame rate during the early stages is just 1 or 2 FPS. The other i5 on that chart continues on past stage 5 though, that\u0027s why it takes so long to finish.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr. Scruffy","CreatedById":38540,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T17:54:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe the only valid sole indicator (that is if you only want to use one, and only one) for a comp\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s performance in KSP is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4calculated time for the launch\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 / \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4used time for launch\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4) * average FPS during launch\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Krizzen","CreatedById":60464,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T18:05:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMultithreading isn\u0027t something you can just flip a switch and say \u0022Tada!

Yours performs similar to the Q6600 at 2.4GHz.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s weird about the docking. I tried this once and it worked ok. My method, I think, was to EVA a Kerbal over, detach the docking port from the adaptor first, then activate the stack separator, open the docking port and dock using the command module. It worked fine for me. However, I have had problems before when detaching a docking port in-flight like this. It seems that it can cause the docking port to get stuck. They behave like you describe when this has happened to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can check if this is the case by opening the persistence file and searching for \u0022state = acquire\u0022 without the quotes. If you find a docking node with that line you can just change it to \u0022state = ready\u0022 and it should fix the problem. I\u0027ve had this happen many times, but I\u0027ve never been able to reliably replicate it on a stock install. Hopefully you\u0027ve stumbled onto a way to make this happen. I\u0027ll look into this later and if I can recreate it then I\u0027ll submit a bug report. This is one of the docking port bugs that\u0027s been giving me problems for a long time, so it would be great if this could help find a solution.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
