The easiest fix for that is on the model design side of things where objects that could possibly be climbed by a large wheel of some sort should have a sloping collider that the wheel collider can interact with. So, when it comes down to it, we can\u0027t really do anything about the inability for large wheels/tracks to climb these low obstacles... unless we were to build a bunch of dummy objects (like the one used to make the VAB helipad launchable in KK by featuring a plane that side below the visual surface of the pad and a collider that sits just above it) with the various inclines in the colliders that we could embed into the structures/features that we want climbable. I\u0027m doubtful that there\u0027s any way to do that without the tedious task of placing everything by hand (unless we build the collider dummies with the same origin as the object we want to make climbable, in which case we just set it\u0027s location in a config to be equal to the visible object\u0027s location).

All I know is that we handled our side of the problem which occurred even with BDArmory not installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I noticed is that during all of our code merges, somehow the line that makes that collider visible keeps being set to \u0022true\u0022 when it should really only be set to \u0022true\u0022 if you compile with a debug argument (we still need to separate some stuff into debug defines so we don\u0027t need to comment them out or delete them). So, even with a more recent release of the plugin, you can\u0027t guarantee that the white box won\u0027t show up. Somewhere down the line we might even think about building some GUI elements to activate debug visuals/readouts if a \u0022debug\u0022 toggle is switched on.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-20T17:41:01Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2015 05:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaalidas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T19:14:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment, it\u0027s mapped to the numpad. 8,2 4,6 1,9 move it around linearly, then if you hold alt, 8,2 4,6 1,3 rotate.
