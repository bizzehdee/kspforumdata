The app is free and it\u0027s called GoISSWatch. It will go off of your location and show you where ISS is in realtime. It also has a 3D map mode which utilizes your phone\u0027s compass and gyro to allow you to point your phone directly at ISS. I was able to confirm this just a few minutes ago and was delighted to note that it was actually quite bright in the night sky and was visible for around 50 seconds from where I stood. I was out in the courtyard where I work and the walls are pretty high so needless to say if you are someplace out in the open and perhaps higher up, you will be able to see it for a longer period of time. I\u0027m curious if it will be possible also to spot ATV-5 as it gets closer to docking with ISS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"advil","CreatedById":113133,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-04T10:34:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother piece to the ISS puzzle.
