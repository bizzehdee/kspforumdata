All the patches since .20 have essentially rewrote much of the code (each having a major performance increase coupled in with it) and built sections of the game from out of thin air (IE: Science, tweakables) think about everything those 2 things alone affect in game and you\u0027ll understand why it takes so long, for a game that doesn\u0027t have a definitive development schedule, this is actually reasonably good. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow mind you, I would love if they would do part patches, or UI patches separately, and have them every month or so (and a major patch every other month). Much of the complaints for this games development come from the great space between patches.
