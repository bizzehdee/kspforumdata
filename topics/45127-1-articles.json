As for dropping something without it breaking, try getting it to land on a part with high impact tolerance (such as structural panels, modular girders, and especially structural pylons). I\u0027ve dropped one of my Hellhound rovers from 2500 meters on Kerbin before, land at 70 m/s and survive (broke off a few tires and popped a few more of course, but the thing was still drive-able afterward) because it\u0027s largely constructed with high speed-impact tolerant parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
