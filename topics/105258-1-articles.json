So no more spamming crew reports since you can only hold one and not be able to transmit it without an antenna?\n\n- It looks like each capsule has some sort of basic heat shielding, but there doesn\u0027t seem to be any metion of it on the part itself or way of telling how it is working. I launched a capsule about 100km up and brought it down with no heat shield (since you don\u0027t start with any) and it survived. Admittedly, I haven\u0027t really played around much with the actual heat shields, but from what I know, they have a lifespan and if you come in too steep, you can burn them right up. Why no such info for the capsules if they appear to have a basic heat shield?\n\n- Also heat shields as \u0022aerodynamic\u0022 parts? Doesn\u0027t make sense to me; they seem more like structural parts in the same way as a stack seperator/decoupler.\n\n- The camera wobble is nauseating and annoying. That said, I\u0027ll probably get used to it eventually. I know you can adjust it in the settings, so don\u0027t jump all over me about that. I want to try and play this with all the new \u0022features\u0022 to see what I like and what I don\u0027t. For now, I\u0027m not a big fan of the camera wobble, but I\u0027m giving it a chance.\n\n- Haven\u0027t really played around with the fairings too much yet, but the one time I tried them out, I liked how they worked. \n\n- New aerodynamics haven\u0027t really made an impact on the stuff I build or fly, but I\u0027m still doing very basic stuff. Never was a big spaceplane fan, so not sure how much this will impact me. But I\u0027m flying my rockets same as before without any real issues yet.\n\nSo far, I\u0027m having fun with 1.0.

For now, I\u0027m not a big fan of the camera wobble, but I\u0027m giving it a chance.\n\nI turned it off after literally five seconds. I don\u0027t like how it\u0027s a slow drunken wobble, and not a rapid but subtle vibration (like would be expected from a rocket...). It even shows up as a slow wobble in IVA, while just flying smooth and steady in a plane. I never have really been susceptible to motion sickness until I met this camera.\n\nNot fond of how far down fairings are in the tech tree. Career in general just seems, amazingly, like *even more* of a tedious slog than it was before (and this is with default settings). Is it just me, or are building upgrade prices even more ridiculous now than they were before?\n\nI\u0027m going to bet parachutes are enough to land lots of stuff on Duna, now, given how much more they slow you down.\n\nI can\u0027t make sense of the overheat mechanics for resource gathering/processing. It seems to fluctuate up and down of its own free will, and at times it will just suddenly detonate the rear half of my ship without warning. Wasn\u0027t there supposed to be some overlay that let you see the overall heat of your ship? And one for aerodynamic stability? And, hell, where is the delta-v indicator we were promised? I haven\u0027t seen anything on engineer kerbals for it, or anywhere else.\n\nI\u0027ll be honest... it, as I was afraid of, just doesn\u0027t feel like a release-quality game. You still get multiple second long freezes when going between KSC scenes, or even just closing the map view for the first time (that one I really don\u0027t understand...). Loading times on start are faster but the game still struggles, mostly due to terrain slowness as far as I can tell.\n\nAnd, you know, no clouds, despite there being clouds in the (still-inexplicably-static) hangar/VAB backgrounds, and even in the trailer for 1.0.\n\nEgh...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-27T19:55:55Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2015 07:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NovaSilisko**"},{"CreatedByName":"Thnd3r","CreatedById":137708,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T19:54:45Z","Content":"Building upgrade costs have gone down by roughly 25% so says Harvester in the change log.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Facility upgrade costs re-evaluated, lowered by about a quarter overall.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-27T19:57:46Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2015 07:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Thnd3r**"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnny Wishbone","CreatedById":118096,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T20:03:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Building upgrade costs have gone down by roughly 25% so says Harvester in the change log.\n\nthat cant be right. In 0.90 with default settings, you could take the \u0022escape the atmosphere\u0022 and \u0022orbit kerbin\u0022 contracts and use the advanced funds from them to upgrade the mission control building so you could go back in and take the rest of the contracts, all before you even launched your first craft.

There\u0027s a lot of great new additions, but it feels as though everything was pretty rushed.
