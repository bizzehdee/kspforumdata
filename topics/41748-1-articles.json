Duna was at the wrong phase angle though by around 46.6 degrees and this was a pure chem rocket not intended for a interplanetary orbit. And just now when recording a Minmus flyby I managed to get a Mun encounter and slingshot to nearly Duna\u0027s orbit again but I gave up reloaded and sent him back to Kerbin where during timewarp his chute broke and he died.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scorpi15","CreatedById":34189,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-09T10:20:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELook at NovaSilisko\u0027s youtube channel and his real-time Moho flyby!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
