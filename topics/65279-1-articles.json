And of course I thought of the KSP community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought the movie was just epic!! I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s just me, or something to do with my back ground (I was a infantry combat medic and now I\u0027m a civilian paramedic), I\u0027m used to seeing very heroic people do amazing things on a daily basis. But whatever the reason this movie hit me in the face with a shovel; it just moved me spiritually and emotionally. It was visually stunning and beautiful on so many levels. I\u0027m so disappointed that I didn\u0027t get to see it on the big screen in full 3D; if it ever comes back to the theater I\u0027m going to see it hands down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is nothing that just moves me like self sacrifice, and the ability and courage (giant brass balls) for someone to choose to put themselves in harms way for the betterment of mankind, and/or the well being of others. Its for reasons like this that gives me hope for us as people in general, and why I have a very sensitive spot in my soul for movies like this, and others like the right stuff, apollo 13, from the earth to the moon, and so many more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you watch movies and documentaries like these it hits home, just how dangerous space travel is. These HEROS and I don\u0027t use that word lightly, knowingly put themselves in the most unbelievable scenarios that I could ever imagine. KSP is an amazing game that brings so much attention to these amazing people that SQUAD, and the dedicated people working on this should be very proud.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I just wanted to say that while we have our successes and failures in KSP, and Kerbalnauts rise to greatness, and die for the betterment of science.. please keep in mind that there is a direct parallel and mirror to real life and human history here. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo all the fallen HEROS of past and present space programs, and also to those that are currently and knowingly putting their lives on the line for NASA, other agencies, and other occupations; I salute you, my heart and prayers go out to you, and you all make your mark on human history every moment of your lives. I thank you all, for your courage, and selflessness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGod Bless You All.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-09T12:27:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E*surreptitiously shunts thread to the Space Lounge, since it isn\u0027t really about KSP in particular*\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
