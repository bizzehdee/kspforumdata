The question \u0022are you making an unlawful copy of the KSP game when posting a video\u0022 should answer your question. The only case where you could run afoul is when the software you\u0027re running is displaying copyrighted content (like showing a movie).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, there\u0027s this widespread misconception that Take2 bought the game because the want to remove it from the surface of the earth. I\u0027d love to hear the motivation of this thought. Why would Take2 buy a game to destroy it? So, assuming that Take2\u0027s intention is to actually make money from KSP (one must admit that this theory has certain merits), \u003Ci\u003Ewhy would Take2 fight free publicity for the game? \u003C/i\u003ECase in point: Youtube videos about GTA and about \u003Ci\u003Eany \u003C/i\u003Epopular videogame. In fact, there\u0027s even streams and videos around dance games. If there\u0027s any game genry that would be shut down on youtube it\u0027s those, because of the music being played. And they exist, so...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird, in 99% of the cases where \u0022copyright\u0022 is being brought up, we\u0027re really talking about trademarking\u2014an entirely different beast. But keep in mind that the keyword in trademark cases is \u003Ci\u003Econfusion\u003C/i\u003E. For instance, yes, UPS does have the color brown trademarked. Can they stop you from using the color brown? Only if it\u0027s close to their brown, and even then only if you\u0027re using it for your courier service. There\u0027s no way \u0022Bob\u0027s Boat Rental\u0022 could be confused with UPS, therefore UPS will have no case when Bob paints his boats brown. Take2 must fight you when your Youtube channel pretends to be them, but that\u0027s as far as it goes, I\u0027m pretty sure. In all other cases there\u0027s no doubt your channel is yours, not theirs, and they have grounds nor reason to take it down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-01T11:01:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/en/?page_id=19\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFAQ on the KSP website\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0still says this is fine.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/en/?page_id=19#0\u0022 style=\u0022background-color:rgba(0,0,0,.9);color:#aaaaaa;font-size:14px;text-align:left;\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EI uploaded a gameplay video to Youtube.
