I\u0027ve been watching a few tutorials, mostly those of Matt Lowne and Scott Manley, and they have been very helpful. In my current attempt, I am trying to more or less copy part of a\u00A0\u00A0station that Matt Lowne demonstrated in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbD5JcByAbQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis video\u003C/a\u003E. The part that I\u0027m copying starts at about the 2:10 mark. I don\u0027t know if it makes a difference, but I\u0027m using fuel tanks instead of crew quarters. The shape of the parts is the same.\u00A0 Also, I\u0027m just doing\u00A0the octagon, not trying to make it rotate. It looks fine in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, but once I move to the launch pad and the physics kick\u00A0in,\u00A0 it\u0027s obvious that I\u0027m missing some aspect of the construction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/FI0r2iSFcmg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EI made a short video if it helps.\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0 It all just starts flopping around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs long as this game has been out, I\u0027m guessing that this has been addressed somewhere.

(I.e. the second tank in one arm to the first tank in the next arm.) With a little bit of fiddling you can probably fit that in the gap between the two tanks.

The same cannot be said on the launchpad - where it has to deal with 1 g acceleration - or during launch - where the forces a even higher! So I would add some more struts to the craft to keep it stable during launch.

That way I can fire the decoupler and the strut and the connection pieces will stay on the decoupled part. (And will deorbit if you do it right.) If every tank is strutted to a part on the central stack well above and below it, then that will make the whole craft a lot more sturdy and will also reduce the \u0022floppyness\u0022 of the waist where the ring is connected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223889517\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022198508\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221607082035\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022207495\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Particle\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Particle said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know if it makes a difference, but I\u0027m using fuel tanks instead of crew quarters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt does make some difference because fully fueled tanks are heavier than the crew quarters.
