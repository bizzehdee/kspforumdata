Test out such a large design(the largest ship I\u0027ve ever built) and see how it performs on an interplanetary mission. Prior to this, I\u0027ve only done a single robot satellite/lander combo to Duna, which was always planned as a one way trip. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) Land the first Kerbals on another planet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) Test a series of different landers in an atmosphere, including parachute performance. Thus why each lander is different. I also wanted to test my ability to put landers as close to a specified landing zone as possible(which is tricky with an atmosphere causing drag).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
