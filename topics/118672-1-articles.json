I thought it would do better as its Isp at 1 atm is better than the aerospike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at the stats KER shows for eve sea level... the mammoth looks terrible... It doesn\u0027t equal the Aerospikes Isp until 5.3 km, then it has a better Isp than the aerospike until 14.3km, at which point the aerospike overtakes it again... but ascending those first 5.3km takes a lot...........\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Red mentioned, an aerospikes advantage is being near optimal across a wide pressure range, but at each pressure you should be able to design a bell nozzle that is better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that the mammoth, should be optimized for somewhere above 1 atm, and have significant underexpansion on Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs to SSTO, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s doable yet. Can you pack 6km/s into a single vessel of sufficient TWR? The atmosphere also is rather odd. The problem of not burning up forces a pretty steep ascent at any rate, and then I found that there was very significant drag as high as 80-90km... ultimatley my launch approached the \u0022straight up then turn left\u0022 paradigm with circularisation burns on the order of 2km/s, because any attempt at speed-building while in atmosphere turned out to be too costly.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, my gravity turn started slowly after passing 20km... I\u0027m not sure if that was best, but it worked, I don\u0027t think I was really pitched over much until about 60km.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-17T22:50:21Z\u0022 title=\u002208/17/2015 10:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KerikBalm\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-18T00:03:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerikBalm\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KerikBalm\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI had a look in the VAB with KER, and using the stats it says...\u003Cp\u003EAt sea level(eve) the Aerospike gets 230 Isp, The mammoth gets 193.2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9.8:1 TWR at Eve sea level for the mammoth, the Aerospike, only 7.3...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI seem to recall a recent patch changed the thrust/Isp curve for aerospikes, that must be the reason for the discrepency with Kelderik\u0027s numbers\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI apologize, you\u0027re right, they must have changed the aerospike in a more recent version.

I had no trouble getting to orbit from sea level on Eve, my trouble was with landing safely on Eve - I always had trouble with re-entry tearing up my large ships. But my launches worked fine if I hyperedited the ship to the surface. I was also trying to get all 4 of my orange suit kerbals there and back too, so that necessitated a bigger design. This has always been such a great challenge in this game that it always seems to suck me back in from time to time to try it over and over again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
