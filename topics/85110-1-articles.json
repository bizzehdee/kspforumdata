However i am expencting that in 1 week ( time warp or normal play ) they will visibly drift a prity big distance jus becouse game engine rounding ( in calc. or on save file ). But let\u0027s see if they will drift or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway in reality there are many other intercations with a satellite ( n-body physics , solar explosions , etc etc ) which are NOT taken in calc. in KSP so if the oribtal period is the same they should not drift but they do.
