So, the probe would be an artificial comet, with instrumental module in the rear side.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA mirror front surface is a must have just because any \u0022dark\u0022, non-reflecting spot would be getting warmed much faster than the surface around it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, the probe\u00A0would start locally melting faster than when its fron surface is a mirror.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, as the pass lasts enough long the probe in whole would anyway get a near-equilibrium temperature.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt can redistribute it with combination of a front mirror and rear radiators/ablators, but as the probe itself should\u00A0solid, at least one part of the craft (between the solid probe and non-solid\u00A0\u0022heat exhauster\u0022) should be heated up to the equilibrium temperature.
