In a nutshell: it makes science gathering with unmanned more practical, makes the science lab a bit more useful and returning science to Kerbin is no longer the only viable option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECrew \u0026amp; EVA Reports\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe base value of both types of reports has been dropped a bit. This was done so that a certain area isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t fully \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153scienced\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 on the first try. This means you can either transmit the data and collect the remainder then or you can have another spacecraft pick up the remaining science. This also makes often visited places like low Kerbin orbit a bit more interesting, as there might still be some small bits of science left. The most important change is that Crew Reports in low orbits are now biome specific, while EVA Reports no longer are. This removes the annoying get-out-of-the-pod-click-on-EVA-report-and-climb-back-in and replaces it with something that works a little more intuitive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExperiments\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the experiments now have a base value that is around \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BE of the science cap, to achieve the same effect as the Reports. The experiments have had their values changed the most, to create a more logical increase in reward vs. the amount of data it has to send (and thus how much electricity it costs). The small experiments also transmit at 100% now. Gravimetric or temperature data are after all just numbers, which can be easily transmitted. This gives also more use to probes, as they now have more science to gain from experiments that they can perform. It also cuts down on the necessity to bring all spacecraft back for maximum science. The Temperature Scan now also works in outer space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA modified version of the MastCam by Sethnizzle (see thread for license) has been added, which allows for remote EVA reports but less efficient than a manned EVA report. This allows probes to be more useful but without removing the advantage of manned expeditions. An unmanned surface sample part has also been added, but it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s less efficient than a Kerbal collecting samples. A third new part performs a special orbital science experiment called Surface Mapping. This biome-specific experiment creates a use for satellites. Both of these parts\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 models were graciously provided by Frizzank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMobile Processing Lab\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make the Lab more competitive with returning experiment results back to Kerbin, the transmission boost has been raised from 1.5 to 5. To make the science lab a bit more difficult to haul around, the mass has been increased to that of two Hitchhiker pods (which are about the same size as one Lab). The Lab now also has an interior, that of the Hitchhiker. There\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s now place for four Kerbals, although only two are still necessary to enable the Lab\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s function.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOther Changes\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe antennas have been balanced and the placement of the science experiments on the tech tree has also been redone. The experiments with the lower payouts (such as the thermometer) now come before the ones that get a lot of sciene (such as the Materials Bay). The Hitchhiker pod has now been given a special space-based experiment, which makes it a worthy addition to any space station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mod also contains an optional mini-mod that changes the way solar panels work. They now more closely follow the inverse square law, which means they receive more realistic amounts of sunlight at various distances from the Sun. Instead of them working perfectly far beyond Eeloo, solar panels are now practical only to around Dres\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 orbit.
