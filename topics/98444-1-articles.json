Also some of the edge smoothing is lost on the tubing around the bells and the cylinders under the engine. All appears normal when in game though. Any idea what is causing this? I only have the texture set as KSP/Diffuse in Unity atm, since I still have some texturing work to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing I noticed is that the grey bits (text, creases, etc.) seem to be a bit washed out and pink-ish...is this due to the MBM format?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RFSrRhJ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RFSrRhJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-07T21:34:59Z\u0022 title=\u002202/07/2015 09:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Quiznos323\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bac9","CreatedById":57757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-01T21:29:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the first issue, no idea, but make sure you don\u0027t have Kronal Vessel Viewer installed, it can cause similar issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the second issue, those are DXT compression artifacts and they are completely unavoidable no matter the source format.

I\u0027m pretty sure I did everything in Unity/texturing the same as previous parts. I\u0027ll put it into another KSP install and see if it does the same thing. And I guess I will just have to live with the texture compression since I can\u0027t help it, like you said xD\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Installed into a new KSP and it is still doing it, so idk what is happening.. It seems as though the shadows cast by artificial light sources are not fading correctly, and instead create a very firm line. It does the same with the light on the tower on the launch pad, and parts that emit light, but the shadows from the sun seem to be perfectly fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit 2: I fixed the issue by re-importing my mesh with the setting \u0022calculate normals\u0022 instead of \u0022import normals\u0022 and now it looks fine. I was pulling my hair out trying to figure out what in the heck was causing it, but that little detail was what fixed it. So, tip for everyone who happens to read this, make sure you calculate normals on import, else suffer weird shadows and buggy spec maps like I did haha.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-07T21:34:38Z\u0022 title=\u002202/07/2015 09:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Quiznos323\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
