My plan is to circumnavigate Kerbin by boat, except for the minimum land crossing required due to the big continent that goes pole-to-pole. I\u0027ve developed a vehicle that appears to have a reasonable chance of success with this in a reasonable amount of time. However, because boating avoids most of the problems associated with rovering, I\u0027m afraid it might \u0022break the spirit of the rules\u0022 so I\u0027d like approval before I get underway.\n\nHere is my creation, the Electro-Boat Mk 2.\n\n[![17955292992_24761e0829_z.jpg](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8778/17955292992_24761e0829_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/tmDz47)\n\nIt\u0027s mostly Firespitter parts: pontoons, electric props, cockpit, and crew cabin. The curved solar cells are from Near Future. I used TweakScale to shrink a Mk 1 fuselage to 0.625m for the engine nacelle, and it\u0027s got Surface Lights for the required navigation lights.\n\nThe Firespitter pontoons not only float it, but have retractable rover wheels making the Electro-Boat quite amphibious, with a top speed of 29m/s on level ground using the wheels (90m/s using the props). The electric props consume lots of power, hence lots of solar cells. The Near Future curved panels are intended to wrap around 2.5m tanks and seem to work quite well--no battery draining at full power, at least at the equator.\n\n[![17335823904_6170369afe_z.jpg](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5466/17335823904_6170369afe_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/spUCtA)\n\nWith both props running, top water speed is 50m/s. The pontoons have built-in rudders and the whole thing is rock-solid on course at 4x physical warp. This is where I\u0027m thinking this might be considered a bit lame for this challenge. Oceans are perfectly flat so I can just point the thing in the desired direction, crank it up to 4x warp, and go do something else while it crosses an ocean. Because it\u0027s using actual engines instead of rover wheels, I don\u0027t even need to hold a key down for this, just set it on full throttle. And being electric, there\u0027s no need to refuel. Is this OK or not?\n\nAnyway, the Electro-Boat has a crew of 2:\n\n[![17772149299_ab158d9a32_z.jpg](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8790/17772149299_ab158d9a32_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/t5sUPe)\n\nThe plan is to cruise during the day and park on the beach at night (so I can save the game and plant flags). The rear cabin is the sleeping compartment.\n\nThis is my proposed route:\n\n[![17958388475_6c5776d0ef_z.jpg](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5323/17958388475_6c5776d0ef_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/tmVrev)\n\nI haven\u0027t yet decided on whether to go east because we launch facing that way, or west for longer daylight runs.\n\nThe main challenge I foresee is of course the land crossing, when all the problems with rovers will be in play. However, not only is the chosen crossing spot reasonably flat, but it\u0027s got a chain of big lakes across it. Assuming they\u0027re not bounded by cliffs, I can minimize the amount of time spent on dangerous dry ground at low speed. However, this crossing point is at 47^N, which might adversely affect the power. I might have to go on just 1 engine up there. Should this be a problem, I can try crossing further south.\n\nAnyway, that\u0027s my plan. I intend to do this in my ongoing main game save because I\u0027ve for 46 days to wait there before I can launch my Jool flotilla, and this will help pass some of the time constructively without wasting it with warping.\n\nWhat say you?

All navigation is purely dead reckoning off the navball and in tests across the ocean east of KSC, I\u0027ve noticed the boat will drift slightly off course over time, requiring a correction every few minutes. MJ\u0027s rover autopilot doesn\u0027t work without wheels to steer with and I don\u0027t even have a waypoint creator to give me a target icon on the navball. Thus, on ocean crossings, I have to guesstimate my heading from the map, let it run a ways keeping it pointed that direction, check the map, adjust, etc., as the thing is out of sight of land most of the time. And on legs when I\u0027ll be following the coastline, I\u0027ll have to make sure I don\u0027t run aground as new headlands come up over the horizon.\n\nSo yes, it does require continuous monitoring and periodic input from the player. It\u0027s just not the constant struggle with alertness required when driving over land. No finding practicable ways up steep hills or safe ways down them, no worries about hitting a bump and flipping out, etc. So I can feel safe leaving it going full blast while I get refreshments or even check my email in another window, and the worst that will happen is I go slightly off course. In this way, boating is rather easier to do than roving, although it\u0027s rather more boring because of the lack of scenery. It\u0027s this lack of the constant fear of disaster lurking over every hill that made me ask whether this was legal or not.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E If I could ever get this thing above 17 m/s, I was hoping to sail around Kerbin...\n\n17m/s = 33 knots. That\u0027s a world record for a square-rigged ship. Not bad at all ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif).\n\nI once had dreams of \u0022rowing\u0022 a boat all around Kerbin. I made a boat powered by the ladder glitch that would do 28m/s. However, the ladder glitch doesn\u0027t work very well with physical warp---power decreases by the warp factor, and with the loss of power comes loss of speed. It thus took less realtime to go a given distance in 1x time than it did to warp at any level. BOOOORRRRRRIIIINNNNNGGGGG!!!!! So I ended up just settling for making it to Airbase Island ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)."},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T23:16:21Z","Content":"[Part 4 of my Mun circumnavigation.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121720-Circumnavigation-of-the-Mun?p=1963955#post1963955)\n\nHalfway done now!"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T05:07:13Z","Content":"[I started my attempt on Kerbin by boat.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122380-Ore-Travelling-Circus-02-Episode-1-1st-Jool-Flotilla-Launch?p=1964455\u0026viewfull=1#post1964455). This stage began with dire portents and ended on a cliff-hanger, but all turned out well in the end.\n\nI decided the name Electro-Boat\u0022 was rather lame so, in keeping with my usual naming conventions, I decidded to call it the ECK-1 VACUOUS (Elcano Challenge, Kerbin #1 -- Very Ambitious Circumnavigator Upon Oceans and Up Shores). No disrespect to the challenge by that name. I name all my stuff disparagingly like that. Other ship names I\u0027ve used (and will probably use again) included LOSER, JERK, FOOL, VAPID, etc. It\u0027s a strange result of translating Old Kerbish into English ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
