Other times, there are constraints that automatics can\u0027t deal with, for example a ship with a probe core but little electricity storage which can only manoeuvre under sunlight, or trying to dock with very little monopropelant left or even having to use RCS to return from an elliptic Minmus orbit after running out of LFO.\n\nWhen this happens, it\u0027s pretty useful to know how to correct and finalise a failed manoeuvre yourself, divide a manoeuvre into multiple parts or simply how to use unusual forms of propulsion to achieve something.\n\nThat said, doing the 100th lift from Kerbin using a tried and true lifter subassembly with a payload below its max is something best left to automatics."},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T18:19:16Z","Content":"I have done everything without Mechjeb ...

I installed MJ later because KER was not available anymore, and now i use only MJ and not KER. I liked KER, because it shows you about the same datas than MJ, but without any autopilot, so i had to learn every maneuvers without autopilot.\n\nAfter about 1000hours in KSP, i decided to install MJ, and now, i use the autopilot....for some maneuvers, because i became a bit lazy :\n\n-I use maneuver planning to create my nodes, but i often rework them to get the proper inclination when entering the other body\u0027s SOI\n\n-I use docking autopilot sometimes, for huge vessels, but anyway with some designs, MJ doesn\u0027t manage to dock when i manage to do it. Anyway, i am consuming far less monoprop when i dock myself.\n\n-Never used taking off/landing assist so i can\u0027t tell if they\u0027re right or wrong. I often land using ScanSAT within a 20m accuracy (to dock ground stations together)\n\n-I use a lot smart A.S.S. to keep the proper direction, because long burn are often boring (even while warping x2, for huge vessel i don\u0027t warp more than x2 while burning). Smart A.S.S. is an autopilot, but you have to tell him where to go. Now, i am using smart A.S.S. as vanilla commands and i know enough to correct some trajectories without any node planning (i use to meet the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn or Minmus without creating any node, just burning prograde at the right time until i meet the body, if i am too far away, i manage to correct it on-the-fly without nodes too, just push target \u002B and target retrograde ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) )\n\nI personally don\u0027t like to have some computer realizing a maneuver if i don\u0027t understand it myself. I think I should use autopilot only if i can realize the same maneuver without it, but that\u0027s my playstyle, i can\u0027t judge people using it for realizing maneuvers they don\u0027t manage to do."},{"CreatedByName":"michaelhester07","CreatedById":96470,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T18:54:55Z","Content":"Everything except gravity assists as I don\u0027t know how to do those.

It got better when it started making maneuver nodes. Then you could really see what it was doing.\n\nSome things like docking or space plane landings since those are kinda hit and miss with MJ, I do manually just cause it is easier. Launches, I let Jeb do it cause it is just easier. Over 2-3 years now, i\u0027ve manually flown to orbit enough times that it\u0027s kinda tedious to me.

I suck at precision landings.\n\n MJ really isn\u0027t that bad, when you play on career you pretty much have to do everything at least once before you get enough science to unlock the module needed to fly automatically.

I spoke to a friend who told me I needed to hit within 100m if I wanted to dock, what I didn\u0027t get (and the wiki didn\u0027t make clear) was that I could just get in the right neighbourhood, and then get closer afterwards.
