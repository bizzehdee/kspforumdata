I figure the best way to go about it at the fastest time is a ship that can boost constantly, both to and fro. I\u0027m still experimenting to make that happen, and I\u0027m trying really really hard to NOT use atomics or the new big stacks and engines, but that\u0027s what I\u0027m going for.\n\nSide note: Decided that I\u0027d probably yet again need custom seperatrons. So I pulled my old design out of my dusty mental filing cabinet, and did a few changes.\n\n![38178B938BB2F2757A3F57E5A4C2A84DB5BA6570](http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/710781191330530255/38178B938BB2F2757A3F57E5A4C2A84DB5BA6570/)\n\n80kn seperatron.
