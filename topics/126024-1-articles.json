{"TopicId":126024,"ForumId":148,"TopicTitle":"Forum Migration Nov 27th!","CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T00:01:03Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T00:01:03Z","Content":"\nHi [s]Bob[/s] everyone!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOver the past weeks we\u0026#39;ve taken big steps in preparation of migrating our forums from the vBulletin platform to the IPS 4 platform. We\u0026#39;re now at a point where we\u0026#39;ve tested our processes and can set a date for the conversion. The conversion will start [U]Friday November 27th, at 09:00 UTC[/U] and is scheduled to last between 30 and 40 hours depending on how much - if any - sleep we get and how smoothly the process will go. Once the update starts the forums will be unavailable until the migration is completed.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSeveral forums will be merged into others, for example a few inactive language-specific forums which will disappear and their contents will be reposted to the general \u0026#39;International\u0026#39; forum. The same goes for the Live From Mission Control forum which will be merged into the Fan Works forum. Apart from merging forums a few will also be moved around. Note that [B]not all data will be transferred to the new forums[/B], so please back up the following if you wish to repost it after the migration:\u003Cbr\u003E\n[LIST]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[*][B]BLOGS[/B] will not be converted because we\u0026#39;ve chosen not to use that particular feature any longer. \u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]The [B]Rocket Builders[/B] forum and its contents won\u0026#39;t return. \u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]For now we won\u0026#39;t have support for the [B]Livestreaming Calendar[/B] on the new forums, but we\u0026#39;ll work to get that back if possible. \u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]Information about [B]Friends[/B] may be lost in the database transfer. \u003Cbr\u003E\n[/LIST]\u003Cbr\u003E\nOf course, there\u0026#39;s good technical reasons to migrate to IPS 4, but everyone will notice some vastly improved functionality as well, some highlights:\u003Cbr\u003E\n[LIST]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]Get notified when someone responds to you (quotes you) \u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]The critical addition of some Kerbal themed emoticons, and support for emojis \u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]Full functionality when browsing with mobile devices \u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]Tag people in your posts \u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]Easily keep track of threads you\u0026#39;ve started or that you\u0026#39;ve followed, with a ton of notification options to choose from \u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]Easily quote sections of a post simply by selecting them with your mouse \u003Cbr\u003E\n[/LIST]\u003Cbr\u003E\nThose are the most important things about the update, please leave a reply if you have any questions. Of course we encourage you to join us on our official IRC chat or any other place to interact with the community during the transfer :)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[U]Update Nov 21st ~19:50 UTC[/U]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nA lot of people seem to respond to this thread without reading the prior posts and discussions, leading to a lot of repeat questions and misinformation. I\u0026#39;ll quickly reiterate a few points:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[LIST]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]A backup of the current forum will be available to moderators and administrators for a while after the update, if someone is for some reason not able to recover a particular blog/thread we can retrieve it \u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]After some discussion in this thread we\u0026#39;ll (most likely temporarily) keep a read-only version of the Rocket Builders forum available for people who wish to retrieve their content but were unable to at first. This archive will be available to a link which we will post on the new forums. \u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]We love to see people work together to build craft and such, and as long as the roleplay element is remove from the Rocket Builder company threads there\u0026#39;s nothing stopping you from posting these collaborative threads in the new Spacecraft Exchange forum. \u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]Almost all data will be preserved including reputation, custom user titles and signatures. \u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]Though the new forum does not support BB-code for new posts, it will convert existing posts which contain BB-code automatically. \u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]Some links may be broken during the transfer, but I\u0026#39;m looking into how we can avoid this. IPB itself may have a solution as well in the form of support for mod_rewrite. It\u0026#39;s being looked into. \u003Cbr\u003E\n[/LIST]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs for the reason of migrating to different forum software: vBulletin 4 is an aging platform, which only receives legacy support and it\u0026#39;s showing its age in many ways: backend integration of the different systems is poor, security with the vBulletin platform is becoming an increasing concern and the forum lacks support for many modern techniques, requiring quite a few workarounds to get some things working. We have tried updating to vBulletin 5 previously, but that failed hopelessly and wouldn\u0026#39;t take away the security concerns. We\u0026#39;ve compared many forum packages and IPS 4 came out on top both for us on a technical side and for (at least we think) the community as a whole. The new features should allow us to interact with you a lot better, and more. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow time for the stern side of things: I\u0026#39;ve seen quite a few rather disrespectful posts in this thread, both towards other members and towards Squad. These posts will be deleted and the users contacted. We\u0026#39;re open to discussion and criticism on the condition of a constructive attitude and mutual respect, even when you disagree with something.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[/QUOTE]\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-21T19:52:34Z\u0022 title=\u002211/21/2015 07:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KasperVld\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdding information that was spread throughout the thread.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T00:09:10Z","Content":"\nIt\u0026#39;s a shame really, IPS is a downgrade from vBulletin, IMO.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAh well, I don\u0026#39;t really care that much as long as it doesn\u0026#39;t go away for good ;)\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Giggleplex777","CreatedById":29829,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T00:09:36Z","Content":"\nWhy remove rocket builders?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EdusacconBR","CreatedById":135047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T00:10:12Z","Content":"\nwow, im a bit sad that some data will be lost, theres so much amazing stuff arround :l\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T00:12:21Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Giggleplex777\u0027]Why remove rocket builders?[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\nRocket Builders is a place that actually breaks our community rules constantly, in particular the \u0026#39;thou shallt not roleplay\u0026#39; rule.
