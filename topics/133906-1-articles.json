This post isn\u0027t about spaceflight, but more about science. Where do we waste energy most at?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis question is to find out which aspect of our lives consume energy most inefficiently, and if this trend may be true if alien life exists. Share your answers below!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid you mean biologically?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf so, then a big factor in lost energy lies in the size of a person. Heat escapes from your body at a rate depending on your surface area (not your volume), which means larger creatures lose less heat per unit body weight. A mouse eats a quarter of its body weight each day. You? Three to five pounds. Smaller creatures are more wasteful in terms of having to eat more per unit body weight. (and you wondered why Hobbits and dwarves in the LOTR movies eat so much?? it\u0027s because they\u0027re small! it\u0027s science!)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you meant stuff besides biology (i.e. technology)? I can only guess at that, but I can say just about everybody in this thread has it backwards. There\u0027s been a lot of chat about how energy is lost from cars and power plants and such. A thousand years ago, when, say, power plants didn\u0027t exist, humans simply did without. No cell phones, no electric lights, no computers, no Kerbal Space Program chat forum. Then somebody came up with an idea: dig up some coal (which was sitting in the ground doing nothing) build a power plant, burn the coal, boil water, spin a turbine, generate electricity! And suddenly we had energy we didn\u0027t have before. When you \u003Cstrong\u003Ehave more than you did,\u003C/strong\u003E that\u0027s not waste. That\u0027s production.
