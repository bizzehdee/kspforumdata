The Falcon 9 core is barely larger diameter than an intermodal container. In terms of volume the Energia II could certainly take the equivalent, but not in raw dimensions.\n\nAnd powered landing boosters would be quite undesirable for this vehicle. To give some quick numbers, the landing legs \u002B fins of F9R are quoted at two tonnes, an estimated 10% of the stage empty mass. Taking airliner and cargo aircraft as reference, we find that even with very long, high-efficiency wings and very durable landing gear, they\u0027re likely to be less than 10% each, so you could make F9 a flyback booster for under 4 tonnes - possibly around two with high-strength delta wings and optimised landing gear. Only on top of this, even for a barge landing F9R has to reserve 30 tonnes of around 300 to make its powered landing. This means that the boosters are each 32 tonnes heavier at \u0022burnout\u0022 and have 10% less fuel to burn up until this point, whereas a flyback booster is only 4 tonnes heavier and sacrifices no fuel. Considerably higher performance. The disadvantage, and why SpaceX have not pursued this method, is the development cost, as you now need a dual-mode booster rather than simply reverse what the booster would normally do.\n\nThe Russians decided that the flyback booster was worthwhile, should they ever pursue the technology - although in the end they didn\u0027t due to not seeing usefulness in this payload class and reusing such a launcher. That said, they did continue to develop the idea on a smaller scale, and they have the proposed [Baikal booster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baikal_%28rocket_booster%29) available for any future Russian launch vehicles that are on a more sensible scale. SpaceX were unable to pursue this technology path due to the way US funding works, requiring them to get something working fast and simply - although this did help them get working models faster, as they can test the technology very easily and quickly.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T03:58:04Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 03:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Iskierka**"},{"CreatedByName":"cryogen","CreatedById":134454,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T00:57:43Z","Content":"We should rebalance the problem, and make this into a KSP challenge. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nHere\u0027s an idea, what about a spaceplane/rocket hybrid? Put wings and a heat shield around a single engine, so that it becomes an unmanned return-to-launchpad spaceplane. Stack a disposable propellant tank on top of that, and stack your payload on top of the propellant tank, under a standard rocket fairing. And that\u0027s your upper stage. Because the spaceplane doesn\u0027t have to *contain* either a cargo bay, passenger bay, or a propellant tank, it can be much smaller than the shuttle. The main tradeoff is that it can no longer return things from orbit.

On top of those, sits either a reusable cargo bay or a disposable payload holding truss covered by fairings, on top of which sits a Dragon V2-esque crew cabin with hypergolic engines for parachute-assisted propulsive landing that doubles as LES. If using a reusable cargo bay, it reenters separately from the crew cabin, then either glides to a runway via paragliders or lands propulsively with parachute assist.\n\nAll in all, it would probably resemble the old Space Shuttle as much as a pencil resembles a pen.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-17T16:00:38Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2015 04:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by shynung**"},{"CreatedByName":"Emperor of the Titan Squid","CreatedById":158183,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-06T20:21:53Z","Content":"LOX LH2 flyback booster, Hypergolic upper stage, and optional NTR 3rd stage,ought to do it.Also,an MCT capsule for crew.Why does everyone turn their backs on spaceplanes?

For this version, I modified the original design (which had a payload capacity of 60.5 T to LEO) to instead use a 6.5m diameter external tank (the same diameter as the S-IVB, reducing costs for new infrastructure) and slightly shorter, to be only slightly longer than the Shuttle itself. The top of the tank would contain a payload fairing for higher-risk or oversize payloads, like space station modules, or Shuttle-Centaur missions [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaur_%28rocket_stage%29#Shuttle-Centaur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaur_%28rocket_stage%29#Shuttle-Centaur). \n\nMeanwhile, the S-IC would be kept, but with 3-4 F-1A engines instead of 5 for the reduced mass of the upper stages. The center engine would do the reentry and landing burns, before the S-IC propulsively lands on a barge for reuse. This would make use of the extra S-IC performance to reduce the costs of this system (instead of using the hard-to-reuse SRBs). Larger fins may be added to increase this launch system\u0027s stability. \n\nLastly, it can also launch unmanned- as the development money for the SRBs and 8m diameter External Tank is instead of modifying the Shuttle to be unmanned. Ejection seats and pressure suits would always be worn during manned missions. A preliminary launch payload capacity and first launch date of 30T to LEO and 1982-1983.\n\nA heavy-lift version could be made by first dumping S-IC reusability, then removing the Shuttle, instead placing the now air-started SSMEs on the side of the rocket, where the Shuttle was. The payload would be carried in the 6.5 meter diameter fairing, which can be increased to 8 meters if necessary, and would target a payload capacity of 90T to LEO, possibly increasing to 95T with the Centaur-Shuttle upper stage. A larger upper stage, and another F-1A engine added to the core stage, would increase the payload to 130T to LEO.\n\nHow much would thus reduce launch and development costs of the Space Shuttle? Would it work?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-07T05:48:25Z\u0022 title=\u002202/07/2016 05:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by fredinno**"},{"CreatedByName":"fredinno","CreatedById":143381,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-07T05:54:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 5/12/2015 at 0:05 PM, shynung said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Suppose that in the near-future, a space launch service agency/corporation wants to construct a high-capacity semi-(or fully)reusable space launch system, with the following design requirements:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E -60 tons to LEO payload.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E -Staging permitted.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E -No more than 20% of hardware by mass is discarded in each mission. 80% must be recovered.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E -Any discarded hardware must be of low value (spent SRBs, empty fuel tanks sans engine, fairings).\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E -Capable of precision landing.

The top of the tank would contain a payload fairing for higher-risk or oversize payloads, like space station modules, or Shuttle-Centaur missions [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaur_%28rocket_stage%29#Shuttle-Centaur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaur_%28rocket_stage%29#Shuttle-Centaur). \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Meanwhile, the S-IC would be kept, but with 3-4 F-1A engines instead of 5 for the reduced mass of the upper stages. The center engine would do the reentry and landing burns, before the S-IC propulsively lands on a barge for reuse. This would make use of the extra S-IC performance to reduce the costs of this system (instead of using the hard-to-reuse SRBs).

The payload would be carried in the 6.5 meter diameter fairing, which can be increased to 8 meters if necessary, and would target a payload capacity of 90T to LEO, possibly increasing to 95T with the Centaur-Shuttle upper stage. A larger upper stage, and another F-1A engine added to the core stage, would increase the payload to 130T to LEO.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E How much would thus reduce launch and development costs of the Space Shuttle?
