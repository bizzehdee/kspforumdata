Systematic position and value are not synonymous. Pluto has value created from its observations and because of its unique position in apparently variable gravitation circumstances in the solar system (both a transneptunian planet and a member of the Kuiper belt). If we are to return to pluto its going to because of its interesting qualities, had it been another gassy planet Neptune it would not be near as interesting. I think what New Horizons teaches us that a low resolution view of something could reveal anything from a Ceres like planet to the strange thing everyone gasp at when they saw the high resolution images for the first time. Pluto basically tells us that we need to invest more in space astronomy and in observation missions around the solar system. If such objects exist in the Kuiper belt there are probably a few comets that wander in and out of the solar system that are equally interesting. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd more to the point Pluto basically is now the Epic dwarf planet, its the champion for the exploration of the Kuiper belt.
