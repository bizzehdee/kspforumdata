Everything else about the engine works, functionality-wise, it\u0027s just blue. The blue glow is on all the time though - shut down and stopped on the ground, full thrust in either engine mode, or anywhere in between. I can\u0027t find the cause anywhere in the cfg (which is the only thing that\u0027s changed between the time it was normal to the time it started glowing.. Haven\u0027t messed with the model or anything.. ) Where did this come from and how do I remove it?\n\nVisual Representation of my struggles:\n\n![Untitled.png](http://s2.postimg.org/ko5jo6pcp/Untitled.png)\n\nHere\u0027s the full cfg, because at this point I\u0027d believe you if you told me it was because of angularDrag. This shouldn\u0027t be as difficult as it\u0027s being..\n\n    PART{    name = turboFanEngine    module = Part    author = C.
