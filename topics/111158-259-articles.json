I know this from *experience*, the great teacher of all things. There are two other forums I use that also use this same software (Invision). One allows the user to change their own name, the other follows similar protocols as we do here. And that\u0027s the one where I had no notification the user name had changed (from the old one - alanaeas to adsii1970).\n\n1. When you log in, simply click the link that says \u0022forgot user name/password\u0022 and it takes you to a screen where you must enter the email address you used when you first created your original account. Enter the password, click submit.\n2. Check that email. It will contain your user name and a link to reset your password. If you need to reset your password, then do so.\n    - **If you do not need to reset your password and just needed to find out if your user name was changed, then go to step 3.**\n    - **If you need to reset your password, follow the instructions contained within the forum software. It is literally step-by-step instructions.**\n3. Go to the forum login screen, enter the shown user name and your password. You\u0027re back in. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 43 minutes ago, Gargamel said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E We have a much longer list of higher priority items than something that will happen only once to a user and only when they request it to happen.\n\u003E \n\n[@Gargamel](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/64714-gargamel/) is correct in this. None of the moderation team are paid; we are all volunteers. Right now, my life has been completely turned upside down, shaken up, and then dropped on the floor. What began as an easy semester with three undergraduate classes at a local community college, two graduate classes at a local university, and 25 advisees (students who I advise on their academic endeavors) has turned into a living nightmare. I now am advising 37 students and have picked up an additional graduate course in U.S. Constitutional History since the tenured professor quit in the middle of the term. I am now averaging about 60 to 70  hours a week working in my vocation.\n\nThe time I have on the forum has gone from about five hours each day to maybe an hour and a half - if I am lucky. Last week I was only able to get on the forum for a total of 3 hours for the entire week. While I cannot speak for other members of the moderation team, I place my focus on the things that are the most important for the community. Not too long ago, in this very thread, someone commented about the lack of spam and spambots - and we do not use any automated process but the human process. We operate as a team, we discuss what we do. We need a balanced approach and we are all passionate about our love for the forum community and our service given to it. Consider us the forum equivalent of the Vatican\u0027s Swiss Guard - except y\u0027all are who we serve, we protect the integrity of the forum, and we don\u0027t get paid (wait, does that mean that [@Ghostii_Space](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/218794-ghostii_space/) is the commandant of the Forum guard?).  ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif \u0022:cool:\u0022)\n\n![giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/deR32LdMuvIfZDheOL/giphy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Rutabaga22","CreatedById":221143,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-04T01:31:06Z","Content":"What are the rules for posts on my profile?
