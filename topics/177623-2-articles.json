though I think I prefer the old helmets.\u00A0 Seeing kerbals in the dark (e.g. when they\u0027re EVA, clambering around a ship, etc.) can be tricky, sometimes-- the high-contrast stripes on the big helmet have always helped me spot them.\u00A0 Plus it shows up nicely even when zoomed out a fair amount.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m fine with either the two-color or the three-color

simple way to do that would be if they got different \u0022secondary\u0022 colors, i.e. they\u0027re all white, but the helmet-stripe color and trim color is different per profession (e.g. red = pilot, green = engineer, blue = scientist, or whatever).\u00A0 Having two tones would be more amenable to that than three.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EModdability:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 I think lots of players would probably want to be able to distinguish the professions, but not everyone\u0027s going to agree on which color should be which, and no matter what you pick it would be \u0022wrong\u0022 for someone.\u00A0 So making it nicely tweakable/moddable would help a lot with this.\u00A0 Here\u0027s a thought:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nHave a set of N textures to choose from.\u00A0 Ideally the stock textures would differ only in some minor detail like \u0022stripe color\u0022, so having N suits doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027ll take N times the artist\u0027s time, since they\u0027re mostly just copies of each other.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHave some config somewhere that maps texture to profession.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHave a moddable module somewhere that has a function which is basically, \u0022given \u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;crew member\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E, pick \u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;texture ID\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E\u0022.\u00A0 The default implementation is to read it from the aforementioned config.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nNow it\u0027s really easy and flexible at different levels depending on how much effort modders want to put into it.\u00A0 Some sample scenarios:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nYou like all the textures, but just want to switch which profession is which because \u0022Nooooo, I\u0027m a Trekkie and engineers are supposed to be RED!\u0022 or whatever?\u00A0 Easy, just tweak the config with a ModuleManager patch.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou want to add additional textures to the game and give an alternate choice for engineer?\u00A0 Just create your own texture, put it somewhere so that the game knows about it, and add config to point \u0022engineer\u0022 at the new texture.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou\u0027re writing a mod that adds additional profession types to the game?\u00A0 No problem, it\u0027s the same deal as #2 above.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou\u0027re getting fancy-shmancy and you want to do something really custom like make some procedural decision at run time which suit they get, based on some state that your mod adds to the game?\u00A0 You just add some code that overrides the \u0022\u0022given \u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;crew member\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E, pick \u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;texture ID\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 function, so that instead of following the config file, you can do whatever custom decision-making code you like in order to pick which texture you
