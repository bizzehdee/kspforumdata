So the only way the issue you\u0027re seeing should happen is if the transmitter wobbles outside the fairing at the same time as you\u0027re ditching a stage. FAR isn\u0027t calculating if something is inside the fairing every single frame, that would add lots of vector math, comparisons and iterating through part lists that are simply unnecessary. Try right-clicking on the transmitter and making sure that it stays \u0022isShielded = true\u0022 the whole way, since that needs to be false in order for FAR to apply drag parameters; it acts the same as FAR detecting zero density and it simply stops running the rest of the code at that point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the payload is wobbling too much, I\u0027d make sure you\u0027re running KJR v2.0 rather than an earlier version if you don\u0027t want to wait until the official joint fixes.
