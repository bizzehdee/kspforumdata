Und it looks absolutisch \u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCber kool.\n\n*Inspired by the Messerschmitt Me 262.*\n\nOperational Guide\n\n**Takeoff**\n\nAlthough it is necessary to rotate with precaution on takeoff, the craft is remarkably stable on the runway and almost takes off on its own.\n\n**Flight**\n\nThe Ke 262 is not very maneuverable, but is easy and intuitive to fly. \n\n**Landing**\n\nApproach the runway at between 80-120 m/s and attempt to land as horizontally as possible with minimum flair. Owing to the excellent handling characteristics of the Ke 262, this is not very difficult. Be as gentle as possible, but keep in mind that the airframe does tolerate some moderately rough landings.\n\nLink\n\n[http://kerbal.curseforge.com/shareables/232165-kesserschmitt-ke-262-stock-replica](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/shareables/232165-kesserschmitt-ke-262-stock-replica)\n\nAlb\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCm\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
