Fuel tanks and engines are so much heavier that dont matter what I put in the front of the plane its always out of balance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe I need more tech? But idk, if the contracts are open since the beginning it should be easy, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm pretty sure that even with only a few aerodynamics parts I have enough control. Only that center of mass... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fuel tanks need to be in the center of the plane. That way, as the fuel drains the CoM doesn\u0027t shift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E After that, it\u0027s a straightforward \u0022weight moment\u0022 problem. You can counter-balance a heavy chunk (like an engine) with an equal mass at the same distance or a lighter mass at a farther distance. 1/2 the mass and twice the distance will balance perfectly, or 1/10 the mass at 10x the distance, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E You multiply the mass by the distance for each part, then add and subtract these products to get zero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So without using the lift/mass markers (you should always use lift/mass markers), it\u0027s still possible to eyeball a balanced design. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The wings provide lift at the point where they attach, so that\u0027s also easy to eyeball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If worst comes to worst, you can fulcrum- balance a design by building it without the wings and placing a control surface under the fuel tank to act as a fulcrum. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch/ check the balance/ recover/ adjust until it balances. I used to do that for my ion gliders back in the day, which were extremely large and could not use control surfaces due to the rules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g13/GoSlash27/KSP/balance1_zps734e61b9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022balance1_zps734e61b9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHTHs,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Slashy\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-31T00:06:35Z\u0022 title=\u002212/31/2014 12:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 31, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by GoSlash27\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-31T00:22:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00225thHorseman\u0022 data-cite=\u00225thHorseman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo when you filter in the VAB by tier 0 you don\u0027t get any parts?\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell there isn\u0027t a tier 0 to filter by, the filter starts with 1.
