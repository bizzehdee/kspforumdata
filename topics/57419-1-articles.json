Unknown to the outsiders, the RAPIER on this classified prototype is not the same engine used for orbital insertion, nor for space propulsion. The RAPIER\u0027s space capability is switched off. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E By doing this, rather than twin Turbos or Turbo\u002BAerospike, the craft realizes a noticeable fuel savings.
