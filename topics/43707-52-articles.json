If it sets \u0022done\u0022 to true once or does so 100 times the effect is that same in the end. So this has been happening all along and we didn\u0027t notice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis goes back to a comment I made a long time ago in this thread about how we don\u0027t REALLY have the ability to set up a trigger that re-executes EACH time a condition is true. This practice of putting an ON inside a loop is NOT enough to fix that problem, as it creates this new problem of clogging the mod with zillions of redundant pointless trigger hooks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think we really could use a way to differentiate \u0022EACH TIME X is true do Y\u0022 from \u0022JUST THE NEXT TIME X is true do Y just once\u0022. in the language.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the meantime, I *THINK* this might fix the problem (I don\u0027t have KSP running right now so I can\u0027t test it.

I originally was using Remotech 2 for playtesting, and found out quickly it was causing the problem where typing in the kOS window would react to the rocket (such as staging). It still happens from time to time after I took RT2 off, but not nearly as often, and usually if I click out of the kOS window and back into it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
