Friction is an constant and its low compared to the jet engines so the only way to stop the plane is to use the energy elsewhere. I can not see any other sinks for the energy than the rotation energy of the wheels.   \n\nSo yes two jet engines is now used only to spin up three wheels with an total weight of say 60 Kg, just accelerating them would give 350g force, however the heaviest part of the wheels are metal rim and brakes. closer to the center of rotation while the outer rubber part is very light so it would probably over 1000 g acceleration. \n\nObliviously you can not accelerate an  real world treadmill track with 350g, it would snap, you could not even spin up an superconducting electrical motor so fast.   \n\nSo assume an ideal treadmill, this would also assume ideal wheels who would not disintegrate because of centrifugal forces nor overheat.   \n\nSame is true for the treadmill. But as the wheels has mass who must be accelerated so does the treadmill, the treadmill also has to accelerate an far higher mass.   \n\nI can demand that the treadmill is either of the conveyor belt type or is an rotating plate so large the plane can takeoff from it with no problems.   \n\nIf so I win because of relativity ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-05T20:49:08Z","Content":"And here I am, thinking such a universal answer would stop the flood...\n\nDoesn\u0027t really work isn\u0027t it.\n\n![standards.png](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-06-05T20:49:20Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2018 08:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by YNM**"},{"CreatedByName":"Gordon Fecyk","CreatedById":157121,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-06T13:19:08Z","Content":"[@DAL59](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/180784-dal59/) [@magnemoe](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57801-magnemoe/) I made sure the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E and acceleration of both craft (platform and aircraft) were as close to equal as possible, which you can observe using the Kerbal Engineer display, to eliminate the \u0027accelerating treadmill\u0027 and \u0027ideal conveyor belt.\u0027 I used rockets instead of jets to eliminate jet spool-up delay.
