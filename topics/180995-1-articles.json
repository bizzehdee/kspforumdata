I have to right-click on the probe core for the nav-ball to control properly. It\u0027s not an urgent problem with me, since a rover just lays there and it\u0027s not hard to click on, but I can see how you don\u0027t have that luxury with a\u00A0cruise missile. That\u0027s what I would try first to fix it- make the root part of your missile the probe core before putting it in the part library, and then attach it from there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-31T05:32:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK, Mr. GoatRider makes a good point.
