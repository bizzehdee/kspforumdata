And again and again. \n\nIs there some way to enable temps in the debug menu once. And have it remember that I want it on, every time?\n\ni mean it\u0027s pretty stupid that you have to go into a DEBUG menu (not a normal menu) to enable something you should always have. \n\nEspecially since in 1.0.4 heating has become a very important part of the game. \n\nI know I could get a mod. But why? Why do I have to get a mod for the simplest things in ksp?\n\nalso non of the mods out there show the information better then the ksp debug way. \n\nI have a mod that shows external temps of parts. That was all you needed before. \n\nBut now internal temps are arguably more important.\n\nand there is a mod that shows the single hottest parts temp. Again not good enough. \n\nso I guess my question is. . . Is there a way to force ksp to show internal and external temps from the debug menu without having to go into the debug menu every single time I load up ksp?\n\nis there a config file that I could edit to achieve this?\n\nthanks."}]}
