And again and again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there some way to enable temps in the debug menu once. And have it remember that I want it on, every time?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei mean it\u0027s pretty stupid that you have to go into a DEBUG menu (not a normal menu) to enable something you should always have. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEspecially since in 1.0.4 heating has become a very important part of the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know I could get a mod. But why? Why do I have to get a mod for the simplest things in ksp?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso non of the mods out there show the information better then the ksp debug way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a mod that shows external temps of parts. That was all you needed before. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now internal temps are arguably more important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand there is a mod that shows the single hottest parts temp. Again not good enough. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso I guess my question is. . . Is there a way to force ksp to show internal and external temps from the debug menu without having to go into the debug menu every single time I load up ksp?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eis there a config file that I could edit to achieve this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
