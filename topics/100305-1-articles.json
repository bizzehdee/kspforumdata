They just buck wildly and go crazy constantly. What\u0027s the workaround for that? I tried using the inline reaction wheel but it didn\u0027t really make a measurable difference. Is there some advanced automated SAS in the tech tree somewhere that I should research before I can start doing satellite missions?\n\nMy other problem appears to be a bug, but it may be working as intended and I\u0027m just missing some vital detail. My piloted ships will fly fine, presumably because piloted ships are automatically given SAS. However, after I complete an EVA, say, a moon landing, the ship stops acting as if its piloted and begins bucking wildly out of control like it does with satellites. This has so far ruined two otherwise perfect moon missions because of the sheer amount of fuel wasted trying to get the ship to fly in a straight line for any length of time. How do I fix this/work around this? It\u0027s pretty frustrating.\n\n(PS, while I\u0027m here, how do I get the maneuver mode these days? I can\u0027t find it and I miss it. Did they remove it?)"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T14:10:30Z","Content":"SASless flight of rockets is indeed hard.

The ship just goes wild whenever I try to take off of Mun or whatever. Could there be some other reason why my ship is losing control on Mun when it made it up there fine?

You need to command SAS on after your pilot gets back into the ship, just as you do on the launchpad during preflight.\n\nAlso, in regards satellites (this was alluded to in an earlier response, but it should be stated explicitly): As of 0.90, the Stayputnik (the first and most primitive probe core) does not have SAS circuitry/programming built into it--it\u0027s basically a radio relay that lets you pilot the vehicle completely manually. A few people welcome this as a challenge to their piloting skills, but most of the community consider the Stayputnik to be nerfed into unusability. The usual tactic seems to be to avoid unkerballed satellites/probes until a better, SAS-capable, probe core is available."},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T18:53:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yeah I figured that\u0027s how it was supposed to work, but it seems like SAS isn\u0027t turning back on when my Kerbal gets back in the seat.

It would turn on, but it wouldn\u0027t provide ANY input to stabilize the heading. Restarting KSP cleared that issue. I haven\u0027t seen it happen since.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The usual tactic seems to be to avoid unkerballed satellites/probes until a better, SAS-capable, probe core is available.\n\nWaiting an entire tier. The OCTO core is literally just one step above the Stayputnik.\n\nThat being said, Squad really phoned in the command pod/probe core stuff. I\u0027d love to be able to add/remove features to pods and cores with tweakables after unlocking upgraded components from the tech tree (ex. upon unlocking advanced flight control, all probes and capsules can then have a SAS module added to them for 50kg extra mass, and as progression increases, the mass penalty goes down and the option for additional features goes up)"}]}
