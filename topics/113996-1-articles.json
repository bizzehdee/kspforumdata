It had parts from the SCANsat mod and the 1.25m rocket cargohold from another mod I can\u0027t recall (modular rockets, I think?). Anyway, my AP would constantly change whenever the ship was under 1x time warp. Even if I would \u0022freeze\u0022 it by going to 2x warp and then came down to 1x warp, it still would change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought it could be maybe the deployed parts from SCANsat somehow applying some kind of force on the ship, but I think it\u0027s actually more likely parts wobbling within the cargo-bay, because apparently even a tiny amount of wobble can actually cause the ship to move (not just rotate).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, probably a bug due to wobble, so once again we can all thank Unity4\u0027s joints.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T16:51:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBy any chance, do you use the claw for anything, ever, anywhere?
