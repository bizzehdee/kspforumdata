Basically I\u0027m a new Dev but a scientist. I\u0027ve been wanting to test out my mod abilities and am wondering if anyone needs a Fairings design or a Cover up. If you don\u0027t know what I\u0027m talking about then its the BIG shell thingy that surrounds a lander and you decouple it in space. I can make it ANY way you want . Skinny. Weird. Tall. Fat.

As for your offer it\u0027s a very nice one, but people have created tools to do this automatically, such as nhnIfong\u0027s Fairing Factory, which you can find at \u003Ca href=\u0022http://nathannifong.com/FairingFactory/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://nathannifong.com/FairingFactory/\u003C/a\u003E and the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/39512\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EProcedural Fairings\u003C/a\u003E mod \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EatVacuum","CreatedById":72754,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-30T00:35:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are lots of people looking for devs to build addons they\u0027d like to see, and devs who can code but need someone to build their models. So while that other response is true and we don\u0027t necessarily need fairings there\u0027s tons of stuff you could sink your teeth into.
