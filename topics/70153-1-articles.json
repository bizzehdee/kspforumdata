The payload is loaded into a transport vehicle at the start of the track which has little more than a beefed up heat shield and ballast tanks to add mass if the payload is underweight. it also has a small liquid fueled rocket to enable it to circularize and some RCS thrusters to assist with docking. The transport vehicle is designed to be very aerodynamically efficient and stable in order to minimize drag. Then bang, the payload is accelerated to high enough speeds to both overcome the drag of the atmosphere and to maintain enough speed for a simple circularization burn. So here\u0027s some questions, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERoughly how fast would you need to be traveling to reach orbital speeds AFTER you overcome atmospheric drag and reach orbital altitudes to perhaps rendezvous with a station in space based on a 15 ton craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebased on the described track, how many Gs would the payload need to endure. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally imagine it would be well beyond the realms of possible, even if there was a way to produce enough energy to send 15 tons of payload to several times orbital velocity against air resistance, to do it within just 50km would be a huge explosive release of power, also the heat shielding would need to be made from imaginary materials since the temperatures endured would be far higher than reentry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dkmdlb","CreatedById":70275,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-22T16:00:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHeinlin\u0027s wonderful \u0022The Moon is a Harsh Mistress\u0022 has catapults like this to ferry cargo from the moon to earth, and then at the end, one is built on on earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=1118\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=1118\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sillychris","CreatedById":103939,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-22T16:03:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy limit yourself to one lap?
