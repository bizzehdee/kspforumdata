If the goal is commercialization of HSF, especially in BLEO, then it\u2019s better to have cheap heavy rockets, compared to one ridiculously expensive rocket that can launch once or twice a year. Hilton is less likely to spend $4 billion to launch their space hotel to the Moon than to spend whatever it costs to launch a reusable rocket by a company\u00A0that previously developed a cheap rocket for NASA\u2019s commercial Moon missions.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-15T02:32:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m trying hard to make a use case for SLS in general (since it never got a mission FIRST, then a design that accomplished that mission), and the use case I find is as a big dumb booster for large mass, and particularly large \u003Cem\u003Evolume\u003C/em\u003E cargoes (8.4m or even 10m dia is a big deal).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNASA had no other options when this process started in some respects, but they WERE aware of commercial crew (which was delayed partially because SLS poached some of their budget the first couple years). So I agree with criticizing \u0022new space\u0022 fans who say it should have been SpaceX... yeah, no, SpaceX wasn\u0027t a thing then.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA better strategy would have been to leverage commercial crew. Commercial Crew is a service, but it\u0027s a contract, and that contract could have been done differently. It could have left an option for NASA to buy vehicles outright, or buy variants for BLEO work at some cost to be renegotiated. Vehicles get done for ISS, then after testing and cert, they get altered for BLEO EDL.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat mission is ideally suited for launch on SLS? Europa Clipper?
