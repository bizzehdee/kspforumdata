I\\\u0027d like to change my suggestion from the two turn per week idea towards maybe a three turn per two week idea. That should allow roughly four days for the players to make rockets and just less than one day on average for don to carry out turns and plan the next turns missions etc.\n\nWhat are people\\\u0027s thoughts on this, or am I just a bit of a moron who is making up an issue that isn\\\u0027t really there?"},{"CreatedByName":"DonLorenzo","CreatedById":13642,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-08T00:42:19Z","Content":"I try to run people\\\u0027s submissions when they come in, to be able to do the turn as quickly as possible. This time around most players submitted close to the deadline, which made it hard for me to finish the turn today. Also work schedule doesn\\\u0027t help (just back from it now, totally dead. Will finish up tomorrow morning though). \n\nWhat I do as far as \\\u0027planning\\\u0027 goes is just take a three day minimum turn duration and slap the next deadline in a spot where I have at least a bit of time and that \\\u0027makes sense\\\u0027 to you guys. It\\\u0027s not much more defined than that. I think it\\\u0027s been working OK, I don\\\u0027t mind the irregularity. We can have a more rigid schedule, but it\\\u0027s going to have to be fairly slow and incorporate set \\\u0027processing time\\\u0027. As I said the fairly unpredictable and irregular schedule hasn\\\u0027t been bothering me, but if you guys prefer things more rigid and defined (and there are perfectly valid reasons as to why that\\\u0027d be nicer) we can do that too. It will probably end up like a week long turn with 1-2 days of dedicated processing time for me. It\\\u0027s bound to take a little longer now with the missions becoming longer and the amount of players growing (both good things!)\n\nCheers, and more importantly, good night."},{"CreatedByName":"robsr3v3ng3","CreatedById":18051,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-08T10:52:50Z","Content":"ah ok no worries then if you are happy with it as is.

I haven\\\u0027t looked in detail yet but I think I\\\u0027ve got some second submissions for the 100x100 mission. I\\\u0027ll allow that this turn (since the info is quite buried), but pay out a lower amount. Next turn this information will be updated in the OP as well. Just saying.

Doesn\\\u0027t that mean others can still do the 100x100 orbit for the full 33k, but as **I** already have one up there, **I** need to put one in a 200x200 (which is the plan this turn). And etc.\n\nAha I\\\u0027ve got it -- awaras put up a kubble this turn too? And if issarik launched one, the sky is getting crowded with prying eyes!\n\n(Don\\\u0027t mind me, just enjoying the launching of actual payloads more than passing altitudes.)\n\nNow for an uncalled-for suggestion: I\\\u0027m not fond of the doubling in altitude each time -- perhaps if it were linear (100, 200, 300, 400, 500... or 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000...). Maybe a Fibonacci sequence (100, 200, 300, 500, 800, 1300, 2100, 3400, etc). I\\\u0027m rather fond of that one, and thought I\\\u0027d suggest it sooner than later in case anyone has some input. The Fib is a gentler exponential that will still make each new launch a serious decision, but doesn\\\u0027t have as hard a cutoff as a strict doubling of altitude each time. (edit2: prime numbers are pretty nice too, and \u0027harder\u0027 than linear. (100, 200, 300, 500, 700, 1100, ...) Just a thought.)\n\nedit: Thanks for the launch time clarification. I was just thinking along the lines of \u0027sunrise\u0027 or whatever. Since Kerbals haven\\\u0027t invented clocks. (Just stopwatches for elapsed time per mission)"},{"CreatedByName":"DonLorenzo","CreatedById":13642,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-12T12:15:39Z","Content":"Yeah the ladder is personal, I was just concerned that info got snowed under. I\\\u0027m gonna stick with the doubling, it means there will be less feasible kubble missions, but there will be more new missions soon anyway so that should be OK. Also the dV required to double the orbits becomes less and less so it\\\u0027s actually not that steep an increase. I do like the fibonacci sequence, I\\\u0027ll keep that one in mind for future stuff that might need it."}]}
