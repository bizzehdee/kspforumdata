Many of them can be used together to increase stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first, and the most obvious, is to use the largest docking ports available. The 2.5 meter docking ports are stronger than the 1.25 meter ports. Depending on where you are in the tech tree, this might not be an option. You could also try triple docking the 1.25 meter ports, but this takes some skill and luck to pull off consistently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second method is to reduce the number of docked craft. It\u0027s generally more stable to have two big craft instead of 4 small craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could also try doing a puller configuration instead of a pusher configuration. Stick your engines in the front, and string out the modules behind it, like a train. It will still wobble while trying to turn, but it\u0027s more stable while performing burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you insist on doing a pusher, build a \u0022core module\u0022. This should contain the engines and most of the fuel. As you add more modules, try and keep the center of mass of the whole craft inside the core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor what you\u0027re doing (multiple M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn missions with a modular ship), a mothership is almost overkill. However, what I would suggest is instead build one single lander with around 2000 m/s of delta-v in a single stage (pretty easy to do). This will act as your drive unit and your lander. Attach some fuel tanks in front or behind it, and you have your mothership. When you get to the Mun, fill up the tanks on the lander, then detach it from the rest of of the craft and land. Once you\u0027re done with the mission, takeoff and rendezvous with the fuel tanks in orbit to refuel. You can keep doing this until you run out of fuel in the orbital tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sovnheim","CreatedById":104593,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T17:33:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis seems like a good idea - The problem is that if one of your reckon crafts is destroyed then you have an unbalanced mothership with reduced power. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy advice : \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1/ For your reckon crafts, make them as light as possible. I have had similar problems which I solved with very light reckon probes \u0026amp; manned crafts powered with monopropellant. They can perform rendez-vous easily to refuel.

Then burn at apoapsis to get the maximum efficiency for the rest of the inclination change and aerobrake back to a circular orbit. Changing inclination in a low orbit is incredibly expensive and should be avoided if at all possible. If you there is no way around it I recommend raising your apoapsis quite a lot (a few hundred if not thousand km) and making the burn at apoapsis. However if you are orbiting an airless body you will also have to burn retrograde at periapsis to circularize again. I usually try to plan my missions so that I do not need to do an inclination change while in low orbit or if that is not possible try getting a gravity assist to make the change for me.
