Docking ports cant\u0027 however hold those crafts in place and they start to shake and swing until the hit something and blow up. Is there a way to hold them that would still allow to undocking and docking ?\n\nSo far I could only leave Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere in one piece If I had separate, fixed main engines and didn\u0027t use recon crafts engines when getting into orbit (layout 2).\n\nIf I would use strut connectors, decouplers or other parts to stabilize docked crafts, would I be able to undock and then dock ?\n\n[http://www./view/uu2h3e4sqln81hn/layout.JPG](http://www./view/uu2h3e4sqln81hn/layout.JPG)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-31T06:37:42Z\u0022 title=\u002203/31/2015 06:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Khazar**"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T10:14:20Z","Content":"Struts won\u0027t reattach after undocking.

Many of them can be used together to increase stability.\n\nThe first, and the most obvious, is to use the largest docking ports available. The 2.5 meter docking ports are stronger than the 1.25 meter ports. Depending on where you are in the tech tree, this might not be an option. You could also try triple docking the 1.25 meter ports, but this takes some skill and luck to pull off consistently.\n\nThe second method is to reduce the number of docked craft. It\u0027s generally more stable to have two big craft instead of 4 small craft.\n\nYou could also try doing a puller configuration instead of a pusher configuration. Stick your engines in the front, and string out the modules behind it, like a train. It will still wobble while trying to turn, but it\u0027s more stable while performing burns.\n\nIf you insist on doing a pusher, build a \u0022core module\u0022. This should contain the engines and most of the fuel. As you add more modules, try and keep the center of mass of the whole craft inside the core.\n\nFor what you\u0027re doing (multiple M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn missions with a modular ship), a mothership is almost overkill. However, what I would suggest is instead build one single lander with around 2000 m/s of delta-v in a single stage (pretty easy to do). This will act as your drive unit and your lander. Attach some fuel tanks in front or behind it, and you have your mothership. When you get to the Mun, fill up the tanks on the lander, then detach it from the rest of of the craft and land. Once you\u0027re done with the mission, takeoff and rendezvous with the fuel tanks in orbit to refuel. You can keep doing this until you run out of fuel in the orbital tanks."},{"CreatedByName":"Sovnheim","CreatedById":104593,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T17:33:08Z","Content":"This seems like a good idea - The problem is that if one of your reckon crafts is destroyed then you have an unbalanced mothership with reduced power. \n\nMy advice : \n\n1/ For your reckon crafts, make them as light as possible. I have had similar problems which I solved with very light reckon probes \u0026 manned crafts powered with monopropellant. They can perform rendez-vous easily to refuel. So far it has worked well for me, especially for missions at close range on small bodies (Mun \u0026 Minmus).\n\n2/ Add a big badass engine on your mothership that is able to push your craft as far as you want. You\u0027ll have shorter and safer burns. A Rockomax Skipper (Mainsail might be overpowered for missions to the mun)\n\n3/ Add some radial docking ports for refueling and return, but send them attached with decouplers. This will make your ship far more stable for the journey to the Mun. Remember that your ship will be lighter on the way back, therefore easier to maneuver. \n\nLast but not least, consider that it is much easier to return from the mun than to go there. A small manned craft (1-kerbal) with a medium sized monopropellant tank is enough to return home. You may want to leave the heavy mothership behind - especially if its gas tanks are almost empty.\n\nHope that helps ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Khazar","CreatedById":138578,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T09:14:17Z","Content":"Thank you for your answers.\n\nI have no access to large docking ports yet, also I have reached mods \u0022capacity\u0022 and KSP started to crash quite often at this point.

It\u0027s generally more stable to have two big craft instead of 4 small craft.\n\nMy carreer situation is that I have to take crew reports at more than 20 locations, more like 30 I guess, as well as plant a flag, take some science data from surface ad place a basic station in the orbit. \n\nTo get those reports done I will have to change orbit many times or spent much time waiting to get near every location.\n\nSo I thought that the best idea would be to take 4 small crafts that would take care of crew reports, 1 lander to place the flag and gather the data. All that would be detachable. Then there would be a main command module with science lab and other stuff required for this \u0022space station contract\u0022. I hope that I could just undock it on specific orbit and then dock it back instead of leaving it for good. After I accomplishing as many contract as I can, I would like to assembly every craft and go back to Kerbin. Refuel, exchange crew (to get exp) and science samples, and wait in orbit until next big mission.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E If you insist on doing a pusher, build a \u0022core module\u0022.

Stronger engines increase wobble, also they have lower ISP which means you need more fuel for the same dV.\n\nOf course using this design would require quite a lot of rendevouz and docking, which can be quite hard.

Then burn at apoapsis to get the maximum efficiency for the rest of the inclination change and aerobrake back to a circular orbit. Changing inclination in a low orbit is incredibly expensive and should be avoided if at all possible. If you there is no way around it I recommend raising your apoapsis quite a lot (a few hundred if not thousand km) and making the burn at apoapsis. However if you are orbiting an airless body you will also have to burn retrograde at periapsis to circularize again. I usually try to plan my missions so that I do not need to do an inclination change while in low orbit or if that is not possible try getting a gravity assist to make the change for me.
