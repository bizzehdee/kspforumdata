I\u0027m not sure, but that fuel line may be giving the 3 and 4 boosters some structural integrity, which they lose when the first two boosters are staged and the fuel line is severed. I\u0027ve had similar issues with mysterious explosions upon staging, and MORE STRUTS generally solves the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, that rocket is really overbuilt for what it\u0027s trying to do. The 3-Kerbal command module is insanely heavy (though the thermal and impact resistance are nice), and I don\u0027t think you should need monopropellant for anything, since you aren\u0027t docking and MJ is probably going to land it for you (right?). Even without RCS, MechJeb can land on target quite nicely, easily to within a few meters of the target. That 750 RCS is a lot of mass that you really don\u0027t need, and the same applies to the command pod. My suggestions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Use a Hitchhiker module instead of the command module. MJ is providing control anyways, and the Hitchhiker weighs half as much as that command module, and seats one more (which won\u0027t matter). You could alternatively use the Mk2 passenger module, which is even lighter, but that is a lifting body and can do weird things to your CoL. You will need to put dedicated reaction wheels on your craft, though, since the Hitchhiker and passenger modules don\u0027t have any.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Halve the size of your transfer stage, at least. You really only need a Rockomax 16 (quarter orange tank), plus a Poodle engine for your transfer stage. Those weight savings on your lander will really help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Your ascent stage can be a lot smaller, simpler, and cheaper (though it looks like you\u0027re in Sandbox, so that won\u0027t matter). Replace your asparagus with an orange tank and a quarter orange tank with a Mainsail, and then stick 6 Kickback (the largest) SRBs on it. Put 6 tailfins in between the boosters, ditch the second set you have now, and you should be set. Ride the boosters with the mainsail off, stage the boosters and activate the mainsail, and then you should make it to orbit without using the transfer stage. Even if you do dip into the transfer stage\u0027s dV, with all the weight savings your lander stage should have an insane amount of dV, and should be able to do the round trip no problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T17:21:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETransfer (Rockomax \u0026amp; Reliant)... uh,oh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis happens when you drop the orange tanks and mainsails and are firing *all* remaining rockets?

Though I did not read his entire post, if I repeat what he says, it all the more affirms that conclusion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket is too tall. You can do a couple things, but I would suggest taking out one of the inside orange tanks. if you want to make up for that lost delta v, toss in an extra non-orange tank on the first and second stages to increase that overall initial thrust duration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, you are probably turning down too suddenly. I do not know mechjeb (and I suggest playing without it. I imagine it is nice when you know all about the game and want to get lazy, but it fails to teach you how to play it better. Trial and error will help you with these analyses) but it sounds too me like you do not have enough vertical velocity OR you have too much vertical velocity and you are burning out those asparagus too early, forcing a climb at an altitude under 60k with the single, internal, 3rd stage mainsail. This is not always a problem, but when your rocket is hugely tall and your Thrust to Weight ratio is very low, it causes issues. Mainsail is buff, yes, but two orange tanks in dense atmosphere is rough, especially with a large final stage sitting atop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you launch, immediately, and VERY DELICATELY, aim the rocket a degree or two East. From there on, let gravity turn you and use about half throttle. The idea behind the best, most stable climb to orbit is not speed (although you need it to qualify the climb since too slow a climb destroys any chance of horizontal acceleration a minute into your climb to orbit) but instead \u003Cstrong\u003Eburn time\u003C/strong\u003E. (as for speed; what I mean is that a low speed reduces the usefulness of your overall deltav, while a high speed can do the same. If you are going fast at low altitude, even near horizontally in preparation for orbit, you lost a lot of potential delta v because you fight atmosphere. On the other hand, if you go too slow and lose your asparagus without burning any horizontal, sure you got into space, but now you have to burn 2000\u002B delta v horizontally to get an orbit in a short window with a single engine because once you are at the peak of your climb, it becomes harder and harder to stay out of the atmosphere with a low horizontal velocity). But careful; this means your gravity turn will be more aggressive. You do not necessarily need to aim into your prograde the entire time. Back off a bit and aim more vertically if it is too aggressive. 45 deg is ideal at 35-45k altitude, for example. This slow, natural turn prevents the bend you are seeing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, if you have to have a long rocket, use struts. Make the entire thing as solid as you can throughout.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I suggest losing some final stage fuel. You only need a few hundred delta v. Use Engineer Redux. It does an excellent job at telling you per stage Delta v, weight, etc., without giving autopilot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-----------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust read your post about asparagus breaking away and tearing apart your ship. Couple things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, that lower throttle is important here, too. It gets you higher with less fuel so when you do break away, it is with less atmosphere resisting the ship and the falling away stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, this is where you need to point as directly in prograde as you can. If you do not, then the pieces will not drift delicately and directly retro to the climbing rocket. You could use sepratrons. Place them on either side in the center of mass (ish) of each asparagus and have them initiate at decouple. They cause the stage to shoot outward and away (or whatever direction you set) at decouple and get them out of the picture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Clear Air Turbulence\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Clear Air Turbulence\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi Goomblah, thanks for those ideas.\u003Cp\u003EI now have a lander with just about enough d-V to get to minmus and back again, so it will be a test of my flying skills from here on.
