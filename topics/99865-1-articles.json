You thrust one engine more than the other to keep it balance and it\u0027s controlled by high end computers. It\u0027s not unprecedented in the real world, certainly not science fiction. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is not quite the same, but closely related in principle, to how the B2 bomber flew without a tail. In that case, it was computer controlled thrust vectoring, so the engines would change their thrust direction to stabilize the craft. I\u0027m not sure, it may have had independent throttle control to help too. It would certainly make sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s probably less science fiction than some of the stuff we have in the stock game (LV-N).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-17T16:14:52Z\u0022 title=\u002202/17/2015 04:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xaver","CreatedById":46640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-17T16:23:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah!
