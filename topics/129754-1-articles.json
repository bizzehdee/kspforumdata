They painted the rocket core white so it would catch the light more easily. When looking for Sputnik, most people would see the rocket stage - not the much dimmer point nearby that was Sputnik itself. Also visible were the two fairing panels that ejected just before Sputnik did.

Something four times the size of ISS, though, and you\u0027d start to be able to make out its geometry (assuming excellent vision again).
