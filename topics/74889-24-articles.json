The Kerbal voices were a little annoying, and the video cuts don\u0027t always sync up with the music, which also ends about two measures too soon (Couldn\u0027t you have just let the song reach that cute little climax?) Also, and I\u0027m really picking nits here, doesn\u0027t one Kerbal or another score a goal at 0:31, and the video is cut before the ball goes in?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would say that this video is the most creative of the Forum members\u0027, and I think that it deserves a bit of applause.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWith all of this being said.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008000;\u0022\u003EMy vote goes to Team 2\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E for their admirable following of the rules of the challenge, as well as the most fun-to-watch video of the three.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough, of course, I still think that \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/RhTqI44K0YM\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emy video\u003C/a\u003E is by far and away the best of all.

Looks like the other teams videos have caught up in view count in proportion to your team\u0027s video. The greater number of views was probably due to his subscriber base.
