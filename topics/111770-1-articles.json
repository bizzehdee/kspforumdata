Compare that to LF, 1 ton of ore becomes 100 units of LF (1,000 kg ore x 0.5 kgs LF/1 kg ore x 1 unit LF/5 kg LF), which is worth 80 funds.\n\nYou\u0027d be basically printing money.\n\nI personally think this feels like an exploit. Maybe some players feel that this *should* be included to represent some kind of orbital manufacturing, but omission of Ore -\u003E Xe means that the current game isn\u0027t balanced around this alternate source of income, and this would lead to a LOT of income: 100 tons of ore -\u003E 1 million funds if you can get 50 tons back to the KSC.
