Now it contains both monopropellant (30) and LF/O (50). The model has been tweaked a bit, with a recessed bottom to allow an engine to be mostly hidden inside it with only the exhaust sticking out, which gives it more of a \u0022LEM\u0022 profile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also changed up the texture a little bit to break up the visuals and updated the bump map to work. Currently trying to get the \u0022toggle flag\u0022 option to work. Right now it works for full-sized flags but if the original flag has an alpha (like the default KSP one) I get a nasty black box on the flag decal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso another issue I ran into is in the little preview-box where you select the part, my new part scales UP, I\u0027m assuming until infinity as it passes the screen.
