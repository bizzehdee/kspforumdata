Each \u0022Wheel\u0022 works like this:\u00A0an\u00A0dummy\u00A0object with a kinematic rigidbody is created and placed at the end of the suspension travel line. A configurable joint is created between the \u0022wheel\u0022 and this dummy object with relevant settings to turn it into a linear joint - \u00A0suspension is configured here. In FixedUpdate() the position of the dummy object is updated with the hit point of a raycast (we can move onto sphere later), so the suspension always updates\u00A0against the contact point on the terrain. This makes perfect repulsors, as the dummy object has no link to the ground. This is possible either by linking it to the ground with another joint, or simply manipulating its positions with some calculation. Configurable joints allow you to manipulate the three linear axis spring and damper separately, so we have the option of adding some \u0022slip\u0022 in there, or fixing those two joint axis and doing the rest mathematically.

Each \u0022Wheel\u0022 works like this:\u00A0an\u00A0dummy\u00A0object with a kinematic rigidbody is created and placed at the end of the suspension travel line. A configurable joint is created between the \u0022wheel\u0022 and this dummy object with relevant settings to turn it into a linear joint - \u00A0suspension is configured here. In FixedUpdate() the position of the dummy object is updated with the hit point of a raycast (we can move onto sphere later), so the suspension always updates\u00A0against the contact point on the terrain. This makes perfect repulsors, as the dummy object has no link to the ground.
