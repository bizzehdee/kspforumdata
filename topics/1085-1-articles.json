If I added any more solids the extra weight would break the ship apart. The purpose of such a large ship is to get into space with as much extra fuel as possible. So far I\u0027ve managed to get her into orbit with 5 tanks of fuel left. Better results are probably possible with this ship, but ol\u0027 Jeb had to start body-building just to handle the stick in the first few stages.\n\nNot to thread-jack too much, but what is the best way for picking up lots of speed with all this leftover fuel? An elliptical orbit with a burn of some sort at the nearest point?"},{"CreatedByName":"Killerhurtz","CreatedById":320,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-27T02:45:50Z","Content":"I\u0027m no rocket scientist, but if I follow the vectors we did in physics last year (high school physics), you should just go and do full-burn and adjust your direction so the thrust is as close as the direction you\u0027re currently going at as possible."},{"CreatedByName":"rdfox","CreatedById":1818,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-29T14:51:41Z","Content":"I\u0027d like to be able to have both my stage 1 liquid sustainer and my stage 0 SRBs light simultaneously, but be able to jettison the solids after burnout... ah, well, maybe in a later version.\n\nAs for picking up speed, depends on what you wanna do. If you want to go into an elliptical orbit or acheive escape velocity, then wait for perikee and fire full thrust along your current velocity vector (\u0027posigrade\u0027, in rocket science-ese). (If you want to be \\*really\\* technical about it, fire just enough \\*before\\* perikee that you hit perikee right at the midpoint of the burn, but really, don\u0027t make it more than a ten-minute total burn; if you have more fuel than that, wait until the next orbit and repeat the process.) This\u0027ll maximize your velocity and get you the highest possible apokee, if you don\u0027t hit escape velocity.\n\nIf you\u0027re trying for as high a circular orbit as you can, you\u0027ll actually need to make two burns. First, at perikee, you\u0027ll need to make a posigrade burn to raise your apokee to your desired level. Then, half an orbit later, at apokee, you\u0027ll need to make another posigrade burn to raise the perikee to the same level.\n\nRemember, if you want to bring the boys home, you only need to make one retrograde (opposite velocity vector) burn, preferably at apokee, to lower your perikee to below 35km, at which point aerobraking will perform the rest of the deceleration needed to deorbit them! Horizontal burns perpendicular to your velocity vector, for the record, will shift your orbital plane (inclination) so that you are travelling north and south of the equator on each orbit. (You \\*are\\* launching due east, right?)\n\nSo, short version: Burn at perikee to adjust your apokee altitude. Burn at apokee to adjust your perikee altitude. Don\u0027t bother burning in any direction off your current velocity vector unless you\u0027re trying to change your orbital plane; vertical burns (usually) just waste fuel, though some low-orbit-only spacecraft (Mercury, Space Shuttle) have included a downward component in their retrofire to get them into the atmosphere faster and save weight on retro fuel."},{"CreatedByName":"DrZaius","CreatedById":3004,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-29T17:32:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027d like to be able to have both my stage 1 liquid sustainer and my stage 0 SRBs light simultaneously, but be able to jettison the solids after burnout... ah, well, maybe in a later version.\n\nIf I\u0027m understanding your question correctly, you can in the current version. If I have 3 stages, 1 being liquid tanks \u0026 engine, 2 being decouplers, and 3 being SRBs, if I move just the engine icons down to stage 3, the engine will light along with the SRBs. Once they run out, you can decouple them (stage 2), and the ship will proceed with the remaining fuel left in stage 1.\n\n-DrZ"},{"CreatedByName":"rdfox","CreatedById":1818,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-30T14:57:49Z","Content":"Thanks!
