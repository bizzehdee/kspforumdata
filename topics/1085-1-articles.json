If you want to go into an elliptical orbit or acheive escape velocity, then wait for perikee and fire full thrust along your current velocity vector (\u0027posigrade\u0027, in rocket science-ese). (If you want to be *really* technical about it, fire just enough *before* perikee that you hit perikee right at the midpoint of the burn, but really, don\u0027t make it more than a ten-minute total burn; if you have more fuel than that, wait until the next orbit and repeat the process.) This\u0027ll maximize your velocity and get you the highest possible apokee, if you don\u0027t hit escape velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re trying for as high a circular orbit as you can, you\u0027ll actually need to make two burns. First, at perikee, you\u0027ll need to make a posigrade burn to raise your apokee to your desired level. Then, half an orbit later, at apokee, you\u0027ll need to make another posigrade burn to raise the perikee to the same level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember, if you want to bring the boys home, you only need to make one retrograde (opposite velocity vector) burn, preferably at apokee, to lower your perikee to below 35km, at which point aerobraking will perform the rest of the deceleration needed to deorbit them! Horizontal burns perpendicular to your velocity vector, for the record, will shift your orbital plane (inclination) so that you are travelling north and south of the equator on each orbit. (You *are* launching due east, right?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, short version: Burn at perikee to adjust your apokee altitude. Burn at apokee to adjust your perikee altitude. Don\u0027t bother burning in any direction off your current velocity vector unless you\u0027re trying to change your orbital plane; vertical burns (usually) just waste fuel, though some low-orbit-only spacecraft (Mercury, Space Shuttle) have included a downward component in their retrofire to get them into the atmosphere faster and save weight on retro fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrZaius","CreatedById":3004,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-29T17:32:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rdfox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rdfox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to be able to have both my stage 1 liquid sustainer and my stage 0 SRBs light simultaneously, but be able to jettison the solids after burnout... ah, well, maybe in a later version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I\u0027m understanding your question correctly, you can in the current version.
