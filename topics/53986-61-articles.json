Basically you yaw some during ascent, making a \u0022dogleg\u0022 or kink in your ascent trajectory. You can use this to change your ascent azimuth, and thus inclination; it is, however, more useful for increasing than decreasing inclination, since the impetus for your inclination comes from gravity\u0027s pull due to your offset from the equator, and thus builds throughout your ascent until you reach the equator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. For geostationary launches: launch into a parking orbit, then insert into geostationary transfer orbit at the AN/DN. This will ensure you arrive at geosynchronous height at the DN/AN (respectively) and can thus combine plane change with your apogee kick (circularization).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. If launching from *very* high latitudes (the break-even point is about 45 degrees IIRC), you can launch into a super-synchronous orbit and perform a bi-elliptic transfer. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://coopi.khrunichev.ru/download/2012/is22/img/orbit_b.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s what Proton does for some geostationary satellites\u003C/a\u003E.

Then you move your perigee to the desired orbit\u0027s apogee, and finally you circularize at perigee.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Woopert","CreatedById":84274,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-11T23:30:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey NathanKell, I need some help re-scaling this Taurus HCV pod.
