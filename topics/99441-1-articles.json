Try turning SAS off in flight for a few seconds to see if it cures the problem. Also try toggling the reaction wheels with an action group and see if the plane will fly on flaps alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow high are you flying? 300m/s may be a bit fast if you are near the ground in a large plane. If you have reaction wheels and flaps you can get a lot of resonant oscillations, especially if your wings are a bit flexible.

IRL aircraft have specified max. speeds at different altitudes to prevent nasty things happening to the airframe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, I might be completely wrong...
