I always try to test my creations on Kerbin before sending my Kerbals into space, but I since I manually fly, more times than not I send them to their graves on some celestial body. I get more satisfaction when things go right than I think I would if I did not fly the craft myself. That\u0027s just me, anyway, and I certainly to not criticize other people\u0027s ways of doing things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Doc Anderson","CreatedById":59918,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-17T20:24:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Promii\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Promii\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI won\u0027t use Hyperedit but I use MechJeb for many things\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have to admit, I do sometimes use Hyperedit, ... but only to test something before I stick it on a launch vehicle and invest 30-60 minutes getting into position to use, and only then if I\u0027ve actually piloted a craft of that kind to a given location.
