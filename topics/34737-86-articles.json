These are relatively straight forward to fix up:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E// Servo.cs, setupJoints()\u003Cbr\u003E//newJoint.breakForce = breakingForce;\u003Cbr\u003E//newJoint.breakTorque = breakingTorque;\u003Cbr\u003EattachJoint.SetBreakingForces(breakingForce, breakingTorque);\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAnd several places where the PartJoint class has been given a ConfigurableJoint rather than (presumably) encapsulating it, but those seem fairly innocuous to me.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe Servo.cs setupJoints() then throws a curve ball as the changes to the PartJoint don\u0027t seem to allow whole replacing of the ConfigurableJoint, so I decided to modify the code to simply update the ConfigurableJoint that is now exposed, rather than creating a new instance.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese minor changes resolve the compiler errors in doing so it does restore the IFR GUI when in flight mode! However, the real challenge then begins. In my simple test of a Docking Washer and Powered Hinge, the Docking Washer almost immediately breaks in two pieces, which the physics engine complies with but doesn\u0027t (seem to) break the part from the rest of the vessel. The Powered Hinge is functional through it\u0027s range, but the swivel isn\u0027t positioned correctly - presumably the geometry of the hinge location has changed, so there is obvious clipping of the two halves of the hinge as it swivels. This is where I left it because I believe to fix this part of the problem requires more knowledge of how the plugin operates and if sirkut is already looking in to the problem as time permits, he\u0027s probably going to arrive at the solution before I can wrap my head around the code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m happy to collaborate on getting IFR updated for 0.23.5, as it is one of my key addons for playing KSP!

I keep telling myself I\u0027ll stop after this debug log, but I keep compiling.\u003Cp\u003EI cant speak for StevenRS11, but heres where I am with it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The first few lines are just for intro purposes, and things I expect you know after 10 seconds:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EattachJoint is now a PartJoint. PartJoint contains a Joint class. That contains ConfigurableJoint.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, I\u0027ve had to totally comment out the two methods there are to set breakingforce and breakingtorque, as those so far always give NullReferences (also commented out in servo.cs)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried altering newJoint to a PartJoint, that made most of the code happy, but you cant set attachJoint.Joint to newJoint, as it\u0027s read-only\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve gone in and am directly setting attachJoint.Joint variables. This works with the large gantry (there may be others, but so far, this is the only part to work 100%) There is no longer a newJoint object.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is still a \u0022NpScene::createJoint: desc.isValid() fails!\u0022 being thrown, at:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EattachJoint.Joint.connectedBody = parent.Rigidbody;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, it works for the gantry, not for the others I\u0027ve tested. I see zero difference in the part configs, but the large gantry has the rigidbody parent of GantryLarge, and everything else has the parent as the object they\u0027re connected to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if I attach a gantry large to one side of a lander cabin on launch A, and the gantry 1/2 on launch B, GantryLarge is the rigidbody parent on launch A, LanderCabin is the parent on launch B, which causes the joint setup to not be valid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommenting this out makes the joint function, but the moving portion is in the wrong location.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYup.
