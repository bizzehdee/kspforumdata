They create drag, and they provide more intake air than you\u0027d ever need.\n\nAt top speeds, high altitudes you need all the air intakes you can get just to keep the engine going a bit longer. You may also switch some engines off to keep air consumption lower. \n\nAbove that threshold you switch to rockets, and you should close all air intakes not to produce drag.\n\nHas anyone given a thought how to manage that all? Through action groups? Seems like awfully many of them, as you\u0027d regulate the number of active engines, number of open intakes, etc. Is there maybe a way to add more action groups? (I\u0027d need a few for normal orbital/planetary/landing operations too!) Or some other smart way to do this?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-10T13:12:21Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2015 01:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T09:12:05Z","Content":"I must say I\u0027m not sure the open/close does any difference in 1.0 aero. \n\n- Drag lines don\u0027t decrease when you close intakes.\n\n- MechJeb \u0022Drag coefficient\u0022 don\u0027t change either (even it changes when you lower landing struts), or do a minor pitch\n\nMaybe it was a 0.9 features which was forgotten to be added to 1.0.\n\nBut I still close/open intakes for RP."},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T10:25:29Z","Content":"Don\u0027t bother; closing intakes makes no difference to drag now, in stock or FAR."},{"CreatedByName":"JoCRaM","CreatedById":84138,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T10:48:29Z","Content":"In older versions I used action groups to toggle - I\u0027d have intake A always open, action group 1 would toggle intake B, action group 2 would toggle intake B , C and D, action group 3 would toggle intakes B, C, D, E, F, G, H.\n\nbefore launch I\u0027d hit \u00223\u0022 to go down to minimal intake, When I started running low I\u0027d hit \u00221\u0022 to have two intakes, then hitting \u00222\u0022 would give me three intakes (A,C,D) hitting \u00221\u0022 again would boost to four intakes, then \u00223\u0022 would give me five, \u00221\u0022 six, \u00222\u0022 seven, and finally \u00221\u0022 would give me all eight.\n\nI eventually realised this was overkill, and used just two action groups with out the complex toggling to give me three levels of intake 1-\u003E3-\u003E9"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T12:38:01Z","Content":"JoCRaM, that\u0027s a smart approach.
