What I noticed is that\u00A0belly landings there are\u00A0way more forgiving than doing so in KSP. The plane slides on the grass if it doesn\u0027t have it\u0027s undercarriage out.

IRL, Tailstrikes upon takeoff almost never cause serious damage, and tailstrikes upon landing rarely do. Landing gear collapses cause some fireworks, but even at high speeds, they don\u0027t make the cockpit disappear.

My reasoning is that grass grows in dirt, which is soft enough to become deformed even in a relatively controlled landing, and that will cause things like the nose and engines to dig in. At the very least, belly landing in a hard surface is probably a lot more survivable, because once the plane digs in, things normally go pear shaped. Basically, I would expect the deformation of surfaces like fields to provide more resistance than a hard surface like Concrete that withstand the impact without deforming.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other thing is that, at least for a passenger plane, without the ground deforming, there is remarkably little of the plane actually touching the runway when the gear is up.
