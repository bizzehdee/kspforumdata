Each user will perform in this save file the challenge posted by the previous user, then create a new challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUser-A completes the challenge posted by User-Z, which involved returning a ship to Kerbin and ending the mission. User-A Creates a new ship, which is designed to land on the Mun, and challenges the next user to get the ship into orbit. User-B gets the ship into a 100 km. orbit and challenges the next user to transfer the ship to the Mun. User-C transfers the ship to a 75 km. Mun orbit and challenges the next user to land it. User-D does so, has the kerbals walk around for a bit, and then challenges the next user to get the ship back into orbit. User-E takes off and gets the ship into a 60 km. orbit, but the fuel is now almost completely depleted, so he build a rescue mission and challenges the next user to fly it into orbit. Etc, etc....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome basic rules:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe challenges should be small steps, not \u0022launch this fly it here and land it and go back to kerbin\u0022. Each challenge should be one step of the mission, not the whole thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChallenges should be fun. For example, driving a rover to the North pole and back is not fun, it\u0027s just a lot of boring, repetitive driving.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably the most important, challenges should be possible. For example, landing something on Minmus with just enough fuel to get it back to Kerbin and challenging the next user to fly it to Eeloo is just plain stupid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe challenges should always start with a vessel that is already in the persistence file, you can start the challenge by launching a vessel and leaving it on the launchpad, but there should always be a vessel ready and waiting for the next user.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf four users dislike a challenge and agree that it violates the rules as stated above, then the challenge is revoked and the game reverts to the previous challenge and save file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlways post a download link to your version of the save file in your post every time you complete a challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll stock please, not because I hate mods, but because introducing mods into this sort of thing would quickly make it a nightmare to keep track of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are encouraged to try out your challenge before posting it, just to make sure it is possible. Just make sure you quicksave at the point where your challenge begins. The idea is that you should makes sure it\u0027s possible, then challenge the next guy to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOfficial flights may only end on Kerbins surface, and all kerbals not assigned to permanent bases or stations must be returned to kerbin. This means that if the kerbals get stranded in space, then someone is going to have to rescue them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Amendment 1) Before starting a challenge, make sure to post your intent to take on the latest challenge, like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EI have the save file, please wait until I finish it, link will be below.\u003C/span\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, when you have finished the challenge, you can edit your post with a link to the new save file. This will help keep the ninja\u0027ing down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Amendment 2) The plugin \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/kerbal-alarm-clock-2/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal Alarm Clock\u003C/a\u003E is recommended, due to the high number of transfer trajectories currently going on. It is not, however, required, and since it does not involve any parts, users who do not have it will still be able to access and use the save file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to share your alarms with the save file:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- In /KSP_win(or whatever this is called on mac and linux)/PluginData/KerbalAlarmClock/ there should be a file named \u0022Alarms-Hampatsfct (Sandbox).txt\u0022. This is the file that stores the alarms you\u0027ve created, simply include it with your save file upload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce again, Kerbal Alarm Clock is officially supported for this thread, but it is by no means required to participate. However, if you are not using it, please take care to ensure that no spacecraft miss any important windows, as it would be a bit disheartening if a probe that a lot of people put time and effort into ended up becoming a piece of space rubble because it missed a capture window, for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will start with this vehicle, which I am certain is capable of getting into orbit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2MGy1Da.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222MGy1Da.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5jJWk5O4TaUcHlUVVc2SEMxWnc/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis is the persistence file.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave Fun!! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-07T18:58:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2013 06:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by hawkinator\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAmendment 2 added concerning KAC plugin\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dazhat","CreatedById":59413,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T09:03:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are in orbit.
