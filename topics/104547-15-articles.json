But **\u003Cu\u003Eit is save itself\u003C/u\u003E**.\n\nThere has to be some kind of setting in each save folder that is messing with sequencer....or perhaps setting for each mod.\n\nI tried fresh 1.3 KSP install with just IR \u002B sequencer (and dependables like tweak scale and mod-manager) to test if it got messed up in patching process itself since i was updating via patch file instead of clean install.\n\n1. And with some basic sequence it worked.\n2. Second step was moving all the mods from main install to this \u0022newly found working\u0022 install. Test sequence good so far.\n3. Third step was moving the saves. And lo and behold my original craft exhibited same issue like before. ![:/](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon1.png \u0022:/\u0022)\n4. After transferring just craft file into a new sandbox save everything worked like charm.\n\nSo this fixes my issue which is fortunately only tied into my design sandbox save folder i don\u0027t care about.\n\nBut for the people who were designing in their main career save it might prove as major hurdle.\n\n....will try one more thing be back soon ;-)\n\nEDIT : Its worse then i thought Its not not just sequencer it is tied into bigger issue.\n\nKSP saves from previous version to 1.3 get messed up again. I see no Kerbals in my old saves ...... (missing kerbals were caused by not updated different mod...unrelated)\n\nor perhaps some other mod that haven\u0027t got updated properly and that could cause corruption of saves.\n\nBut anyway the issue is corrupted save.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-09-30T18:55:25Z\u0022 title=\u002209/30/2017 06:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 30, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by DirkLarien**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tirehtoori R.I.P","CreatedById":149732,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-30T22:06:40Z","Content":"[@DirkLarien](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/91662-dirklarien/) oh it was the save file issue for you :,D didn\u0027t come to mind since i always just start fresh eachtime after an update since i can always make my mechs again improved and since i don\u0027t do career mode at all anymore since making mechs tends to be my brain hobby, so i just craft them, test them, move on xD and maeby sometimes  even upload them to curse"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerman Jebediah","CreatedById":180979,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-21T20:13:40Z","Content":"someone help me!! there\u0027s no UI in the game!! i put the Control unit but don\u0027t work, its bugged to me,how do i use (if i\u0027m doing wrong) the control unit ?\n\n(my version is 1.3)"},{"CreatedByName":"Rivvik","CreatedById":77232,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-28T19:16:50Z","Content":"I\u0027m getting this on 1.3.1, as well."},{"CreatedByName":"Colonel Cbplayer","CreatedById":102399,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-03T21:55:40Z","Content":"I feel that a good quality of life feature would be if there was a button to automatically set all the servos in their current position in a sequence.
