Another reason is that the blue decoupler can fail under enough force from the rockets, the red decoupler should always be used to avoid this. You could also get rid of all of the RCS components because you never need RCS on anything unless you\u0027re docking the craft, use SAS for turning. Also, you should add an SAS component because I don\u0027t see one on your craft and that could also cause it to be hard to control. I would put a large SAS ring right on top of the orange fuel tank and a small SAS ring on top of your lander can. You already have solar panels, but adding two electric generators wouldn\u0027t hurt either.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-07T03:47:20Z\u0022 title=\u002211/07/2013 03:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by 700NitroXpress\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"celem","CreatedById":91132,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T10:25:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep, those stages are dropping single tanks. Co-ordinate opposite pairs to drop together, if your fuel lines are done right they will be hitting 0 together anyway. As other\u0027s have said, you probably want an engine on every single stack, otherwise it will struggle to move all that fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally i\u0027d keep \u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003E of the RCS, though you do have a lot. Add some of those rcs thrusters in 4-symmetry way way back on the main fuselage. Having it all up front isnt especially effective. With rcs setup right you can use it in combo with sas to launch even quite unstable rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also strongly suggest moving the control surfaces (fins) off the external tanks. As it stands you will drop 3-pairs of tanks and then be without control in the tail of your rocket. Since this will almost certainly occur below 9km its a problem. Especially while you are staging incorrectly with single tanks they will actually push you off course as you will have asymmetrical winglets.. Put the fins on the centre column and you will have use of them for much longer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI_Killed_Jeb has done an excellent image for you above.

Your shots show the outer tanks not lining up with the inner tanks. This is very important. Draw a mental line from the middle of your central tank out through the first layer and on to the second. It should be a straight line that moves through the centre of each outer tank. Your third picture shows imperfect symmetry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Dropping the right tanks at the right time. The way to think about this is to imagine that each outer tank feeds EVERY inner tank connected to it or the tank it\u0027s connected to. Having four tanks on each side of your central one means you should pick a tank and attach it to the next one along. Connect that one to the next one along and then once more and then the fourth one should be connected to the tank on the inner ring next to it. Next you connect the first inner one to the one next to it, that one to the next one, and again and then that one into the middle tank. Repeat for the opposite side. Sort out your staging and BOOM! You got poifect asparagus staging and a whole load more delta v. Make sure you go in the opposite direction as you connect them on each side so the tanks you drop are also on opposite sides of your rocket and you keep a nice weight symmetry.
