Before I had tens of mods, and it was pretty fun but heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am a bit more into the role-play side of things, rather than career mode, and thus I like playing in Science mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to know if there is a mod that more or less rearranges the stock tech tree (with their parts) in a more realistic manner. Basically, similarly to Better Than Starting Manned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s nice for new players, but not very realistic, that you are able to send live people on space way before sending just probes to do a local survey (SCANsat is pretty nice in this aspect), and rovers. Imagine if we sent Apollo mission before anything else!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course I could simply play in Sandbox and just pretend I don\u0027t have stuff unlocked. But I really like that you get the Science to unlock things, it gives a bit more pragmatic purpose than just pretending.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not really sure if BTSM is still supported, and last time I checked it needed DeadlyReentry, and stuff like that. I\u0027d like to run something almost stock.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T18:43:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBetter then Manned or something like that does this.
