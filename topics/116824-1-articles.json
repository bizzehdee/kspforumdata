(Probes and rovers before manned capsules)","CreatedByName":"Heliosmaster","CreatedById":103813,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T18:35:23Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Heliosmaster","CreatedById":103813,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T18:35:23Z","Content":"Hello all, I recently restarted playing KSP after going on a hiatus in 0.23.5 or something like that. Before I had tens of mods, and it was pretty fun but heavy.\n\nI am a bit more into the role-play side of things, rather than career mode, and thus I like playing in Science mode.\n\nI would like to know if there is a mod that more or less rearranges the stock tech tree (with their parts) in a more realistic manner. Basically, similarly to Better Than Starting Manned.\n\nI think it\u0027s nice for new players, but not very realistic, that you are able to send live people on space way before sending just probes to do a local survey (SCANsat is pretty nice in this aspect), and rovers. Imagine if we sent Apollo mission before anything else!\n\nOf course I could simply play in Sandbox and just pretend I don\u0027t have stuff unlocked. But I really like that you get the Science to unlock things, it gives a bit more pragmatic purpose than just pretending.\n\nI\u0027m not really sure if BTSM is still supported, and last time I checked it needed DeadlyReentry, and stuff like that. I\u0027d like to run something almost stock."},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T18:43:16Z","Content":"Better then Manned or something like that does this.

Just get most of the recommended mods and have fun.

Neither the Soviet Union nor the US sent much stuff more capable than a stayputnik before launching their first kosmo-/astronauts... \n\nPerhaps the first capsule should be in the second tier, instead of the first, but rovers and such is much more advanced imho."},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T12:41:48Z","Content":"Quite a few parts mods add a probe core to the starting node, including Modular Rocket Systems.
