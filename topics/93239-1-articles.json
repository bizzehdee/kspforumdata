When he tried to get back on board the game said that he could not board a fully occupied module. Sure enough, there was already (still?) a Bob inside the MK1 command pod. I now have 2 Bobs, one on the surface in an EVA, and the other inside my ship. I tried to EVA the one from the ship and that worked fine and he got back inside fine too, so I\u0027m not sure what voodoo happened to make the first clone -- I could not replicate it myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis clone exists on the Tracking Station list, but NOT on the view inside the Astronaut Complex (there was room for one more Kerbal, I had only used 4 up to that point with a max of at least 5).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlas, I only have space to carry a crew of 3, so I will have to leave Bob the Clone on the surface \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only mod I am running is Kerbal Engineer Redux (updated for 0.90) if that helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some images:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Hpq86\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

If I click another craft first, I can fly/terminate/recover it as normal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the VAB I equipped Bill\u0027s inventory (I have KIS/KAS installed) with a few items.

(Unfortunately my current craft is only single-seat so I need to send a rescue craft to do this.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship is currently on an escape trajectory from Minmus, Im hoping that I will be able to have EVA\u0027d Bill grab onto the outside whilst I do the retro-burn to achieve orbit around Minmus, where they can wait for the rescue craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo thats the situation so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anybody have any further advice? Has there been any further movement on this bug since December 2014? Any details on what causes this, what kind of scenario I should avoid?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried removing EVA\u0027d Bill from the savegame, but Im not very familiar with that sort of thing and it didn\u0027t work (think I borked the save trying to do that, but I backed up). If the rescue craft fails, any hints here would be very helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
