Natural climate change appears to be slow (hundreds, thousands or millions of years). However, the fact that 30-40% of human CO2 emissions are presently absorbed by the oceans indicate that the time constant/response time of the oceans are much faster than those of natural climate change, no? Otherwise, all of the CO2 we release would stay in the atmosphere until the earth could react. This clearly isnt the case since sources say 30-40% of the CO2 is absorbed by the ocean alone and contributes to ocean acidification. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fact that it takes much longer for natural climate change to occur might indicate it is driven by slow periodic processes, and not that the earth takes soo long to react.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AngelLestat\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AngelLestat\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I can see, mostly all graph or sources of info are correct, sometimes they choose different ways to measure (ppm, Gt=bmt, or some weird imperial units), there are some graph which was made in different years, 90s, 2000, now.. and you can see how the levels increased with the years.
