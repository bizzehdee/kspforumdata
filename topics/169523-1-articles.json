I managed to klaw to it and put it on orbit of Kerbin, the burn took me a few hours because I was not mining the asteroid quickly enough to provide continuous fuel to the engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI exited the game and returned later on the ship to find that the klaw was at a distance of a few meters from the asteroid and the drill could not reach the surface of the asteroid and was unable to mine it. I am now left with a ship \u0022klawed\u0022 with my asteroid which I cannot mine and not enough fuel to move it around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf i try to unklaw and reklaw to the real surface, I have a message from the agency stating that the asteroid has already been touched and I am afraid the asteroid would not qualify for the contract anymore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid this behaviour happened to anyone ?
