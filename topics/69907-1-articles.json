I go and check it out and it turns out it was an asteroid I had been tracking! First of all, is this even possible? Did my game glitch out and accidentally make an asteroid enter orbit around Kerbin? Second of all What are the odds of this? I have 36 asteroids being tracked and 7 unknown at the moment. Should I hitch a ride for when it gets ejected? I can post pictures if you want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mach_XXII","CreatedById":94457,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-20T01:40:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have had 2 or 3 that have been self captured\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-20T01:40:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have 2 that spawned/captured in kerbin orbit, and 1 that hit the planet.
