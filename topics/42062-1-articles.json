They\u0027re modeled and exported to Unity. I set the collision meshes, put the parts folders together etc. The issue is when I load the parts in game, they are facing to the left and are rotated the wrong way. I\u0027ve gone into blender and rotated them multiple different ways and re-exported them, but nothing seems to change. Is there something in Unity that decides their orientation once loaded into KSP, or should I continue looking in Blender? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestion 2:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe node placement is completely escaping me. Can someone direct me to a good tutorial on this or offer advise. There are multiple coordinates when I look in the existing config files in Squad parts (Y up, Z up etc.) Are these important?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-11T19:59:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1. Are you sure those rotations are affecting vertex co-ordinates and not just being stored in the model file? IIRC in Blender it\u0027s something like edit mode rather than object mode, but freeze/reset transform commands are common as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Yes, they determine which direction and position in which things attach. First three co-ordinates are the position relative to the scene origin, second three are a directional vector.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aumeydio","CreatedById":78540,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-11T20:07:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really appreciate your response.

I also know that when you rotate your model in your scene you don\u0027t actually change the XForm of that model, you need to use a \u0022adjust pivots only\u0022 setting (or what you have in Blender) to move and rotate only those pivots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had an air punch moment yesterday when I wrote down:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EZ = forward\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EX = Right\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EY = Up\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EX = RIGHT!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast thing is that we should be able to use blank game objects to get the coordinates we need via Unity, make an empty game object and call it \u0022Ruler\u0022 or whatever, then place it exactly how you want it and take note of it\u0027s XYZ and rotations. Those will allegedly work (with minor tweaking, presumably because \u0022scale\u0022 is a loose concept between editor and software like a sound system with separate volume controls for each device) I have not tested this yet, I got caught up in this going to work business this morning.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
