Unfortunately, at periapsis I didn\u0027t get a Mojo encounter and missed the rendezvous (It looked okay before I time warped...) So now I\u0027ve got a boat load of Kerbals in an elliptical orbit between Kerban and Mojo, with less than 300m/s delta-v left and no hope of getting home on their own. (I\u0027d had hoped to collect some Karbonite from Moho/Kerbol orbit and have a space collector attached, but so far no luck.)\n\nI\u0027ve built a refueling mission with a 2000m/s delta-v rescue vehicle and a full orange tank payload in Kerban orbit for my stranded crew, but I\u0027m not sure how to get it to them. I mean, I missed a Mojo rendezvous, and it\u0027s a heck of a lot bigger than my lost-in-space Kerbal\u0027s ship. I figure I could use some help.\n\nDoes anyone out there have any advice? The lives of my missing Kerbals may depend on it!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-23T19:06:17Z\u0022 title=\u002202/23/2015 07:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Seaview123**"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T22:45:32Z","Content":"2km/s just isn\u0027t going to cut it for a rescue mission near Moho orbit. You need at least 6km/s unless you\u0027re being clever with an Eve slingshot or similar. Beyond that, I\u0027d say get the astrophysicists and mathmaticians to plan the mission very carefully ... then put their results into MechJeb for the rendezvous."},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T22:50:55Z","Content":"Claw wrote an excellent tutorial on [Kerbolar-orbit intercepts](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/75759-Asteroid-Rendezvous-Outside-of-Kerbin%E2%80%99s-SOI).\n\nIt\u0027s focussed on asteroids, but the principles will hold for ships."},{"CreatedByName":"Greenfire32","CreatedById":36705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T22:56:07Z","Content":"oof that\u0027s a tough one.\n\nMy best guess would be to increase your Solar Orbit as much as possible (and as circular as possible, elliptical orbits are hard to rendezvous on) with the stranded Kerbals. Then send a rescue probe (like you\u0027ve done already) about half way there. Then send another probe to re-fuel the first one. Using the first probe, travel the last half of the way and rescue your kerbals. Then fly back to the second probe to re-top off your tanks and then fly home. You may actually need 2 re-fueling probes depending...\n\nThat is probably the most *Kerbal* way of doing it and it\u0027s going to be very time consuming, but if you\u0027re anything like me, those Kerbals\u0027 live are worth it."},{"CreatedByName":"aleis","CreatedById":62823,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T17:53:21Z","Content":"A more kerbal way is to take the craft you used to get that far and just stick it on top of a bigger lifter stage.

Otherwise, you\u0027re in for a boatload of trouble and effort.\n\nIt\u0027s tough to rendezvous with an elliptical orbit. Best bet is to wait a Kerbin year until the major axis is back in line again. Or else use lots of Eve assists.\n\n2K delta-V isn\u0027t going to cut it, obviously. Either strip and relaunch your previous vehicle (as the above posters have mentioned), or build a refueling craft so you can complete your original mission (my suggestion; no one likes to abandon a mission). Using several launches, you can build an enormous refueling craft in LKO with tons of fuel and either 3-4 nukes or a Mainsail (my preference; I hate long burns) and use it to rendezvous and refuel your original mission ship. I once shipped 25,000 units of fuel out to Jool in one gigantic ship.\n\nFor some tips on getting to Moho, here\u0027s a good guide, using multiple Eve and 8 Moho assists. It\u0027s basically god-status, but you can still glean some tips.
