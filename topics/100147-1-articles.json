Unfortunately, at periapsis I didn\u0027t get a Mojo encounter and missed the rendezvous (It looked okay before I time warped...) So now I\u0027ve got a boat load of Kerbals in an elliptical orbit between Kerban and Mojo, with less than 300m/s delta-v left and no hope of getting home on their own. (I\u0027d had hoped to collect some Karbonite from Moho/Kerbol orbit and have a space collector attached, but so far no luck.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve built a refueling mission with a 2000m/s delta-v rescue vehicle and a full orange tank payload in Kerban orbit for my stranded crew, but I\u0027m not sure how to get it to them. I mean, I missed a Mojo rendezvous, and it\u0027s a heck of a lot bigger than my lost-in-space Kerbal\u0027s ship.

Then send a rescue probe (like you\u0027ve done already) about half way there. Then send another probe to re-fuel the first one.

Otherwise, you\u0027re in for a boatload of trouble and effort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s tough to rendezvous with an elliptical orbit. Best bet is to wait a Kerbin year until the major axis is back in line again. Or else use lots of Eve assists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2K delta-V isn\u0027t going to cut it, obviously. Either strip and relaunch your previous vehicle (as the above posters have mentioned), or build a refueling craft so you can complete your original mission (my suggestion; no one likes to abandon a mission). Using several launches, you can build an enormous refueling craft in LKO with tons of fuel and either 3-4 nukes or a Mainsail (my preference; I hate long burns) and use it to rendezvous and refuel your original mission ship. I once shipped 25,000 units of fuel out to Jool in one gigantic ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor some tips on getting to Moho, here\u0027s a good guide, using multiple Eve and 8 Moho assists.
