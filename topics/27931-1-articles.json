The engines use the mass of parts near them to bleed off excess heat, so if there is nothing close by they can\u0027t do that. That measurement is made from the COM of the part, and as it happens the jumbo tank\u0027s COM is outside the range the engine looks at, so the engine doesn\u0027t see it as a heatsink (even though it ought to be about the best part for that purpose).
