I have nothing against those that do but I haven\u0027t explored the limit of the game as is and enjoy some of the inherent challenges (ie. never used mechjeb ever).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust about to launch my first large mission to Laythe. Almost everything is set to go. The Laythe space station, 2 landing probes, the Laythe landing base, 2 fuel depots, the return ship and the Nuclear push phase are already all hooked up in orbit. The only issue I have left is making a SSTO that\u0027s decent enough on the ground to pull up to and away from the fuel depots to allow uninhibited Laythe exploration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy issues with the landing gear:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Steering. They just turn way to slow. Currently my only truly ugly solution has been a set of buggy wheels off the front that when I lower the front gear I can steer with them lowrider style.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. When braking it seems to be all or nothing (no tapping the brakes). This I can live with. The really annoying item is however after I turn off the brakes they stay on for a period of time. Anybody know how to fix this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank-you\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-07T03:53:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe brakes just do that on the stock landing gear, although I find they only stick on for a bit if they have been active for a while \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC*a short tap or 2 or 3 doesn\u0027t usually cause them to stick on. The B9 landing gear, on the other hand, the brakes come off instantly, regardless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no steering with stock gear, that\u0027s why it\u0027s so slow, as it\u0027s not steering at all, but being unwillingly dragged sideways by your plane\u0027s rudder force (or any other yaw force generator, such as vectored thrust, reaction wheels, etc). The B9 gear does have steering, which works fairly nicely. It also has motors, for electrically powered taxiing, which you may find useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, the stock landing gear is just about ok for use on the KSC runway, but pretty poor for any significantly advanced usage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I believe that they may be adding steering to it in 0.23, but not sure if that\u0027s confirmed or a hope-to-do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-07T04:09:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAccording to the latest \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59746-Devnote-Tuesdays-No-Sleep-til-Kerbalkon\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDeveloper Notes\u003C/a\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SQUAD\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SQUAD\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe landing gear are now steerable and tweakable in the editor.
