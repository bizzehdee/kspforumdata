I\u0027d really appreciate some help, either if someone could put together a quick mod to do this or if someone could explain how I could create such a mod myself. \n\nIn career mode, I disliked how I was getting most of my science from contracts, to the point where I wasn\u0027t really bothering to conduct experiments anymore. I now have the Contract Science Modifier mod to remove the science rewards from Contracts, but on its own I\u0027m now having the opposite problem -- I\u0027m struggling to get enough science in the early game to unlock stuff I need to be able to get more science. \n\nSo yes, looking to increase the amount of science that it is possible to gain from any given experiment by say, an extra 50%.
