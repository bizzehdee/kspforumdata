When I start going to places I\u0027ve never returned a Kerbal from before then I\u0027ll return them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBodies I haven\u0027t landed on with a Kerbal yet:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETylo\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaythe\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EDuna\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVall\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBop\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPol\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve and Tylo I don\u0027t know if I could return them. Duna\u0027s atmosphere is scary but it should be easy and I\u0027m currently planning a manned mission to it. Laythe should be easy but I\u0027d have to do it differently to how I normally do things. Vall, Bop, and Pol are all easy but I can\u0027t be bothered to do them individually so I won\u0027t do them until I can make a lander I think could return from Tylo, put that on a ship along with a Laythe-lander and the lander(s) for the other 3, and then land on all of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter sending a manned return mission to Duna, now all that\u0027s left are Eve and Jool\u0027s moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt turns out my fear of Duna was rational. I just barely got back into orbit. That said, I could have designed the lander better to include the return stage then ditch the rest of the lander rather than orbital rendezvousing with the return stage, so Moho (Which took all the fuel in my main lander to land and had too high a surface gravity to get back to orbit with enough fuel to get home, forcing me to make an orbital rendezvous without a completely different design) was technically harder. Duna was still a lot harder than Dres and Eeloo, I was able to land and return from them with no rendezvous and with fuel to spare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EA tip: Your Tylo lander is likely to be multistaged, but if you design it well the final stage can be reused to land on and return from the other three. Just make sure to do Tylo first.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI keep going back and forth between doing that and making the last stage of the Tylo lander really really light. Back in .235, just before .24 came out, I was planning a mission where the lander for the other 3 was the final Tylo stage, but since landing on Tylo with a probe in .24 I\u0027ve been more inclined to just make the last stage of the Tylo lander really light and use something else for the other 3. Taking enough science equipment to get all the data from a surface takes quite a lot of weight, and if the last stage of the Tylo lander is still carrying them then that\u0027s a fundamental limit on how light it can be.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
