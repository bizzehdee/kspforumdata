Demonstrates the new part rotation in the Spaceplane Hangar, which, incidentally, allows you to build things horizontally then launch them vertically by rotating the command pod.

I managed to glide it horizontally at 20m/s vertical speed, I\\\u0027m not sure if it could land at that speed however, so MOAR WHEELS. Fitted with drag chute and emergency chute, just in case. Also, all engines fire on take-off.
