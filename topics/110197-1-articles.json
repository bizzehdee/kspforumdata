I\u0027ve really got back into KSP after ver 1.X (and watching some space stuff on Modern Marvels. \u0022That\u0027s a cool rocket...oh yeah, KSP!\u0022) Still very much a beginner. Managed to land on the Mun several times now without killing everyone aboard the lander, and twice I even managed to land so that the lander was still operational. (Though getting docked again with the return craft still alludes me. Eventually Jeb gave up and returned home without Bill. But Bill had the last laugh as Jeb didn\u0027t survive the landing. He\u0027s still laughing up there, fuel-less in Mun orbit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, back on topic:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems like the buildings at the Kerbal Space Center really don\u0027t like flaming debris falling on them. Which is problematic as I tend to generate such debris getting into the air, and the KSC always seems to start under my flight path. Is the answer to just add parachutes to everything and hope for the best? Will they deploy without being connected to any kind of control? And will that help with later stage recoveries that land much further out?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T05:36:07Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 05:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SignalCorps\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T04:23:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe easiest option is to start your gravity turn early, even just a tiny smidgeon eastwards, before your first stage (SRBs or whatever) needs to drop.
