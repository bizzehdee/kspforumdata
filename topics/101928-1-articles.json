Though, without it the mod will still work. \n\n- [Fix] #117: Fix duplication of the default items on flight revert.\n- [Fix] #140: A part get created on drag in the editor.\n- [Change] Always calculate part volume from its prefab. It\u0027s now consistent but may be not optimal in some cases. E.g. deployable parts that are deployed by default (in the mesh state) will take more space than they used to be. It may result in awkward behavior of containers that were loaded prior to the update.\n- [Change] Add a ModuleManager patch to override stock drills volume since in prefab these parts are deployed and take too much space.\n- [Fix] #141: Stop directly modifying inventory part mass.\n- [Enhancement] #148: Dropped parts get weird names.\n- [Fix] #147: Some parts don\u0027t give usable drag models from prefab.\n- [Fix] #145: Carriable items show as \u0022carried\u0022 in the inventory.\n- [Fix] #142: Settings are always read from file.\n- [Fix] #137: Volume of Drill-O-Matic calculated incorrectly.\n\n**1.2.9 (3 May 2016)**\n\n- [Change] Temporarily set surface attach node as the most preferable for default. It\u0027s a workaround until #134 is fixed.\n- [Fix] #131: Kerbals can\u0027t pull items from Inventories.\n- [Fix] #133: Concrete block doesn\u0027t attach.\n\n**1.2.8 (2 May 2016)**\n\n- [Change] Compatibility change for KSP 1.1.2.\n- [Change] When attaching a part with stack nodes by default prefer \u0022bottom\u0022 and \u0022top\u0022 attach nodes as they are most used ones.\n- [Change] Turn allowPartAttach and allowStaticAttach fields of KISItem into enums. Integers are still accepted but in the new parts using of enum names is encouraged.\n- [Change] Temporarily increase breaking force of equipped items by x10 (up to 50). Old settings of 5 is too weak for such applications as eva chutes. Also see bug #128.\n- [Enhancement] Show error message when \u0022X\u0022 is pressed and no item is equipped.\n- [Enhancement] #117: Auto add common items to the seats.\n- [Fix] #116: Mass limit is not checked when grabbing from inventory.\n- [Fix] #118: Detach of static attached part results in NPE.\n- [Fix] #119: Adding an item into inventory in the editor shows KSP error in the logs.\n- [Fix] #121: In node attach mode the connection points markers get overlapped by the part\u0027s mesh.\n- [Fix] #122: For some parts attach point is wrongly detected.\n- [Fix] #124: Parts with allowPartAttach = 1 still require a tool.\n\n**1.2.7 (21 April 2016)**\n\n- [Change] KSP 1.1 supported!\n- [Change] Increase static attach strength on ground base to prevent joint breakage.\n- [Enhancement] Add new setting in the config to specify key modifiers that activate dragging in editor category list. By default it\u0027s set to None which preserves same behavior as in 1.0.5.\n- [Enhancement] Improved search tags and descriptions in parts.\n- [Fix] Parts got replicated and attachment didn\u0027t work when surface attaching parts onto radial adapter.\n- [Fix] React on joint break on static attached items.\n- [Fix] Match rendering queue of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E pointer to the part\u0027s highlight renderers to prevent overlapping issue.\n- [Fix] Restore highlighting of the hovered part when deselecting a hierarchy.\n- [Fix] Fix bottom attach node on ground base to make it more stable and prevent explosions on physics start.\n\n**1.2.6 (7 April 2016)**\n\nThis version does **NOT** support KSP 1.1 yet! Version 1.2.7 will.\n\n- [Fix]: [#108](https://github.com/KospY/KIS/issues/108): Parts with no attach nodes cannot be static attached.\n- [Change]: Some cleanup to make code more compatible with pre-release of KSP 1.1.\n\n**1.2.5 (22 February 2016)**\n\n- [Feature] #101: Allow configuring EVA inventory hotkeys via a config file.\n- [Fix] #103: Part (not seat) inventory overwritten by crew inventory when transferring crew into it.\n- [Fix] #89: Portable containers revert to previous content when dropped. For now only restrict using of such inventories to not loose items. Which promotes this bug to enhancement.\n\n**1.2.4 (17 February 2016)**\n\n- [Feature] #96: Allow move/attach a group of parts. When grab mode is selected the whole hierarchy is highlited.\n- [Feature]: New mode \u0022Re-dock\u0022 (shortcut: \u0022y\u0022). Allows moving vessels docked to the station. No need to snipe the right part to deatch, the right docking port is found automatically. The port allowed for re-docking are highlighed with green color.\n- [Enhancement] Added semi-black background when showing cursor status and hint text to improve visibility in light scenes.\n- [Enhancement] Detect and fix wrong assemblies that could have created due to a bug in the KSP editor.\n- [Enhancement] Don\u0027t allow (un)equipping when dragging/moving a part.\n- [Enhancement] When stack attaching only consider nodes that don\u0027t allow collisions.\n- [Fix] #87: Correctly handle \u0022revert flight\u0022 action, and stop adding multiple callbacks that slow down editor UI.\n- [Fix] #97: Accept names with dots when overriding part settings in config. E.g. \u0022mumech\\_MJ2\\_AR202\u0022 is correctly tarnslated into \u0022mumech.MJ2.AR202\u0022.\n- [Fix] Don\u0027t equip items when loading non-eva kerbal. When vessel had multiple non-engineer kerbals, and there is one with an equipped screwdriwer an error \u0022cannot quip\u0022 was showing on load.\n\n**1.2.3 (11 November 2015)**\n\n- Compatibility fix for KSP 1.0.5\n\n**1.2.2 (13 August 2015)**\n\n- [Fix] Fixed kerbal items not transfering to pod without internal model\n- [Fix] Fixed missing command seat icon (thx to mongoose)\n- [Fix] Fixed node attach not working for some radial part\n- [Fix] Prevent playing static attach sound after load/warp\n- [Fix] Removed old ILC-18k container .mbm textures\n- [Fix] Converted ISC-6K container textures to DDS\n- [Fix] Fixed minor typo in sound error message (thx to Amorymeltzer)\n\n**1.2.1 (29 July 2015)**\n\n- [Enhancement] Added key (B/N) to move up or down a part in drop mode\n- [Enhancement] Added a dedicated key to put/remove helmet (J)\n- [Enhancement] Added new stackable modules\n- [Enhancement] Added max sound distance parameter for ModuleKISItemSoundPlayer\n- [Enhancement] Added new parameters in moduleKISItem : useExternalPartAttach \u0026 useExternalStaticAttach (for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E or others mods)\n- [Change] Modified the organization of the text keys under cursor\n- [Fix] Fixed editor part dragging\n- [Fix] Removed some unused debug lines\n- [Fix] Fixed eva speed not returning to the default value after moving a carried container to an inventory\n- [Fix] Kerbal headlamp is disabled when helmet is removed\n- [Fix] Prevent helmet sound to play if it cannnot be removed\n\n**1.2.0 (11 July 2015)**\n\n- [New Part] ISC-6K inline container (6 000L)\n- [Enhancement] Added a dedicated key to attach/detach (H)\n- [Enhancement] Part can be detached from parent without grabbing\n- [Enhancement] Explosives can be attached without a tool\n- [Enhancement] Added a GUI to set the timer and radius of explosives\n- [Enhancement] Added different color to attach and drop\n- [Enhancement] Added an dedicated icon for detaching\n- [Enhancement] Allow detaching \u0026 grabbing of part with one parent or children\n- [Enhancement] Added colors to the target part and his parent on detach\n- [Enhancement] Removed attach mass restriction for the wrench\n- [Enhancement] Added a ModuleKISItem parameter : allowStaticAttach (0:false / 1:true / 2:Attach tool needed)\n- [Enhancement] Added a ModuleKISItem parameter : allowPartAttach (0:false / 1:true / 2:Attach tool needed)\n- [Enhancement] Added a ModuleKISItemAttachTool \u0026 ModuleKISPickup parameter to enable/disable part \u0026 static attach\n- [Change] IMC-250 container renamed ILC-18k, max volume reduced from 22000 to 18000\n- [Change] Moved ModuleKISPartStatic to ModuleKISItem\n- [Change] Changed some part description\n- [Change] Increased explosives maxTemp parameter\n- [Change] Updated guide to 1.2\n- [Fix] Compatibility fix for KSP 1.0.4\n- [Fix] Fixed crash on x64 linux\n- [Fix] Fixed wrong position of part attached from inventory\n- [Fix] Prevent part \u0022cloning\u0022 when removing content of a carried container before dropping it\n- [Fix] Fix crash when dropping a part from a carried container\n\n**1.1.5 (31 May, 2015)**\n\n- [Enhancement] Disable jetpack mouse input while dragging\n- [Enhancement] Converted parts textures to DDS\n- [Enhancement] AVC is now used for version check\n- [Enhancement] Added a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E version dependancy check\n- [Enhancement] Added more stackable module (KASModuleHarpoon, ModuleRecycleablePart, CollisionFX)\n- [Fix] launchID is now correctly set for stored parts\n- [Fix] Prevent removing the launch vessel flag of stored parts\n- [Fix] Stored parts must now be recognized by contracts\n- [Fix] Fix static part not attaching when dragged from an inventory\n- [Fix] Prevent vessel switching while dragging an item\n- [Fix] Engineer report take into account the mass update\n- [Fix] OnKISAction method use BaseEventData (prevent \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E crash if \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E is missing)\n- [Fix] Fix two typos in the user manual\n- [Fix] Fix wording for removing helmets.

This items pack is for fun and to show the capabilities of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\nDon\u0027t hesitate to take a look on the wiki to see what you can do with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E is pretty moddable and you can create your own items easily!\n\n**Known issues**\n\n- Small parts dropped can go throught the ground or explode. I recommend to avoid dropping them on the ground directly, and instead drop them on another part (container for exemple)\n\n- EAS-1 External Command Seat cannot be dragged in the inventory because the icon is missing. Hopefully next KSP release will fix this issue.\n\n- If you use tweakscale, parts will not be stackable\n\n- Mirroring a container will not mirror the content. However, you can save a container content using sub-assembly.\n\n**Mods using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E**\n\n[Kerbal Attachment System](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92514-1-0-2-Kerbal-Attachment-System-%28KAS%29-0-5-0)\n\n[Universal storage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/75129-Universal-Storage-1-1-0-2-%28For-KSP-1-0%29-1st-May-2015?highlight=kis)\n\n[Pro Props](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99013-Pro-Props-Wearable-items-for-your-kerbals-Updated-to-KIS%21?highlight=locob)\n\n[OSE-Workshop](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108234-0-90-OSE-Workshop-KAS-Addon-%28v0-1-0-2015-01-23%29)\n\n[Portable Science Container](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106562-1-0-2-KIS-EVA-Portable-Science-Container-and-Transmitter-v1-3)\n\n[Phoenix Industries Cargo Resupply System](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122510-Phoenix-Industries-Cargo-Resupply-System-%28KIS-MechJeb-Compatible%29/)\n\n[Mk3 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E Cargo Containers](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123984-Mk3-KIS-Cargo-Containers?p=1988722#post1988722)\n\n[Pathfinder](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122484-WIP-1-0-2-Pathfinder-Finding-The-Right-Location)\n\n**Planned** \n\n- 2.5m and 3.75m containers \u002B mounts\n- Mechanical help for moving and attaching bigger parts\n- Storing vessels\n- Kerbal parachute\n- Items improvements\n- More items\n- Crafting\n- Building construction\n- ...\n\n**Useful Links**\n\n[User Guide (PDF)](https://github.com/KospY/KIS/blob/master/User%20Guide.pdf?raw=true)\n\n[Wiki](https://github.com/KospY/KIS/wiki) (See the wiki for more information on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E : how to, version history, modding guide, etc...)\n\n[Issue tracker](https://github.com/KospY/KIS/issues)\n\n[License](https://github.com/KospY/KIS/blob/master/LICENSE.md)\n\n[Sources](https://github.com/KospY/KIS)\n\n**Reviews**\n\nSpoiler\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/GI-_25pAfPQ?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/JHQ9exQEX7w?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/OCo1aXWOdwI?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Authors**\n\nKospY : Plugin design and development, C# coding.\n\nWinn75 : Graphic design, 3D Models, textures and user guide.\n\nIgorz : Plugin maintainer, C# coding.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-25T12:02:20Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2016 12:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by KospY**"},{"CreatedByName":"mrmcp1","CreatedById":79657,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T12:00:43Z","Content":"Looks brilliant, a huge improvement of what I believe was already one of the best mods available.
