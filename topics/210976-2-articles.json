That sort of thing is better added as mods if for no other reason than the simple fact that the sort of folks who want that are also the sort of folks who would liberally mod their game.

The issue for me is that once players figure out how to encounter one planet, there\u0027s little reason or increased challenge to encounter any others - just the added tediousness of fiddling with maneuver nodes and having to look up the transfer windows using the calculator. The mechanic gets old very quickly and I wouldn\u0027t bother to play without Principia now, which adds more depth and interest to this part of the game.

The science system and, more generally, career progression is rather bland at the moment and doesn\u0027t really incentivize exploration. All kerbals are largely the same, differing only in their professions and experience levels. Planning gravity assists and other complex maneuvers is extremely difficult with the way the map works. There is no signal delay or probe automation (even more nonsensical for interstellar distances). There is no such a thing as wind, and aerodynamics are quite basic.
