But from xperiece I can tell you this message is most likely  associated with tweakscale which also alters a part mass. WHat might be happening is that Firespitter is expecting the part to have a specific mass but was altered by tweaskcaling, generating this message. IFS has integrated tweakscale while Firespiter relies on tweakscale configs\n\u003E \n\nGah! thanks - Damn message not being specific enough.
