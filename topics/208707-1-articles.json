And did you stage/decouple/(un)dock something since the last time you tried to EVA? Or even just reload a quicksave? That might be the source of the issue: if a crewed part is considered shielded/occluded by a bay/fairing, it won\u0027t allow use of the hatches, ANY hatches on that part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately if there is a way to fix it, I\u0027m not aware of it - in all cases where I encountered this, that part would no longer allow EVA regardless of what I tried, with the same message you\u0027re showing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey added a bit of code at some point that checks parts for being \u0027occluded\u0027 by cargo bay/fairing shielding, with the intent of making the game a bit more realistic. Unfortunately, that code gets it wrong more often than right. One of the most annoying ... let\u0027s call it \u0027features\u0027 ... of that code is that it can randomly decide after a decoupling or (un)docking event that a part that was considered \u0027not occluded\u0027 before, is now somehow occluded and so is suddenly no longer allowed to do whatever it is they felt is \u0027unrealistic\u0027 when in a cargo bay or fairing.
