By any of the FTL proposals, the player would, after some preparations and obstacle-busting, be using his midgame tech to try and explore a whole different system, finding new things to do and new places to go, with the improving technology aiding him in the task.

What we see in Star Trek is a grand vision for what COULD be. Will it shake out to be exactly like that? Who knows, but to blatantly claim that we will never see technology that is like that, is well, foolish. Flight was nothing more than fantasy and something reserved for insects and birds until 2 very brilliant men in Ohio said: you know what? that looks kinda fun, bet we can do that! and guess what? WE DID. Jules Verne made wild claims in the 19th century about space travel, and MANY people thought as you now do that it would never happen and could NOT be done, and what have we done? Stepped foot on the moon, sent probe after probe after probe beyond this planet with 2 very nearly out side the reach of OUR STAR, again, something that a CENTURY ago was IMPOSSIBLE. Do not sell humanity short by claiming something is NOT possible. Hell, look at 20,000 leagues under the sea, impossible technology of underwater ships that stay down there for long duration. oh wait, we do that on a daily basis in the various Navies of the world or the various Scientific submersible vehicles used. They once said it was impossible to touch down on the bottom of the sea, and we sent a sub down to the bottom of the marianas trench and down into Challenger deep. They said man cannot travel faster than sound, that it was impossible to exceed the barrier of sound and we have world air speed records that show that it is possible and back in the day Chuck Yeager did just that, broke MACH 1. They said man cannot drive faster than the speed of sound, and yet: The official land-speed record (measured over one mile) is 1,227.985 km/h (763.035 mi/h) (Mach 1.020), set by Andy Green (UK) on 15 October 1997 in the Black Rock Desert, Nevada, USA, in Thrust SSC. source: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/2000/land-speed-(fastest-car)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/2000/land-speed-(fastest-car)\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoon, there will be an attempt to break 1,000 MILES PER HOUR on the GROUND, will it succeed?

Humanity cannot nor shall it ever be shackled to a limit that some would impose on us, because it is in our very nature to progress, to strive for that next hill, to seek what we do not know. It is not in our nature as humans to say that what we have is enough, that we know enough. Never will the day come when we and our curiosity is satiated and we allow ourselves to stagnate, it is not in our nature. We are the curious, we are the intelligent, we are the ones who have stood up and said we do not know enough, that we want to learn more, that we MUST learn more. We are the people who will push humanity forward into territory never before conceived outside of science fiction and dare to make it a reality. We will never sit down and let questions go unanswered. We do not know what we cannot do, not because we have not done enough, but because we have not stopped to say that we cannot do something. We may not now know how to achieve what the authors of science fiction so readily give us, but we will one day find a way to make those fantasies a reality. That is our responsibility as sentient beings on this planet. It is our duty to step forward and say to each other and then into the stars and heavens above that we will not be denied our place in the cosmic chorus, for we will one day know how to sing you our songs of progress and that day will come sooner rather than later!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-28T12:35:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AlamoVampire\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AlamoVampire\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWho knows, but, NOTHING is impossible.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep dreaming. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmappedout","CreatedById":57281,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-28T12:42:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, he does have a point.
