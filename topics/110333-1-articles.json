This means that the big red button does not decline (what I intuitively believe to be is) a duplicate contract to make room for a new one -- it cancels an active contract, costing me funds and reputation and whatever science payoff I would have gotten. I\u0027ve been bitten by this one twice now. When switching tabs, the contract panel should clear itself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
