Not sure when this was changed, but the Auto-Saved ship used to be notated on the Launch New Mission Window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeaning if you click the Pad or Runway directly to launch a craft, the Auto-Saved ship has the SAME name as the ship that was manually saved. When loading a craft it has [Auto-Saved Ship] at the end of the name, so you can recognize which one it is. However, there is no such label or any form of identification of which craft is which. This gets annoying as I may have made a change and end up loading the wrong one when I go to launch, just to find out I clicked the wrong one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you can see (or not see to be precise), these two craft are actually different, but which one is which?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u00229D46657C95AD88AB8BDD8B527C70012D1FF2EE87\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 src=\u0022https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/811123967458664537/9D46657C95AD88AB8BDD8B527C70012D1FF2EE87/\u0022 width=\u0022935\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my suggestion\u00A0would to either have it show the [Auto-Saved Ship], which could get cut off with long names.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOr better, Italicize the name, or just have it say \u0022Auto-Saved Ship\u0022 (then maybe the name after that for reference).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-05-23T23:47:27Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2019 11:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Red3Tango\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ESuggestions\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-25T05:49:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are not the only one who is annoyed by this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is already a suggestion for this on the bug tracker (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/16806\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elink\u003C/a\u003E)\u003Cbr\u003E\nYour suggested text \u0022Auto-Saved Ship\u0022 is already in the translation dictionary, so\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wish a knew a good workaround.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
