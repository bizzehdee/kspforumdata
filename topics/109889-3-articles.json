And as such it is probably correct. Isp does not care about your mass, payload or whatever. So no, it is very realistic (and probably simply factual). Now it is another question if it allows us to reach 0.25c, but K^2 didn\u0027t say that; he only claimed 0.2c at 4:1 ratio (which by the way is again just a calculation and has nothing to do with future tech). Read up what he claimed and what Isp has to do with this; you said nothing that contradicts what he wrote.\u003Cp\u003EIf you would go for a 16:1 ratio, you could go for ~0.4c (ignoring relativistic effects for simplicity). Therefore more than 0.2c is not fantasy. But maybe not worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHumans needing space/shielding/food is also no concern. There is enough space out there, and enclosing (or shielding) something scales slower than volume (until you reach some other problems, but we probably won\u0027t). Food and other goods (each being a miniscule part of the total mass) can either be recycled or be used for the M/AM reaction; so no waste there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EISP does care about the nozzle, and if the nozzle is degrading because its a soft material in which the lead can undervaporization due to the demands of acceleration. In other words you are basically arguing that it is possible to reach 0.4c with M/AM device when you ignore the weight of lead (one of the most dense materials known to man) and the containment devices, and the AM/M injection devices. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets put it like this, the lead absorbs high energy gamma, that therefore results in heat and the occasional particle production. The higher the g-forces needed, the more heat 1-g worth of acceleration for a huge object is a tremendous amount of energy. That level of energy production will lead to degradation of the blast plate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo 0.4C or 0.25c hardly matters if you are limited to 0.01g acceleration 50 to 80 years spend in acceleration cycles and 100 years spent in transit means payloads become very large. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets put a faux bet on this, in 20 years lets re-address the issue with updated science and see who is more correct. I would be willing to bet that in 20 years times future estimates for maximum acceleration and maximum velocity are closer to my estimates. And as time goes on future estimates of maximum velocity will fall. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm going to go even one step further, in 100 years the highest speed humans will be able to obtain with an unmanned vessel will be under 300,000 m/s (0.001c) and in 1000 years 0.01c and that will just about be the maximum speed humans unmanned strategies ever obtain relative to the sun\u0027s velocity in space. Sending a human into space at either speed would be a suicide mission. I suspect these missions will be conducted on channeled solar EM conduits and some sort of EM/ion drive conversion. This prediction is based on the fact that an easier technology (fusion power) is well behind schedule and not likely to be implimented in space in the next 100 years, maybe 1000 years and is heavy technology. The anti-matter/matter devices will prove to have a size limitation (probably on the order of milligrams per containment unit) and require a magnitude more development time. At 0.01c going to a goldilocks planet would likely take 1000 to 10000 years, and therefore manned missions are not going to be possible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts amazing that people who are dead set against the cannae drive can be so convinced by the musings of anti-matter fantasizers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T16:44:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESimulated is the key word.
