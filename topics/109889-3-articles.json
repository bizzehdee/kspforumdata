And as such it is probably correct. Isp does not care about your mass, payload or whatever. So no, it is very realistic (and probably simply factual). Now it is another question if it allows us to reach 0.25c, but K^2 didn\u0027t say that; he only claimed 0.2c at 4:1 ratio (which by the way is again just a calculation and has nothing to do with future tech). Read up what he claimed and what Isp has to do with this; you said nothing that contradicts what he wrote.\n\u003E If you would go for a 16:1 ratio, you could go for ~0.4c (ignoring relativistic effects for simplicity). Therefore more than 0.2c is not fantasy. But maybe not worth it.\n\u003E \n\u003E Humans needing space/shielding/food is also no concern. There is enough space out there, and enclosing (or shielding) something scales slower than volume (until you reach some other problems, but we probably won\u0027t). Food and other goods (each being a miniscule part of the total mass) can either be recycled or be used for the M/AM reaction; so no waste there.\n\nISP does care about the nozzle, and if the nozzle is degrading because its a soft material in which the lead can undervaporization due to the demands of acceleration. In other words you are basically arguing that it is possible to reach 0.4c with M/AM device when you ignore the weight of lead (one of the most dense materials known to man) and the containment devices, and the AM/M injection devices. \n\nLets put it like this, the lead absorbs high energy gamma, that therefore results in heat and the occasional particle production. The higher the g-forces needed, the more heat 1-g worth of acceleration for a huge object is a tremendous amount of energy. That level of energy production will lead to degradation of the blast plate. \n\nSo 0.4C or 0.25c hardly matters if you are limited to 0.01g acceleration 50 to 80 years spend in acceleration cycles and 100 years spent in transit means payloads become very large. \n\nLets put a faux bet on this, in 20 years lets re-address the issue with updated science and see who is more correct. I would be willing to bet that in 20 years times future estimates for maximum acceleration and maximum velocity are closer to my estimates. And as time goes on future estimates of maximum velocity will fall. \n\nIm going to go even one step further, in 100 years the highest speed humans will be able to obtain with an unmanned vessel will be under 300,000 m/s (0.001c) and in 1000 years 0.01c and that will just about be the maximum speed humans unmanned strategies ever obtain relative to the sun\u0027s velocity in space. Sending a human into space at either speed would be a suicide mission. I suspect these missions will be conducted on channeled solar EM conduits and some sort of EM/ion drive conversion. This prediction is based on the fact that an easier technology (fusion power) is well behind schedule and not likely to be implimented in space in the next 100 years, maybe 1000 years and is heavy technology. The anti-matter/matter devices will prove to have a size limitation (probably on the order of milligrams per containment unit) and require a magnitude more development time. At 0.01c going to a goldilocks planet would likely take 1000 to 10000 years, and therefore manned missions are not going to be possible. \n\nIts amazing that people who are dead set against the cannae drive can be so convinced by the musings of anti-matter fantasizers."},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T16:44:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Simulated is the key word.

In this case this is not a problem.\n\nBecause we can launch several crafts, they are so light and they require so few materials that once you can make one in space, you can make many more with low cost.

Not this century.\n\nI agree that antimatter in any commercial non-purely-scientific use is centuries away. The stuff takes a small country\u0027s worth of energy to create a visible amount, and said amount can\u0027t currently be contained for more than a few minutes. Also remember that antimatter is extremely dangerous. Just 1 gram of it combining with one gram of normal matter creates a 43 kiloton explosion. For comparison, the *nuclear* bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki only had yields of 15 and 20 kilotons. And this is just from one gram of antimatter, an interstellar spaceship will need several tons of it, enough to wipe off a large continent.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E At 1% ligth-speed, it take 500 years to go to proxima centaury.\n\u003E \n\u003E  At 10%, 50 years. More reseonable. We need 30 000 000 m/s DeltaV So, the launch will be for 2050, you have 35 years for finding that.\n\nYour calculations are slightly off. At 0.1c the trip to the centauris will only take 43 years. But that still means that to get there in this century we will need to launch it in 2057. Good luck getting any kind of 0.1c propulsion system by then.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Wouldn\u0027t in-space resource mining make it viable to construct a sort of interstellar highway, consisting of giant lasers or particle cannons, built and maintained by automated spacecraft, which in turn are also built in Space in part or in whole, as well as ships to make use of those beams? Of course, there would need to be some kind of justification to travel between Stars. Habitable worlds maybe?\n\nHabitable worlds to would certainly be a large motivator for interstellar travel, like in *Civilisation: Beyond Earth*. The only problem with the giant laser-sail network you propose is the energy requirements. If you look here ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_travel)) and look at the beamed propulsion section, a manned expedition to epsilon eridani requires 75 *million* gigawatts of power. Good luck finding a way to power the laser, or even design one that could cope with such energy.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Even if we have technology which we don\u0027t it\u0027s still hardly possible. There must be economic reasons behind it. We haven\u0027t even explored the Solar system. There are centuries of work ahead just to explore the neighboring space. Then, perhaps, we might be in position to start thinking about interstellar travel.\n\nAgreed. Once we have colonized the moon, Mars, Venus, Ceres and the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, and have built huge solar collectors on mercury, and have a few space elevators on earth, the moon and mars, then we can begin interstellar expansion. But only then.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t expect any breakthrough in propulsion methods in the near future so, velocities of about 100-150 km/s will probably be our limit for quite some time (very optimistic estimation).\n\nThis is actually pessimistic if you ask me. With modern technology, Nuclear-electric ion or magnetoplasma drives can probably bring the limit up around 600km/s, or 0.002c. Even with this, though, the centauris are still 2150 years away. Good luck keeping any sort of spaceship operating from now all the way to the year ~4200.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E If humanity would focus efforts on Fusion power (more than some side-show called ITER that is more often used for political purposes to show Fusion is not viable and we should continue to encourage oil and coal extraction), we could manage probes that could travel at significant portions of the speed of light...\n\nThis, fusion propulsion, will probably be our answer. Icarus interstellar has already designed 4 fusion probes for alpha centauri, and they all seem doable for the 23rd-century space community.\n\n[http://www.icarusinterstellar.org/a-ship-called-resolution-project-icarus-workshop-update-14/](http://www.icarusinterstellar.org/a-ship-called-resolution-project-icarus-workshop-update-14/)\n\n[http://www.icarusinterstellar.org/meet-firefly-project-icarus-workshop-update-24/](http://www.icarusinterstellar.org/meet-firefly-project-icarus-workshop-update-24/)\n\n[http://www.icarusinterstellar.org/project-icarus-workshop-update-34-the-ghost-ship/](http://www.icarusinterstellar.org/project-icarus-workshop-update-34-the-ghost-ship/)\n\n[http://www.icarusinterstellar.org/ultra-dense-deuterium-fueled-starship-project-icarus-workshop-update-44/](http://www.icarusinterstellar.org/ultra-dense-deuterium-fueled-starship-project-icarus-workshop-update-44/)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Nuclear Salt Water Rocket.\n\nThis is even more environmentally scary than an orion drive. It is basically a continuously detonating orion drive with several times as much radioactive death coming out. Good luck getting permission to use one within a million kilometers of an inhabited area.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I think we have a decent chance... if another Cold War happens and we have to race Russia (or whoever) to the next star.\n\nFirstly, are you referring to the Cold War II *that we are witnessing right now*? Even if there is a Cold War III, it will never see a space race to another star. The timescales and resources involved are simply unsuited to a political rivalry. By the time the probes get there, the competing nations that launched them will have completely changed to the point where the rivalry that launched the probes will be a distant memory.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E United world government might speed things up...\n\nThat will never happen. Never. It is impossible for a species like us to all merge as one nation. If other planetary colonies become their own nations, that might make it slightly more likely.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 1. No Money\n\u003E \n\u003E  2. No Interrest\n\nThe money is there, it is just being spent on killing people in the middle east and elsewhere, and technology that will make killing those people faster and more efficient.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Political structure is too immature and self centred for forward thinking beyond 5 years on average.\n\nFor the most forward-thinking countries, like China and India, the maximum \u0027government visibility\u0027 is about 5-10 years. For America it is more like 1 year, and for Australia it is about 2 weeks.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Starting off or getting there?\n\u003E \n\u003E I fully expect us to get the mining of asteroids going which will lead to build industry in space then large habitats.\n\u003E \n\u003E These habitats will become more and more wonderfully heaven like.\n\u003E \n\u003E Some will have very large populations. Billions of people. We are probably well out of this century here...\n\u003E \n\u003E At some point one of these will have a fall out with the rest of us and choose to fly off to avoid the controls and laws of the rest of humanity. See the Mayflower. \n\u003E \n\u003E The journey to the next stars taking 150 years is not a problem when you are a billion people doing all the things that any advanced economy does.\n\nSpace colonies with billions of people? Habitats being self-sustaining for hundreds of years? Interstellar colonisation is easier than that.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E We have propulsion necessary for a generational ship...We have the ABILITY for orbital construction, we just haven\u0027t ever done it on a grandish scale. We wouldn\u0027t need \u0022massive\u0022 access to orbit, we\u0027d just need to redesign our current launches to accommodate people rather than robots. We have the resources required for regenerative food production.\n\u003E \n\u003E  Am I saying it\u0027s easy? No. Am I saying it\u0027s do-able? Yes. The only bit that stands in our way RIGHT NOW is the cost it would take to do something like that. And not \u0022cost\u0022 as in purely monetary definitions, but the cost of life, the cost of materials, the cost of fuel.\n\nThe materials do build an interstellar generation ship do exist on earth. If we can\u0027t find enough resources on our national soil we can clear out and mine Greenland or Antarctica. The technologies mostly exist, although there are still unresolved problems. However, generation ships are a concept doomed from the start. You can not have a society in a pressurized, confined area that will remain peaceful for more than a century or so. It is statistically certain that at some point, somebody onboard will sabotage the mission, and it only takes a tiny event to kick off a civil unrest that will inevitably escalate. And it only takes one carefully-placed bomb to blow a hole in the ship and kill everyone onboard. Any manned mission taking more than 100 years should not be attempted at all.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Humanity is on the verge of destroying its nest. By the end of this century there will be no fuels left for propulsion; we will need a technological breakthrough just to survive, let alone try to explore the universe.

It provides a very detailed look at how climate change alone can and will kill billions of people very rapidly in the second half of the 21st century. It also shows why there will be no real motive to prevent the collapse until it is far too late. Leaving earth is not a matter of \u0027In the unlikely event bad things happen we will survive\u0027, it is a matter of \u0027Bad things are going to happen and we need to survive\u0027.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E What if we can make our probes with few kg of material?\n\u003E \n\u003E  We just need to master technologies as graphene, CNT and 3d printing.\n\u003E \n\u003E  We can build these solar sails using 3d print spiders in space, with all instruments printed over the same sail.\n\u003E \n\u003E  You can make a solar sail with a density close to 0.01g/m2, this mean that you can make a fly-by very close to the sun (heat is not a problem) which it will provide huge accelerations, this allow speeds close to 6% light speed without using propellent or earth energy.\n\u003E \n\u003E  They can brake using the same technique in destination, and go everywhere you want in that solar system.\n\u003E \n\u003E  The sail can change is shape to act as a huge parabolic mirror to alow interplanetary comunications with low energy requirements.\n\u003E \n\u003E  You just detach the laser emissor/receptor to reach the focal point of the sail, then return the emissor to the craft after the comunication is done.\n\u003E \n\u003E  I dint enter in details to not make a huge post, but I am confident that I can answer each criticism that you might found about this.\n\u003E \n\u003E  As someone else mention, the speed in interstellar travel is an issue, because if you reach 0.05c in some moment, you will double that speed few decades later which it can surpass the older mission. In this case this is not a problem.\n\u003E \n\u003E  Because we can launch several crafts, they are so light and they require so few materials that once you can make one in space, you can make many more with low cost. So you keep launching these sails to all stars, this allow a continuity flow of data from everywhere.\n\nWe still need to master the materials technology to make such a sail ship.

Besides your craft is in wet mode with several tons.\n\nMagnetic sails are good to brake as you said, but they are good to slow down from very fast speeds to lower speeds, is like a car and the air friction, at 500 km/h it will lose speed super fast, at 200km less, and at 10km/h (if we ignore wheel friction) it will keep moving a long time.\n\nMag sails to brake from 95% light speed to 10% are very good, to brake those last 10% not so much, more taking into account that you need to save some fuel to brake the last km/s of deltav, so your craft still count as wet mass.\n\nHere you have an study taking into account with and without mag sails for Icarus:\n\n[http://www.academia.edu/4133057/Braking_via_Magnetic_Sails_vs_Two_Stage_Fusion_Rockets](http://www.academia.edu/4133057/Braking_via_Magnetic_Sails_vs_Two_Stage_Fusion_Rockets)\n\nThey lower by a lot the intial wet mass of the ship with magnetic sails, but the travel time increase to 100 years to alpha centauri, that is how much takes to brake at that speed.\n\nAbout the solar sail erosion against the interstellar dust..\n\nYou have 0.1 atoms /cm3, the distance to alpha centauri is 9x10^16^cm, the graphene density is 3,8x10^15^ atoms/cm2, not all atoms will hit another atom in the sail, but we can said that it will need some kind of shielding for sure.\n\nSo to avoid that, once the acceleration ends (leaving the solar system) the solar sail rotates to be parallel to the direction of motion. Then we use the external mag sail to shield against the interstellar dust without lose much speed.\n\nLike this graphic:\n\n![interstellar_solar_sail.jpg](http://s20.postimg.org/yvclvjsvx/interstellar_solar_sail.jpg)\n\nThe sail at launch will have an external layer to provide extra mass to achieve a good sun diving and extra thrust due evaporation when reach the sun periapsis.\n\nIt will have magnetic rails, with superconductor tiny masses that will move as any maglev train. That would help to control the sail, you can change the speed of the sail spin which provide the centrifuged force, also it can shape and balance loads over the sail. It helps to rotate, shape or different movements that the sail may need. To allow extra control when we dont have solar pressure, we can have tiny lasers and mirrors, the light bounce 1000 times so ir provides a descent net force.\n\nSo this sail would need just more advances in nanotechnology and 3d printing. I guess in 2055 it may be possible to start with the first launch test, and in 2970/80 start with the first mission.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-22T00:29:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2015 12:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AngelLestat**"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T01:55:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This, an major fail in Avatar, made more fun with the short traveling time, had energy had any cost at all they would used some more time traveling. \n\u003E If you have unlimited electricity the setting don\u0027t make much sense. \n\u003E \n\u003E ---\n\u003E \n\u003E how is 0.7 civilization calculated, human energy production is just an tiny faction of the sunlight earth receive. 0.01% I belive.\n\nCarl Sagan formulated it. \n\nLog base 10 of the civilazation\u0027s power output in Watts(I think...) minus 6, all over 10."}]}
