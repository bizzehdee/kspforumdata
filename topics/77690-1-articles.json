One big feature of the Mission Editor is being able to add events and actions to the missions. This means that if a certain condition is fulfilled, an action takes place, so for example, when the vessel has reached a certain altitude, the screen could be frozen, there could be a message box etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFemale Kerbals\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe thought it would be a good idea to have female names for the Kerbals as well as male names as the Kerbals are going to classrooms.
