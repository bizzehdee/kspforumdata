It may have been a glitch in the matrix or I had reloaded a previous save which I didn\u0027t have the contract. I hadn\u0027t realised it had gone until I landed the mun lander to perform it and wondered why it didn\u0027t complete. It wasn\u0027t listed in the active, archive or to be accepted lists so I just shrugged and got on with the game - I completed 3 other contracts and now the one that had disappeared is back!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027ve accepted it - how do I \u0027pretend\u0027 that I completed it without having to do it all over again. I have the lander on the ground but the contact says it needs to be one built specifically after I accepted the contract. I\u0027m thinking the best way would be to dial back when I accepted it in the persist file but not sure how to do that and if that would trick ksp in to thinking its an old contract or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks in advance \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-26T16:12:40Z\u0022 title=\u002209/26/2014 04:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by psyper\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TechnicalK3rbal","CreatedById":86903,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-26T14:55:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealt-f12 opens the debug log, go to contracts, click COM next to the one you want finished, and its done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor you can do some editing of the time in the persistent.sfs file, but that causes... problems...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"psyper","CreatedById":90641,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-26T16:12:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eits only cheating if it wasn\u0027t to get round the bug that I seemed to have picked up - thanks for that \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TechnicalK3rbal","CreatedById":86903,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-26T19:19:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022psyper\u0022 data-cite=\u0022psyper\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eits only cheating if it wasn\u0027t to get round the bug that I seemed to have picked up - thanks for that \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lot of people consider any use of the debug menu cheating, so...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-26T20:13:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had this myself too, howver I lost all contracts and got back the explore Eve and Duna at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly serious contract issue I have had.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
