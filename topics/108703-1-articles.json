The Earth is big, really big, absolutely humongous, but compared to the Solar system, it\u0027s just a speck of dust. And the Solar system is an even smaller speck of dust compared to our galaxy, while the galaxy is hardly even there compared to the size of the observable Universe, and we know nothing about the rest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I was a kid, I contemplated making some sort of a scale model of the Solar system, but concluded that in order to have the Earth and Moon big enough to be visible, my house wouldn\u0027t be big enough to contain the model.

I was obsessed with black holes, too, and bought any and every space book I came across with any mention of them, hoping to find out just a little bit more. Silly me didn\u0027t realize that there wasn\u0027t much more to them that we knew about. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I saw a Space Shuttle launch. It was many years ago, now. I think it was Discovery, maybe Atlantis. That was so, so cool. Space was one of the biggest interests in my life. I saw at least one more, a night launch. Brilliant clouds of bright smoke fading to black as they got farther from the pad, the terrain across the bay lighting up like a miniature sun was rising... the utter silence. It stretched for many seconds before the sound reached me, a great rumbling, roaring, crackling sound, like a wildfire.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d learned as much as I could, I realized, around the seventh or sixth grade. I lost a lot of my interest in space then, instead focusing on aviation. Microsoft Flight Simulator X was just about as obsessive as KSP is now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my freshman year at high school, my friend decided to show me KSP. I made an ill-fitted aircraft, which almost flew, before the class had ended. I was hooked. Soon after, I downloaded the demo, (demo version 0.18.1 or so) and spent a month or so trying to get to the Mun. Then more time trying to land, and yet more getting back. I wanted to try rendezvous next, and got two ships within 2,000 meters of each other. No docking ports, though. I bought the full game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then space changed for good. I knew what Delta-V was. I found Hohmann transfers, and ballistic trajectories, and phase angles. Isp, TWR, gravity turns, aerobraking, slingshots, free return trajectories... it was amazing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that is my space story. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adsii1970","CreatedById":89014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T12:15:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JoshuaMinchew\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JoshuaMinchew\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m a youth who loves space.

I remember being glued to the evening news when the STS Enterprise went through all the glide tests in the 1970s, I remember watching the night sky as Skylab reentered the Earth\u0027s atmosphere over Hawaii (Dad was stationed at Schofield Barracks). Moving every two or three years, depending on my Dad\u0027s orders, I learned to take the larger boxes and turn them into complex \u0022cardboard\u0022 spacecraft. With a box of crayons, tape, a ruler, and scissors, I could turn any box I could climb into into a shuttle, a Colonial Viper, or just a command module/LEM. I would imagine what it would be like to land on those far away planets, to explore them as did Kirk and Spock, and to write about them in a notebook. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOver the years, I have marveled at the night sky and everything I can see with the various telescopes I have owned over the years. When I look out at the moons and rings of Saturn, the polar ice cap of Mars, I cannot help but to wonder when mankind will set out on the ultimate voyage of discovery and wish that I could join them. I fully believe Issac Asimov was right when he said:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHumanity has the stars in its future, and that future is too important to be lost under the burden of juvenile folly and ignorant superstition.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince those days of childhood, I have gone through many telescopes, nearly 10 years of Astronomy magazine, and few editions of Popular Science that caught my eye. I play this game because I love space. I still watch sci-fi (not sci-fi horror) because I want to see what others envision with space. I even watch those bad documentaries on BBC about manned missions to Mars, Venus, and even the asteroid belt for the same reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EON A SIDE NOTE:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E To echo what others have said, it is really a bad idea to throw your personal contact information on-line, even in this forum.
