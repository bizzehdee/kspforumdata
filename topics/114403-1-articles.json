I have been using Shadow Play since it released. It is built into newer GPU\u0027s (at least as far back as the 670) and since all the captures are being done at a GPU level is it very low resources usage. It has the ability to capture the last 10 seconds to last 2 minutes of gameplay with the push of a button, as opposed to something that is always capturing video and filling up your hard drive. So you are not sorting through a bunch of raw footage trying to find that one scene you want to use. Instead you can retroactively capture say the last 30 seconds of video if you did something you want to save. If your launch scene did not work out the way you want, then don\u0027t hit the save video key and try again. IF you have an AMD card, then I do not know.
