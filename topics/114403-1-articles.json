For older videos on my channel, I have used ezvid, although I\u0027m wondering if there\u0027s anything better out there. I\u0027m looking for something that ideally would be free, could be imported into sony vegas, and has no watermark. Ezvid fulfills all of these, but it\u0027s quality is a bit lower than what I would prefer. If I can\u0027t find anything else, I\u0027ll stick to this.\n\n**Editing Software**\n\nWhat editing software would be best? I use an old version of Sony Vegas, although I\u0027m wondering if there would be any better ones out there. I would prefer something that\u0027s free since I can\u0027t pay for any of this.\n\n**Mods**\n\nWhat good KSP mods could I use for this? I primarily need a camera mod, but am not sure if there\u0027s any other mods out there useful for filming.\n\nEDIT 2: what good visual mods could I use. i know I\u0027d want a good skybox, and also things like clouds. I already have texturereplacer, but where could I get other visual mods that add things like clouds?\n\n**Any other advice?**\n\nNot sure if there\u0027s anything else that would be nice to know before making a KSP short film. If there is, please post it here!\n\nEDIT:\n\n1 more that I forgot:\n\n**What good songs could I use as soundtracks for the film?**\n\nI generally want to avoid using songs with voice(since IMO they don\u0027t sound as good).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T23:26:10Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 11:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Clockwork13**"},{"CreatedByName":"jedensuscg","CreatedById":76475,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T00:22:01Z","Content":"Environmental Visual Enhancements is to my knowledge the only mod that creates nicer graphics outside of the limited stuff Texture Re-placer dies (which seems to focus on suits and skyboxes).

I have been using Shadow Play since it released. It is built into newer GPU\u0027s (at least as far back as the 670) and since all the captures are being done at a GPU level is it very low resources usage. It has the ability to capture the last 10 seconds to last 2 minutes of gameplay with the push of a button, as opposed to something that is always capturing video and filling up your hard drive. So you are not sorting through a bunch of raw footage trying to find that one scene you want to use. Instead you can retroactively capture say the last 30 seconds of video if you did something you want to save. If your launch scene did not work out the way you want, then don\u0027t hit the save video key and try again. IF you have an AMD card, then I do not know. Shadow Play is enabled and controled via the Nvidia GeForce Experience panel.\n\nAs for sounds or music, check out Youtubes Free Audio Library. It\u0027s a collection of free to use music (without lyrics) that you can download and attach to your videos. A lot of it is styled to sound like movie score music, but they have something from every genre.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music](https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music)\n\nI just used Widows Movie Maker honestly, though it is not very feature filled it was free and on my computer already.\n\nAll of the above (minus the KSP mods of course) are what I used for making video shorts for Planetside 2.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-28T00:26:02Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2015 12:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jedensuscg**"},{"CreatedByName":"Clockwork13","CreatedById":100102,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T01:02:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Environmental Visual Enhancements is to my knowledge the only mod that creates nicer graphics outside of the limited stuff Texture Re-placer dies (which seems to focus on suits and skyboxes).

I remember awhile back I did a career trying to do IVA only. It was hard but with RPM as well as the many mods that plug into it (mechjeb, vessel view, cameras, etc) it was doable and fun. However for a film type video, imagine having scenes from inside the flight deck looking out the window at a planet or an asteroid looming on over the window. Even if you don\u0027t actually FLY with IVA, all the realistic details RPM adds makes IVA look much neater than the stock interior from a cinematic standpoint. There is also a mod (or used to be not sure if it\u0027s updated\u0022 called prob control room that allows you to IVA with a probe. It is essentially a room with a main screen and several computer displays set up like a small version of Mission Control, where you set up all the RPM screens.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-28T02:46:33Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2015 02:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jedensuscg**"},{"CreatedByName":"Clockwork13","CreatedById":100102,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T04:10:36Z","Content":"I will try it then.
