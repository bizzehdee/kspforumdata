For first time I thought that rovers would be useful in career, because of all that visual scans. What rovers/probes are missing are crew report and surface samples. Easy solution is drill for better surface samples than kerbals hand and camera for crew report.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this kind of mod exist please post the link.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFly with safe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Volcanix","CreatedById":117245,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-25T10:26:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would recommend this, it adds new ways of gaining science by rovers and probes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64972-DMagic-Orbital-Science-New-Science-Parts-V0-7-1-%283-12-14%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64972-DMagic-Orbital-Science-New-Science-Parts-V0-7-1-%283-12-14%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I haven\u0027t heard of mods that add a camera for making crew reports. You could think about building a small rover with a Kerbal in it, using this cockpit, for example: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Mk1_Inline_Cockpit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Mk1_Inline_Cockpit\u003C/a\u003E (It\u0027s the Mk1 inline cockpit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could set up a base where you process Surface samples, you know, this thing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Mobile_Processing_Lab_MPL-LG-2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Mobile_Processing_Lab_MPL-LG-2\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that it uses up a lot of electricity and needs 2 Kerbals in order to work.
