So the Idea was that I would not have to fly in and out of the Cargo bay, instead the arm would swing the Docking Port (incl. Lander) out of the Cargo bay into a 90\u00B0 angle, which would make it much easier (and cooler looking) to dock and un-dock that little \u0022captains barge\u0022. But as it turns out, the connection Arm -\u003E Docking Port has absolutely no stabilizing effect. It is just a point connection and the Lander pivots around it. Just swinging which ever way it pleases. The docking port stays firmly attached to the arm, but only in the one point it freely pivots around.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So the Question is: Is there any way (or mod) which would make this work ? Because a) its freakin\u0027 cool and b) I foresee a bunch of explosions and dead Kerbonauts in the near future if i have to maneuver in and out of that tight cargo bay.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E P.S.: I am aware that i could stabilize the Lander with struts but that would defeat the purpose of it leaving and returning(!) to the main vessel. Also i do have the mod (Kerbal Joint Reinforcements) installed that supposedly reinforces joints but its not helping here. In fact there doesn\u0027t seem to be any kind of stress on the joint at all. It doesn\u0027t even try to keep the docking port in place.\n\u003E \n\nSo while this more general question is hopefully answered elsewhere, what I want to ask in this thread specifically is: How exactly are those Robot Parts supposed to work, if they can\u0027t keep whatever is attached to them steady ? Am i missing something here ?\n\nHere is a screenshot of what it should do. Only it doesn\u0027t do it instead it swings the lander around like a wrecking ball. The movement of the arm works flawlessly but the Docking port swings freely around that \u0022one point connection\u0022 with the folding arm.\n\n![Zta4nVn.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Zta4nVn.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-16T02:50:03Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2016 02:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by John Kermin**"},{"CreatedByName":"kcs123","CreatedById":127158,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-16T06:56:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, John Kermin said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E How exactly are those Robot Parts supposed to work, if they can\u0027t keep whatever is attached to them steady ?

That is with KJR and as you can see i put parts between IR and the docking port. Active struts sound amazin, only they dont help with something like that because I can only activate them when/if/as long as the part is inside the cargo bay. Now admittedly this is at full Kerbin gravity but it just shows the problem. If it would work correctly the joint would at least try to lift the Lander and then break.\n\nSince it is obviously bugged, is there any other known way i can accomplish the goal (move the Lander in and out of the Cargo bay for Start/Docking) that would work as intended ?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-16T15:09:52Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2016 03:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by John Kermin**"},{"CreatedByName":"nachomaiz","CreatedById":151749,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-16T17:40:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, Cerberus738 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Clipping through IR parts and having docking ports attached directly to IR parts seem to cause some fun glitches.\n\u003E \n\nThanks for the advice.
