According to sources, the kerbonauts secretly went to the purple world by the cover of night to plant a flag depicting a purple heart and the words \u0022I Love You\u0022 in small cursive underneath. The location, in Eve\u0027s polar regions, has been declared the \u0027Mom Desert\u0027. The plaque reads:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I love you, mom. \u0026lt;3\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApparently, this is in celebration of Mother\u0027s Day, specifically for the mother of the Director of the Jedi Space Program, who\u0027s favorite color is purple. The kerbonauts are both relatives of the Director, but he won\u0027t say in what capacity. The two will not be leaving Eve due to the gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EI love you, mom.\u003C/em\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_kiss.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:kiss:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
