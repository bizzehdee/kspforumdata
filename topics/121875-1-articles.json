An interesting solution to this would be an RCS part that can be moved by Kerbals on EVA (perhaps generically, perhaps as an engineer skill). The idea would be that the player could build a tug with this part, dock the tug with a station module, then move the tug\u0027s RCS to line up with the center of mass of the tug-module assembly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RidingTheFlow","CreatedById":111197,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-28T09:07:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would prefer smarter RCS stock controller.
