When kOS gets enough support for operating parts\u0027 controls that it can retarget antennas, that will help with the latter, although it will still take some forethought to make sure relays that are on rails don\u0027t need to retarget.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only way to cover multiple targets with a dish right now is to target the planet or moon they\u0027re orbiting with a dish that has a wide enough cone to cover all of the desired targets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Climberfx","CreatedById":57126,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-25T20:26:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lammatt\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lammatt\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eyes, but i am having a strange issue now that point at kerbin doesnt quite work, has to point at a specific satellite, rendering a satellite constellation meaningless\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is some antenas have a narrow cone of communication.

I guess that assumption was incorrect: dishes can only talk to dishes and omnis can only talk to omnis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MeCripp\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MeCripp\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEDIT- This might help too \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ryohpops.github.io/kspRemoteTechPlanner/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ryohpops.github.io/kspRemoteTechPlanner/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat link only helps with calculating coverage in orbit around a single body, it does not discuss inter-planetary comms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs long as I remember that dishes only talk to dishes, omnis only talk to omnis, then I\u0027ll be fine. That little tidbit isn\u0027t mentioned anywhere in the Wiki or in this thread...as far as I can find after multiple searches...so now that I know this I can get a commsat into Kerbin polar orbit with a dish (target at the Mun) and a large omni to connect to the Kerbin network.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Ok, while reading the Basic Rules section of the Wiki again I saw the part about how \u0022both satellites must have an antenna that can reach as far as the other satellite.\u0022 So dish-dish and omni-omni is not actually correct...it comes down to the fact that both antenna must be able to reach each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in the example provided:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EExample: a probe with a Communotron 16 antenna (range 2500 km) and a probe with a CommTech-1 dish (350,000,000 km) are located 3000 km apart. Although the CommTech-1 is one of the most powerful dishes in RemoteTech, the two probes cannot link because the first probe can never link to anything more than 2500 km away \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 unless, of course, it has a longer-range antenna in addition to the Communotron 16.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the CommTech-1 dish was within 2500km of the Communotron 16 then they could create a link, even though one is a dish and the other is an omni.
