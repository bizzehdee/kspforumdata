But lunch that from high up where the air is thin then it should have no problem reaching orbit so stick some airship parts and you do fine with just one engine. I have not used the airship mod but I guess that it will help the the landing. (not that landing anything that small on eve it a problem. The thick air helps when landing.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERocketPlane:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not use good with aircraft but I think you could take of with one with a TWR of 1:3 so that meens 5 x FL-T800 for the plane stages and 5 x FL-T400 for the rocket stages. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 engine ideas:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStock rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5 FL-T400 Fuel Tank aspague stage ship works for the upperstages. The lower stages you use the you use a main sail with 7 core aspague stage ship. I think you can use the 9 ton tanks which should give you TWR of 1:1 but maybe you have to swap out 2 of the tanks for the 4.5 ton ones. Also you could try using more then 5 FL-T400 on the upperstage yes you would have a TWR\u0026lt;1 but you would of just go a kick from the mainsail so while you would be slowing down for a short time it should not be a problem. No idea if this will work but I cant think of anyway to get more delta-v with 2 engines on eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have not had time test much yet.
