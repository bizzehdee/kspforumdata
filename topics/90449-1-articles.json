But I would strongly recommend going with at least four physical cores, and at least 600 series GeForce GPU.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModern games are getting better and better at utilizing multiple cores, and 4 cores is the typical target. (In part, because XBox One runs 4 cores.) Having multiple cores also improves your multi-tasking performance, so if you are recording or streaming, a CPU with 4\u002B cores will keep things running smoothly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EnVidia introduced \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.geforce.com/geforce-experience/shadowplay\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EShadowPlay\u003C/a\u003E with their 600 GeForce series. It was developed primarily for their Shield tech, but one of the advantages is that it lets you stream or record gameplay without tying up your CPU for encoding. In other words, you can be recording your gameplay without any performance degradation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a solid mid-range PC, I\u0027d build it around an Intel Core i5-3750K Ivy Bridge CPU and probably GeForce GTX 760 graphics card.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rest of the components don\u0027t make a huge difference. You just want everything to be compatible, and you want it to be reliable. For the later, check reviews. Personally, I try to stick with ASUS motherboards, but that might be personal bias. Basically, if you go with 3750K CPU above, just start looking for an LGA 1155 board that has all the features you want and has the size that matches your tower. It also needs to have a slot for your graphics card (PCI Express 3.0 for basically anything modern), but hardly any motherboard these days doesn\u0027t come with at least one. (And you only need multiple if you plan to SLI, which is not really a mid-range sort of thing to do.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn LGA 1155 board will also almost certainly come with DDR3 RAM slots, so you\u0027ll need to pick DDR3 memory. At least 8GB for a mid-range. I like Corsair, but again, read reviews. And the board will also come with some number of SATA ports for HDDs. You probably don\u0027t need RAID, so essentially anything will do. With HDDs, just read reviews, and look for capacity that works for you. Western Digital and Seagate tend to be pretty reliable, but absolutely all brands of HDDs vary from model to model. Seriously, read reviews.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat basically leaves optical drives (hardly even matters what you chose at this point) and PSU. PSU is important. Don\u0027t go cheap. Last time I was replacing PSU, I\u0027ve found one that looked like a bargain, only to discover that while it doesn\u0027t fail often, its principal mode of failure was catching on fire. You want your PC flaming hot, but not literally. It might feel like you are wasting money, paying twice as much for a PSU with good reviews, but you just don\u0027t want to be part of statistic on this one. Best case scenario, it burns out and you have to buy a new one. Worst cases are just, ugh. Common PSU-related problems cause anything from frying your other components to a literal fire.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll that\u0027s left is finding a case to stick all of that into. Basically just get anything you like. The case usually supports certain sizes of motherboards which are called form factors. Make sure these match. And if you are putting a lot of crap into it, make sure it\u0027s a big enough box. But that\u0027s about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a whole lot more considerations, from specialized cooling systems, to solid state and hybrid memory. But these don\u0027t really fall into mid-range sort of pricing. So the only real choices you are going to get is which CPU and which GPU to build your PC around. Everything else will fall into places once you decide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. There are several pieces of hardware typically integrated into modern motherboard. Ethernet, USB ports, and audio. For most people, all three are quite sufficient. But if you happen to be an audiophile, you will definitely enjoy benefits of a specialized board. For all of such things, however, the question is basically how much money you are willing to part with.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-16T13:29:49Z\u0022 title=\u002211/16/2014 01:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by K^2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sgt_flyer","CreatedById":57690,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-16T13:27:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Elets start from KSP point of view : \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efor mods, one of the key components is memory usage.

It\u0027s not supposed to minimize the memory usage, but maximize the performance and minimize the delays. If there is enough memory available, a good memory manager often uses much more of it than the minimal amount required to run the same workload with a decent performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are basically three resources a memory manager handles. One is the memory used by applications. If memory is scarce, the memory manager can move inactive pages to disk, freeing physical memory for other purposes. Moderate swapping causes potential delays, while excessive swapping degrades performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother resource is disk cache. Because random reads are ridiculously slow even with the fastest SSDs, having a lot of cache is still as useful as ever. If more memory is needed, disk cache can usually be freed quickly, unless there are a lot of queued writes. The optimal cache size depends on the workload, but it\u0027s often a significant fraction of physical memory. Having too little cache can cause unnecessary delays, increase loading times, and reduce the overall performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third main resource is free memory. Usually it\u0027s a good idea to have enough completely unused memory that you could start a fairly memory-hungry process without the memory manager interfering. If there is too little free memory, large memory allocations can cause delays, as the memory manager has to free some used memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy example workload was quite typical for me playing KSP. On this 16 GB desktop, OS X uses 9 gigabytes of application (and system) memory and 4.5 gigabytes of disk cache, leaving 2.5 GB free. When I quit KSP, the memory manager keeps the amount of disk cache the same, while increasing the amount of free memory to 4.5 GB. I also have similar workloads on my 8 GB laptop.
