I have a folding crane, that as soon as it unfolds, the tracks run in opposite directions of each other. As for the choices in the cfg, one of the reasons I love Paul\u0027s (BobCat) designs, is that I can modify these rates to fit the loads the vehicle is carrying, not to mention match a trailers torque that is using wheels. The ability to adjust these settings when one wants is important, if its something you don\u0027t see a reason to do, then the only loss is some of us wont be able to use your tracks....but I really like em. As for the suspension travel, hell yeah I understand the travel would exceed the range of the part, but it looks so damn cool. That was more of a love of watching the travel, I know you cant give that adjustment in the cfg\u0027s. As for the placement of the GUI options, the TTmodlular wheels 4.0 and earlier I think, had a tab by right clicking on the wheel just like you would to retract, or deploy the wheel set, that allowed you to change steering orientation, as well as drive direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: I have been playing a bit this morning, and I cant think for the life of me why you wouldn\u0027t want to include the spring and dampening adjustments in the cfg file for people to change? If this is something you plan on putting in the cfg, then please just disregard, if not, then rethink it. I always have different uses for so many parts, and if I want to re-size a set of tracks, I need to be able to change these settings. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreat work as always with most of you guys and thx from Oregon\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDren\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-16T13:16:29Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2013 01:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by ArkaelDren\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-16T13:20:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was playing with that rover I pictured above yesterday, and noticed something odd about directional control. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a probe core installed under the seat that I control from, so I use mechjeb to do its best to keep the thing upright.

I would love to be able to use them, and they are really great visually, but you need to make a few sets of each track if we are not allowed to adjust the spring rates through the cfg files any more. Make a set for heavy medium and light weights for each track variation. Or try and figure out how to allow settings in the cfg files.
