All are updated to their latest builds. They are active with 1.0.5 in the VAB/SPH and in flight/orbit. They also worked with 1.0.4 flawlessly. Only Planetshine, smartparts and engine lighting are coming up with compatibility errors at the loading but nobody is coming up with issues for those ones in the related threads. It\u0027s affecting both stock and modded parts so I believe the issue is a little more systemic (i.e a mod that runs under the entire engine like KSPAPIextensions, etc. Not a \u0022parts\u0022 mod)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phreak","CreatedById":81517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T22:15:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92229-How-To-Get-Support-%28READ-FIRST%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis thread\u003C/a\u003E out. it would help us help you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"W1ntermute","CreatedById":117426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T09:53:03Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Phreak\u0027]Check [URL=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92229-How-To-Get-Support-%28READ-FIRST%29\u0022]this thread[/URL] out. it would help us help you.[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks, not needed. I figured it out. It\u0026#39;s the mod CrewXfer that was causing the problem. It wasn\u0026#39;t a parts mod, I was right. CrewXfer worked right up to 1.0.4... Shame, handy mod. Ah well.
