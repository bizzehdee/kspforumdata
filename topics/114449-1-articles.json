It has an official campaign and scenarios, but it also has a built in editor to create custom ones. The game is also fully moddable.\n\nI bought it about two years ago when it came out on Steam in alpha, and it has since become one of my favorite games.\n\nI also have Arma 2, but 3 is the one I play the most.\n\nVarious links\n\n[Steam store page](http://store.steampowered.com/app/107410/)\n\n[Official site](http://arma3.com/)\n\n\u002733 things about Arma 3\u0027 trailer\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/ph1mm2KKSv0?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nYour opinions?"},{"CreatedByName":"comham","CreatedById":43245,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T13:12:01Z","Content":"It\u0027s pretty sweet. I played a tiny bit of arma 1, then arma 2 came along and made things much more accessible, and arma 3 made it even more accessible.

They get kicked instantly.\n\nCon: I was probably the best pilot on a server - I was landing loaded Mohawk Choppers safely in combat situations and making it home in time for tea. I was kicked for not being in the right Mumble Lobby (mumble is like bad teamspeak)"},{"CreatedByName":"TheCanadianVendingMachine","CreatedById":59684,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T18:07:14Z","Content":"ARMA is best when you\u0027re in a group, IMO.
