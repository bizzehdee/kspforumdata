Dunno if this is helpful, but it seems to me that the HX end piece already kind of looks like a bridge...Maybe you could just texture the bit crudely outlined below as glass? Could do something similar with the other end piece.

Is it possible to create a new winglet using the two existing designs? I\u0027m talking about the two where one of them is static except for a flap while the other one is the entire control surface. Basically what I\u0027m aksing for is a combination of both, where setting the trim moves the entire surface and using control inputs uses only the flap, like the trim on airliners adjusts the entire horizontal stabilizer while leaving the full range of motion of the elevator untouched with respect to the trim.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m only asking because I use trim a lot and I end up with controls that are not sensitive enough in one direction and too sensitive in the other direction. (I love building and flying airliners in KSP, though using a full set of flaps produces a fair amount of downward pitch so I need to compensate with about 7-8 degrees of elevator-up, which leaves me with only about that much more to pitch up while pitching down is too sensitive when I have three times as much control authority)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps a possible idea for the future?

I\u0027m getting weird malfunctions. Specifically, what I\u0027m getting is that if I install ATM, FAR and B9 v5 (latest as twelve hours or so back), either Xorg or my window manager (Cinnamon, on Linux Mint 16) begins using 2-300% CPU time in short bursts, and the entire operating system\u0027s graphics display become unresponsive. This can be when clicking \u0027start game\u0027 in the main menu - here it will freeze up just before the new menu is in place on screen, or after loading into a game and going to the tracking station. I\u0027m not completely sure this is B9\u0027s fault - hell, I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s not because my CPU is flaky - but I figured I\u0027d ask, against the possibility anyone else has seen anything like it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
