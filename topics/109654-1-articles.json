Whilst doing some testing to establish whether this was possible by manually landing the craft, I realised this wasn\u0027t possible due to the \u0027on rails\u0027 settings (Specifically, either my main craft or the radial engine I was not controlling cut their engines and fall to Kerbin). I was intending on using kOS to launch and land all parts of my rocket, but this obviously doesn\u0027t work when crafts are on rails, especially if they just vanish after a certain distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I came online and heard Lazor and TTNeverUnload both changed the rails distance, but have both been discontinued. So I looked in the physics.cfg file and there are no options there either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027ve come to ask, can you please put an option somewhere to change the distance? Surely (from my humbly novice perspective) it would be possible to have whatever function of the game that uses this distance just call it straight from the settings file rather than being a value declared in the application itself? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading!\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TothAval","CreatedById":142030,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T15:37:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei recommend the stage recovery mod, it does in a way what you want, well at least you can recover stages and pretend it happend that way \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eanyway, i put your suggestion in my list.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T16:09:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe current system models physics for everything within about 2.25km, and everything on a suborbital trajectory within 22.5km. The thing with pushing that second number farther is that the mods you spoke of sometimes caused problems if you pushed the physics bubble too far due to FP rounding issues. From what I remember, 20-30km was the recommended limit with those mods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MathewVaughan","CreatedById":143764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T18:57:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMmm.
