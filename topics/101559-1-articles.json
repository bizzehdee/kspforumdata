To place three satellites into three hour orbits (1585.2km) in a nice triangular formation I just put all three onto one launch vehicle. From launch get your apoapsis to the target 1585.2km and then raise your periapsis to 550km, that puts you into a nice two hour orbit. Then every time you hit apoapsis, drop a satellite and circularize it to a three hour orbit. The two to three ratio puts them into a nice formation and as long as your orbital periods are correct you don\u0027t need to sweat getting the apsides exact.

As mentioned by @supermun18, you don\u0027t really need to match ap/pe that perfectly, just make sure the orbital period (in msecs) is as close as possible: they sats will get closer and far during the orbit, but will keep their average distance stable. So I recommend you to use the smallest engine available and also reduce the thrust while adjusting the orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou must also take care of how much battery do you have in your sats. The bigger the orbit, the MORE time in the shade because of body eclipses, the BIGGER battery required. Additionally, the higher the orbit (the bigger the orbital period) the less deviation you will get because of different satellites speeds: if the difference is one second between two of the satellites, they will completely get out of their triangular shape at 1sec every orbit.. so if 1 hour (3600 secs) is 360 degrees, that means that 1 second of difference is 0.1 degrees: In 10 orbits (10 secs) the satellites will be 1 degree de-synched. Try to find somewhere in between that gives you some pace, you will have to balance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor kerbin \u0027ground\u0027 control, you just need 3 sats with a communotron 16 antenna at 200km orbit, but that will be too hard to maintain because of this same issue..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBtw, have you ever put a satellite in geosynchronus orbit in the mun?..
