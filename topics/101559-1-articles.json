At the end of the tutorial, it suggests that you might want to edit the save file to align the semi-major axes in order to get perfect orbital periods for them.\n\nMe, being OCD, I decided that I\u0027d just hyperedit them into absolute perfection. I zeroed out everything I could zero out, set the SMA to a nice round number, and now, the only problem is, how do I calculate the necessary mean anomaly at epoch in order to space them out evenly along the orbit?\n\nI\u0027m OK if someone just happens to know this number and doesn\u0027t want to bother with the math. It\u0027s interesting, but I\u0027m trying to calm my disorder here.

To place three satellites into three hour orbits (1585.2km) in a nice triangular formation I just put all three onto one launch vehicle. From launch get your apoapsis to the target 1585.2km and then raise your periapsis to 550km, that puts you into a nice two hour orbit. Then every time you hit apoapsis, drop a satellite and circularize it to a three hour orbit. The two to three ratio puts them into a nice formation and as long as your orbital periods are correct you don\u0027t need to sweat getting the apsides exact. Minimal skull sweat."},{"CreatedByName":"godefroi","CreatedById":101728,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T02:54:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Your first sat should be at 0, the next one depends on how many SATs you have.

It\u0027s the Longitude of Periapsis I was referring with a Mean Anomaly of 0. This way your satellites will start at the same position in their orbit (Periapsis I believe) but will be spaced relative to each other.\n\n[I point you to an awesome tutorial type thing I made a while back.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/63278-Perfect-Satellite-Orbits-%28Or-how-to-Hyper-Edit-without-Hyper-Edit%29)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-09T03:03:01Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2015 03:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Taki117**"},{"CreatedByName":"superm18","CreatedById":57755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T07:55:30Z","Content":"The Ap/Pe is not important, it\u0027s the orbital period you wanna get right.\n\nThis works for any orbital height, just make sure your orbital period is the same and the sat\u0027s will never drift apart.

As mentioned by @supermun18, you don\u0027t really need to match ap/pe that perfectly, just make sure the orbital period (in msecs) is as close as possible: they sats will get closer and far during the orbit, but will keep their average distance stable. So I recommend you to use the smallest engine available and also reduce the thrust while adjusting the orbit. \n\nYou must also take care of how much battery do you have in your sats. The bigger the orbit, the MORE time in the shade because of body eclipses, the BIGGER battery required. Additionally, the higher the orbit (the bigger the orbital period) the less deviation you will get because of different satellites speeds: if the difference is one second between two of the satellites, they will completely get out of their triangular shape at 1sec every orbit.. so if 1 hour (3600 secs) is 360 degrees, that means that 1 second of difference is 0.1 degrees: In 10 orbits (10 secs) the satellites will be 1 degree de-synched. Try to find somewhere in between that gives you some pace, you will have to balance.\n\nFor kerbin \u0027ground\u0027 control, you just need 3 sats with a communotron 16 antenna at 200km orbit, but that will be too hard to maintain because of this same issue..\n\nBtw, have you ever put a satellite in geosynchronus orbit in the mun?.. I did!! (i tis not in a geosynch orbit as it is not possible in the mun, but the mun relay sat stays in the same position relative to the mun during its whole orbit, and is orbiting kerbin).\n\n![0STvDjh.png](http://i.imgur.com/0STvDjh.png)\n\nThere is a satellite in the same orbit as the mun separated by 2.600km, enough to reach the mun sats using a communotron 16 antena.. \n\nThese are my sats in the mun, they don\u0027t need a directional antenna because this is the purpose of the satellite in the mun orbit. \n\nI can have full coverage in the mun surface for a deflectron DP-10 antena.. with only C-16 antennas. \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
