This should be possible, the logic of the system itself says this should be possible, and the system is for many people useless without this feature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etl;dr you can\u0027t save attachable parts because they aren\u0027t \u0022attachable\u0022, not sure if this is a bug since it\u0027s allways been like this as far as I hope, but I sure hope it is, and that it will be fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate: This is only appears to happen when a pod(or first placed part?) is one of the parts connected to the selected part and does not have a free side, in other words a solution to his (hopefully bug) is to save the part of the craft above the pod, and under the pod, since you can\u0027t save the craft if the pod is in the middle.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-07T10:02:54Z\u0022 title=\u002209/07/2015 10:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Rockyfelle185\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdditional Information\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-16T09:09:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou cannot make an entire vessel into a sub assembly, sorry, sub assemblies are by their nature sub sections of the vessel, this is by design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you would like to load a vessel alongside another vessel you should use the \u0022Merge\u0022 button in the vessel load dialogue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
