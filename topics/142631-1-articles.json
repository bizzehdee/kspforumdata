If I\u0027m not pointed perfectly straight up, then it seems like no matter what, I can\u0027t \u0022get out from under\u0022 my falling radial stages without having some kind of a collision. I got around this in my most recent craft by using\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emultiple layers\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of radial decouplers, each firing at the same time, which gave me both much needed spacial separation at time of ejection and additional ejection force... but obviously this is a stupid solution.

I mean, from a purely physics-based perspective, it seems like as long as the center of mass of the radial tank\u002Bengine is aligned with the decoupler, then on ejection it should have the same velocity as my craft plus a slight outward momentum pushing it away... but it seems like that never happens. It\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Efeels\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0like once i\u0027ve ejected the side-tanks, I have a limited amount of time to accelerate away from them before they fall into my craft.

The bigger the booster, the bigger the fin you may need. If you want to get really tricky, there is also a question of timing if you are not using struts all over the place. When a booster flames out, and it has no struts on it, it will wobble fairly violently. If you hit the decouplers at the right moment on an outward wobble, the boosters will fly\u00A0nose-outwards away from your ship. You can also use a couple of tiny fins at the top end of a booster, and angle them sligtly so that they produce a tiny outwards force. That will also pull the booster away from your stack when it decouples.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodari","CreatedById":157578,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-27T23:49:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor most of my ships, I don\u0027t have much problem with this.\u00A0 Just make sure you do the following and should be fine:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.\u00A0 Be pointing prograde and not at too steep of an angle if you\u0027re still in the lower atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.\u00A0 Just before separating the boosters, make sure you switch \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to stability assist mode and not \u0027hold prograde\u0027 or anything else.\u00A0 Don\u0027t turn the ship AT ALL during this stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.\u00A0 Once you have separated, wait a couple seconds until you\u0027ve completely cleared those boosters before you start the engine for the next stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs noted above, you also want to make sure that you have enough struts to ensure that the boosters aren\u0027t wobbling at all.\u00A0 If all of the above still aren\u0027t enough to keep them from colliding, sepatrons would be the next option to try, but I very rarely find that I need them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrOsterman","CreatedById":153514,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-28T01:35:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222650673\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022142631\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221467071384\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157578\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hodari\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Hodari said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsepatrons would be the next option to try, but I very rarely find that I need them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah.. but they\u0027re Perty.... watching them fire to push those other stages away....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-28T06:55:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCouple of tips...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPut the decoupler at the top and strut the tank at the bottom.

The more you put your decoupler above the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0of your empty booster, the faster it will spin due to the decoupling force (and less force will be applied to push the boosters sideways).

Drag will pull the tumbling boosters toward each other when they\u0027re jettisoned, so if they are too high up your craft, they get jettisoned away from your craft and will boomerang back. Place your strap-on boosters as low on the core as you can.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Decouplers that are placed too high up. This will cause insufficient clearance sideways, and the boosters will pretty much \u0027roll off\u0027 your core instead of having enough sideways momentum to fall on their own. In the extreme case, the decouplers will only spin the boosters into a tumble and not push them outward, which will make them flop around a 180 and smash into your main engine on the bottom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShort answer: Decoupler needs to go a small amount above the dry \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. Liquid boosters have a center of mass that is quite low when they are empty, solids have a more uniform mass and their center of mass is more in the booster\u0027s center when they\u0027re burnt out. Also, use struts to keep the boosters from wobbling, one strut per booster attached to the bottom is more than enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-28T15:01:53Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2016 03:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Stoney3K\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Firemetal","CreatedById":164725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-28T15:01:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeperatrons are the best option but if your strap-on boosters are too big, I\u0027d suggest flea solid rocket boosters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CSE","CreatedById":145588,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-28T21:59:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike bewing, I find a single fin at the bottom of the radial boosters is normally enough to tilt them outward just slightly, without sending them into an immediate wild tumble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA real-life solution is to use longer-burning boosters so that you will be decoupling them higher in the atmosphere, where the air is thinner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe SpaceY mods offer some combined decoupler-sepatron and nosecone-sepatron parts, which are a particular help for large rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ineon","CreatedById":152379,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-29T08:00:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might find this helpful, I had a similar problem:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/133565-tanks-pushing-inward-when-staged/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour problem sounds similar, but not exactly the same.
