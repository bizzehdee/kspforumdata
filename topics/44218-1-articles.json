You eject/drop stuff by using decouplers/separators and stick them in the stage list where you want them to drop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAction groups are things you can add rather than having to right-click or toggle things manually, or you can group several things on the same button, buttons 0-9 use their corresponding number under the action groups list. Can be used for anything between toggling brakes/steering on rover to lights, landing gear, engines or docking ports. A lot of stuff can be put in there, you can check what by going into action groups and left clicking an item on your craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could use action groups for staging and engines, but generally it\u0027s a lot faster and easier to just manipulate the staging list and press spacebar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Manipulate your staging list by dragging from one stage to another, or moving whole stage sequences around.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T03:00:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you asking....When the fuel are used-up, would it be possible auto advance in stage?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy personal Answer = No. If someone know the \u0022Yes\u0022, Please let me know too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hansman1982","CreatedById":62705,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T03:09:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you do not have mechjeb, then pressing space will advance to the next stage.

In a limited way, a solution for you might be to combine \u0022staging\u0022 into one stage event. As an example: you have one tank empty (from its engine depleting that fuel). You want to decouple the tank AND fire the next engine at the same time. You would drag the decouple icon into the same stage bracket which contains the icon for the next engine which you want to fire, instead of leaving them in separately numbered staging brackets. You may do this in the editor (VAB for example) or on the launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Amoun","CreatedById":74485,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T16:54:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey Wolf, welcome to the forum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust like people above me said, use the space-bar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not sure if I am answering your question, but if it is the simple dumping of spent fuel tanks you want to do, then yes, pressing space will advance you to the next stage. You COULD use action groups, but I would recommend using that for something else as the numbers may get confusing (if you have a few action groups set up doing different things) whereas you have just one button, the space-bar assigned for that already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen it is all a matter of setting up your staging correctly. An easy way to determine what does what and when, is when you hover your mouse over the decoupler or engine, the game with high-light it on the right (where the stages are). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yes, you could use the numbers for that but I wouldnt recommend it.........then again, maybe it\u0027s just a personal preference.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mountaineerman","CreatedById":125387,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-15T16:55:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Prowlerwolf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Prowlerwolf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs there a way I can manipulate or configure an \u0022Action Group\u0022 to remove a stage once its fuel reserve has been used up?
