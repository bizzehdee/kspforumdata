It may be totally impractical but I have no idea:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the start of career mode, all planets, including Mun, should be \u0022un-mapped\u0022, meaning we do not have data about their surfaces or what they look like. This can include not just what the surface looks like, but also atmospheric details and plenty of other data that you would need to know before attempting to land there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make unmanned probe missions really useful in the game, you could send probes attached with cameras to other planets, and then take several photos until you have fully mapped the planet. Upon transmission of the photos/data, the planet would then start to have it\u0027s details and image uploaded into the science center, whilst also giving you science for completing the mapping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me this seems like fun, as now we don\u0027t magically know all about the planets at the start of career mode, and need to research and analyse them first. This would be even better, and insanely fun from an exploration point of view if we had procedural generated solar systems for each save, but I doubt that will ever happen as it\u0027s a huge task.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings like telescopes could also be great for mapping planets and gathering information and data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, just a suggestion, I love the idea of unmanned probe missions alongside manned Kerbal missions, and something like this could really make it worth while to send some probes out before embarking on landing missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease do make any suggestions/observations, or let me know if it\u0027s a stupid idea! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cryptk","CreatedById":97237,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T11:37:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is just about a perfect description of part of the functionality of SCANsat, which is currently in development.
