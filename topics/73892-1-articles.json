Made it to orbit and back twice without refueling. There is a very small chance that someone with better skills than I could take this ship to 3 orbit cycles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/e5SgS\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
