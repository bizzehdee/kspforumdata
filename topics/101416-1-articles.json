If you have have carried over an old save, follow these steos: First backup your the persistent.sfs file from KSP/saves/[your save name] then open it. Look for sections close to the top called ScenarioDestructibles and ScenarioVesselRecovery (or something like that). One or both of them will likely be missing. If they are missing, start a new save and open the persistent.sfs file for the new save. Copy the relevant SCENARIO{} modules to your main save. If that doesn\u0027t work, post the persistent.sfs and output log* on here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*You must have experienced the bug in the most recent game session for this to be useful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rasheeke","CreatedById":20217,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T04:10:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt seems I have an old save from a long time ago. I have a lot of science progress, but it seems to be the old days when careers were only science. It\u0027s clearly a Science save but it shows the Career icon. For now I\u0027m restarting a whole new Career save. I am not allowed to post attachements. If you know how to pull the science progress over into the new Career that\u0027d be great.

Saves sometimes survive one update to the next (because \u0022save upgrade safe\u0022 code is often included in the update).
