I am experiencing three errors, the first is that the shadow mapping seems to have a fit after a while and I get flickering shadows, the terrain tiles begin to shadow themselves, or a massive circular shadow that looks like something is eclipsing the sun is cast over everything. It\u0027s a really distracting bug that persists in all game modes but is not completely game-breaking. The seconds error is that a screen coordinates texture pops on the screen (if you\u0027re a graphics programmer you\u0027ll know what this looks like), obscuring the game view completely and persists and has happened multiple times, in flight, and during a Duna landing (which was not fun). This error happens in any of the game modes and I pretty much have to restart KSP once it starts happening. Occasionally a screen-space normals coordinate texture will pop us as well and do the same, and sometimes I even see the game switching between the two textures and other times just one of them will flicker. The last one isn\u0027t really a rendering issue but usually happens once of these rendering issues start happening and the game crashes or goes into an indefinite frozen state which will cause me to lose progress and is also game-breaking. I have been playing KSP since 0.19 and never experienced any of these issues until the 0.90 update and still after the 1.0 release and they are really preventing me from having any fun with the finalized career mode (or anything else in the game for that matter). Just to recap, I am having two main rendering issues, one with shadow mapping that seems to get worse over time and one where one of the shaders (probably a post-processing shader?) just displays the screen-space coordinates or the screen-space normal coordinates over the game view, and the only time the game has crashed for me is after one of these issues starts happening. If someone could let me know if I\u0027m the only one having these issues and if not I hope they could be addressed in the next update because I can\u0027t play the game for more than 25 minutes without the rendering seemingly fall apart. Thanks for reading."},{"CreatedByName":"FlipNascar","CreatedById":137605,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T05:55:11Z","Content":"Have you tried reducing the texture quality to half (or less)?\n\nAnd maybe add your specifics to [this thread.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/116985-1-0-Constant-crashing-on-OS-X)"},{"CreatedByName":"SkavenPlanet","CreatedById":142802,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T20:29:49Z","Content":"I tried reducing texture quality and I got worse frame rates (somehow) and the game crashed within five minutes.
