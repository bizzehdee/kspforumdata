I\u0027m playing in career mode and have hit a bit of a snag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been spending today, having just started playing career mode this week, by executing free-return orbits past M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn with a science bay and two goo canisters in tow trying to rack up as many points as I can. As part of this I\u0027ve also been doing EVAs when near the moon, though it doesn\u0027t give many points now. Once I got my FRT correct my pods were returning a little hot so I switch out the single chute for three of the heavier chutes. I also added some struts between the pod and the science bay after a couple of frustrating losses on splashdown. Something in that mixture obstructed the crew door on my pod in such a way that when Jeb went out for his EVA he was forcefully ejected from the ship. I got him back and tried to re-board but nothing was working.

Having swapped out my science bay for a second command pod I inserted into M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn orbit rendezvous with Jeb and got him on board for a safe, uneventful return to splashdown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBad news, I\u0027ve got a perfectly good rocket, fuel, and valued science points up in space. I\u0027d like to go up there, remove the two chutes and one strut that i think are blocking the hatch and have one of the two kerbals fly it back. Any such luck?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Col_Jessep","CreatedById":4071,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T02:54:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPress Alt\u002BF12 and try \u0027Whack a Kerbal\u0027.
