I designed my plane in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, when I launch it it takes off, accelerates, goes supersonic and to orbit, no problem. If I\u00A0revert to launch and try again though, this time the parts inside the cargo bay are producing excessive drag and this time my plane won\u0027t even pass the speed of sound. I had the bug once during testing,\u00A0I sort of dismissed it, put a short fairing on one of the things\u00A0inside the cargo bay just in case, and proceeded to send that spaceplane to another planet where it is now. Problem is, now the aero engine is freaking out again and I\u0027m kind of stuck there moving at very low speeds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried quicksaving and reloading, as well as opening and closing the cargo bay, hoping to force the game to recalculate what is shielded and what\u0027s not, but it didn\u0027t work. I also noticed after some time that the engines were maxing out at their stationary thrust (they\u0027re supposed to work like jet engines) instead of going past it as I gain some speed, which probably also contributes to my relatively slow speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did tons of test flights with that craft where everything went fine, but now it seems to be stuck with that weird aerodynamics behavior and I obviously can\u0027t revert to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a modded install but I don\u0027t think that any of the mods I have installed should affect aerodynamics (I might try installing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and seeing if it solves the problem though).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was wondering if anyone ever had the same bug and managed to find a way to beat some sense into that stubborn physics engine\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-05-06T00:58:48Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2021 12:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by lBoBl\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-06T03:35:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s an old bug (that I\u0027m not sure still exists)\u00A0where making the cargo bay the root part of the craft can prevent\u00A0it from shielding the parts inside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you closing it with the slider or the button?
