By basically surfing back and forth between north and south of his target (the space center), he drains it of speed well before atmosphere becomes thick enough to cause problematic heating. It takes a while to do, but it seems a good use for remaining RCS fuel, although you could probably manage it on airfoils alone (in the case where your RCS has run out) with the right ship design.\n"}]}
