A very interesting and engaging game, I look forward to seeing where it will progress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave a question about the symbols on the artificial horizon; they are not documented anywhere that I can find, and I am having trouble getting my rockets to go where I want them to go. Pitchover is particularly hard, since even simple rockets tend to want to roll.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, it\u0027s unclear exactly what the function of SAS is, and how to use it during pitchover. Sure, it\u0027s great for keeping your rocket going straight up, but as soon as I want to pitchover, I have to turn it off, and then things go to hell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat would be nice was if when SAS was on, the pitch/yaw/roll keys let you tell the rocket what attitude you want to be in, and SAS tried to get and keep you there. But that does not seem to be the case.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-01T00:08:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe yellow/green icons are your prograde velocity vector and the one with the x is the retrograde velocity vector. i.e. where you\u0027re going and the opposite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe purple indicator is the location of the KSC and the one with the x is the opposite side of where KSC is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SAS is just an attitude hold.
