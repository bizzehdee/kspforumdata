Just go. I am incredibly nitpicky about sci-fi movies, after how much action and steamy drama we\u0027ve had forced down our throats in recent years that just pretends to be sci-fi. Interstellar is NOT one of those movies. It stayed interesting the entire time, even though it left ample time for introspection and reflection between the intense scenes. And I don\u0027t just mean for the crew, but for the audience. I haven\u0027t been this pleased with a old-fashioned semi-realistic space adventure since 2001: A Space Odyssey. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn hour later my brain was still running at 200% trying to analyze everything that happened. It\u0027s been forever since a movie has been able to do that for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre there some science mistakes in it? Sure. But they\u0027re nowhere near as obviously chalkboard-scratching as what Hollywood usually gives us. Don\u0027t even worry about them. Just enjoy it. The things this film got wrong are far and few between. Everything it got right is jaw-dropping. And major kudos to Nolan for not just creating entertainment, but also trying to give humanity a wake-up-call. The film kept on saying what us Kerbs are typically trying to tell everyone we meet. Our future is OUT THERE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo those of you who went, what were the theaters like? Mine was only 1/3rd full at best, but it was also a 4:30 screening. I hope that just means lots of folks were still at work. It\u0027ll be tragic if this doesn\u0027t get some good numbers.
