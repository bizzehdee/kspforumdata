I live in Arizona, and that was pretty alarming, at least one house in a nearby town lost its roof as part of that storm, though I was not directly affected by other than my caution and that of others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, I have generally found them quite helpful. At worst they give information that I already have, but rather need anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding the alarm sounds, that is very interesting, they sounded like possibly that sort of transmission, but I had never looked into it very much. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd about duck and cover, of course there is the possibility that you will be vaporized, crushed, smashed by flying shrapnel, killed by poisoned water, or fall victim to any other of a quite diverse set of possible fates derived directly from a nuclear attack on a city, and perhaps, \u0027duck and cover\u0027 will reduce the chance of death/serious injury somewhat, versus staying at your desk (or wherever) by creating a small sheilded area. But from my understanding, a large amount of the \u0027saftey\u0027 it provided, was, in addition to the feeling that something can be done in such an event, is drill into people\u0027s minds an objective for such a blast that says nothing about looking at the explosion through a window. The fact that probably, so many people would rush to areas where they could see the cloud of the explosion and the missile tail if applicable would almost certainly increase the number of casualties by rather a large degree, as the shockwave would proceed to shower people with shards of glass and smash them to the ground with immense force. It seems that many peoples base inclination would be to place themselves, without thinking, in a place of serious danger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps \u0027duck and cover\u0027 does not make you particularly safe, but it should protect you from your own actions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T03:52:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 03:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Newt\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CelticCossack51","CreatedById":127600,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T04:03:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMust be scary hearing that message on TV.
