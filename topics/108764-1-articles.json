Unless you\u0027re close to the area in the immediate vicinity of a hypocenter, which is a fragment of the total devastation area, you have a great chance of initial survival if you don\u0027t get hit by the blast wave carrying debris. Duck and cover is a lifesaving thing, especially if you\u0027re in a room. Duck and cover against a wall and if the building collapses you\u0027ll likely end up in a triangular void. It\u0027s all about increasing chance of survival, not making them 100%.\n\nIf you saw a flash and you knew what it was, would you stand there like a stupid turkey with your head high and neck exposed?

[**Nikola7007**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/113851-Nikola7007) is correct. The EAS uses this system for a number of reasons, including packet radio relay of emergency notification data (ham radio) - which is about the only thing which will be working if all else fails. Hurricane Katrina is a perfect example: no phones (landlines or cell service) were available, so police, fire, EMS, National Guard - all were without working communications. It was amateur radio operators who came to the rescue (as far as communications) with a relay network.\n\nYou can find out more about public use of the EAS here: [http://www.arrl.org/ares](http://www.arrl.org/ares)\n\nLiving near the ocean, from time to time I\u0027ll get EAS weather alerts if rough weather is heading our way.

I am not sure they were creepy, or scary really, just, interesting. Of course, I never received any bad memories to associate with them--all the ones I ever saw were tests.\n\nMore recently, during the last few years, I have received them via radio, but I think I always understood them. They more prompted informed responses then alarm. Mostly they have been about serious weather conditions, quarter size hail, for example, comming in fifteen minutes (a correct prediction), or a really serious fire, when my house was kept under pre-evacuation notice for several days .We needed to be able to be gone in one quarter hour, but left voluntarily, as did most people nearby--the smoke was awful at my house, even when it cleared enough to return and it rained burned leaves and ash all over town. That was a fun birthday ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif). \n\nOnce a tornado warning was issued. I live in Arizona, and that was pretty alarming, at least one house in a nearby town lost its roof as part of that storm, though I was not directly affected by other than my caution and that of others.\n\nOverall, I have generally found them quite helpful. At worst they give information that I already have, but rather need anyway.\n\nRegarding the alarm sounds, that is very interesting, they sounded like possibly that sort of transmission, but I had never looked into it very much. \n\nAnd about duck and cover, of course there is the possibility that you will be vaporized, crushed, smashed by flying shrapnel, killed by poisoned water, or fall victim to any other of a quite diverse set of possible fates derived directly from a nuclear attack on a city, and perhaps, \u0027duck and cover\u0027 will reduce the chance of death/serious injury somewhat, versus staying at your desk (or wherever) by creating a small sheilded area. But from my understanding, a large amount of the \u0027saftey\u0027 it provided, was, in addition to the feeling that something can be done in such an event, is drill into people\u0027s minds an objective for such a blast that says nothing about looking at the explosion through a window. The fact that probably, so many people would rush to areas where they could see the cloud of the explosion and the missile tail if applicable would almost certainly increase the number of casualties by rather a large degree, as the shockwave would proceed to shower people with shards of glass and smash them to the ground with immense force. It seems that many peoples base inclination would be to place themselves, without thinking, in a place of serious danger.\n\nPerhaps \u0027duck and cover\u0027 does not make you particularly safe, but it should protect you from your own actions.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T03:52:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 03:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Newt**"},{"CreatedByName":"CelticCossack51","CreatedById":127600,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T04:03:07Z","Content":"Must be scary hearing that message on TV.
