You can\u0027t just slap on more fuel, because then the launch stage has to lift more weight, which means it runs out of fuel earlier, which means your transfer stage has to start burning earlier, which means you end up using that extra fuel you brought to minimal, if any, affect.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-20T18:12:53Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2013 06:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by painking\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T15:06:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBest way to overcome that is to build the ship in orbit.

Simply put you have to build a rocket to take it into stable orbit. The heavier your transfer/landing/return craft/stack is the heavier of a launcher you have to build to get it into a stable orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think you\u0027re stuck in the though process of just having one lifter design and adding to it, rather than redesigning it. If you have more mass to launch then yes you need more fuel, but you also need more engines. Just adding more engines to your current design won\u0027t work, and just adding fuel won\u0027t work, but adding engines AND fuel will.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if your transfer stage runs out of fuel it\u0027s not designed for the trip, crudely put. I\u0027d advice you to start from the opposite end. What do you need to get home, what do you need to get off the planet you\u0027re visiting, what do you need to land, what do you need for orbital insertion, what do you need for the transfer.. Once you\u0027ve got that ship built it\u0027ll be capable of the trip. Then build a launcher to take it up into stable orbit without using the payload\u0027s fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can\u0027t launch heavy stuff then make it modular, that\u0027ll require docking and a bit of preplanning, but it\u0027s an easy way compared to struggling with launching everything in one go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T15:30:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry adding more asperagus staged engines to your lifter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndOfTheEarth","CreatedById":24503,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T17:50:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) What kind of engine are you using?
