If the Mastodon doesn\u0027t have enough thrust for efficient liftoff, though, the Mainsail becomes a better choice. Lots of rockets can use either engine and work well enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E (thrust to weight ratio) of your rocket?
