It\u0027s been my intent the whole time to share those here, and add a bit more of the story to them. For a short while I was posting them to the \u0022What Did You Do in KSP Today\u0022 thread. Then I stopped uploading images to my (incomplete) website, and... got behind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(February 2014) While 2014 has been kinder to me than 2013, I\u0027m still not terribly fond of it yet. Once again I find myself behind on several projects, with more and more knocking on the door, and work being busier than ever. I\u0027ve also not had the time or energy to post updates to Google\u002B as I was in the past, so all of these screenshots and notes I take while playing through KSP go unseen and unread. This is my attempt to change that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(April 2014) The latest round of updates coupled with a desire to completely start over has led me to leave the cycles behind and start a new, fresh save.

This thread is the collection of After-Action Mission Reports and other details related to the Null Cycles universe. Each \u0022cycle\u0022 represents a new career save, and thus a reset of the universe and game clock. All of the vehicles and flags that are landed get carried over to the new save, and in some cases all of the satellites and other orbital craft get deleted. There are a few exceptions, such as not resetting the game clock during the Dunan-X mission and not deleting its orbiter. My cycles start at zero (for the demo), and count upwards based on my personal whims. I occasionally merge in my \u0022SkunkWorks\u0022 test save into my main universe canon, such as when Hudwin suddenly appeared on the Mun. (I also can\u0027t count, as evidenced by two \u0022Tenth Cycles,\u0022 but that\u0027s more a result of me accidentally overwriting the save before I backed it up to DropBox.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy use that name?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA multitude of reasons.

At the end of the cycle you have exactly what you started with. I\u0027ve enjoyed playing with the new things Squad includes with KSP each release, and wanted a way to start over while maintaining my \u0022accomplishments,\u0022 i.e.: landers, flags, etc. Of the craft and flags I\u0027ve placed since I started playing in 0.19, only three are not included in this save. (Because I lost their save before I merged everything in.) So in truth, these are not null cycles as the craft I create remain. But the science and achievements and all the other cruft that gets saved to the persistence file gets cleared, so in a way it is.

The grand plan was to land in the \u0022Dark Gorge,\u0022 conduct a few studies to determine why it formed, and then head home. The gorge is rather perilous due to its rough terrain and steep sides, so it was thought this would be a good measure of the lander pilot\u0027s prowess. Plus, no kerbals had yet landed on the far side of the Mun. Naturally Bob, being the ace pilot he is, brought the lander down on an incline and proceeded to roll it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Cuairt 3 has landed. Wait, uh.....

Not that being afraid and confused was anything new, but the last three months had been the scariest and most confusing of his life.

Tore through the AoC\u0027s manual, trying to find the restart sequence. Kicked and cursed at the main computer. Nothing.

He took out the orbital map, ran some quick back-of-the-notebook calculations. The dust from the pencil clouded around him, some clinging to the arms of his suit. Quick and violent erasures only caused more dust. Why did it have to be so dark! He would land short of KSC and save himself a swim.

Thus was born Project Moho, both from a desire to place Kerbals First, and from the need to keep pace with the CCHR.

Jeb investigated the effects of orbit on Goo (and Kerbals). Bill conducted the first northward launch to test polar launches, and was to be the first to land at the North Pole. Bob ultimately became the first to land at the North Pole after entering into a polar orbit. Nelble explored the northern Tundras. Buzz flew to a record altitude and landed in the FSK\u0027s deserts.

Whatever had knocked out the computers aboard the Dunan-X also damaged most of the automated systems aboard Lucky. They had to salvage parts from the self-righting \u0022legs\u0022 from the back to repair the Dunan-X, and wired the motors directly to the controls in Jeb\u0027s seat. Most of the secondary systems and remote operator controls were gone for good, but they wouldn\u0027t need those with Jeb at the helm!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheir destination was the large Hellas-like impact crater, about 80km south of the Dunan-X landing site. The terrain between them and the edge of the basin was relatively flat, but then the elevation drops to about 300m in the basin, and rises back to 4km to the twin peaks in the center. The first stop was the small hill to the southwest of the lander, the furthest anyone had driven to date. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CLittle Red Hill\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 they\u0027d been calling it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill let Jeb plant this flag.

With the self-righting mechanism broken they couldn\u0027t risk flipping the rover. And with the loose sands they couldn\u0027t keep traction driving downhill. So they had to zig and zag down the edge of the basin, descending 3.5km over the 20km distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat didn\u0027t stop Jeb from occasionally being Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/20131031_ksp0326_billnjeb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220131031_ksp0326_billnjeb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey made one more stop a bit further down, where the slope leveled out a bit before getting much steeper.

Twilight wasn\u0027t as short as at higher elevations, but the thin atmosphere did nothing to refract light down to them.

They recomposed themselves, repacked all the junk that was scattered about, and took a few minutes to rest. For some reason Jeb decided to name the place \u0022Camp 27.\u0022 It was only their second campsite. They set out in plenty of time to make summit by sunrise. They stopped at the highest peak first, West Peak at 4km, and made it to the East Peak just in time to catch a unique sunrise / eclipse combination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Both Bill and Jeb) \u0022Wow.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/20131102_ksp_duna_sunrise.gif\u0022 alt=\u002220131102_ksp_duna_sunrise.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerfect spot for a long nap, so they made camp at summit.

So far they hadn\u0027t been able to get the engines online, and their computers were still down. Life support aboard the orbiter was run directly from an RTG, but nothing else. Including the lights. They had spent the last several years with only intermittent sunlight and their helmet lights to work from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey also mentioned another signal they\u0027d been picking up.

That xenon was traded for a total of 22,784m/s of \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0v, half of which was expended on the final escape burns at Solar Periapsis (day 2300 or so) and the final Jool flyby.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/20131206_ksp_wayward1inner.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220131206_ksp_wayward1inner.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/20131206_ksp_wayward1outer.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220131206_ksp_wayward1outer.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs one respondent in our Google\u002B community said, \u0022and as this chapter closes *weep**weep**weep*.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo ended my 0.22 gameplay.
