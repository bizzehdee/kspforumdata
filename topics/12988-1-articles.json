For some reason i ive been able to land and return from Minmus without the slightest issue but Mun is seemingly much more challenging. Using the exact same rocket design i could return from Minmus with some fuel remaining even after landing on Kerbin again. However this rocket design cannot seem to get me to the Mun and back. I run out of fuel just after escaping the Mun\\\u0027s orbit and reaching Kerbin orbit again. I\\\u0027m sure i could manage with a specifically designed Mun rocket but its just odd to me. Want to know if anyone else has noticed this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-20T20:02:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, Minmus is much smaller and has less gravity.

You only need to go about 80-90 m/s faster t push your apoapsis out to Minmus\\\u0027 distance from LKO than you do to push your apoapsis out to Munar distance. The Mun\\\u0027s higher gravity means that the slight saving in transfer delta-V is swallowed whole by the extra delta-V you need to pull off landings and returns.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
