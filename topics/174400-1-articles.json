Then I added an additional slight green tint to more easily distinguish it in the parts menu (since it rotates, and if the windows weren\u0027t visible, you couldn\u0027t tell it apart)/ from angles where the windows aren\u0027t visible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I used the part tint, particularly on the drills, the orange color remained, and blue got added on top of it, which also turned the grey areas blue... etc... it doesn\u0027t give the effect I want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess that I\u0027m not allowed to share these files\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-05-04T08:43:47Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2018 08:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by KerikBalm\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
