It involves thermonuclear weapons, gas giants, stars, and to some extent terraforming and evil geniuses. So let\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s get started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThermonuclear warheads are pretty much atomic bombs wrapped in hydrogen. The fission explosion from the atomic bomb releases enough energy to ignite fusion in the hydrogen. The fusion aids the explosion and makes it bigger, but most of the energy comes from the fission bomb (correct me if I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m wrong, but I think that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s the gist of it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what that means is that a nuke releases enough energy to ignite hydrogen fusion. Fusing hydrogen releases a lot of energy too. What I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m wondering is if fusing hydrogen releases enough energy to fuse \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E hydrogen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example: if a nuclear warhead were detonated in Jupiter\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s lower atmosphere, the bomb would start fusion in the surrounding hydrogen clouds (Jupiter is nearly all hydrogen). I wonder if the fusing hydrogen clouds would then cause the inert hydrogen around \u003Cem\u003Ethem\u003C/em\u003E to start fusing, too. If that worked, the fusion would spread through all of Jupiter like fire.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you nuked Jupiter, would it turn into a star?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean, it doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have nearly enough mass to ignite fusion for itself, but if we lit the match, would it burn?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow much energy would it output, since it would be like a sub-sub-brown dwarf? What would that mean for potential terraforming of the Galilean moons? What would that mean for us earthlings?
