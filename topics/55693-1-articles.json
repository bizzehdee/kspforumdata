While it may seem wide, the 0-100 degrees range for the water to remain liquid is rather narrow. On real tidally volcanic planet surface the water would be mostly in two states: vaporized in near vicinity of volcanoes, and frozen everywhere else. Water vapor might help keeping the atmosphere greenhouse effect high, but definitely not high enough to allow liquid water over most of the surface. And overheated steam would have tendency to escape the planet into space, gradually drying the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou guys argue with Io and Europa, but fail to notice that even volcanic Io has average surface temperature way below freezing (90-130K, i.e. -183 to -143\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C) and Europa has (likely) liquid water ocean hidden under surface only because it is insulated by thick layer of ice.

Oceans on Laythe are made of water. Atmosphere is made of breathable mixture containing oxygen. Laythe is 5 times further from Sun than Kerbin and with 25 times less Sun radiation is therefore definitely out of habitable zone.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep, excellent analysis. At Laythe\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s distance it is receiving 1/25th the solar energy as at Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s distance: Kerbin receives a *surface* average of 343 W/m^2 (not, actually, the 1370 W/m^2 that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been thrown out there - that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s the intensity at 1 AU from the Sun, but a planet absorbs that over not its whole surface, but only its cross-sectional area; that throws in a factor of 1/4th). Laythe would then receive about 14 W/m^2 (again, averaged over the entire surface). In order to get the same amount of heating as Kerbin, Laythe would seem to need at least 329 W/m^2 additional. Tidal heating? Well... Io, the most tidally heated object we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve got as an analog, produces 2.5 W/m^2 global average. So... Is Laythe a minimum of 130 times as tidally heated as Io? I have my (extreme) doubts. Furthermore that 0.8 Atm isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t going to help much... not as much as the 1 Atm on Kerbin, for example.
