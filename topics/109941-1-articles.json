I have done several missions and met various milestones on Kerbin, Mun, and Minmus with regards to flight, flyby, orbit and landing (on Minmus). So far xp has seem to have been applied correctly, however I just sent a mission to Minmus (after previously completing flyby, orbit and landing without flag placement) and had all 3 members of the crew place individual flags but when we recovered on Kerbin all 3 members only got 1xp. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBased on the chart I\u0027ve seen on the wiki and various other posts from .90 it would seem we should\u0027ve gotten 6xp for that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I just missing something or is this a bug?

I was assuming that you could get 5.xx for landing and then an additional 6.xx for flag placement (on a separate mission).
