However, during the build and testing of the rocket, I began to encounter bug after bug. I\u0027ll try and describe all that I can remember here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThe center of mass is stuck in one of the corners, despite the whole craft being built in symmetry mode. Attempts to remove sections to find the unbalance completely froze the center of mass indicator in place. Center of thrust and lift were unaffected.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRemoving the decouplers underneath the vector engines of the lander portion unloads one of the four outer engines for some reason. I noticed that the center of mass is biased towards the vector engine that unloads.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTrying to test fly the ship results in it instantly flipping over thanks to the center of mass imbalance from earlier, which is to be expected. But during some of the crashes all forces acting on the ship would disappear, including gravity and even its own engines. (It is important to note that I haven\u0027t been able to recreate this result after a fresh install.)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRemoving the outer section of the rocket and replacing the center Skipper engines with Mainsails allows the ship to overcome the flipping, but the game\u0027s physics freak out and the whole thing blows up about 100 meters above the launchpad.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen trying to revert to launch, the loading animation in the bottom left would lag as normal but eventually play at a flawless 60fps. Opening the pause menu during this reveals the ship with only half the parts loaded in on the launchpad. Reverting to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and then launching fixes this.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAttempting to launch directly from the launchpad in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E sometimes yields an invalid part error, preventing the launch. Launching through the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E also avoids this one.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game is completely stock with no mods, dlcs, or addons. My hypothesis is that there is a part error of some sort on the rocket that interferes with the games loading of the ship and its physics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease let me know if there\u0027s any way to upload the craft file so you could try this for yourselves.
