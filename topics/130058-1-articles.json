I started playing modded before official release, too... I don\u0027t know what\u0027s going on with the 1.0.5 update that doesn\u0027t seem to like my mods. I recently just updated every single mod to just to fix these problems and it helped a little bit, but I\u0027m getting a \u0027Kerbin disappears and has a light halo around it\u0027 bug, crashes that usually result from switching from craft-to-craft, but sometimes a tiny bit of lag kicks in and crashes it... I made sure all my drivers were updated and I checked my GPU proprietary driver and made sure to use the correct one. My CPU is more than capable of handling KSP. I barely have it overclocked, but I have a massive cooling system.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nA new problem I have is sometimes when I switch over to another craft, it starts spinning insanely fast and has a chance of completely disassembling itself due to the speed...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI just don\u0027t know what to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-20T01:05:54Z\u0022 title=\u002201/20/2016 01:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Shuriken333\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdding in more info\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shuriken333","CreatedById":151577,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-18T02:45:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBump\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Please, anyone? \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jas0n","CreatedById":57441,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-24T03:40:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you sure that all of your mods are compatible with 1.0.5?

I wouldn\u0027t be surprised that you have reach the limit of your RAM. Unfortunately, my crappy laptop or gedit do not want to go further than the line 586546 in your log file. If it is a problem on my side, you\u0027ll need to look for a \u0022OutOfMemory\u0022 in that log file. If it isn\u0027t, can you verify that that you have post the entire file?
