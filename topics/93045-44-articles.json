So say 25 for the -143 and 20 for the -89.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay... Now, that advice places me in an interesting conundrum. I have engines ranging from during and just after WWI (BMW IIIa, Liberty L-12) to close to the \u002760\u0027s (Duplex Cyclone TC). I was thinking of putting the DupCycTC in a first-tier tech node, since it\u0027s not actually around at the \u0027start line\u0027 on the game, so higher tech = higher price, no prob. So presumably, for the rest I\u0027d have to figure a way to make them reasonably priced in relation to one another. I honestly don\u0027t figure on including the WWI/interbellum engines in RP-0, since they\u0027re not going to serve much real game use. They\u0027re more interesting for RO players who want to build replica Fokker D.VII\u0027s and such. But for the WWII-proximal engines (i.e. most of them), I guess I should normalize to 1950 and go?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-27T18:30:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat makes sense.

Hrm. Seems silly to have multiples of the same engine, honestly. Might end up doing a bit of overview work of what sorts of prop engines are even available in the RP-0 mod list.
