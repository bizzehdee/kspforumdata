Your first post didn\u0027t explicitly mention that this is what you had in mind. Your idea works but only if the dynamic program is going to be run just once and then never again. It doesn\u0027t work if you want to write the dynamic code in a loop where it changes each time. To do that you can\u0027t just keep appending code. You have to delete and re-create the program from the start, and that means writing half the file ahead of time statically and then writing the other half later dynamically isn\u0027t a solution.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-28T05:36:09Z\u0022 title=\u002209/28/2013 05:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Steven Mading\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"drtedastro","CreatedById":70911,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-28T05:47:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Steven Mading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you uploaded your KoS file for the sky-crane landing from earlier post.

When you know how to do something, however, this complexity sometimes works against you. The same input does not always yield the same result due to a large number of things being estimated and interpreted. A scripted computer does things a lot more linear, which is as much an advantage as a disadvantage, but comes in handy when doing things where the parameters are known.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-28T22:05:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KevinLaity\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KevinLaity\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m taking the first step now toward better parsing by having a special regex builder.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery nice, I did not expect something like this so soon!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso, I can\u0027t complain too loudly about it when I\u0027m not taking the time to teach myself Csharp and .NET to do it myself.
