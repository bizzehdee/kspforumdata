I\u0027m keen to get into modding and I\u0027ve got a couple of ideas that I think would be neat. I\u0027m seeking the following feedback:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(a) Do other people think the ideas would be cool and/or useful?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E Can any experienced modders point me in the right direction to get me started? I\u0027ve read (and am fairly comfortable with) lots of the general modding material, but I\u0027m still not really sure to start with the first idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00A9 Have these mods already been created?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe two concepts are as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(1) A mod that allows idle Kerbals to perform some scripted walking around and/or other activities when they are standing within some range of the active vessel (or other Kerbal). An explanation: it detracts from the immersion for me when I have a bunch of Kerbals standing around some planetary base, but they are all completely static.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) A mod that allows RCS-powered vessels (including Kerbals) to be controlled relative to another orbital vessel. I don\u0027t just mean that the directional controls are aligned relative to to the vessel (as they are when you set a docking port as target), but also so that the RCS vessel comes to a stop relative to the other vessel when the WASD controls are idle. I feel like this would make it way easier to whizz around orbital stations on EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeen to hear your thoughts!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SmarterThanMe","CreatedById":58706,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T05:14:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E(1) would be good.

On the other hand i would like a function that would stop all relative motion when pressing a button or something like that. So whenever a user looses control he can regain it by pressing the button.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"timchap","CreatedById":149978,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T14:17:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@TheCardinal, good thought RE performance concerns.
