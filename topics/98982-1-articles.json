Don\u0027t forget some of us have been playing kerbal for a very long time, and will find this far to simple as a challenge. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, here is an Evas where I\u0027ve left the ship. Done an orbit around the Mun, then returned to the ship. And the same during a real solar system mod apollo mission just for kicks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/V75J8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

You need to use R to engage jetpack, and then use wsad,shift,ctr to move around. Its same idea as any docking though, so basically move kerbal away from the ship, fly around aimlessly, crash into some panels, and then get back inside by flying near enough to grab the ladder near the doors with F key. If you feel truly pro, try to DEORBIT a kerbal and make him survive (its kinda possible if you do it right).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
