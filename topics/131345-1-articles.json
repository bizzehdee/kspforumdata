As you may or may not know, BDA has a habit of using the green text that appears in the middle of the screen to indicate a lot of things. The issue is is that this text can\u0027t be turned off with the F2 key, which\u00A0is... less than ideal for videos. So, is there a mod that removes all the text from the screen when the HUD is off?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-04T03:39:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/117753-105-screenmessagehider-hides-screen-messages-when-f2-is-pressed/\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/117753-105-screenmessagehider-hides-screen-messages-when-f2-is-pressed/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hobbes Novakoff","CreatedById":129018,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-04T08:40:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks a ton!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
