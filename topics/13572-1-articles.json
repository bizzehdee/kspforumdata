I stumbled upon the demo at around 1 AM the night before work in the morning..and couldn\\\u0027t put it down! So I guess I can blame it for being sleepy that day, but it was worth it. By 2 AM, I had purchased the full version and struggled to get a rocket that could escape the atmosphere, but that had to wait until the next day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next day, I was fed up with being in the atmosphere and built the biggest baddest rocket I could. Sure enough, I blasted the little guys into orbit around the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve since improved to where I can obtain orbit, and am now on my Mun-landing mission. I don\\\u0027t know if it counts, but I crashed into it once!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m definitely glad I discovered this game, because there\\\u0027s nothing quite like circling around the moon with the rocket you made and controlled. I can\\\u0027t wait to see where future updates lead this game!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, hello everyone!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shhhilent1","CreatedById":28278,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-03T04:39:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome!
