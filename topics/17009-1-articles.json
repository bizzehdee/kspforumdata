That way you can concentrate on controlling vertical speed. Different players do this at different altitudes; some people like to stop at 10,000m or more and then descend, though I like to come down to about 3,000m before trying to stop. Or, a good way to zero horizontal speed gradually is to always aim for your retrograde marker as you steer backwards toward the surface. That way you will constantly be slowing vertically and horizontally as long as the engine is running. Don\u0027t try to touchdown until the retrograde marker is directly below your ship, because that means you\u0027re not moving sideways at all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it looks like that ship is carrying much more fuel than you need to get home, and the heavier it is, the harder it is to stop. Consider redesigning your lander to make it lighter, and then it will stop faster and be easier to steer. Maybe get used to landing a small 1-man ship before you try the much larger 3-man. It\u0027s a nice-looking ship, though. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-15T20:23:53Z\u0022 title=\u002208/15/2012 08:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 15, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Vanamonde\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Killerblonde","CreatedById":36220,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-15T21:04:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKeep you eye on the navball, make sure it\u0027s in surface mode, and aim your thruster to face retrograde.
