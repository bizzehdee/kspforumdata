I had to downgrade to the LV-909 due to excessive pitch caused by the aerospike rocket. Still, the NF will push over 24,000M if handled properly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome flying tips:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. She needs the ENTIRE runway. She\\\u0027ll also be very squirrely on takeoff, so I recommend setting SAS on until you just run out of tarmac. Make SLIGHT adjustments using precision controls. Right before she reaches the end, pull back hard and keep it level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Once airborne, pick up speed and point her skyward. Both aircraft will start accelerating into a 30 degree climb around 1500M. Operating altitude is 12,000M to 15,000M, and when half the fuel is gone you\\\u0027ll make mach 1.5 at 14,000-15,000M.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Flying with SAS on constantly is STRONGLY encouraged. She\\\u0027ll fly level and true at low altitude and maneuvers well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Exceeding the flight envelope at high mach WILL KILL YOU! Many crews have met their fate falling in a flat spin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Keep in mind that the NF is equipped with a RCS system for orientation in high atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, go out there and break some records! My altitude record in the NF is 24,986M.
