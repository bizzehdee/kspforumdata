That\u0027s a good thing.\n\nSo now I MUST use a heat shield.\n\nOk so Im reentering and the temperature is going up on my heat shield...\n\nAblator starts going away... 199/200\n\nAs I get lower, the temp goes WAY UP!!! ablator at 93/200\n\nLittle bit lower (about 19,000m) and now ablator is at 0/200\n\nBut my heat shield does not blow up... and actually starts cooling off even though external temp says 6,500 kelvin.\n\nSo where is all the heat going?\n\nMy MK1 stayed at about 406 kelvin.\n\nNo ablator left, so what Is acting as the heat sink?\n\nSorry if this is a silly question, I just want to understand the mechanics. If ablator is completely gone, then where is all that heat going? \n\nThanks ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-14T04:55:55Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2015 04:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Solar71**"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T09:41:34Z","Content":"The heat is probably being carried away by convection. Can\u0027t more than guess without trying it myself or seeing screenshots.\n\nThere is a point in any reentry where you simply have slowed down enough that you\u0027re no longer heating up. Maybe you just happened to randomly hit things exactly so that at the moment you run out of ablator, you\u0027ve slowed down juuuust enough for things to be okay?"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T12:08:24Z","Content":"If you had lost all ablator by 25km then you likely would have been toast.

After it loses all ablator the heatshield is just another part, but by that point you were going slow enough that a normal part with that thermal mass and heat tolerance would survive just fine. Basically, you were lucky... this time. However, if you can find ways to increase your drag, you don\u0027t even really need a heatshield at all for Kerbin re-entry from something like Mun or Minmus."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T21:08:03Z","Content":"I recently re-entered the atmosphere with no heat shields going 6.3km/s.

A supporting structure for the ablator? what\u0027s under the ablator? I would guess some sort of metallic \n\nsupport, but possible ceramic?\n\nEither way that material would get hot as well...\n\nIt honestly seems to me, that the ablator is just something to \u0022trick\u0022 KSP players into thinking heat is real.\n\nHonestly, it \u0022feels\u0022 like smoke and mirrors to me.\n\nBut of course I could be completely wrong. I would love it, if a Squad Dev person would chime in with something.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nOne more thing. Im going to turn up the reentry heat multiplier to 10.0 and see if something happens to my heat shield after ablator is gone.
