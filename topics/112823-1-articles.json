After it loses all ablator the heatshield is just another part, but by that point you were going slow enough that a normal part with that thermal mass and heat tolerance would survive just fine. Basically, you were lucky... this time. However, if you can find ways to increase your drag, you don\u0027t even really need a heatshield at all for Kerbin re-entry from something like Mun or Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T21:08:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI recently re-entered the atmosphere with no heat shields going 6.3km/s.
