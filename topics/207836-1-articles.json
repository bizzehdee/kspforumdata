Yes- KSP has no built-in systems to prevent you from copying the entire game. It\u2019s entirely possible and indeed advisable to do so if you use mods, this way you can keep different saves with different sets of mods separate to avoid interference/corruption/loss of saves etc. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E can even automate this for you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:28px;\u0022\u003EHOWEVER\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile copying the game for your own use is fine, I\u2019m fairly sure that copying the game to give to someone else is called piracy and is against a variety of laws, the exact details of which will vary depending on which nation you happen to be in. It\u2019s no different to buying a hard copy of a game, or music for that matter, and burning copies on CDs to give to others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo to answer your question: no.
