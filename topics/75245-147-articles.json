There\u0027s nothing in the way. When I switch to the probe around Kerbin, it HAS connection, and I confirm that the 40GM dish is pointed AT the vessel I want to control (and it says \u0022ok\u0022, it\u0027s not blocked by anything\u0022). So then I go to the vessel which I just confirmed is in range, and confirm that its dish is pointed at the deep space probe around Kerbin, which it is. And the ship has power. So why on earth is there \u0022no connection\u0022? There\u0027s two vessels which each have a 40Gm dish pointed at each other, with nothing in between, both have power, yet there\u0027s no connection.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#a9a9a9;\u0022\u003EAm I missing something?

But that can\u0027t be right, because I can\u0027t even get a direct connection from the original vessel back to Kerbin. It\u0027s off and on. Seems to go off for like 30ish minutes every few hours or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT II: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFigured it out lol. So the deep space probe only had a connection when I was controlling it, because a bunch of satellites had \u0022active vessel\u0022, but when I wasn\u0027t controlling it, it only worked when it could point to mission control, because I hadn\u0027t calibrated my kerbin network to always point at the deep space probe.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-07T20:06:21Z\u0022 title=\u002211/07/2015 08:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Crixomix\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"paul23","CreatedById":120544,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-09T16:21:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell I\u0027m wondering why the internal antennae of probes isn\u0027t working, isn\u0027t the 3km antenna meant to make sure you \u0022have control on launchpad\u0022?
