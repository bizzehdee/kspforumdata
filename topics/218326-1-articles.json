When close enough to craft you want to dock with to be able to be switched to. Switch to it.\u00A0 Click on the docking port and choose \u0022Control from here.\u0022 Click on your incoming ship and set it as target, then use the pilot option of point at target (The purple option next to the Nav Ball.) You will see the purple target symbol on the Nav Ball. Once lined up, switch back to your incoming ship then choose the ship you want to dock with as your target. As it is using its docking port as its control point, that is the part of the ship your target symbol on the nav ball is pointing at. Reduce the thrust level of your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E so that you can make fine movements. Then just adjust till your prograde marker is over the top of the target marker on the Nav Ball. Readjust using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E regularly to keep the overlap, be patient and keep your speed towards the target low. When getting very close make sure you are traveling towards the docking port at no more than 1m/s. If you do this then when you get close enough for magnetic attraction, the ports will snap you together. Now you are docked\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"darthgently","CreatedById":204885,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-18T11:48:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224301165\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022218326\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221688987282\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022229725\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022paranoid android\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 7/10/2023 at 7:08 AM, paranoid android said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIve seen mods for docking port alignment indicators but i think we need a built in one for the game.
