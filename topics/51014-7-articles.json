I\u0027ve had a period where I was doing well with them and just trying to eek out a little more performance / form / or the like to get them working. I\u0027d even been building and flying them using NEAR (because even though NEAR and FAR are pretty much the same I have a better track record with NEAR than FAR).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter taking a break I\u0027m just as good - if not a bit better - with my rockets but I can\u0027t remember how to get a plane that doesn\u0027t flip out. I\u0027m almost at the point of uninstalling NEAR for a bit and trying again later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo Date: The Jool-5 and really any interplanetary mission. I\u0027ve designed lots of Duna capable ships - even capable of Duna return. I\u0027ve even flown a few to Duna, but I\u0027ve never flown the return. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get caught up in the design, fiddling constantly to try to make it better and better. Getting frustrated when the one little thing breaks - is forgotten - makes trouble. Never getting everything to work together right. Or getting all of my designs but hitting part count cap on the Jool-5 ship making docking the modules an unbearable chore instead of part of the fun. I\u0027ve started the Jool 5 design stage 4 different times with 4 different mission profiles but I\u0027ve never got the ship to leave Kerbin orbit because I just burn out on the design. I\u0027ve still never been to Jool at all. (or Eve, Gilly, Ike, Moho, Dres, Laythe, Bop, Pol, Tyloand Eeloo for that mater).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve removed Mech-Jeb from my list of mods. My working theory is that this will get me past this block by forcing me to test designs in practice. Sending 6 different landers to Tylo to see which ones can/can\u0027t land and return will be A) more fun, \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E get me to Tylo at last, and C) prevent me from burning out on one part of the mission since I\u0027ll have so many missions to fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrent goal of my Sandbox game: Get ships (manned or otherwise) to every body in the solar system. Started yesterday. Got a ship at Mun (CSM, MEL, MER). Got a ship enroute to Moho (think I\u0027ll make it this time) (CSM \u002B 2 MEL). To do today: Minmus ship \u002B lander - land Mun mission - look at launch windows and design for that mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
