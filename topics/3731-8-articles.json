This tutorial while very informative back during KSP 0.15 or earlier in the development, 2 more maybe 3 new updates to blender have been released. Also there were no internal views in KSP yet. This tutorial really needs to be updated especially now with moving away from .DAE to .MU format. There is just so much that has changed from now until then. If somebody wants a chance to shine on these forums make a blender tutorial for the newer version of blender and KSP 0.20. It would be highly appreciated by alot of people and would only help KSP mod development by creating more and more mod developers. That is what helps make KSP great is it not?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-27T16:48:11Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2013 04:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Redneck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-09T18:45:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think that KSP 0.20\u002B supports .DAE files anymore.
