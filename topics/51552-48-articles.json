Saying \u0027upload commands\u0027 is like clicking the \u0027NEXT\u0027 tab after configuring something to install on your computer. By the time you get there, you\u0027re certain that\u0027s what you want to do. Why would you start a command train in the first place if you\u0027re not sure what all you want it to do? That\u0027s not a problem with coding how you send it, that\u0027s an error between desk and chair.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if I were to compromise. The easiest trick to fixing your scenario would be a simple \u0027recall last upload\u0027 button. In this case, in the event of what you\u0027re suggesting actually happening. Say, you realized just after upload that you told it to burn BEFORE the command to turn the vehicle retrograde for an orbital insertion. Everything in the last sequence you uploaded can be stored in a recall slot and be a button click away. Click it, and the sequence comes up in full. Do your editing, clear the old sequence, upload the new one. (Or even streamline that into an \u0027upload and replace\u0027 command.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the amount of work Cilph has to do. That\u0027s really up to him how exactly he codes it and how much work he wants to do. I\u0027ve programmed in C and C\u002B\u002B as well as programmed PLCs with ladder logic myself. And while setting this kind of code up may be more work than what you suggest, you also have to consider at the same time that over several iterations, hundreds of lines of code, and days of work in manhours, we may end up there ANYWAY. Because it\u0027s just better as a control scheme.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt that point you end up resting your head in your palm, elbows on the table going \u0027Why didn\u0027t I just do that in the first place?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKind of like how my PLC instructor about chewed my head off for something. I coded what I thought was an optimization into my PLC logic. A piece of logic in the main program ladder I set up to, what I thought, would bypass the program even looking at a large subroutine when it wasn\u0027t in use, saving runtime. (Hint: It still looks at the code, it just doesn\u0027t mess with it.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, when she looked at it, the first thing she asked, in no uncertain terms, was \u0027What\u0027s this? Why\u0027d you do this? What\u0027s this doing.\u0027 After a half-explanation/half-argument with her (Her personality is one to jump right in before I\u0027m finished explaining my thoughts), she explained to me that even though I bypass the logic, the PLC still scans through that code. I saved nothing and only added confusion and created a headache.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason it added confusion is because of something she kept trying to drill into our heads over and over. When writing PLC code, you need to make it as clear and simple as possible because even though you\u0027re writing it, it\u0027s other engineers WILL have to read it and work with it: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u0022If you can\u0027t read it like \u0027that\u0027 *snaps her fingers*, it\u0027s worthless code. Nobody will want it. They don\u0027t WANT to have to EXAMINE your code. They don\u0027t WANT to HAVE to decode it. You are selling product to them here. You have to make it as easy and as possible. If you can\u0027t do that for them, someone else WILL, and the company will pay THEM to do it instead of YOU.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the reason my code was \u0027wrong\u0027 was because I took the logic bypass out of the subroutine and put it on the main ladder. In doing so, I\u0027m making the engineers who have to read my code confused because now they see a \u0027bypass to nowhere\u0027 on the main code, and the subroutine appears to be missing a critical bypass. And that forces them to waste time flipping between two code sections wondering what the hell is going on. They have to \u0027hunt for it\u0027. And that\u0027s a headache. And that\u0027s why it is wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that\u0027s a bit different from what we want to see done here, but the core lesson is the same. Are we saving work by shortcutting the code? Or would this just become a headache that results in a set of fixes that ultimately cost more time and effort than \u0027doing it the hard way\u0027 in the first place?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, it\u0027s up to Cilph.
