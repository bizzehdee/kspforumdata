But good games last longer than bad decisions.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo here we are. 3 years later. Ripened and with some gray hair. (not kidding, my mums genes really hit me lately...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpdated the game and got to work.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA basic Kerbin orbital satellite system it should be (with RemoteTech).\u003Cbr\u003E\nBusiness as usual.\u003Cbr\u003E\n...\u003Cbr\u003E\nOr not so usual.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHeck, I was unable to read the \u0022Multiple Launch View\u0022 diagram of my favourite Remote Tech Visual Planner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd Google didn\u0027t help me either. Old bugger.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut hey, I\u0027m expierienced. I don\u0027t need those stinkin\u0027 diagrams...\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo I patched together my first little rocket with 3 minimalist satellites as payload. \u0022EFFICIENT\u0022 it\u0027s called.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWell, I was at \u0022Mark VII\u0022 until that thing could properly perform it\u0027s mission without running out of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI was thinking about grabbing my old, trusty check list assortment. But as said, I\u0027ve done this stuff a million times...\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow, deploying those 3 sats went as follows:\u003Cbr\u003E\nAttempt 1:\u003Cbr\u003E\nGot near the AP to deploy Sat 1, hit SPACE and realized, that I forgot to activate the Communotron on the sat and I also forgot to attach an antenna onto my deploy vessel.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd I also only had a pilot in that capsule and no enigneer. So...... R.I.P. that satellite.\u003Cbr\u003E\n(I have an internal rule, that only Engineers can fiddle with tech on EVA. So no EVA for manually extending that antenna)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAttempt 2:\u003Cbr\u003E\nSuccessfully decoupled 1st sat. Told MechJeb to circularize at next AP. But....it didn\u0027t budge.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo I was like: \u0022Hey, MechJeb, dude, bruh, lad, ... why you not turning that thing into the prograde stellar wind?\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nI was double-checking the sat and my blueprints.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen I realized why the OCTO2 core is much smaller and lighter than the OCTO.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI first thought I was smart to use the OCTO2, because it\u0027s exploiting the games obviously wack balancing of probe core weight/feature ratio.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, 2 is better than not 2, right? RIGHT?\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut in reality, those idiots of Probodobodyne forgot to include reaction wheels.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E is for beginners. So, R.I.P. that satellite too.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAttempt 3:\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis time I got them all deployed.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut after the second sip of my victory tea, I realized, that those sats were not nearly as evenly spaced as they should be.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn fact, the most of the time, they didn\u0027t have a connection to each other or the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFound out, that I had interpreted that Visual Planner diagram completely wrong and was deploying those sats in a way too high orbit to reliably work with Communotron 16\u0027s,\u003Cbr\u003E\nand also, the battery capacity was so tightly measured (\u0022EFFICIENT\u0022 it\u0027s called...), that the antennas would disable themselves at \u0026lt; 20% EC.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAttempt 4:\u003Cbr\u003E\nI let those other 3 sats in orbit and flew 3 new, slightly improved ones up there and again deployed them.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut again, the spacing between them was horrible. So even with 6 sats up there, the signal coveage was spotty at best.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo I went to sleep.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAttempt 5:\u003Cbr\u003E\nToday I upgraded those sat blueprints to make them actually viable (and more EFFICIENT!).\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd then took my Deployer Mk VIII to bring them in a fresh, unhumilated orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis time, I had figured out how to read that obsolete Multi Launch View diagram. So the 3 sats finally ended up in 120 degree spacing.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENext Mission:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nDeploy 2 polar orbit satellites.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI built an abomination of a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E sat with 9 dishes on it, to cover the whole Kerbol system (as a relay at least). I also didn\u0027t forget to attach stuff via electric servo hinges.\u003Cbr\u003E\nJust to give the kraken something to eat.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNailed the design for my large deploy rocket (honestly, that thing I put together in 5 minutes \u0022just worked\u0022 - and not in a Bethesda way...)\u003Cbr\u003E\nBrought those sats up there.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut then I did realize, that I had no clue how much \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E I need to get them to highly eccentric orbit. So ofc, I didn\u0027t have enough with me.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo I didn\u0027t even try to, aborted the mission, de-orbited the payload and set up my re-entry.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd at about 40 km above ground, I realized, ..... I didn\u0027t bring parachutes on my perfect large deploy vessel that \u0022just worked\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn my despair, I tried a powered landing over land. If SpaceX can do it, I can too. I\u0027m an IRL engineer after all (who doesn\u0027t do rockets or anything remotely close to it ofc)\u003Cbr\u003E\nI actually almost did it with my poddle engine, but my pod got separated from the tank/engine part at impact and tumbled into a rock wall and exploded.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut hey, I didn\u0027t give up on Valentina and erm.... Cris..fred until the very end. XD\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo at that moment, I realized 2 things:\u003Cbr\u003E\nA) Even with gray hair, I DO need my old checklists and tipps \u0026amp; tricks docs\u003Cbr\u003E\nB) This game is still as much fun as it was 3 years ago.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave a good one! And keep the blue side up! Wait....that\u0027s not for space flight..... Welp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-11T22:39:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome back. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
