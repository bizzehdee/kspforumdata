Don\u0027t worry if you see any issues in this clip, a few of the shots are due to be refilmed and the VFX/SFX aren\u0027t quite up to scratch yet. Nonetheless, I hope you enjoy it. That\u0027s as much as I can say at the moment.

However what was going on with the little explosions really just depends on how you observe them. It could be the final moments of the battle in a more sci-fi style or it could be the Vanguard exploding and the final explosion being the ships fuel reserve detonating. As for either the amount or timing of the explosions being synced with the actual video? No, going through the episode and counting the number of explosions/the time patterns in which they occur would simply have taken too long, sorry \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Megalodon 720","CreatedById":108146,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-03T20:42:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t wait to see the final thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"O-Doc","CreatedById":95453,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-04T07:54:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s your approach to music copyright if I may ask?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Halban","CreatedById":89536,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-04T15:49:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022O-Doc\u0022 data-cite=\u0022O-Doc\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat\u0027s your approach to music copyright if I may ask?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, I can\u0027t really answer that very clearly without going in to things that aren\u0027t supposed to be public yet.
