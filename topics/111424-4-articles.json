It was quite a journey to the base, but I made it. I did some mining, and build a refinery/factory with 2000 factory enhancers in total. Look for the mostly-red segment \u0022clamped\u0022 to the shop above the main section of the base (Or the second huge mining ship above the main base). There is a rail elevator to the refinery from the main building. Pressing the lower button brings the elevator down, the upper button sends it up.\n\u003E If you\u0027ve got the materials for your ship, you can use any of the machines there.
