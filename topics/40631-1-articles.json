But it sucks in stabilizing aircrafts. A whole lot of them doesn\u0027t fly smoothly but still shake with the all known wobble, because damping mode doesn\u0027t work as it should. Instead of bringing the amplitude of oscillation down slowly, it sometimes even produces this waving movement. For example, consider the B9 YF-28 Haldeman flys extremely stable on it\u0027s own, but when you kick in SAS and try to turn it, it flys as if it had parkinson afterwards (tested with FAR). I think the algorithm to adjust the differential equations for the damping could be optimized for planes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA feature for optimizing long range atmospheric journeys the also SAS lacks is horizon orientated stabilization. As of now, a aircraft cruising above Kerbin slowly but steadily pulls up as the surface curves away beneath it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnybody also feels like there still is some potential to put work on the SAS?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Synapse","CreatedById":72502,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T11:17:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eit flys as if it had parkinson afterwards (tested with FAR)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemove FAR, THEN complain about SAS on planes...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beeman","CreatedById":28178,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T11:29:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t worry too much about how spaceplane mechanics work for the time being.
