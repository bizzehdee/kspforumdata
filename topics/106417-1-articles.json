It\u0027s the Tier 2 launchpad - it\u0027s definitely bugged. It\u0027s most easily reproduced with LV-T30s and the Thumper boosters (and I see you are using the Thumper!)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frybert","CreatedById":97766,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T23:30:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, happens to me too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"finky45","CreatedById":139213,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T11:24:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/d68VwKB.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022d68VwKB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter updating to 1.0.2 the problem is still occurring (I didn\u0027t see a fix in either changelog). I zoomed in closer to see the problem and added stack decouplers to see if that would fix the clipping. I think the launchpad is bugged. As of now, KSP is broken. I cannot fly this rocket and I will not grind more crap contracts for 2 science a pop to unlock stabilizers to fix a bug. As you can tell from my tone I am getting pissy. I had a working product that I paid for in 0.90. Now you guys decided to work on 5 features simultaneously instead of releasing them one a time and testing them, because you set it in your mind to release on a certain date and you rushed. Now it\u0027s probably crunch time for programmers to fix the bugs that escaped your thorough testing procedures, and annoying for users that can\u0027t play the game. Not good for anyone. I don\u0027t like coming here and submitting bug reports. It\u0027s not my job as a customer to assist you in fixing your product. If you think it\u0027s not worth the hassle, then maybe you should charge more money to make it worth it. Tired of this money first, break it, then maybe fix it later game industry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and I did not receive my confirmation email for Bugtracker to submit this bug. Checked in spam/trash, tried to remake the account, no go. Looks like it wasn\u0027t sent or got hung up somewhere to the Google servers. Can someone with a Bugtracker account submit this bug so it can catch the attention of Squad? I need it fixed to continue playing and I\u0027m sure other people will run into the same problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
