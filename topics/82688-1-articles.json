The estimates of the amount of delta-v needed to launch from Venus vary widely, but with extreme Isp losses expected due to air pressure, as well as massive drag, and the atmosphere generally extending higher than the Earth\u0027s, you can expect the actual figure to be in the ballpark of 20 000 m/s of delta-v.

Glycerol has nearly no density change upon melting so one could fill all the probes void space with the stuff. The other alternative is paraffin wax which has comparable performance but is not as dense so less of it can be jammed in. That would be the best pre-cooling and heat storing could do, after that one will need heat pumps and the power system for those pumps, to keep something at room temp against venuses over 450\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C is insane. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet this JPL slide show on the idea of a long term venus lander-probe illustrate all the problems in achieving even that: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.lpi.usra.edu/vexag/meetings/archive/vexag_7th/oct2009/presentations/hunterVenusLanderTechnologies.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.lpi.usra.edu/vexag/meetings/archive/vexag_7th/oct2009/presentations/hunterVenusLanderTechnologies.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rainbowtrout","CreatedById":60253,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-25T17:16:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lajoswinkler\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lajoswinkler\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E-snip-\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for that \u003Cem\u003Etotally\u003C/em\u003E non-graphic explanation.
