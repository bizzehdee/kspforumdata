I could tell of how testing and bugfixing has been going on pretty much non-stop from waking up to going to bed, and how this fabled concept of a \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cweek-end\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 has become a strange, alien notion\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 But that wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t cover it. I could also tell of how during this I moved to a new apartment, and took apart my computer (and desk, they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve kind of become one unit at this point) and hauled it to the new place, put it back together again, and now I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m working through a 3G tether while the internet isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t hooked up. But that wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be the whole story either\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 I should also tell that I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m getting married this Friday, and that all the preparations for that have happened \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;while \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;all that other stuff was going on\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 But really, I think I can more accurately explain how things are going over here by simply saying that the only reason I know that today is Tuesday again is because I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m writing a dev note.

It should be well worth the effort once it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s all said and done. Most features are integrated and working together now in the main development branch. We have had a fair share of merging issues, but that was about expected, given how much was changed in this update. Most of those are taken care of now, and it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s really cool to see it all come together. \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;If I remember right, last week, I was writing about the challenges of coming up with meaningful, logical gameplay effects for each facility and for the Kerbal skills. We had many a discussion about those, and we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve got a few new features as a result of that, which I think a lot of people will enjoy.

We want to check it and see how it works, and if it fits what we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re looking for and it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a better option than vBulletin, we may want to change the KSP Forums. Also, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m helping to change the VAB crew shown on each version of the VAB building.

Basically, pilot skills are a set of additional SAS type modes which allow the pilot to lock onto various vectors. All of these modes are available in sandbox but they will only activate in career as you level up Kerbals with the pilot trait.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Marco (Samssonart):\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;I spent this week implementing the new building and wreck models Dan, Roger and Nick got as soon as they had them finished. By now, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve got the final versions of practically everything ready.

Just a bit. We finished the models, and it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s all into tweaking those small details that are popping out, thanks to our QA team. Managed to create some nice floors for the interiors after struggling with how they were implemented in the past. Turned out it was very easy. A tiled texture on the floor, and some decal lines with alpha with their cast shadows turned off. .After that, there have been some updates to the buildings grounds. That said, today I finished the wrecked buildings for the Research and Development compound. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m happy to say, all models are modeled \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Jim (Romfarer)\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; It has been another week of bugfixing and finishing up all the icons that are supposed to go into the editor toolbar. I also made the toolbar filters moddable and added some static methods to make this process a lot easier than the way it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s done internally.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Max (Maxmaps):\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; .\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;The push for experimentals continues as QA gets thinner. This week I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve focused more on things surrounding KSP, such as working with the website, helping with some quirks regarding the forums, as well as looking into revisions regarding our legal stances on community projects. These are things we are cool with and should encourage some more.

We\u2019ve got all the 0.90 features into the main QA git branch, which is a good indication of how stable QA is currently and a factor that makes QA go a bit more smoothly (no more jumping between various branches and features).\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;We\u2019ve had some pretty grim and elusive issues this past week and they\u2019ve been excellently tracked down and squished thankfully.
