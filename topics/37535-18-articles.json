You built your terrain tile as you wanted. You then went into the vertex paint tool and flagged all your vertices to be 0 value. The vertices on the edges that you wanted to snap to another tile, you\u0027d flag 100 (the range was 0 to 100). Scenery vertices (so when you went into the editor scenery would snap to them) were flagged a value of 50. 0 meant nothing could snap to them. You then exported using their tool and it would generate a text file with addresses of all the vertices and their function.
