I have also experienced it as a bug, where I simply right clicked on a tank and then right clicked elsewhere and it wouldn\u0027t go away. Sometimes going to map view or back to the space center worked. Another time I did a quicksave and reload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the time when I see this bug, I\u0027ve been messing with Alt-clicking on parts and it causes the pop-up screen to stick. I don\u0027t know if you were doing any of that, but might be something to avoid (or check if your keyboard is stuck).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedCowboy","CreatedById":92106,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-28T02:29:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for quick reply, I will try the right clicking on empty space thing and the IVA next time it happens. It was not a complex ship, just in lander stage with kethane stuff on it. I was trying to right click on the Kethane detector which was shrouded underneath a (I don\u0027t recall what it is ;;; 1.25 to mini hexagonal strut), but couldn\u0027t bring it up, kept on clicking on stuff and voila, a big mess.
