The Russians did it a dozens of times. It\\\u0027s possible, and while less than ideal, it\\\u0027s not particularly prohibitive, since there are naturally periods of low-velocity flight in a lunar transfer during which the plane-change may be more-efficiently done. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way to set it up in Orbiter when you wish to go from an arbitrary LEO to the Moon is to (mentally) project a line through the ascending and descending nodes out to the Moon\\\u0027s orbit, plan on intercepting the Moon at one of these points, time-accelerate until the Moon is the appropriate distance from reaching this point, then perform your TLI at the opposite node. \u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
