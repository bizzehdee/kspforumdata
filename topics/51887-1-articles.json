BUild this rocket in carrer mode, hope to fly to Duna and back - dV ~ 12 000 m/s, but rockets keep desintegrating shortly before or shortly after launch. Can\u0027t figure what did I wrong. Could you tackle this problem.

Had to edit out some parts because you are using a mod (MechJeb) that I don\u0027t use, but I don\u0027t think that has anything to do with your problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI worked on it for a while and made some improvements, but it was still breaking when I finally gave up. Here are the improvements that seemed to help:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Move the launch gantries down so that they are supporting the structure from the bottom instead of letting it hang from the top.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) (more) struts tying jumbo-64 fuel tanks to each other vertically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are the improvements that I think you should make but I didn\u0027t try yet:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Build wider, instead of taller. Your rocket is so tall that it is breaking under its own weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Use the kind radial decoupler that leaves some space between the tanks, instead of the hydraulic detatchment manifolds. This allows you to do the following two steps:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Put a strut connecting each radial decoupler to its parent tank, and\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Put a strut or two connecting each radial decoupler to the tank it is supporting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-05T09:37:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf your rocket keeps failing over and over and over, it\u0027s time to stop trying to fix it.
