I was annoyed that the scanner missed spots when timewarping too fast (read: traveling over the ground too fast). But I realized that the scanner has a time-delay between scans causing the gaps, and wanted to get rid of that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a tip in case anyone would like it / hasn\u0027t figured this out yet: putting multiple Kethane scanners will allow you to timewarp faster, thus scanning a whole celestial body much more quickly. The benefit is directly related to the amount of scanners on your sattelite, as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy mining!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-12T02:25:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen it comes to KSP, if you\u0027re in doubt, just add more of everything.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"horndgmium","CreatedById":92543,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-13T02:06:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t argue with that logic!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-13T02:51:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can also in the scanner configs change the detecting period to 0.
