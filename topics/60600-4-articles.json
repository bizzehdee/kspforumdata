Eventually I will have all of the game\u0027s data displayed on gauges and 8 segment readouts so a microprocessor like the arduino is needed to interpret the data from KSP and convert it to something the displays can use. Also it\u0027s much better to use a microprocessor for inputs (switches etc) as it can keep them in sync with the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have already ditched my simple human interfact board that I was using as it did not \u0022talk\u0022 to ksp... it just sent keystrokes, this meant that the switch positions would go out of sync with the game every time I quickloaded, docked or jumped to a different ship. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing Zitronen\u0027s plugin my arduino makes regular checks against the position of my switches and ensures that the game state matches them - for example if I set my SAS switch to \u0022ON\u0022 before even loading KSP... when I load the game up and start a flight the Arduino says \u0022hey this switch is already on\u0022 and it turns the SAS on in the game \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rosco P.
