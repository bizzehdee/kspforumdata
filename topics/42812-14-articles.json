Is it possible to add flag decal support here? It requires two things. One is the flag decal module added to the PART. That\u0027s trivial and can be done with ModuleManager or direct PART editing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second part is where I\u0027m unsure. The mesh needs a second UV map? Or a separate properly UV map? Not sure which exactly. I think the latter. The mesh name is used by the the FlagDecal module to display the flag. It\u0027s really nifty but hardly any parts coming out use it. And no stock parts at all. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-05T20:32:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll have to look up how that works, but sounds like you do need a separate bit of mesh with a particular texture and UVs.
