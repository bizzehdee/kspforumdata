Part categories are nice but it can be difficult to remember whether parachutes were in...landing? Or aerodynamics?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe existing improvements in clarity over KSP1 are appreciated, such as the size radius class and subheaders, but with the implication of many more parts included in the game versus KSP1 had in stock as time goes on, as well as modders pitching in new parts, a built-in filter system feels like a sensible addition. It should also alleviate the strain for those who jump into sandbox and feel overwhelmed with the number of parts, an existing problem in KSP1 even without DLC and mods\u2014helping them to hide everything that is or isn\u0027t of a certain size class or fuel type (especially if multiple fuel types are to be added in the future beyond the basic \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E/O/Xenon) would better help them navigate vehicle design as well as the kinds of choices one makes when putting together a rocket (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E vs thrust, for example).
