Though she may never be as bright as the prism of colours that serenade her body and accentuate every beat of her wings, Rainbow Dash sure was enjoying the book she was reading. The dusky red cover of the book mysteriously began to fade to a familiar milky white, and for some odd reason the words were getting smaller. As if they weren\\\u0027t already hard to read! Originally Rainbow though nothing of it. She was tired after a long day of flying, and wanted nothing more than a nap. Perhaps she was so sleepy, she was just seeing things. Chuckling lightly, RD proceeded to waltz away from the book, aiming towards the ever-so-appealing bed that sat waiting for her. Eyes half-open and dreamy, they just barely noticed the Wonderbolts poster hanging on the wall. Suddenly Rainbow\\\u0027s eyelids snapped open, her veins pulsing with adrenaline. She couldn\\\u0027t nap now! She needed to learn this trick for the Wonderbolts tryout next week! Dash hurried over to the desk at which she was formerly standing, and reached out her hooves to grab the book. But instead of touching the smoothness of parchment or the rough texture of the cover, Rainbow felt something she had been trotting upon her entire life. \u003Cem\u003ECloud.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Thinking quickly (but never as fast as her wings can take her), RD attempted to calculate why the book she had borrowed was suddenly being sucked asunder, as a lone bead of sweat rolled tentatively through her rainbow locks and down her cheek. Furrowing her eyebrows so close together they could crush a pea, Rainbow clenched her eyes shut at attempted to focus. Ideas ran like film through the imaginative, yet rather thick, brain of the pegasus, screening visual possibilities of how this escapade of literature could be taking place, though most of them were ridiculous (\u003Cem\u003EWhat if Nightmare Moon was on the other side of Cloudsdale and was sucking up my book with her magic?\u003C/em\u003E, for example). Now, RD was not the superstitious type, so what made her believe such silly things? If Rainbow ever picked up one lesson from Twilight, it would probably be opening her mind. It\\\u0027s hard to believe that just a few months ago, Rainbow Dash would barely go near a book, and here she was, sweating out of nervousness that she may lose one! Sure, it wasn\\\u0027t as awesome and action-packed as Daring Do will ever be, but the dried up parchment of the tome still contained something she loved, and was, unsurprisingly, good at. That\\\u0027s typical Rainbow Dash for you! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E What was I saying again? Oh yes, why Rainbow was having dumb ideas. Well, since she\\\u0027s learned to accept what may seem strange or unlikable, and the mighty word of Twilight Sparkle apparently supersedes common sense. And from that day when Rainbow Dash attempted to pilfer a book from a hospital because she loved it so much, Rainbow has put nothing out of the question, for better or worse. Dresses were still out of the question, permanently. So back to the story. Although the embarrassment of the \\\u0027book thief\\\u0027 incident had burned the lesson of open-mindedness into the pegasus\\\u0027s brain, she still though of Twilight Sparkle saying the words to her... Hold on! What if she had something to do with this? She\\\u0027s always sucking up to that Princess and staying up all month to learn some stupid spell, often to spectacularly horrible results! What if she was just practicing some summoning or book-taking spell or whatever and had just screwed up?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027\u003Cem\u003EUnless Twilight\\\u0027s doing another crazy one of their experimental spell thingies,\u003C/em\u003E Rainbow thought, still staring at the book vanishing before her, \u0027\u003Cem\u003EShe\\\u0027s gonna have some explaining to do when I find this book on the half way across Cloudsdale!\u003C/em\u003E\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHold on a minute. Cloudsdale... Cloud... Sdale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027I\\\u0027ve got it!\u0027 The pegasus cheered aloud, wings fluttering with the glee that their master had finally figured out a puzzle on her own. It may not seem like much to remember that things non-pegasi make slowly sink through the clouds, if not falling straight through, but when you\\\u0027re that awesome, you don\\\u0027t bother with the details. Now, there was a word for such great discovery. Twilight had told her during one of her super-boring lectures for Egghead-or-something University. Oh, what was that word? It sounds so cool and makes you sound smart; surely Rainbow would remember such an unawesome-yet-awesome word... AHA!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Ooh-reek-ah, or whatever those eggheads said. Woohoo!\u0027 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Still giggling for no apparent reason, Rainbow Dash swung her hooves and mane around in a random ball of chaos she called \\\u0027dancing\\\u0027. This continued for much longer than it should have, accompanied by a panting mantra of \u0027\u003Cem\u003EWho\\\u0027s awesome?\u003C/em\u003E\u0027, to which Dash would reply to her own question breathlessly: \u0027\u003Cem\u003ERD\\\u0027s awesome!\u003C/em\u003E Finally, fatigue overtook the random episode of joy, something that had probably never applied to Pinkie Pie, and Rainbow collapsed on the floor of her Cloudsdale home, kicking up clumps of cloud as she did so. Luckily enough, she herself was not sinking. Even though RD was possibly the most restless pony to ever exist, she felt perfectly happy to lay in the fuzzy maw of tightly-packed clouds that comprised her abode. In fact, Rainbow Dash was \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eso\u003C/span\u003E relaxed, if it weren\\\u0027t for the rapid, oscillating movement of her chest, you\\\u0027d be sure she had just... well, moved on! Soon enough, though, a pegasus\\\u0027s natural curiosity for velocity kicked into top gear, and Rainbow was back on her feet before you could say \u0027Easy-peasy, one-two-threesy\u0027. Looking back for once at her original objective, which had recently been totally ignored, the book was almost halfway through being swallowed out of Rainbow\\\u0027s home! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The mare had to think, and to think fast. She hovered around on her wings to get a closer look on ways to free \u0027\u003Cem\u003EYe Moste Wondrous Arte of Aviation\u003C/em\u003E\u0027 from its milky-white prison. Celeste hooves (Rainbow had always liked that word, since it sounded like you-know-who and also applied to the colour of her coat) promptly attempted to dig the tome out from its high-altitude grave, but to no avail - all that emerged were countless droplets of water. Those little devils decided that it would be a good idea to soak Rainbow Dash\\\u0027s tail, and that\\\u0027s just what they did. Weighted down by the very thing that Rainbow feared so much, yet lived on an adapted form of all her life, the once vibrant and twitchy tail of the pegasus became darkened and paralyzed. Even after this embarrassment, Rainbow shall not be stopped. Taking a quick moment to fan out her dripping-wet tail with her tired yet sleek wings (\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ESo fillylike,\u003C/span\u003E she muttered under her breath), RD shook her head menacingly at the table and thought of a more plausible solution. Not necessarily at the same time, though. That would be too hard; to move and to think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Well, if Dash couldn\\\u0027t remove the book from the cloud, she\\\u0027d simply have to remove the cloud from the book! Without a second glance or a sliver regard to the safety of the book (or anypony within a ten-mile radius), RD leapt from the floor, throttled her wings to maximum gear, and began to hurtle towards the desk, backhooves-forward. It was just standard procedure, kicking clouds to bits. In fact, Rainbow bet herself she could tear this whole place down in ten seconds flat! However, it does take much more than that to build it back up, so Rainbow sadly checked herself. Within mere milliseconds, the solid cloud dissolved behind Dash\\\u0027s hind hooves, and her quick reflexes yanked her to a halt, so that she didn\\\u0027t just kick down the wall. Shaking the spectral locks out of her face, Rainbow victoriously craned her neck behind her. Out of the corner of those scarlet peepers a golden glint could be found. The title of the book! Huzzah, the book was free! RD tempted the thought of another victory dance, but checked herself immediately, blushing that anypony may well see it through the hole in the floor...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EUh oh...\u003C/span\u003E\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-17T23:10:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ping111\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ping111\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you guys think of my fic so far?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E To most ponies, the book that was slowly sinking in to the table on which it was resting, which was made of cloud, would seem like jibber-jabber with some doodles.

Furrowing her eyebrows so close together they could crush a pea, Rainbow clenched her eyes shut at attempted to focus. Ideas ran like film through the imaginative, yet rather thick, brain of the pegasus, screening visual possibilities of how this escapade of literature could be taking place, though most of them were ridiculous (\u003Cem\u003EWhat if Nightmare Moon was on the other side of Cloudsdale and was sucking up my book with her magic?\u003C/em\u003E, for example). Now, RD was not the superstitious type, so what made her believe such silly things? If Rainbow ever picked up one lesson from Twilight, it would probably be opening her mind. It\\\u0027s hard to believe that just a few months ago, Rainbow Dash would barely go near a book, and here she was, sweating out of nervousness that she may lose one! Sure, it wasn\\\u0027t as awesome and action-packed as Daring Do will ever be, but the dried up parchment of the tome still contained something she loved, and was, unsurprisingly, good at. That\\\u0027s typical Rainbow Dash for you! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E What was I saying again? Oh yes, why Rainbow was having dumb ideas. Well, since she\\\u0027s learned to accept what may seem strange or unlikable, and the mighty word of Twilight Sparkle apparently supersedes common sense. And from that day when Rainbow Dash attempted to pilfer a book from a hospital because she loved it so much, Rainbow has put nothing out of the question, for better or worse. Dresses were still out of the question, permanently. So back to the story. Although the embarrassment of the \\\u0027book thief\\\u0027 incident had burned the lesson of open-mindedness into the pegasus\\\u0027s brain, she still though of Twilight Sparkle saying the words to her... Hold on! What if she had something to do with this? She\\\u0027s always sucking up to that Princess and staying up all month to learn some stupid spell, often to spectacularly horrible results! What if she was just practicing some summoning or book-taking spell or whatever and had just screwed up?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027\u003Cem\u003EUnless Twilight\\\u0027s doing another crazy one of their experimental spell thingies,\u003C/em\u003E Rainbow thought, still staring at the book vanishing before her, \u0027\u003Cem\u003EShe\\\u0027s gonna have some explaining to do when I find this book on the half way across Cloudsdale!\u003C/em\u003E\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHold on a minute. Cloudsdale... Cloud... Sdale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027I\\\u0027ve got it!\u0027 The pegasus cheered aloud, wings fluttering with the glee that their master had finally figured out a puzzle on her own. It may not seem like much to remember that things non-pegasi make slowly sink through the clouds, if not falling straight through, but when you\\\u0027re that awesome, you don\\\u0027t bother with the details. Now, there was a word for such great discovery. Twilight had told her during one of her super-boring lectures for Egghead-or-something University. Oh, what was that word? It sounds so cool and makes you sound smart; surely Rainbow would remember such an unawesome-yet-awesome word... AHA!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Ooh-reek-ah, or whatever those eggheads said. Woohoo!\u0027 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Still giggling for no apparent reason, Rainbow Dash swung her hooves and mane around in a random ball of chaos she called \\\u0027dancing\\\u0027. This continued for much longer than it should have, accompanied by a panting mantra of \u0027\u003Cem\u003EWho\\\u0027s awesome?\u003C/em\u003E\u0027, to which Dash would reply to her own question breathlessly: \u0027\u003Cem\u003ERD\\\u0027s awesome!\u003C/em\u003E Finally, fatigue overtook the random episode of joy, something that had probably never applied to Pinkie Pie, and Rainbow collapsed on the floor of her Cloudsdale home, kicking up clumps of cloud as she did so. Luckily enough, she herself was not sinking. Even though RD was possibly the most restless pony to ever exist, she felt perfectly happy to lay in the fuzzy maw of tightly-packed clouds that comprised her abode. In fact, Rainbow Dash was \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eso\u003C/span\u003E relaxed, if it weren\\\u0027t for the rapid, oscillating movement of her chest, you\\\u0027d be sure she had just... well, moved on! Soon enough, though, a pegasus\\\u0027s natural curiosity for velocity kicked into top gear, and Rainbow was back on her feet before you could say \u0027Easy-peasy, one-two-threesy\u0027. Looking back for once at her original objective, which had recently been totally ignored, the book was almost halfway through being swallowed out of Rainbow\\\u0027s home! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The mare had to think, and to think fast. She hovered around on her wings to get a closer look on ways to free \u0027\u003Cem\u003EYe Moste Wondrous Arte of Aviation\u003C/em\u003E\u0027 from its milky-white prison. Celeste hooves (Rainbow had always liked that word, since it sounded like you-know-who and also applied to the colour of her coat) promptly attempted to dig the tome out from its high-altitude grave, but to no avail - all that emerged were countless droplets of water. Those little devils decided that it would be a good idea to soak Rainbow Dash\\\u0027s tail, and that\\\u0027s just what they did. Weighted down by the very thing that Rainbow feared so much, yet lived on an adapted form of all her life, the once vibrant and twitchy tail of the pegasus became darkened and paralyzed. Even after this embarrassment, Rainbow shall not be stopped. Taking a quick moment to fan out her dripping-wet tail with her tired yet sleek wings (\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ESo fillylike,\u003C/span\u003E she muttered under her breath), RD shook her head menacingly at the table and thought of a more plausible solution. Not necessarily at the same time, though. That would be too hard; to move and to think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Well, if Dash couldn\\\u0027t remove the book from the cloud, she\\\u0027d simply have to remove the cloud from the book! Without a second glance or a sliver regard to the safety of the book (or anypony within a ten-mile radius), RD leapt from the floor, throttled her wings to maximum gear, and began to hurtle towards the desk, backhooves-forward. It was just standard procedure, kicking clouds to bits. In fact, Rainbow bet herself she could tear this whole place down in ten seconds flat! However, it does take much more than that to build it back up, so Rainbow sadly checked herself. Within mere milliseconds, the solid cloud dissolved behind Dash\\\u0027s hind hooves, and her quick reflexes yanked her to a halt, so that she didn\\\u0027t just kick down the wall. Shaking the spectral locks out of her face, Rainbow victoriously craned her neck behind her. Out of the corner of those scarlet peepers a golden glint could be found. The title of the book! Huzzah, the book was free! RD tempted the thought of another victory dance, but checked herself immediately, blushing that anypony may well see it through the hole in the floor...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EUh oh...\u003C/span\u003E\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats great!
