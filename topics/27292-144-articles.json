I need it to lift itself off the runway, but the only way I\u0027ve been able to get it to do that is to put multiple canards on the front, and I don\u0027t want that aesthetic. It shouldn\u0027t be necessary, either, given the amount of lift the design has, but at present it just thinks there isn\u0027t enough torque around the back wheels to lift the nose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the problem is the old lift inversion bug. Flip some aerodynamic parts upside down and it seems to screw up the lift calculation, but the UI will still make it look like everything\u0027s fine. This is easiest to see with the big delta wing; make a simple plane with two of those wings and it flies fine, but flip the wing upside-down and it\u0027s completely unstable, despite nothing changing with the center-of-lift arrow. In practice, it appears it\u0027s flipping the lift direction, and pulling the plane downward when it should still raise the craft. So I\u0027m betting that the game thinks some of my wing components are upside-down and I\u0027m losing part of the lift that would otherwise pull my nose up off the runway at 110m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lordlundar","CreatedById":81040,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T07:01:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMinmus Station is a go!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s55.photobucket.com/user/LordLundar/media/screenshot4.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i55.photobucket.com/albums/g135/LordLundar/screenshot4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMade the station docker Mk2 that uses the regular docking port and will ensure a safe landing for the kerbal in it.
