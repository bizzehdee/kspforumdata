It uses all three types of liquid engines, and even has ASAS on one side pod and SAS on the other. The lack of a tail is due to the current aerodynamics producing almost uncontrollable roll-coupling on ships with a single tail fin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe wobble on stage transitions can be a little hairy, but it makes orbit with a half-tank left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstructions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[list type=decimal]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[li]SAS on - this ship pitches down hard on launch and barely clears the tower![/li]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[li]Full throttle all the way[/li]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[li]The pitch handling is neutral between around 1250-2500 ft.
