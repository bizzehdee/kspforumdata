You must be very careful, because you can get a Moho encounter quite easily even if your parameters are slightly inaccurate. However, when it is time of the Moho orbit insertion, you notice that required dv is 1500 m/s more than calculated. You should use Mechjeb or some other precision node editor and adjust your burn very carefully. Needed accuracy is 0.1 m/s and one second in time. Calculated values are typically inaccurate by some tens of m/s because the KSP\u0027s patched conic approximation is inaccurate, so you have to iterate values by hand. I have found that it is better to leave from a quite high orbit (300-600 km), because calculators assume instantaneous velocity change and practically it takes minutes and causes the more severe inaccuracies the lower the initial orbit is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should make trajectory checks and possible corrections immediately after leaving Kerbin\u0027s SOI, about halfway, about 10-20 days before encounter and last check couple of days before encounter.
