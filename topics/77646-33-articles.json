We honestly don\u0027t even have a fully fleshed out concept of operations or equipment ideals. So there isn\u0027t really even a true idea of what the code needs to do. We can make a hello world program with empty functions that we refer to as \u0027attitude control\u0027, \u0027biocontainer management\u0027, etc and it would be quite meaningless, but stable. I think once Luis gets back after this week and we get a good idea of what sorts of data we will need/want to collect, we will be able to start figuring out the concept of operations, from that we can begin actually determining more information about hardware than some vague guesses about which processor to use. Additionally there will be two phases of stability in the software. Stable in that it can run on its own just fine. And stable AFTER it has been integrated with the hardware. There is going to need to be some significant effort to make sure the system can detect spurious data and take action on its own. After all, we are not very likely to have constant communication with the satellite. If anything we are going to need to spec it out so that if we establish several minutes of communication that we can download 2-3\u002B days of data (assuming for weather or whatever that we couldn\u0027t establish a connection) so we don\u0027t lose anything.

I think, it\u0027s going to be easiest to simulate everything on the level of physical elements. I\u0027ll look into it in a bit more detail, but there is a lot of code like converting GPS coordinates to and from orbital elements and time, etc. Things you need for interfacing with the simulation that aren\u0027t necessarily visual. That would probably be a better place to start. And if it has to run from command line for now, that\u0027s fine.

One is for torques and rotation. That\u0027s pure Euler mechanics. There is nothing fancy there. The integration needs to be decent, but the sat will need to be able to correct for any drifts, so small numerical errors here aren\u0027t a big deal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second part is satellite\u0027s motion around the Earth. That stuff will be derived from Hamiltonian mechanics, yes, but by the time things like drag forces enter (or thrust, if we get to that), it will be just a set of differential equations to integrate. Now, this part\u0027s tricky, because we want to guarantee that integration isn\u0027t the weak link.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are also two options here. I can either simulate Newtonian physics \u002B corrections from gravity treated as inertial forces. (That\u0027s what KSP does, but I\u0027ll have corrections due to non-spherical Earth in there, plus, much better integration routines.) Or I can convert real forces on the sat to be taken into account in differential equations for orbital elements. I think, the later is more precise, because a lot of \u0022hard\u0022 integration is actually the analytical solution for classical orbit \u002B perturbations. So I feel like numerical errors will be much easier to control. But I\u0027ll have to read some orbital mechanics texts to refresh my mind on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn either case, the first step will be testing pure physics part against data from a real satellite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, I agree with Mazon Del.

He says they occasionally toss up a cubesat themselves, so they actually have some experience with this. Someone could look into setting this up. We may want to set up a system so we can make a file, call it \u0022Instruction 6\u0022 and pass it out. That way if it recieves a second Instruction 6 or a 5 or whatever, it knows to disregard these repeats. This way we can pass the file around to the various operators and have them try and send the instructions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nicholander","CreatedById":108347,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-13T20:07:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mazon Del\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mazon Del\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E..., we still don\u0027t have a good idea how to manage CO2/O2 levels and I think someone should look into that since it will likely be a problem we will have to deal with.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECouldn\u0027t you just use an O2 tank to give air/O2, and a CO2 scrubber to get rid of the CO2?
