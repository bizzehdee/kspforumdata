All that you see are the time required to transmit data and the amount of electricity that costs. And the way that\u0027s set up, the starter whip antenna uses the least power and takes the most time, but that time is still short enough not to be a factor. So there\u0027s no reason to use the others.\n\nHOWEVER, there are a couple of mods you can use that change this.\n\nFor career games, I recommend [AntennaRange](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/56440-1-0-AntennaRange-1-10-1-Enforce-and-Encourage-Antenna-Diversity). It has no real effect on sandbox games unless you enable certain options.\n\nFor sanbox games, there\u0027s [RemoteTech](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83305-1-0-4-RemoteTech-v1-6-7-2015-06-25), which adds a bunch of new antenna and also makes it impossible to control probes unless you have a direct communications link to them (and then also has a signal delay based on distance). Not very career-friendly IMHO (at least with the stock tech tree), and also rather obsolete in this age of autonomous vehicles. Still, if you want an extra challenge and don\u0027t mind making probes way more expensive to use, it can be fun."},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T23:27:10Z","Content":"There are definitely times when a high-powered antenna is called for.

The Comms-88 dish requires noticably more power per data, all others (including the high-gain antenna from the asteroid day mod) have nearly identical power requirements. That\u0027s power-per-data, mind you: the faster transmitters will still use more power per time."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T00:01:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E There are definitely times when a high-powered antenna is called for.

There is no need to transmit data the instant you acquire it. If you\u0027re doing a fast fly-by, you can either leave the experiment results windows open indefinitely or just hit the \u0022keep\u0022 button, then review the experiment later and transmit it then. If you\u0027re falling into Jool, just pop some airbrakes and/or chutes. The atmosphere is 200km thick, after all, and dense so that a little drag goes a long way. It takes a LONG time to reach the surface. And because solar panels don\u0027t work to speak of out as far as Jool, let alone inside its atmosphere, you want the low-power antenna so you don\u0027t run out of battery before you run out of data."},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T00:12:07Z","Content":"The part descriptions are backwards and haven\u0027t been fixed yet.

RT just amplifies that. And I find moderate difficulty is fine for my career (with both RT and TAC-LS).
