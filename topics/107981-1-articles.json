Some coatings act as some form of heat shield, others generate power in the sun. There are 2 ways to apply a coating: partially or compleetly. Partially are only applied on a part of the part, if the coating is partial, the effect of the coating is partial too. Coatings can be multi-layered, but most coatings don\u0027t work as strong when another coatings are applied.
