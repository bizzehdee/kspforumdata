It might be a good idea to paint your rocket with it(reference intended)?\n\n**Coatings**\n\nCoatings are paint jobs which slightly change some properties of a part. Some coatings act as some form of heat shield, others generate power in the sun. There are 2 ways to apply a coating: partially or compleetly. Partially are only applied on a part of the part, if the coating is partial, the effect of the coating is partial too. Coatings can be multi-layered, but most coatings don\u0027t work as strong when another coatings are applied. The types of coatings:\n\nThermoelectric coating: generates electricity from heat;\n\nPhotovoltaic coating: generates electricity when kerbol is shining on the part;\n\nThermal control paint: Makes a part heat up less quickly.\n\nLuminous paint: makes parts glow and give of a small amount of light.\n\nAerodynamic paint: Slightly reduces drag.\n\n(For every type of coating or paint, I checked if it is actually possible to make).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T00:27:56Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 12:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jappards**\n  \nChanging title to be less confusing"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T00:43:16Z","Content":"Nice idea"},{"CreatedByName":"Jappards","CreatedById":131869,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T10:12:36Z","Content":"Not sure if this is the best way to apply a coating:\n\n**Coating menu**\n\nThere would be a special menu where your mouse turns into a brush icon and you are able to paint over it, but you could also use the paint bucket to compleetly cover the hull. Then you select a coating in the coating menu and click on the part of the part or the whole part to coat it. There would also be a tool menu consisting of a brush, a paint bucket and an eraser."}]}
