I found this game not too long ago and love it. I really dig the actual depth of physics the devs have put in the game and I hope they can keep improving.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still haven\u0027t successfully landed on the Mun, and my first attempt at aerobrake capture around Jool ended in flames, though I\u0027ve since managed to orbit Eve with a similar maneuver. I have been trying to make minimal dV ships and using gravity-assisted slingshots to get about on the stock version of the game (still using 0.19). I think it\u0027s awesome that the game so easily inspires learning about orbital mechanics and is nearly realistic about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost looking forward to: ideal-gas atmosphere instead of the isothermal model currently in use, improved drag model and maybe getting something in that would allow the use of Lagrange points. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDivisionByZero\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal01","CreatedById":57322,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T16:57:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome DivisionByZero!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T17:05:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, at least as far as Lagrange points are concerned, it can\u0027t be done right now because the game uses a two-body modelling system based on patched conic approximation to determine orbits for spacecraft, while the planets themselves are put \u0022on rails\u0022 (as are any craft that are not being actively controlled). Having realistic \u003Cem\u003En\u003C/em\u003E-body physics would indeed be quite nice, but it would also significantly increase the amount of processing power needed, because then you\u0027d have to be constantly calculating the effect of every body in the solar system on your tiny craft at the same time through every step of the orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe developers have stated that they\u0027re working on the drag model, although there\u0027s a few mods out there you can play around with that try to add a little more realism. Ferram Aerospace and Deadly Reentry are probably the two best-known.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt any rate, if you ever get stuck on some of the finer points of the game, check out the Drawing Board (link in my sig), which has a wealth of links to tutorials and other reference materials about the game. Don\u0027t be afraid to ask questions of the fine folks in the How To section as well, as many of them have tons of experience with the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-27T19:51:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
