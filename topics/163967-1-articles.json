However I can\u0027t seem to build a spaceplane I can actually land. I find getting to orbit easy. Re-entry is hit and miss but if I can make it to below 600m/s things generally survive that bit. It\u0027s landing I can\u0027t seem to manage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve included 2 links. One is a crew plane (called 14 man but I think I dropped it 10) and another is supposed to lift an 18t fuel tank. Both can get to orbit with ease. Both re-enter if you\u0027re lucky. One lands on a good day, the other mostly explodes. Problems are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) The small plane just won\u0027t manoeuvre\u00A0despite using large control surfaces.

If I add wings further forward it flips out on re-entry and is not recoverable (well, you can get it going straight with a quick blast in closed cycle mode but it won\u0027t turn even gently). It also has a habit of ripping its own wings off when decelerating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAction group 1 switches the intakes and the rapiers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMODS: There may be a SETI Probe Parts pod in the big plane.
