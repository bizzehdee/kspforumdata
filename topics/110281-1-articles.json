I believe it causes a bug and possible crash if you somehow get it working."},{"CreatedByName":"AsterXiphos","CreatedById":82544,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T20:37:41Z","Content":"Put the boosters on in pairs (2x symmetry).

When you add parts with symmetry, any parts that you later add to the first symmetry parts will have their same symmetry by default. The only other option is 1 at a time. So, if you\u0027re doing asparagus staging, you add the radial boosters in pairs, not all at once. Otherwise you can\u0027t do the fuel lines the way you want."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T21:06:21Z","Content":"KSP pretty much insists on consistent symmetry level.\n\nYou can put no-symmetry parts on symmetric ones, and you can put N-symmetry parts on N-symmetric ones, but you can\u0027t put parts of one symmetry level on parts of a different symmetry level.\n\nThis limitation comes up most often when putting together asparagus staging. One way around that is to add the radial boosters in pairs, as suggested above, but I don\u0027t like that way myself because it introduces hassles with editing/maintaining them.\n\nThe other way is to just turn off symmetry when adding the fuel lines, which is admittedly also a hassle, but I find it much less so than the other option, so that\u0027s what I do.\n\nSubassemblies help with some of this pain; I put together a library of various sizes of asparagus for different size payloads, so it\u0027s quick to drop one in."}]}
