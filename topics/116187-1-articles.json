Paste the desired texture there.\n\n2) Open a simple image viewer and either (a) rotate the desired texture 180 degrees, or (![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) invert it both horizontally and vertically (The stock texture format has changed from PNG to DDS, which doesn\u0027t matter in itself, but it looks to have been inverted.)\n\n3) Open \u0022parachuteMk1.cfg\u0022 in a text editor add in the line \u0022texture = parachutes\\_texMapblue.png\u0022 (or whatever you have named the image file, without quotes) close to the top (say, somewhere after author but before techRequired) then save and close.\n\nI\u0027m not certain this will work, as I\u0027ve not tried it myself. If the texture looks all wrong, ignore step 2. (Repeat it to undo)\n\nIt should work though, despite the fact that both the mesh and texture formats used by the game have changed (mesh changed from DAE to MU, texture changed from a mixture of PNG and TGA to MBM to DDS), and the config files have been somewhat restructured. Not bad for a game which has been under constant development for 4 years, using numerous different versions of Unity."}]}
