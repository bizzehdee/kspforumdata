Several mods became incompatible with 1.2 for example when they were updated to work with 1.3, but the min version said they were compatible back to 0.5 or whatever. The result is many users download the mod to get new parts or features and end up not only breaking their existing mod install, but their save files as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust a thought.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
