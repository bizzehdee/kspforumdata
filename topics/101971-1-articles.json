Most organized diets are kind of silly, the fact here is simple: you will lose weight if you expend more calories than you take in. Simplest advice I can give here is more protein, fewer carbs. Carbs make you feel tired and therefore less willing to exercise. And just less food in general. I\u0027ll tell you from experience, don\u0027t ever exercise on a full stomach.

Forget about the BMI, it is rubbish, the Terminator - in the 80\u0027s at least - was not obese, was he?

Give your body enough rest - only train every other day or rotate endurance and muscle training - your body needs time to rebuilt itself to the new activity.

Do not resist every urge of your sweet tooth, if you give in at last it will be disasterous usually - just enjoy smaller treats more intensly: e.g. let chocolate melt in your mouth instead of chewing down a whole bar. And invest a bit more in real chocolate, meaning more cocoa, less sugar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Avoid soft drinks and juice, at least water down the juice, but develop a taste for water rather. Sugary drinks are suspected to influence your insulin production more negatively than similar doses of other sweet food.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Do not do this for some weeks or months, change your lifestyle.
