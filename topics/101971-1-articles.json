And you\u0027re got that. 90% of the battle.\n\nSecond thing you have to realize that it will take time, so stick-to-it-ness is needed and plenty of it.\n\nThird, start in moderation. Most people start too hard and burn out before seeing any real results.\n\nFourth, you don\u0027t need a lot of money to exercise. Stairs, hills, flat terran are all execrise equipment. You just have to use them. But you may need good shoes if you\u0027re planning on running or cross-training, unless you\u0027re going to start a type of martial art. \n\nFifth, you\u0027re mostly likely going to have to change your diet. Ramp up the veggies, lower the carbs. Research the American Heart Association website.\n\nIf you haven\u0027t exercised in awhile, start low-impact - no running, no jumping jacks, no deep knee bends, squats or heavy weight lifting. You\u0027ll get there later. Do a lot of slow and gentle stretching to begin. Warm, loose, flexible muscles don\u0027t injure as often. And you\u0027ll actually start toning yourself just by stretching. Slowly add light barbells into your stretching routine. \n\nAnd walking everyday for about 20 to 30 mins at a brisk pace -- you should still be able to have a conversation with someone without gasping for breath - is a very good start.\n\nNow, go google healthy weigh loss and read. Do not go for the quick or fad diets or super-duper boot-camp exercise programs. The fad diets are just that fads. And the more extreme exercises, you\u0027ll get to them eventually. \n\nLast thing, enjoy yourself and have fun while you\u0027re working out. \n\nGood luck."},{"CreatedByName":"ZedNova","CreatedById":57175,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T01:19:39Z","Content":"I have been exercising lately to get ready for the national guard. \n\nSome basic things i learned so far:\n\n1) If you haven\u0027t exercised much before, the first time to start YOU WILL HURT, so don\u0027t go all out when you begin, ease yourself into it with light exercises.\n\n2) Do not exercise muscles that are still sore, wait until they are no longer sore. \n\n3) After you can exercise without getting sore, do short bursts of exercising throughout the day. (I typically do 30 pushups, 30 situps, 4 times a day. I\u0027ll lift weights about twice a day.) \n\n4) After you start exercising you\u0027re gonna start eating more. Don\u0027t force yourself to eat more *because* you are exercising, just let your body decide how much energy you need to consume and adjust your meals accordingly.\n\n5) Don\u0027t burn yourself out.

How? By[installing a device](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/06/130613092007.htm) into your brain and reprogram your eating habit, literally.\n\nNow, the surgery goes something like this:\n\nYou lie on an operation table. They put your head inside a huge clamp to immobilize your head.\n\nThen they put some topical anesthetic on your scalp, and then proceed to drill through your skull to get to your brain.\n\nNow, at this point, you may have noticed I did not mention they put you to sleep with sedative. **BECAUSE THEY DON\u0027T.**You are required to be *wide awake* during the procedure. As there is no pain receptor in the brain, you won\u0027t feel anything when they probe it. But you will feel the pressure on your skull as the drill make its way through the only protection you have to your squishy, vulnerable, but all-so-important brain. (thinking about it, it is almost no different than doing trepanning in the medieval age huh)\n\nWhy are you required to be awake though? Because that is how [they figure out if they got to the right place](http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/Prime/medical-frontier-brain-surgery-weight-loss/story?id=11574066\u0026singlePage=true). They will drill 10 centimeters into your brain, on both hemisphere, which will take about an hour to do, to reach a point in your hypothalamus (called the lateral hypothalamic area) where it regulate your metabolic function and your feeding behaviour, and they will simulate those areas with electricity. As the region of the brain regulate your feeding behaviour is right next to the region that regulate your body sense of hot/cold, they will ask you (who is still awake the whole time, remember) whether you feel hungry/full or hot/cold to know if they get to the right place as they poke around your brain. Once they got to the right place, they install, well, lemme quote the article:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E lender leads tipped by a row of electrical contacts designed to non-destructively deliver mild electric pulses to a specific location. The leads are connected to a compact, battery-operated pulse generator in a fashion similar to a heart pacemaker.\n\nKind of interesting they specifically mention that it is \u0022designed to non-destructively deliver mild electrical pulses\u0022, isn\u0027t it?\n\nThe total operation last 3 hours, and after that, they will put you inside an enclosed metabolic chamber as you recover and study your metabolic rate, and play around with the programming of the device until they get a satisfactory result, achieving total control of how you eat (they can even make you feel nauseous by just tweaking the current a bit), and turn off your craving for food as they like. Congratulation, you are now \u0022free\u0022 from obesity.\n\n-----\n\nSo, do you feel like exercising now? ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nNote that while I intentionally written this in a scary angle, the actual procedure is done really carefully and the chance of serious complication that result in paralysis or death is less than 1%. The result is also stellar, with patients report weight loss after 9 months, and one of them report that she no longer has to fight constant hunger anymore, and her binge eating score has reduced from severe to normal range. Also, this procedure is only done for patients who are morbidly obese and no other method can save them, even gastric bypass surgery. It is for people who truly can\u0027t control themselves anymore and require technological intervention on their behaviour.\n\nBut hey, what is wrong about installing a device in your brain that can control your very basic instinct to feed, eh? ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-15T14:38:33Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2015 02:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RainDreamer**"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T10:02:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E But hey, what is wrong about installing a device in your brain that can control your very basic instinct to feed, eh? ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nSurgery on a body that is in essence healthy is always a bad idea.

It is only for morbidly obese patients who all other methods has proven ineffective, even[gastric bypass surgery](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007199.htm), and let me quote what it entail, because it sounds scary enough without me writing it up:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E There are two steps during gastric bypass surgery:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - The first step makes your stomach smaller. Your surgeon will use staples to divide your stomach into a small upper section and a larger bottom section. The top section of your stomach (called the pouch) is where the food you eat will go. The pouch is about the size of a walnut. It holds only about 1 ounce of food. Because of this you will eat less and lose weight.\n\u003E - The second step is the bypass. Your surgeon will connect a small part of your small intestine (the jejunum) to a small hole in your pouch. The food you eat will now travel from the pouch into this new opening into your small intestine. Because of this, your body will absorb fewer calories.\n\nThey *reroute* the path of food going through your body and regulate the amount of food you eat by physically *staple* your stomach. And if even that doesn\u0027t help, then electrode in brain would be the final choice.\n\nSo...how about it OP? Do you feel a sudden desire to exercise?![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-15T10:21:59Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2015 10:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RainDreamer**"},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T11:35:57Z","Content":"Yeah I need to read through this thread as well.

Do not eat more than your body needs - might require some over the thumb calorie calculations. Change your meat-vegetable ratio towards more vegetables, reduce noodles, rice, potatoes - although potatoes are less a problem actually.\n\n2. Do not eat (significantly) less than your body needs, your basal metabolic rate - starving your body will make it eager to save calories and pack provisions for the next bad season. (Stone age programming that is still active in our cells, because it got us here over the last millenia.)\n\n3. Sports, train your muscles - more muscles mean more calories burned even while doing nothing, but they have to come from somewhere.\n\n3.a. Forget about the BMI, it is rubbish, the Terminator - in the 80\u0027s at least - was not obese, was he? Measure your body fat intead, a tape measure around your hips, pinch your tummy, bounce infront of a mirror and look how much keeps bouncing.\n\n4. Sports, train your cells - regular endurance training has been proven to help prevent diabetes (from being overweight) and heart problems - even a fit-trained chubby lives healthier than a skin-n-bones couch-potato!\n\n5. Give your body enough rest - only train every other day or rotate endurance and muscle training - your body needs time to rebuilt itself to the new activity. After your training you should feel exhausted, but not half dead - stress (i.e. to much for to long of anything) comes in all varieties and is never a good thing.\n\n6. Do not resist every urge of your sweet tooth, if you give in at last it will be disasterous usually - just enjoy smaller treats more intensly: e.g. let chocolate melt in your mouth instead of chewing down a whole bar. And invest a bit more in real chocolate, meaning more cocoa, less sugar.\n\n7. Avoid soft drinks and juice, at least water down the juice, but develop a taste for water rather. Sugary drinks are suspected to influence your insulin production more negatively than similar doses of other sweet food.\n\n8. Do not do this for some weeks or months, change your lifestyle. Loosing weight over a short period of time and gaining it afterwards repeatedly is unhealthy and the trend usually points upwards regarding body weight.
