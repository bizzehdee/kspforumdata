There should be 2 lines cutting each other with the contract orbit and your orbit. Place a node at one of them and it should be fairly easy to match your orbit with the contract orbit. There is no easy way to do that last part with mechjeb but still that last node tweak is really easy. Before that you can use ascent guidence with the specified inclanation and pe.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-14T05:28:50Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2015 05:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by n0xiety**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tontow","CreatedById":64552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T05:51:07Z","Content":"Anyone know of a mod that has maneuver node editing for argument of periapsis?"},{"CreatedByName":"DeMatt","CreatedById":90539,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T06:03:04Z","Content":"Really gotta ask... what is your problem with just eyeballing it, and then fixing the inevitable error?

Well if the orbits are close and you have fuel left i don\u0027t see a reason why you wouldn\u0027t be able to do it. Just match your inclanation first and then pe and ap. The same thing i told you in the earlier post works. You will have 2 cutting points with the contract orbit and your orbit.

Instal Hyperedit or alt\u002BF12 and complete contract from cheat menu.\n\nYou can read orbital parametrs just fine from mapscreen. Click on Pe or Ap marks during manuver plot and you can see them without mousing over.\n\nWhen i am doing sat missions i will launch to corect inclination when space center is near ascending or descending node of contracted orbit. Circularize at aprox 75km, then i will plot maneuver to hit Pe. If after burn Pe is slightly off i will burn radial or antiradial to get it to correct pozition and then i will tell mechjeb to do Apoapsis change at next apoapsis (becouse future Pe is my Ap now).
