If they are just sitting there, it might be a graphical glitch and you can just walk up to them. If they are on the surface but below the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn\u0027s \u0022sea\u0022 level, then they might be stuck forever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that doesn\u0027t help, they are probably doomed. The only other thing I can think of would be to hurl something at them and try to knock them free without destroying them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spyritdragon","CreatedById":70515,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-31T10:50:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had a similar situation. Jebediah fell down, and i switched to Bob before he got back up. He started doing weird glitchy movements under the lander, and as soon as i switched back to him he fell clean through the surface of the moon, about a hundred or so metres down and got stuck there. Luckily Jeb came in a one man ship, and the lander he was visiting had two crewmembers, so i was able to end his flight and fly both ships back home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith .21, i don\u0027t know anymore though. My suggestion, if you have the same problem as me, would be trying to find out how many metres below the surface you are, then editing your persistance file to un-glitch it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chuangatronic","CreatedById":78585,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-31T23:13:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy problem was a lot like yours Spyritdragon. As I was driving up towards the stranded lander, it somehow disappeared below the surface and was stuck there unable to do anything. I ended up just destroying the lander in the tracking station and losing Philming. Thanks for the help though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
