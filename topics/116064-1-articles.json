YAY!\n\nv1.0 I guess..\n\n(please read the whole thing BEFORE doing anything)\n\n~~Introduction~~\n\nConfiguring a Dualshock 4 for use in a PC game that only just barely supports controllers is a real pain, so I\u0027ve taken the liberty of carefully crafting the InputMapper profile (KSP.xml) as well as the KSP settings (settings.cfg) to take away the guesswork on establishing a baseline setup for using the DS4 in KSP with the InputMapper program. The benefits of using a DS4 for KSP should be clear- using the trackpad as a mouse and the control sticks for more precise control of your craft is just great! Please feel absolutly free to post your modifications to either file, I\u0027m posting this code under creative commons open-source style- hack away! ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n~~Installation~~\n\n[mind the directions above the sections of code to get the required files]\n\n1. Buy, install, and run Kerbal Space Program (32-bit version) at least once.\n\n2. Acquire a Dualshock 4 controller along with the appropriate USB cable to allow PC connection.\n\n3. Download, install, and run InputMapper (link below) at least once.\n\n4. Make sure your DS4 works on your setup.\n\n5. Navigate to C:\\Users\\~yourprofile~\\AppData\\Roaming\\InputMapper\\Profiles (\u0022~yourprofile~\u0022 will be your windows profile name).\n\n6. Drag and drop KSP.xml from the InputMapper Profile folder into the aforementioned Profiles folder of your InputMapper directory.\n\n7. Navigate to your KSP install root directory.\n\n8. Replace the stock settings.cfg file in your KSP directory with the settings.cfg file in the KSP Controls folder.\n\n9. Plug in your DS4.\n\n10. Run InputMapper and switch the profile to KSP. (easy enough to set InputMapper to switch to the KSP profile when it\u0027s launched)\n\n11. Run KSP. (I have the graphical settings maxed @ 1920x1080 so before doing so you may need to run Launcher.exe from the KSP install folder and tweak the graphical settings)\n\n12. Check if everything works fine, then-\n\n13. Go directly to space! (or stay in the atmosphere, both are fine)\n\n~~Notes On The Controls~~\n\n- I edited a hidden control that allows you to switch the UI Mode between Docking and Staging using the left and right analog stick buttons.\n\n- Messing with the axis controls in the settings menu of KSP is not recommended aside from sensitivity changes (IE DON\u0027T CHANGE THE BINDINGS FROM THE MENU IN GAME), messing with the sensitivity is fine though.\n\n- If you MUST change the axis bindings, edit the settings.cfg file in notepad to make sure the modeMask lines don\u0027t change, as that provides isolation between your Docking and Staging control modes.\n\n- Feel free to change any of the primary button controls, as I only used the secondary bindings for the controller, the primaries are the default KSP settings with one tweak so that me the camera controls don\u0027t also control your camera.\n\n- Editing the InputMapper profile is perfectly fine if you don\u0027t touch the bindings on the first tab.\n\n- I would recommend backing up these files first if you are going to make any changes.\n\n- Although this is a very comprehensive configuration, I would still recommend that you use a mouse\u002Bkeyboard for menus and ship assembly, and you\u0027ll have to use at least a mouse for camera controls.\n\n~~Summary of Controls~~\n\nLeft Trigger - Toggle RCS\n\nRight Trigger - Toggle SAS\n\nLeft Shoulder Button - Hold SAS\n\nRight Shoulder Button - Stage\n\nD-pad Up - Linear Throttle Increase\n\nD-pad Down - Linear Throttle Decrease and apple Brakes\n\nD-pad Left - Throttle Full Cut\n\nD-pad Right - Throttle Maximum\n\nShare Button - IVA Switch\n\nTrackpad Movement - Curcor Movement\n\nTrackpad Tap - Left Mouse Button\n\nTrackpad Scroll - Scroll Wheel\n\n (Swipe up or down with 2 fingers)\n\nTrackpad Button - Orbital View Switch\n\nOptions Button - Menu\n\nTriangle Button - Time Warp Faster\n\nCircle Button - Landing Gear\n\nX Button - Camera Mode Switch\n\nSquare Button - Time Warp Slower\n\nRight Analog Up - [staging Mode]- Pitch Down\n\n [Docking Mode]- Translate Down\n\nRight Analog Down - [staging Mode]- Pitch Up\n\n [Docking Mode]- Translate Up\n\nRight Analog Left - [staging Mode]- Yaw Left\n\n [Docking Mode]- Translate Left\n\nRight Analog Right - [staging Mode]- Yaw Right\n\n [Docking Mode]- Trandlate Right\n\nRight Analog Button - Switch To Staging Mode\n\nPlaystation Button - Toggle Lights\n\nLeft Analog Up - [Docking Mode]- Translate Forward\n\nLeft Analog Down - [Docking Mode]- Translate Backward\n\nLeft Analog Left - [staging Mode]- Roll Left\n\nLeft Analog Right - [staging Mode]- Roll Right\n\nLeft Analog Button - Switch to Docking Mode\n\nI don\u0027t even remember the specific controls for kerbals, but the D-pad moves them and I loosely used modified translation controls for the EVA pack among some other miscellaneous controls.\n\nOn that note, be careful EVA-ing Kerbals because I know the board/ let go controls overlap the time warp controls, but it\u0027s survivable.\n\n~~Important Links~~\n\n- InputMapper - [https://inputmapper.com/](https://inputmapper.com/)\n\n- Kerbal Space Program -
