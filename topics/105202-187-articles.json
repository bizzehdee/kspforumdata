I sent her up there to carry out a rendezvous mission and while she was up there she became homesick and now will not do anything. Jeb, who was in a similar craft (the one she was meeting) had been up there longer and was actually fine and I flew him home.\n\nI hadn\u0027t paid any attention to supplies or hab etc as I thought the orange suits were immune to Life support needs. On checking the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E menu on the main screen it shows Valentina\u0027s name as a VET but all the vet boxes were set to \u0027grouchy\u0027. Anyway, I\u0027ve set all the boxes to be immune, saved and restarted but I still cannot control her. I also removed the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Life support mod to see if that would clear her status. This hasn\u0027t helped either. I\u0027m assuming that her config has been now classed as a tourist which is now outside of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E. I have now re-installed the mod again.\n\nSo.. .My question... Is there an easy way to rectify this, using config or anything? I\u0027m terrible at messing around with files and such so any link or clear instructions would be helpful.\n\nI don\u0027t mind sending a rescue mission but what do I need to send to get her back on the team. I can obviously take NOMS but how do I cure the homesickness. would flying an engineer up and building a docking port on her ship and then docking another ship with a hab module fix the problem? Any creative suggestions on how to help her out would be appreciated.\n\nMy last thing and the point that I am most worried about is by removing the mod briefly and re-installing it have wiped and log that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E made her a tourist? And therefore, will it be possible to gain control of her again?\n\nI\u0027m used to losing kerbals, believe me. I don\u0027t get too precious about them but I\u0027m playing on hard mode with no quicksaves or reverting so at the moment every kerbal and funds count.\n\nAny pointers, suggestion, comments, guides, humorous quips would be well received. \n\nCheers"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-20T14:05:17Z","Content":"Your best bet is to send a rescue mission, and once she\u0027s under 25km altitude of Kerbin, her status will reset."},{"CreatedByName":"TachyonGMZ","CreatedById":172198,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-23T19:18:10Z","Content":"Would you recommend changing the hab and supply time when playing with 6.4x rescale?

Personally I like having a reason to put extra living space on interplanetary vessels/stations/bases other then just because they look cool.\n\nSo far I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll need to adjust supply consumption rates. It\u0027s fairly easy to get a mix of recyclers and agroponics modules (MKS) which can extend life support for a small crew a long time with a reasonable amount of fertilizer - and a mining rig or two on each colonised world converting gypsum or minerals to fertilizer can keep them supplied indefinitely for very little effort. Setting up a supplies/fertilizer surplus to resupply interplanetary vessels is only a little more effort (especially with orbital logistics making a come back in the latest Constellation beta)."}]}
