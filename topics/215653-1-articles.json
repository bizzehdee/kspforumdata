When my Kerbal get out, he fell through the ground of the Mun. I managed to get back to the lander with the jetpack and take off. But my saved file was corrupted, I can no longer land on the surface of the Mun, my lander falls through also (not a big deal, I loaded a previous saved game before my landing).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheers to the devs !
