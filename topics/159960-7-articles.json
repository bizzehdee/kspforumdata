The whole thing\u0027s like a giant flywheel. Once you spin it up, it\u0027s moving for good. It takes a lot of energy to spin these flywheels, or K-drives up. EG it takes a lot of energy to make the element that powers the drive. When we engage the drive for real, it creates both positive and negative mass. Both matter and antimatter. The positive and negative masses are hyper-dense and invisible, and are what actually bend spacetime to move us. However, without a containment method the masses will explode or implode and cause bad things to happen.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How bad?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Early models could blow up cities, now failures are unlikely and would probably be contained to the core but might cause a mini-black hole.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ah, great! Just what I wanted to hear strapped to an antique warp drive!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022K-drive. Warp drives are different entirely. As I was saying, we vent a tiny amount of these masses, apply a bit of friction to the flywheel, if you will, and use the matter-antimatter reaction to produce enough energy to activate the time loop that preserves the masses the way they are. The weird element that creates these masses slowly runs over time, but with enough of it you never have to worry about it. With a big enough ship, or a nuclear reactor, you can power the time loop entirely with electricity, netting 100% efficiency.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, I think I\u0027m getting it... But you haven\u0027t answered my question.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right. The element that allows for K-drives to work, the one that makes the negative mass, is very hard to make and rarely occurs naturally. Luckily, we have managed to get the production energy efficiency to 99%. However, that means that attaching the K-drives to a generator wouldn\u0027t be worth it, as you\u0027re better off just using the energy that was required to make the fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, that makes sense... What about using naturally occurring K-drive material to power the generators?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s been done. But it\u0027s a limited and very useful\u00A0resource, and we have plenty of better ways to generate large amounts of electricity.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Like what?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Dyson spheres and stuff. I think the entire Galactic Union is up to a few hundred by now, actually.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022A few HUNDRED Dyson spheres?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah. After you tap the energy from the first one it\u0027s rather easy to build the second. We\u0027re not actually using most of that energy though, it\u0027s just in case we need it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Could you cover the inside with reflectors, make an aperture door and - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Make a supernova to harness all the energy at once? We\u0027ve done that. It\u0027s inefficient, but if you need a ton of energy at once - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Actually I was thinking more towards using it as a giant laser beam for use against The Species.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022All that power, all that potential energy, and the first thing you think of is a weapon!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, our galaxy is being attacked!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022...Well... Err...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We can\u0027t run forever.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Actually, we\u0027ve run the numbers. The species may be expanding at an accelerating rate, maybe a high enough acceleration to maintain a constant increase in radius despite the larger volume. But we\u0027re accelerating at several thousand G\u0027s right now. They can\u0027t be advancing that fast.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022One more question. Could you use the time loop to generate - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Here\u0027s my Kpad, with most of the files unlocked. I shouldn\u0027t be doing this, just don\u0027t get into any files marked \u0022Level 4\u0022 or above.

The actual football games had also taken place, although with mixed amounts of participation as the American population had been scattered around the planet... The tradition of\u00A0\u003Cu\u003Ereal\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0football games at Homecoming time was started by the non-Americans. There were actually more Football games played then American Football games that week.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EEvelina had not gone to any games, be it Football or Football. She had in fact hung with her few, nerdy friends at a local restaurant that had been set up by an American in one of the cities nearest to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E (although trying to recreate American cuisine with Kerbal food proved to be rather challenging, and almost impossible without the use of food synthesis technology).\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThere, she ate with Riya, whose date had dumped her (she planned to go anyway) along with two couples, Darrin and Janicka, and Savaria and Zemel. While these people had incredibly unique and funny personalities, and were to the utmost importance to Evelina, they are not very important to the current events in the story.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EAfter the meal, the six took a flying taxi over to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and were dropped off in front of the Astronaut Complex. Evelina briefly ran over to mission control to check that the Voyager had not exploded, and ran right back to the group for pictures. After that, everyone watched the sunset from one of the research and development buildings, and then proceeded to the ground level of the Vehicle Assembly building where the lights went out, the disco balls dropped, and the DJ began playing actual decent music, which was very unusual.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EAnd everyone went crazy, enjoying themselves - Even Riya, who had been dumped, was having the time of her life. The atmosphere was just as contagious as it could possibly be, but about halfway through the celebration, Evelina still hadn\u0027t really \u0022gotten\u0022 it. So instead of halfheartedly dancing the night away, she decided to sneak\u00A0off, up the several dozen flights of stairs (try doing that in a dress), in an aim to see what the view was like from the top. However, the Vehicle Assembly Building was really tall - she stopped halfway up, and looked upwards out of one of its larger windows.

So we used up another big mass of energy for dilated research - 4,000 years in 2 weeks. They were unable to produce a pentaquantum cloaking device, but they were able to produce a new type of cloaking, one not connected to the quantum spectrum. We don\u0027t even know what to call it, so they came up with \u0022bloaking device\u0022 after this one device from an old comic that - \u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Not a comic, Graphic Novel,\u0022 he responded.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Right, sorry.\u0022 Scott handed Jeb a tiny, pitch black shard made of who knows what. \u0022The device. We want you to test it - your current ship is so old school that they might not notice it leave Kerbin, and this device is so high tech it should let you escape their vision. Just get to the edge of the Galaxy and then pop right back in.

Be careful. And don\u0027t tell anyone. The other representatives and a few head guys from each planet know. The only reason I know is that I\u0027m an ex-quantologist.

I was enjoying it, I had taken my helmet off, and a lot of people had signed it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Who are you actually?\u0022 asked one (very hot) girl who had appeared by my side. \u0022That\u0027s a very good costume, this might be the closest thing I\u0027d get to meeting Ethan!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jonathan Stuart,\u0022 I said, \u0022Pleasure to meet you!\u0022 Oh, if only she knew!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ethan\u0027s soooo hot!\u0022 said another girl. \u0022I\u0027d date him!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, you\u0027re just saying that!\u0022 I said nervously. \u0022Besides the whole space mission thing, he is just an ordinary guy, right?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The fact he was chosen to be\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eastronaut\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0is a sign enough he\u0027s not ordinary!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027d date him too!\u0022 said another. There was a chorus of agreement, much to the dismay of some of those girls\u0027 dates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m just like, soooo attracted to fame!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But I can\u0027t date the real Ethan, and you\u0027re really close... Soooo, Jonathan, would you date, say, me?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey, no fair, Susan! He\u0027s mine!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, he\u0027s mine!\u0022 At this point I began trying to back out of the crowd. I grabbed my helmet back from someone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022JONATHAN I LOVE YOU!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey, what\u0027s your number?\u0022 shouted another. And then I backed into someone. I turned around and it was a very large guy, with a lot of muscles, not wearing a shirt, with his arms crossed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I admire your dedication to detail,\u0022 he said, \u0022But you\u0027re attracting the attention of my Girlfriend,\u0022 he said. \u0022If I were you, I\u0027d tone down the act a little bit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Josh, I\u0027m breaking up with you!\u0022 said a girl to the guy (apparently Josh) as she threw her arms around me. I tried to back away further, awkwardly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Maria, we\u0027ve been together two whole months!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But Jonathan can do better!\u0022 she said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027ve known him for two minutes! Gah, Ethan\u0027s a cool dude but he\u0027s ruining my life from millions of miles away due to the stupid guys who steal MY Girlfriends! He threw a punch at me. I ducked. He began running after me. There was a chorus of agreement from a log of guys. \u0022Well, who else isn\u0027t going to stand for this?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that\u0027s how I began running from a crowd of fifty really angry jocks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI ran through the dense crowd, many angry people, many\u00A0overly affectionate people, and a\u00A0few Kerbal security guards as well.\u00A0I managed to get my helmet back on right before someone nailed me in the faceplate, knocking me into the DJ\u0027s setup, shutting off the music. I yelled \u0022SORRY!\u0022 and continued to run - the exits were all blocked, everyone was closing in on me, so I went for the nearest escape route I could find - up a ladder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was quickly followed by the crowd. The ladder ended and I began running like my life depended on it (it probably did) up the stairs, jocks in close pursuit. they were getting closer and closer, and I thought they were going to catch me. There was a spotlight on me at that point, and much to my annoyance, the sound system was already (!) back up, and playing the Benny Hill theme.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then I saw it - and elevator, dead ahead, the doors about to close, just vacated by two security guard Kerbals. I ran even faster, and managed to slide inside right before the doors closed. I slammed the control panel blindly, and the elevator started moving upward. The doors were ripped back open briefly and I saw Josh and several others right there, trying to get into the elevator, but before they could do so the elevator rose out of the doorway and the doors shut again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI sat back against the elevator wall, sweating, panting, and panicking, for a few seconds before I heard someone say \u0022Wow, you look just like Ethan Edwards!\u0022 I turned my head, and to my left there was a small, young Kerbal that I had not noticed - it was Obbury. Talk about coincidence!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, it\u0027s you, O -\u0022 I stopped myself. \u0022Who are - I mean, uh, hi!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You must have done something really bad to make those guys angry.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, I\u0027m , uh, I mean, everyone thought I was Ethan,\u0022 I said, maintaining my disguise as a cosplayer. \u0022And apparently every girl there wanted to date him, and by association, me. Their boyfriends weren\u0027t happy with that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I knew Ethan for a little bit. He\u0027s a really chill, down-to-Earth person, ironically. He seems more of a friend than a boyfriend, really, too awkward around girls.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022True.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How would you know?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I, uhh... Just from his updates he seems that way.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh. I\u0027m Obbury, by the way!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I know,\u0022 I said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, sorry,\u0022 I said, trying to recover from my mistake, \u0022Uhh... I meant to say that I - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s okay. People are always startled by my weird name.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I knew a friend with the last name \u0022Scheuyrman\u0022 once. He\u0027d always smile on the rare occasion someone pronounced it right after reading it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Haha! You know, you sort of seem like Ethan, in a way. And your costume is very good, I was almost fooled for a second!\u0022 I smiled. I was about to say more, but then the elevator door opened and a strong breeze blew in. I was on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E roof.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Do you know any hiding places?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022There\u0027s a broom closet up here near the helipad, and there\u0027s a weird plane someone crashed up here. But be quick, those guys know you\u0027re up here, and I don\u0027t want to be up here when you find out. Do you have a name?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ethan Edwards.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027re getting into your character a bit too much!\u0022 replied Obbury.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, sorry... I\u0027m Jonathan Stuart. Nice to meet you, Obbury!\u0022 I waved goodbye as the elevator door closed and I jogged over to the center of the top of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. I decided to go up to the helipad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Wh4vzfg.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Wh4vzfg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, as I peered around the corner, I saw that there was one other person up there, obviously a girl (not too many guys wear dresses I\u0027d imagine) standing at the edge of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. I initially intended to just run on by and not really bother her at all, so I crept stealthily across one of the ledges below the helipad towards a door marked \u0022BROOM CLOSET.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then I slipped and fell off the ledge, very loudly screaming while i slid down the slope and then dropped a few feet onto the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E roof with a loud thud. The girl turned around - and by impossible odds, it was Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh my gosh, are you okay?\u0022 she said, running towards me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, I\u0027m fine, E -\u0022 I stopped myself. I wasn\u0027t supposed to know her name. I was just a cosplayer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And you,\u0022 she said, as she saw my face, \u0022Are yet another Ethan cosplayer!\u0022 She turned around in annoyance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh. Yes, just a cosplayer.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Trying to gain popularity from the latest trend?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, just thought I\u0027d stop by for a bit and check out the atmosphere.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027re a really bad liar, you know,\u0022 she said. I mean, I guess she was right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Evelina I - \u0022 Oops.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And you know my name, which means that Patton sent you!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Patton?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Don\u0027t try to deny it. Patton paid you to dress up as Ethan and come here to cheer me up because he knows I miss him... Tell Patton it was a nice gesture, but it didn\u0027t work. Just like the first five times he tried. Although you have the best costume so far.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m sorry, I don\u0027t know a Patton, I\u0027ll just leave now,\u0022 I said, trying to retain my anonymity. Jeb might also be waiting for me at this point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Then how do you know my name?\u0022 she demanded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, that Patton. Sorry, I call him, uhh, Pat, I don\u0027t usually use his full name.\u0022 I stood up and followed her. \u0022Yeah, I consulted with him, and I thought it wouldn\u0027t work, but fifty bucks is still fifty bucks, so I came anyway.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wait,\u0022 she said. \u0022You\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Estole\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0an actual spacesuit, sneaking past Kerbal security, risked getting severely reprimanded, for only fifty bucks?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Uhh... I\u0027m just borrowing this from a Kerbal friend,\u0022 I said. Technically, this was the truth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh. You must be close with him, then.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027d quite like to have a spacesuit. Do you think there\u0027s a chance you could introduce me to this Kerbal eventually?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, he\u0027s... not really the most social Kerbal out there...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, can I get his number or email or something? I\u0027m sure I could make it work.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022He doesn\u0027t use many methods of contact, I only know him in person.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, can I get your email or something so I can contact you and bug you to contact him?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You don\u0027t even know my name yet!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh! Sorry. Was I being too invasive? I really didn\u0027t mean to. I\u0027m just... really into space and stuff.

Even if I had to keep my identity a secret, I was still talking to Evelina. I hadn\u0027t done that without a multi-minute delay in months.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, I\u0027m not going to kiss you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I said I\u0027m not going to kiss you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why would you think I wanted a kiss?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Because according to the entire internet, I have a crush on Ethan. Didn\u0027t Patton tell you anything?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Uhh, no, forgive me if it\u0027s common knowledge, but I didn\u0027t know,\u0022 I said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Uhh, have you been living under a rock for the past six months?\u0022 she said, chuckling. \u0022Literally ALL of the gossip was about me for the month following the launch, except for one article focusing on a supposed relationship between Marie and Jack, which is total BS if you ask me.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It must be hard living with everyone having that misconception about you,\u0022 I said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s not a misconception, though,\u0022 said Evelina. If I was drinking something, I would have spit it out. I settled for coughing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wait, you - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hold up, agh, I shouldn\u0027t have said that... What I mean is, I value him as a friend. Extremely. And if a relationship could work, then, yeah, I might have gone for it back when I first met him... But the thing is, I look around me and I see all these people dating on and off, semi-seriously. And the thing that really gets me is that it always ends in anger. The two people hate each other and never talk again, for the silliest reasons.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah. If they are compatible enough to consider... dating... then... you know, it\u0027s a bit silly that if it doesn\u0027t work, they can\u0027t legitimately be friends again.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Exactly!\u0022 she said. \u0022I think it\u0027s because so much weight is placed on attractiveness that people forget about the other qualities in a person, like sense of humor, personality, shared interests... All of the things that also make a friendship work.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Which is why most relationships only last a few days.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes. So, what I\u0027m saying is, I do like Ethan a little bit... Okay, a lot...\u00A0but right now, especially because he\u0027s millions of miles away, I\u0027d much rather have him as a friend then risk losing him for a relationship that might only last a few days.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Does he seem like the type of person who would do that?\u0022 I asked. \u0022You certainly know him a lot better than most.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, but I\u0027m a bit worried that the fame is going to his head. He hasn\u0027t responded to my emails recently and his updates have been... weird. He\u0027ll probably go for one of those girls that only like him because he\u0027s famous.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What if he\u0027s just busy signing Shrek memes for seventy cents each?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, I heard about that. Poor Ethan...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/UJqyEe3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022UJqyEe3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You know, it\u0027s a bit unfair,\u0022 she said. \u0022I met my best friend ever, and probably my biggest crush ever, we\u0027re just starting to really have fun in a reality straight out of a dream - and then he leaves for some tremendous length of time.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, hold up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSHE likes ME?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd not because I\u0027m famous?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd actually agrees with me on what\u0027s wrong with modern relationships?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd referred to me as \u0022my best friend ever\u0022 and \u0022my biggest crush ever?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...To be honest, I, well, I like her too. Sort of in the same way she likes me. And I agree with everything she just said about friend and relationship stuff. And then, I realized, she doesn\u0027t have a clue that I\u0027m actually Ethan Edwards. I know I may sound like a jerk at this point, and that\u0027s probably true, but I decided to push my luck. Even though Jeb was probably wondering where I was.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What if he likes you back? In the same way you like him?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Then I\u0027ll eat my hat. Fame gets everyone, and he\u0027s just about the most famous person on the Planet.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But what if it doesn\u0027t? He hasn\u0027t actually been exposed to masses of fans just yet, and won\u0027t until he returns.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022If he returns. Voyager was always very low on Delta-V. Dangerously low. And the Laythe plane... Ugh, I give it a 50/50 chance of working. And reentering from an elliptical Laythe orbit to save fuel... And maybe needing many gravity assists... You probably don\u0027t know what any of those words mean.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So I hope he\u0027ll come back, and I hope we\u0027ll stay in contact... But even if he does like me back, the friendship thing is still... And we\u0027re only fifteen, for Pete\u0027s sake! It won\u0027t last! Do you know what it feels like to be trapped between being a friend and liking someone? Especially someone as prominent? Someone with the best sense of humor anywhere, those stunningly handsome blue eyes, and just the right amount of spontaneity?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes,\u0022 I answered truthfully.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Someone as famous as Ethan?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, no, but in my eye\u0027s, she\u0027s - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why the heck am\u00A0I telling you any of this anyway?\u0022 she said, with a sudden burst of anger.\u00A0\u0022Forget sending you to comfort me, Patton sent you just to get a news story!\u0022 she threw her hands up into the air in frustration. \u0022And he just sent you to PRETEND to try to comfort me! What idiot would actually fall off the helipad?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, no, I\u0027m not -\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And Patton knew I wanted a spacesuit, and I fell for that and opened up - You may have a good costume, but you are a disgrace to Ethan!\u0022 she shouted. But at this point, I had a bigger problem then being a disgrace to myself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/xd6iCu1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xd6iCu1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Evelina, why don\u0027t you come over here and - \u0022 I was frantically trying to signal to Jeb to go back down or re-cloak at this point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I better not see this article on any websites tomorrow! Or ever!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You have my word and - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I have the word of a liar, who came here only to make fifty bucks. I wished on a shooting star that I\u0027d see Ethan sooner than expected, and arguably, I\u00A0got really close, but I guess you can\u0027t even trust the stars these days! Fraud!\u0022 She started towards me as I backed away, still trying to signal Jeb to get out of sight. She slapped me (I had taken my helmet off at some point). Hard. I stumbled backwards from the shock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ow!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You got what you deserve, creep!\u0022 She shouted, and turned to walk away. Which, of course, meant she caught a glimpse of Spaceship Memories. She turned all the way around, stopped, and went slack jawed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022ETHAN!\u0022 boomed Jeb over a loudspeaker. He hadn\u0027t seen my signals, I guess.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What the - \u0022 said Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/wGvWk10.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wGvWk10.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Evelina, I - \u0022 I said. Jeb poked his head out the airlock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ethan, I told you not to wander off and - oh. Hello, other person. Don\u0027t mind us, we\u0027re just, uhh, cleaning the windows! Right, Ethan?\u0022 I stood, slightly mortified. Evelina looked at Jeb, then back at me. Then back at Jeb. Then back at me again. She realized that I, in fact was Ethan Edwards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh no.\u0022 Her face went pale. \u0022Ethan, I - \u0022 She couldn\u0027t finish the sentence. She turned and ran away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Evelina!\u0022 I shouted, running after her. \u0022It\u0027s fine! I feel the same way about - \u0022 At that point, one of the doors loudly burst open. Out poured several dozen winded, but still very angry jocks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I thought I lost them!\u0022 I shouted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That many people know you\u0027re here?\u0022 shouted Jeb from his perch in the airlock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They think I\u0027m a cosplayer named Jonathon!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022There he is!\u0022 shouted one of the jocks. \u0022And that\u0027s his friend! Get her!\u0022 Then we both ran back towards Jeb\u0027s spaceship. I jumped the gap onto the ladder, and then Jeb started to pilot the ship upwards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hang on a minute, Jeb! We can\u0027t leave her!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I am under orders from the Galactic Council not to involve anyone else!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So you\u0027re going to let her die?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They\u0027re not going to kill - well, on second thought...\u0022 He quickly lowered the spaceship back down to roof level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Evelina, I highly suggest you get on the spaceship!\u0022 I said. She weighed her options... An extremely awkward discussion and potentially losing a friend plus the chance to go into space again, versus getting beat up by fifty angry jocks. She jumped the gap and grabbed on the ladder. The jocks were right on her tail at that point. Jeb flew slightly upwards, revealing the whole of the spaceship to the crowd to keep it out of reach as Evelina climbed the last few rungs and entered Spaceship Memories.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/qOIqYQZ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qOIqYQZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ethan - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027ve got bigger problems now, Evelina.

Alright, keep this behind your ear,\u201D said Jebediah as he held out two earpieces. \u201CIt will provide a hyper-realistic hologram of a Kerbal that will move as you does and will completely obscure you. Just crouch a lot, you\u2019re way taller than the average Kerbal. And we need to get you some Generation 8 spacesuits, no sense sticking with that Gen 4, Ethan.\u201D Both Evelina and I accepted the earpieces as Jebediah pulled some very futuristic looking spacesuits out of an overhead compartment. Evelina and I were now, for all intents and purposes, Kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022vZSuspl.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/vZSuspl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CSamley to Jebediah, do you have any passengers?\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes, two of them.

Unfortunately our ship exploded, so we\u2019ll have to stop at R5 for a while.\u201D Jebediah turned away from the microphone. \u201CHold on, Evelina, we have a plan!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHad a plan,\u201D I corrected. \u201COur ship exploded.

The Species is this crazy empire of beings who want to escape the heat death of the universe by utilizing its resources with maximum efficiency, which often appears to mean enslaving races, mining planets out to nothing, and other immoral acts. They showed up at our galaxy\u2019s doorstep saying to let them do their business, but obviously very few in the entire galaxy wanted that.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI agree with their goal,\u201D I said, \u201CBut few could ever agree with their means.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C...How strong are they?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey control an area many times the size of the observable universe.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut the square cube law,\u201D I said. \u201CThey can\u2019t expand as fast as our fastest ships.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow fast are your fastest ships?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo fast that there\u2019s no reason to develop anything faster.

The inner one was the one where we were docked, moving very fast between several purple glowing \u201Cgates\u201D mounted on the outer ring, which was several times larger and appeared stationary to the surface. Which also meant it was disconcertingly moving at two kilometers per second probably thirty meters from us. Not that we could see it in person. We were still inside the spacious, but now tiny 5 meter cargo bay. All of a sudden there was a clang as the hatch of the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EMemories\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0- now nothing but memories - opened. There stood a Kerbal in a spacesuit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hello, there, I\u0027m Samley!

Please follow me.\u0022 He led us out of the hatch of our ship and to the 5 meter diameter docking port, which had both large and small hatches. We went through the smaller one, and we were then - amazingly - onboard what was apparently Ring Five, an actual legitimate orbital ring. There was a tiny window that we passed, so Evelina and I were able to get our first real view of the ring, but only briefly. She appeared to still be in shock due to the events of the last ten minutes, but it appeared to be in a good way now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022LbvB6Pp.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/LbvB6Pp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022If you\u0027d please take a seat,\u0022 said Samley, gesturing to Evelina and I, still floating around, \u0022Firstly we need to check you in.

What are you doing, Jebediah, taking unregistered passengers into space?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u0022I\u0027m sorry,\u0022 said Jebediah, somewhat embarrassed, \u0022We did not anticipate stopping at the Rings. Here,\u0022 he said as he passed an official looking document on his Kpad to Samley.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Passenger clearance form, issued by the Department of Near Space Transportation in the grand city of Kerlington, valid for Jebediah Kerman and any valid clones, for any number of passengers,\u00A0issued an extremely long time ago, valid forever. ID number matches. History matches. Portrait matches. There\u0027s the seal... I cannot check this with my antiquated computer system, but I believe you, Jebediah. And you look valid as well, although your ninth active clone doesn\u0027t appear to be in they system yet either. But, hey, you\u0027re Jebediah Kerman! Galactic Representative of all Kerbalkind! You literally make the rules!\u0022 He took out a strange device and pressed it to the Kpad, leaving a virtual green stamp on the papers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Glory to Arstotzka,\u0022 I muttered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nothing. Just a reference to something obscure.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022These computers are almost stupidly old, I really should get them updated at some point. Next order of business, antimatter. Unfortunately, due to the energy shortage,\u00A0the price of antimatter is pretty high. The bill is 129 MA.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wow, I didn\u0027t think the diversion of power to Duna would cause such a drain. Do me a favor, get yourself some new computers,\u0022 he said as he did something on his Kpad. Samley\u0027s machine dinged. He looked at the monitor, in shock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022...Sir? Are you sure that\u0027s the correct number?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, Samley.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You didn\u0027t accidentally add a zero or two?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022150 Allotments. You can do more with it than I can. And in exchange can we skip the rest? I\u0027ve heard it a thousand times. Jeb 3 is literally doing the exact same thing right now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022...Right. Thank you, sir! Oh, thank you so very much!\u0022 He looked elated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No problem,\u0022 he said as he got up from his chair and began towards the main hatch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, one more thing! I\u0027m required to warn you that due to structural issues we\u0027re all required to wear helmets in the ring for the time being.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Structural issues?\u0022 asked Evelina, worriedly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Due to the power shortage, R5 is not as strictly constrained as it is usually, so there is a small danger of collision with R7. Not a big deal, but small scrapes have happened with empty transfer craft. It\u0027s fully precautionary. That and the usual threat of Tower 3 collapsing.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022R7 is the big one right there, right?\u0022 I asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Uhh, yeah. What did they teach you in school?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, we were... Homeschooled.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hmm, odd, I thought that died out a long time ago. I guess I was wrong! Also, don\u0027t forget to change your jetpacks from EVA to ambient pressure! Don\u0027t want to be spewing exhaust into the ring\u0027s atmosphere!\u0022 Jeb showed us how to switch the jetpacks. It was a small switch on the side. And we all followed Samley through the main hatch into his section of the ring.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022DiHGm1I.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/DiHGm1I.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s a bit dark in here!\u0022 said Evelina. She bumped into something. \u0022Ow!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They are both from a bloodline that has traditionally had problems with their night vision capability,\u0022 said Jebediah. It\u00A0was\u003Cem\u003E technically\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the truth. Apparently Kerbals have night vision.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh. I\u0027ll turn the lights on, then!

I was as equally astounded by how large the interior volume was.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sorry for the clutter. Obviously R5 has the default elevators, particle accelerators, power, oxygen, water, supply, electrical, and other supply lines taking up a third of the volume already, and I run a business, so it\u0027s sort of cramped with all the equipment.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No need to apologize,\u0022 I said. \u0022This is already larger than I ever thought you could get!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jebediah, you\u0027re taking them to R7, right?\u0022 asked Samley.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, they have been living under a rock for a while and are in for a shock, or the time of their lives... And it looks like there aren\u0027t any suitable replacement ships on R7 either, so we\u0027ll have to go all the way to R8.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022R8?\u0022 asked Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, R8, the one I told you about!\u0022 said Jebediah, silently begging Evelina to play along.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002227mgtPf.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/27mgtPf.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey, Jebediah, what\u0027s B2H6?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Diborane?\u0022 asked Jebediah, shocked. \u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diborane\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDIBORANE\u003C/a\u003E?

What happened to the first four?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, uh, the first was a giant cable that we attached a few rooms to. The second was another cable, but in an inclined orbit, the third was another cable in a polar orbit, and the fourth was a 5 meter diameter ring which fell back to Kerbin halfway through its construction. Elements of the first cable are on display in the museum at Tower 1.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And where exactly are we going?\u0022 asked Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022To a station which will allow us to transfer between Rings 5 and 7.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What\u0027s ring 6?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022A giant particle accelerator in high Kerbin Orbit that isn\u0027t really a ring, but more of a path. Most of our ringed accelerators are just there to make antimatter, but that one is for ultra high energy physics. Yes, the Jslans have a solar system sized accelerator and the Fenemotians are trying to build a Quantum Relativity Accelerator... But ours is still useful. Ring 7 was built when it was determined that Ring 5 was getting too cluttered internally with stuff that could have been built in a vacuum. As a result most of R7 is unpressurized. R7 is also a stationary ring, it has most of the surface gravity.\u00A0It was built on top of eight giant towers made out of incredibly advanced materials -\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Carbon nanotubes?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Graphene?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Illasti-whatever crystals?\u0022 Jebediah looked appalled by the notion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022NO! Are you trying to make me question your sanity?\u00A0As to what the towers are actually made of, it will\u00A0suffice to say that your Superman would have a hard time bending a straw made from this stuff. The word is in the Kreah\u0027\u0027 Dialect of the Carreeek language, it\u0027s alien technology. Kerbals can barely pronounce it, and\u00A0doesn\u0027t translate into English as more than clicks.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Let\u0027s call it Kryptonite, then,\u0022 suggested Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And R8 builds upon four of the towers, the odd numbered ones, and is at Kerbostationary orbit, meaning there\u0027s no gravity on that ring. It has the main antimatter creation accelerators, and is where we park most of our spaceships. We\u0027re taking an elevator there to get a ship.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, and where are we going once we get a ship?\u0022 asked Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Now that\u0027s top secret. And both of you should stay here, but apparently I cannot talk you out of that... So Evelina, we\u0027re cloning you. You\u0027ll be able to read your clone\u0027s mind. Once this is all over we can re-merge you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022YES!\u0022 she shouted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s really painful,\u0022 I said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s because we didn\u0027t have the time for a sedative, Evelina will feel no pain.\u0022 Well, lucky her. Poor me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And that \u0022May the Infinities smile upon you\u0022 thing?\u0022 asked Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Just a traditional Kerbal farewell, like your \u0022See you later!\u0022 or \u0022Have a great day!\u0022 sayings. Maybe a bit deeper.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I like the ring of that,\u0022 I said. Jebediah went back to his tablet. \u0022You know, I\u0027m actually surprised at how much this falls into predicted sci-fi. I haven\u0027t encountered many things developed by Kerbalkind that weren\u0027t predicted by human sci-fi.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You haven\u0027t seen anything, yet. Wait until you see the giant competitive Whack-A-Kerbal arena orbiting Minmus. Except you aren\u0027t going to see that. And that\u0027s just Kerbin. The oddest technology can be found near the planet Dagnard.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, I know most of my questions can wait,\u0022 said Evelina, \u0022But I\u0027ve been asking you a lot of trivial things by your standards. How about a bit of a fun question. Who is the weirdest alien you have met?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hmm...\u0022 said Jebediah. \u0022That would have to be Representative Galactus the Cow. He comes from the planet Pock, which was destroyed by a giant meteor launched by the evil Francine Fleugenhass from her world, one of the few non-peaceful worlds we have encountered. He was the only member of his species to escape the planet, on a rocket powered by TNT. He flew that spaceship to a strange moon, where it crashed and burned, and another species of aliens, the T\u0027s, shot him in a cannon towards the planet below, where he found Phil the Pig, and together they built TNT-02, the second TNT rocket to try and find the legendary Magic Boulder, a mythical rock with the ability to turn back time in order to save his planet. He went to the planet Mycelium, which is a trade center which happens to have a hundred kilometer tall mushroom created by the great Wizard Ladstini, also rumored to be the protector of the Magic boulder. They were confronted by Francine who tried to kill them because she wants to destroy everything, and the volcano on Mycelium explodes, but Galactus and Phil built\u00A0a spaceship out of old machines and launched using the volcano as a first stage. They meet an old guy on an orbiting space station and he gives them TNT-03, which uses a more efficient fuel. They set off on their quest for the Magic Boulder.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Did they ever find it?\u0022 asked Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Phil has moved on. Galactus is still searching. He\u0027s crashed several hundred TNT spaceships by now, and those are only his ceremonial ships. He has crashed many more normal ships. He has an insanely long lifespan...\u00A0I sort of feel sorry for him, he\u0027s the only one of his species left, but he takes it like a boss and is generally extremely comedic without meaning to be, although he can be cowardly at times. Since he\u0027s the only one left, he\u0027s representative by default, and gets a lot of privileges because of that. Hence how he was able to buy and crash hundreds of spaceships.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So what about the Magic Boulder?\u0022 I asked. \u0022Is it real?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s a bit like religion. Nobody knows for sure but there are convincing arguments both ways.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I was just about to ask that,\u0022 said Evelina. \u0022So nobody knows?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nobody knows. The calculated chance of a God or Gods existing is almost exactly 50/50 all known variables considered, and almost any reasonable belief is accepted. We got around those differences centuries ago.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Huh. Okay, that answers most of my pressing questions.\u0022 The elevator slowed to a halt. \u0022Okay, what now?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We get out of the elevator.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022NLehExs.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/NLehExs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe three of us emerged from the elevator to find one Kerbal passing through the uninhabited piece of Ring 5.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jeb? How much of Ring 5 is occupied?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Lengthwise, maybe two thirds. We\u0027re in the least used section right now.\u0022 I snuck a peak out of one of the gigantic windows. Kerbin was beautiful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221qCas0T.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/1qCas0T.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, Ethan, Evelina, this way!\u0022 Jeb led us through the massive hatch. The hatches appeared to be every 20-30 meters, presumably in case of a depressurization. He then led us through a node with nobody in it into a large ship with room for maybe 200 Kerbals if you squeezed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Lmqk1mO.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Lmqk1mO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So how is this ship going to get us to that ring? That\u0027s moving at two kilometers per second, I don\u0027t see any fuel tanks!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Transfer 5-7\u00A0325, now departing. 3 passengers. Magnets, Ethan! Very precise magnets! Now, if we aimed correctly, we should end up somewhere near Tower Seven, which will be a big hub and we should be able to find a ship there. Although I have gone through 80% of R7 and I cannot find a single ship with the requirements for the mission.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Which are top secret.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Correct.\u0022 There was a loud clang as the docking ports sealed and the ship rocked back and forth before settling on the apparent magnetic tracks and moving backwards relative to R5.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022QlwUwS3.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/QlwUwS3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ethan, turn your seat around. I know it\u0027s a window, but I promise you a view fifty times better in the coming minutes. This wasn\u0027t designed for humans, Kerbals are way more G-force tolerant. You\u0027re going to feel about 7g for about 30 seconds. Oh, I almost forgot.\u0022 I turned around. \u0022Kerbal days are NOT exactly 6 hours long. They are 5 hours, 54 minutes, and 19 seconds, ish. We adjusted your perception of time a bit so that you would have an easier transition. I\u0027m turning that off now for you two, you shouldn\u0027t notice much.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright, I -\u0022 the spacecraft pushed back from its magnetic rails and moved abruptly away from R5, close to R7. I panicked, I thought we were going to collide with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00227pBgu6M.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/7pBgu6M.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother set of purple magnetic stabilizers passed us at over 2 kilometers per second. \u0022Brace yourself!\u0022 Right before I turned around I saw another set of magnetic tracks approach the vehicle, mounted on R7. I turned and braced, before the entire ship was shoved backwards with the force of a thousand elephants. Ten thousand, even. I could not lift my arms, but almost as soon as it started, it was over. Our transfer pod slowed, now coasting at only a few dozen meters per second relative to R7, and it was now R5 that passed by at 2 kilometers per second.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, that\u0027s not something you do every day,\u0022 I said, surprised and elated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, nobody goes to R5 for much anymore, the Munar commute is even more common than that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What?\u0022 I asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey, Jeb? What is the Kerbal money system like? I heard you mention Allotments and MA.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ah. So this is going to sound crazy to you, I did some research on human history. The Kerbol system could be described as part capitalist, part socialist, and part anarchist.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Socialism?\u0022 I asked, surprised.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes. It\u0027s actually relatively common throughout the galaxy.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And you got it to work?\u0022 asked Evelina, equally surprised. Our pod slowed down all the way and docked to R7. We could feel gravity now, about 80% of normal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, the whole government corruption thing usually isn\u0027t a thing, but Earth is an extreme case. As I was saying, we promote competition, development, free trade, free speech, and a lot of other things,\u00A0hence the capitalist, we collectively produce exports that we sell to the galaxy and give everyone who works a certain amount of money which is enough to buy a year\u0027s worth of basic necessities and maybe a vacation to somewhere, called an allotment, hence the socialism. You can earn more than just one allotment per year by doing more and by trade, but we want to provide for everyone at least a little. And we know we can mostly trust each other to not take advantage of the system. Milli-Allotments, called MA, are 1/1000 of an allotment and are used to measure medium levels of expense. Finally, funds are our base unit, the amount that goes into a MA fluctuates and is updated daily. Lastly, we try to let everyone do their own thing because we have created a very nice society in which there is little to gain from not obeying the simple and reasonable rules. Thus we can have as little government influence as possible, hence the anarchy. I understand the word has negative connotations in English, but we mean it as \u0022hey, we don\u0027t have many rules, do what you want as long as you aren\u0027t hurting anyone.\u0022\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hmm... A very interesting government and monetary system,\u0022 said Evelina. \u0022And it works?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Has for decades, very few complaints.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What\u0027s the conversion between dollars and Funds?\u0022 I asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Impossible to know. We have cheap space travel, varied price in food, all electric vehicles... It\u0027s nearly impossible to make an accurate comparison, our economies are too different,\u00A0but I believe a fund is worth several times what a dollar is.\u0022 We emerged from the transfer pod and stepped out into a fairly large chamber where there was several dozen Kerbals in line for a door.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jebediah - \u0022 Asked Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You said you were done with questions. Two questions ago, I think?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, but doesn\u0027t it seem a bit weird? You find the humans and press your ideals upon us, and then the Species - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022SHH!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022-finds you and presses their ideals upon you. What\u0027s to say there isn\u0027t another 8 layers?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nothing. We\u0027d better hope. ATTENTION! I have a permit, level 9 urgency, so I\u0027m sorry but we\u0027re going to have to cut.\u0022 Some Kerbals in the room groaned but most accepted and some even smiled, glad crucial stuff was getting done even if they didn\u0027t know what the crucial stuff was. We followed Jebediah through the chamber to a larger set of doors - standard push doors in a circular hatch - and he showed his permit to an employee supervising the line. He nodded and we went through the hatch into the core of R7.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00229Rxd2rg.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/9Rxd2rg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00220LxUKWS.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/0LxUKWS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022A river? In space? Is that real?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You better believe it, Evelina,\u0022 said Jebediah as he quickly walked off to the left. The room was massive, just this alone was probably more volume than the ISS had many times over! And it was filled with greenhouses, desks, and a river!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But why?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why not?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022All this space, you could use for experiments or something useful or - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Or something emotional and cool! We\u0027ve got an abundance of space, it is space, after all!\u0022 we approached one of the counters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022SSMXsXv.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/SSMXsXv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Excuse me, ma\u0027am, I\u0027m afraid we\u0027re going to need to delay you a few seconds.

You can interview a clone later, we\u0027re short on time. Thank you.\u0022 He shook her hand. \u0022Three tickets for the Tower 7 elevator to Ring Eight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We have two elevators departing, one in 3 minutes and one in 20.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hmm, slow day.
