No clue if it\u0027d work with ions. At some point your isp is so low you just can\u0027t effectively do a \u0022typical\u0022 burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nSet up your full maneuver node. Note the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E requirement and time. Decide how much you can do at once (I personally like 4 minutes as the maximum). Decide how many burns you\u0027re doing (I like 2. Many times you can\u0027t do more than 3 because you\u0027ll eventually eject)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPull back (full minus one burn\u0027s worth) on the maneuver node (usually 1/2, but if you\u0027re doing 3 you\u0027d pull back 1/3) to see what your orbit will look like on the penultimate node. If it ejects you, you\u0027re going to have to rethink things. If it encounter\u0027s Mun\u0027s orbit, you\u0027ll have to make sure you don\u0027t encounter Mun when you actually do the burn. Note in particular how long it takes to go around that orbit. You\u0027ll need to time your burns so when you get back from that orbit, you\u0027ll be at your transfer window.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRepeat 2 as many times as you\u0027re planning to do burns. Note how long the whole thing is going to take. This is one of the reasons I restrict myself to 2 burns, it\u0027s a pain to keep track of stuff \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E The other reason I listed above: The more burns you do the more likely you\u0027ll eject during one of them, and once you eject, you can\u0027t do more burns as you\u0027re not coming back down to Periapsis.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ENow you know when to go for the first burn and how much to burn, so do it, with a new maneuver node of just the first burn.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ERe-make each maneuver node as you go, as there will be little errors in execution so you\u0027d have to edit them anyway.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EProfit\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reinhart Mk.1","CreatedById":194521,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-26T00:57:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223641031\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022186712\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221564101258\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002273725\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00225thHorseman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n22 minutes ago, 5thHorseman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRe-make each maneuver node as you go, as there will be little errors in execution so you\u0027d have to edit them anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthis one is one of the things i was looking for THANK YOU!! \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
