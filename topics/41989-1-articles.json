I thought this would be a faq. I would like to save some of the launch vehicles (rockets) that I have made but add different payloads too them. I can\u0027t figure out to do this with out rebuilding the vehicle in the VAB. For example... I have made a heavy lift rocket to take the core of my space station to orbit. I would like to use that same rocket to lift large payloads (primarily fuel) to the space station. However, when I detach the command pod (I\u0027m using unmanned pods with MechJeb), I am unable to add new command pods and the new payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help would be much appreciated,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-11T01:17:14Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2013 01:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by greensha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-11T01:07:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDetatch the rocket from the payload and put it aside below/on the side.

I tried that, but I can\u0027t get the rocket to attach to the new command pod/payload. Once the original command pod has been deleted I can no longer attach any components.

When I selected the new command pod it placed it very close to the floor of the VAB and it was obscured by support scaffolding. I didn\u0027t realise that it had done that so I selected another command pod and it treated that second pod like a regular component.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gloowa","CreatedById":22683,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-12T11:32:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry doing what i do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery time i build a rocket, i start by placing remote guidance unit, and then build my first stage around it.
