I tried to make it as close to the real one as possible without spamming parts.\n\nIt is still in testing though, and haven\u0027t de-orbited it to see how does it handle when empty or landing.\n\n![1024x576.resizedimage](http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/26231516148984126/4E6B642625DB741793A471E1081A3FA1ABCBDC9D/1024x576.resizedimage)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

So I still have to update the separate .craft files and tweak the combined one too.\n\nAs I mentioned, this replica is as low-as-possible part count to reduce lag and have better handling so the oranges stay. Energia is already 100\u002B parts and that would add at least 8 more. You are right with the tail though, it is not big enough to control the whole ship.\n\nI will post the .craft files on thursday or friday, as this week is gonna be busy."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T02:48:02Z","Content":"That looks very nice. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI still can\u0027t make shuttles. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kibble","CreatedById":131042,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T03:33:05Z","Content":"Pretty! \n\nBuran\u0027s RD-58\u0027s didn\u0027t fire during ascent except to circularize, like Shuttle\u0027s OMS, only kerosene-fueled."},{"CreatedByName":"bakanando","CreatedById":126310,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T06:21:10Z","Content":"@Starwhip: This thing flies like two bricks slapped together, don\u0027t worry about not being able to make one.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Pretty! \n\u003E Buran\u0027s RD-58\u0027s didn\u0027t fire during ascent except to circularize, like Shuttle\u0027s OMS, only kerosene-fueled.\n\nWelp, there goes the whole thing.

It needs a Mainsail to lift itself and you can get Energia-sans-Boosters into orbit and back (which I did), so basically the payload is the whole Buran (it does help during ascent though).\n\nAlso, it works so I don\u0027t mind. I might clip a LFB instead of the mainsail just so I can have twin engines instead of the giant monster, but it\u0027s overkill.\n\nFinally, I forgot the parachutes in the buran mk2 so I\u0027ll have to add them later today.
