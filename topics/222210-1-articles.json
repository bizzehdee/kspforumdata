I used to think time warp would just not be allowed in multiplayer, but then I came up with an idea that I think can work and players can rejoice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst off, I understand there will be a four-player maximum, so this shouldn\u2019t take too long for them all to partake in the process. Initiating a time warp will not be an instant action unless you are the only player. If there are other players, then the process turns to a request to warp and you have to specify a time stamp to end at. This request is proposed to each player who will have an opportunity to deny the request (any denial will deny the warp) or propose an earlier time to stop. When all requests have been responded to, the warp will proceed to the earliest stop time authorized. The warp speed will be the lowest safe warp for each player\u2019s-controlled ship situation and can still automatically increase or decrease as normal. Any player may abort the time warp while in warp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis also means that at no time can a player just increase the current game speed with the warp bar at the bottom and this UI element would be non-interactable. The methods of requesting a warp-to moment can be from any orbital line (conical) like the current warp-to point method, or it can be from a new button on the warp bar to open a dialog for setting the stop time. This will actually be helpful in single player as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, and only if this makes sense, you can include in the warp request a starting time-stamp as well so all players will have a chance to prepare for it or coordinate a group action.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts? Opinions?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LarcasanKerman","CreatedById":230655,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-28T19:05:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem with that might be that all the small time warps will be quite difficult since everybody must approve the time warp.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd when you think about it you don\u2019t want to wait for everybody every time you want to time warp, especially if you have to do time warps very often\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u2019t want to be the person who instantly says no to this and still think you are on to something but there is still some problems left\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nit is a good idea though\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Abelinoss","CreatedById":222638,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-28T20:28:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn Nate\u0027s AMA he somewhat covered how this is going to work:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECan we get anything in writing related to the planned structure/function of multiplayer within the game, and how you plan to work around certain speedbumps like time warp or two player craft docking (I.e. where is the processing for this done?)?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGenerally we try to not talk much about multiplayer but let me give you something:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPeople will have separate timelines and then there will be a reconciliation phase when the players interact with each other.
