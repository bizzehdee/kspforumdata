Your CoT looks off as well. Just like for rockets, you want all those as close to being exactly on the same axis as possible, only for winged vehicles you also need to ensure the CoL has close to a 90 degree pitch compared to the center line of the craft. Also it\u0027s best to have it either dead-centered with your CoM, or just slightly behind it (generally, actually if it\u0027s not perfectly centered you want it to be closest to where the CoM will shift as you burn off fuel mass to maintain stability). It\u0027s tricky, as just about every tweak can change one of the other two Centers you need to account for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for design notes, use the reaction wheels (SAS) in-line, not where you have them. One, they won\u0027t help very much for craft stability if you\u0027re having lift problems. Two, if you need the torque for maneuvering in vacuum, you\u0027re probably better off going with RCS nozzles (which will also help for maneuvering at higher altitude as control surfaces start stalling). Again, it\u0027s a tough balance designing a viable SSTO in the beginning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, about your CoT: just because the builder shows it at one location when using mixed propulsion, does not mean that is where it will be in effect when using only one at a time in flight. Yank them off and see where it is for each type as you put them on (one type at a time), you may have to adjust placement to maintain a CoM-aligned CoT, even though the editor will tell you differently.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T06:20:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour main solution...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52080-Basic-Aircraft-Design-Explained-Simply-With-Pictures\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52080-Basic-Aircraft-Design-Explained-Simply-With-Pictures\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
