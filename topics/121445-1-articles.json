We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been busy tying up the loose ends, and although we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been saying it for a few weeks now, QA is getting very, very near. In the end, despite the delay, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re very happy that we updated to the latest version of Unity and took the time to rewrite systems that really needed it. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Last week we introduced the KSPedia system, and Mike (Mu) has been working hard to finish the database and back-end toolset. This means that the game can now load and overload the help bundles and display them with a basic contents page, as well as navigation elements. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re especially happy with the expandability of the system, which modders should be able to take full advantage of. Of course we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re adding a lot of content into the syste, a task we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve recruited Dave (TriggerAU) for. Some of you may know TriggerAU from his mods such as Kerbal Alarm Clock, or his work for the QA team! \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve also talked about the KSP compile times a couple of times now, and this week Felipe (HarvesteR) is very happy to report that his new CPU has been overclocked and that the upgrade has cut down the compile times by more than half! The load time for KSP itself has also been decreased to about 12 seconds, starting from 27 previously, and he reports scene changes are much quicker as well. That should save an hour or more each day that was previously spent either staring at a progress bar or spinny wheel while the code was compiling, or the game was loading. .\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;With his newfound productivity Felipe has been taking on the last remaining bits of the user interface overhaul that were assigned to him. All the map view icons have been converted from the old system of immediate-mode-style drawing code to properly organized and human-readable objects and delegate assignment, and the map context are planned to be finished by the end of the day. Once those are complete, that should be all there is to the map view for the user interface overhaul. Then it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s onwards to other things for him.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;A very welcome byproduct of this overhaul is that the code that renders map view objects (orbit splines, nodes and such) seems to have been quite dramatically optimized. As with everything so far, we don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have proper benchmarks yet, and your mileage may vary, but the difference is noticeable. The multithreaded user interface rendering added in Unity 5.2 also adds yet another layer of optimization to the whole user interface, so a non-negligible performance boost is something that we can almost certainly expect on this next update. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Continuing on the topic of user interface work, Jim (Romfarer) has been working on the staging backend calls. The purpose of this part of the code is to update the staging list based on how you pick, select and drop parts in the editor. It has been very tricky to bugfix this due to all the calls coming in from the backend, some of which \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153destroy\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 what the previous calls \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153fixed\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;On the production end Ted and Max (Maxmaps) have mostly been planning around the recent schedule updates we mentioned previously. Ted in particular has also been focusing on content for the KSPedia with Mike and Dave, prototyping many fantastic ideas in the progress.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Community wise we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re following the applications for the Media Group very closely. So far we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve received a couple of dozen of applications, each of which takes a good amount of time to review. After all, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re dealing with a subjective judgement of video content, and to make sure everyone gets a fair chance both Andrea (Badie) and Kasper (KasperVld) are going over all entries. The application process will close on Friday, so if you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been waiting to get your application in you shouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t wait too much longer.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d like to thank everyone who entered in the box-art contest last week. The entries were absolutely wonderful and picking three winners was an extremely tough thing to do. The creativity displayed in many of the entries was worth a reward, but in the end choices had to be made. The fantastic entries encourage us to see if we can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t do contests like this more often.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Finally, the Unity Awards ceremony is tonight at Unite Boston, so fingers crossed!\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peachoftree","CreatedById":110108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-22T21:02:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SQUAD\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SQUAD\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u0026lt;figure data-orig-width=\u0022480\u0022 data-orig-height=\u002292\u0022 class=\u0022tmblr-full\u0022\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/figure\u0026gt;QA is getting very, very near.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can feel the hype a-coming\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--edit--\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NFUN","CreatedById":78715,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-22T21:02:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E12 second KSP load time!?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-22T21:04:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome aboard TriggerAU!!
