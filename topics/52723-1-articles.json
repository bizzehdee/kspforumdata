Theoretically, you\u0027d move backwards in time when traveling above the speed of light like that, but I\u0027m no expert in the field.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only force that is capable of such a dramatic acceleration like that would be the dreaded Space Kraken, which the OP appears to have woken from its slumber.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you pretend the 17 seconds is in the accelerated reference frame (in other words, the decoupler experienced 17 seconds of time getting from point A to \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E while it took 130 years back on Kerbal for the decoupler to travel that far (which doesn\u0027t work because I\u0027m sure you can shift the view back to Kerbal and only 17 seconds have gone by there -- but lets pretend), then the Lorentz factor is going to be that ratio, or 241317470. Solving for velocity it would be 0.9999999979c. If I\u0027ve got it right, a super-duper collider accelerating protons that fast would have 226 PeV (226,000 TeV) per beam.

Because it didn\u0027t really take 130 kerbin years for it to travel that far, only it will take 130 years for kerbin to observe that it had traveled that far. If somehow it could travel back to kerbin at the same speed it will have only been gone for 34 seconds but it will have returned 130 years before kerbin could observe it coming about and thats where my head explodes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
