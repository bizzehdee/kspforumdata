What looks like a wobbly mess unstrutted can often be rigidized more than enough with surprisingly few struts, if you know where to place them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nLook for the biggest wobbles first. Big wobbles tend to have an indirect effect on the rest of the craft, so removing the worst offenders first tends to make smaller wobbles disappear as well.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWatch where the pivot point of the wobble is: often it\u0027s where stuff is attached, eg. radial decouplers for boosters. Place struts as far from that pivot point as possible, and start at the bottom (for some reason that works better than the top). Often one strut away from the pivot is more than enough. If that proves not enough, place a strut at the opposite end. If that is not enough, the attachment point is too weak and you probably need to rethink the design anyway.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTake advantage of symmetry whenever you can, because otherwise struts will add inexplicable tendencies to roll/yaw/pitch to your craft or parts of it. Try to add the symmetry from the inside/core outward. Sometimes you have to zoom in and pan the camera \u0027into\u0027 the craft to be able to do this.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s another thing: invisible clipping. Sometimes parts are clipped into each other according to the game, even when visually there is air between them. For example, when you say \u0027big\u0027 I naturally think 3.75m in stock, which often means using Mammoth engines (I mean, what else, right?).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith Mammoth-based boosters in radial symmetry (we are talking big, aren\u0027t we?) the problem is most often not so much a lack of struts, but that the Mammoth has an invisible collission mesh that is bigger than the visible engine. This leads to the engines \u0027clipping\u0027 or bouncing even though visually they appear to be separated. This results in a rocket that will seemingly lift off ok, but at reaching the first separation blows into smithereens, and no amount of struts will solve because it\u0027s the engines bouncing off each other than makes the decoupled boosters fly off and rotate in weird directions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSolution: attach the radial Mammoth-based boosters with two structural pylons (the decouplers that look like forward slanted wings parts) - Place one pylon, then another pylon on top of it (disable staging for the 2nd one), then you place the 3.75m tank and build the booster. That should create enough space for Mammoths at the base even up to 6x symmetry. Strut the Mammoth\u0027s in 6x symmetry to each other and it\u0027s perfectly stable. At decoupling the boosters will just slide off in a straight line down and will not start to rotate until well clear of the craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Mammoths are an extreme case of this clipping, but if you build with the default radial decouplers, which hardly add any space at all, you will notice this problem with 2.5m and even some 1.25m parts as well. So, create enough space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-25T15:56:40Z\u0022 title=\u002212/25/2015 03:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by swjr-swis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-25T23:59:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe best advice I can give you:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0You don\u0027t need to build \u0022bigger\u0022 to reach further.
