I mean, if it is simple data storage, I have other things and cloud storage to keep them. This thing here is a tough, compact USB that will be kept on a key chain meaning it will be with me everywhere. So...what kinds of programs and such would be useful on such a thing? \n\n(I don\u0027t think KSP can be made portable to run off a USB, can it?)"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T04:51:39Z","Content":"It can, but it\u0027ll probably load slowly. Just put your entire ksp\\_win directory on it, in the root. And enjoy the wonders of drm-free gaming.\n\nAs far as other things, only you can answer that. Nothing you don\u0027t mind losing and nothing you don\u0027t mind others seeing (passwords, bank account info, etc)."},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T05:00:31Z","Content":"My use for \u0022spare\u0022 flash drives: Live recovery systems, OS installers and tools.
