If you had posted a mod list then I might be able to point you at specific mods that could be causing this issue; you can get a mod list easily through \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E by clicking File \u0026gt; save installed mod list and saving the text file which will contain every mod and their versions. My initial suspicion is that you\u0027re using an old, outdated mod somewhere which is causing the failures to occur. Check any planet packs you\u0027re using to ensure that they\u0027re compatible with\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are also a huge number of exceptions caused by KSP-AVC, which you should probably remove entirely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou also seem to have two ModuleManagers? 4.2.1 and 2.5.0 from what I see in the logs. You should only ever have one ModuleManager and it should be inside KSP/GameData and the newest version (with the highest number), so delete any and all duplicates you find.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK, I just looked at the video and you\u0027re clearly using many very outdated mods- some were made for KSP 1.4, 1.3 and even 1.2. This is\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ea bad idea\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0as these old mods are very unlikely to work but very likely to break things: KSP has had Unity version upgrades that make mods compiled against the older versions unable to run.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suggest you completely destroy this copy of KSP and start from scratch. If you want to play with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E and RP-1, there\u0027s a special express install available on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E that can install all the necessary mods in a few clicks; however I don\u0027t think your PC will be able to run the game with those mods, or if it does it\u0027ll be painfully slow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
