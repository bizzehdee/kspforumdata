I have a space station set up, but my greenhouse says it doesn\u0027t have any ammonia. I sent up some tanks of liquid ammonia, but I guess that\u0027s not what they meant. I see that the mini chemical plant can convert hydrogen and nitrogen into ammonia, but when I sent up a craft with the chemical plant and some hydrogen, nothing happened. Has anybody gone through this already that can help me out, I\u0027m about ready to give up on the game for a while if I can\u0027t figure this out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-08T01:11:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, the kerbalism wiki (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/ShotgunNinja/Kerbalism/wiki/Default-Profile\u0022 ipsnoembed=\u0022true\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/ShotgunNinja/Kerbalism/wiki/Default-Profile\u003C/a\u003E) says that you can either configure a chem plant in the editor to produce ammonia, or you can use the\u00A0ECLSS function of a pod to create ammonia from organic waste.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zipmafia","CreatedById":108469,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-08T03:33:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnistall all other life support mods besides Kerbalism.
