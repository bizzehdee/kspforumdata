While browsing the web, for nothing really, just searching \u0027KSP\u0027, I noticed this and it caught my eye; pictures below. The Kerbals from the earlier versions seem to look rather different, even in the in-flight cams. Just look at the two, they are different, and noticably so. Were they changed to look different in some version? Just a little interesting thing that caught my eye; I am a new player! \n\n![a_vilagur_1.jpg](http://www.gamechannel.hu/pictures/blog/a_vilagur_1.jpg)\n\n![kerbal.png](http://www.albedo039.es/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/kerbal.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"wossname","CreatedById":118005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T16:35:06Z","Content":"Looks like a boost in poly-count and texture resolution, at least for these marketing pictures."},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainApollo","CreatedById":145000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T16:43:20Z","Content":"I agree, I sort of like the old ones as well though."},{"CreatedByName":"Canopus","CreatedById":57774,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T16:52:09Z","Content":"0.16 is the version that introduced actual Kerbals that could go on EVA\u0027s and, as a consequence, Larger parts and interior views.
