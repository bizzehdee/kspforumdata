Is the math we have now wrong? I bet most of you will say no, and for good reasons: Convincing evidence, rate of usage, influence throughout history, ect.\n\nBut back at the history part, think about how much the math we use now has changed over the years. Centuries, and even millennia of reevaluating, refining, and slowly creeping to where it is now. So my question is:\n\nWhere will our math be in the future? Will it still be the same as it is right now? Will it have changed much, if not just a little? Perhaps drastically?\n\nAnd to clear up a potential argument right now; this question does not apply to basic or theoretical math. Obviously addition for example means to add, and ideas of math that do not influence reality cannot technically be false. So, get those out of here.\n\nWith that out of the way, it\u0027s time to ask.\n\nWhat we think we know... is it wrong or right?\n\nIs there something in the world, or perhaps universe that we have not accounted for?\n\nWhere is it going in the future? \n\nI\u0027d like to hear your thoughts on this, and try not to be influenced by anyone that may have come before you.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-05T08:23:49Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2015 08:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Xannari Ferrows**"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T14:54:22Z","Content":"Really, I don\u0027t think there is a \u0022right\u0022 way to do math.

You want to talk about theorem there.\n\nAnd there were so many wrong proofs in the history of mathematics. Sure, most don\u0027t get published, but that doesn\u0027t make them nonexistent. So mathematics itself is not wrong, but our knowledge or understanding (the false proof) can be.\n\nAs an actual published example: Grunwald\u0027s \u0022theorem\u0022.\n\nShort version if you know some math: Let a be an integer. If x^m = a mod b has a solution for every positive integer b, then a is an m-th power of an integer.\n\nLonger and slightly sloppy version assuming less knowledge: Take a whole number (whole number means nothing after the period; an integer), call it **a**. Assume that the number **a**, if written in any base b, ends in a digit that also occurs as the last digit of an m-th power of some whole number. Then **a** is already an m-th power of some whole number.\n\nCounterexample: a=16, m=8. But the theorem is correct if m is not a multiple of 8. A \u0022proof\u0022 of the wrong version was first given by Grunwald in 1933, and later another one was \u0022found\u0022 by Whaples in 1942.
