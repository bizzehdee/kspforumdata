I don\u0027t know if it is possible to make everything trough action groups. I don\u0027t even need action group extender, one or two action groups I can spare. However pistons got only move to center or move \u002B/- commands available trough action groups. Missing \u0022move to position 0.62 and stop\u0022 command for example, so I don\u0027t know if it is possible to do such stuff even trough KOS SAS or Flight Computer if those are restricted to commands available trough action groups.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a problem I ran into when making that video. I couldn\u0027t use kOS to query the current position of an Infernal Robotics slider because the KSPField that infernal robotics uses to represent the part\u0027s current position is a hidden field not shown on the right click menu. and kOS *deliberately* does not give itself permission to expose a hidden field to the script programs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen we started working on the system for kOS to be able to query and manipulate the values of other modules, we were very conscious of the fact that we could make a lot of other mod writers \u003Cem\u003Every mad\u003C/em\u003E at us if we started letting users fiddle all willy-nilly with any KSPFields they felt like at any time in any way. This is because there\u0027s a lot of mods out there, and \u003Cstrong\u003EInfernal Robotics is one\u003C/strong\u003E of them, for which a lot of things which are really conceptually internal data for the mod\u0027s private use, which the user shouldn\u0027t see or change, are still listed as KSPFields anyway, for reasons other than letting the user see or fiddle with them. One possible reason for doing this includes wanting the value to be changeable via a Part.cfg file, but not necessarily changeable in flight by the pilot. Another possible reason for doing this is because it makes it easy to save the value to the persistence file. Because KSP requires all such fields to be declared as public, we can\u0027t assume that just because it\u0027s public that this means it\u0027s okay to let users use it. There\u0027s a large difference between \u0022I don\u0027t mind other mod programmers messing with this\u0022 versus \u0022I don\u0027t mind the user in-game messing with this\u0022. It\u0027s not safe to assume one from the other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, even though there *are* KSPFields in \u003Cstrong\u003EInfernal Robotics\u003C/strong\u003E that kOS *could* very easily enable kOS scripts to use, that would let a kOS script get the current position of the moving hinge or slider, we\u0027re deliberately not exposing them to the scripts because we don\u0027t know if we have the blessing of the authors of IR to do so. (hint, hint).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment, the rules we established when we don\u0027t have explicit blessing are as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Is the KSPField currently visible and showing on the right click menu?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it isn\u0027t, then kOS will act as if the field doesn\u0027t even exist. Not only will kOS scripts be disallowed from altering the value, they cannot even read it either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Is the KSPField visible on the right click panel but has no gui tweakable control on it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the kOS script can read the value but not change it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

(i.e. during flight versus in the VAB).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the kOS script can both read and write the value, but even then it doesn\u0027t have full reign to write anything it feels like. It still has to abide by the restrictions in the GUI control. (i.e obeying the min/max/increment values of the slider for a floating point value.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur basic philosophy was \u0022Allow a kOS script to do everything the player can do on those right click menus as a manual pilot, *and no more than that*.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s the \u0022and no more than that\u0022 that\u0027s causing us to deliberately not expose the current IR part\u0027s position to the kOS user.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sirkut","CreatedById":57229,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-13T18:19:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou have my blessing to utilize whatever you see in the right click menu to get kOS working.

If the parts weighed even more, like 500 tons, would the joints be even more stable? Or is this a perception thing on my end?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond part of that question, and the weird part: I know that Goodspeed parts have a configurable test weight that uses a resource called \u0022ExtraTons\u0022, one unit of which weighs one ton, to add or subtract weight from that part. Is it possible to create a resource with negative mass? If so, I wonder if the following scenario would work at all:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Make IR parts weigh something ridiculous in order for them to have stiff joints.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Add this resource, invisibly if possible, to IR parts such that the \u003Cem\u003Enet \u003C/em\u003Eweight of the system is the weight the part really ought to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. In theory, the actual mass of the part might be used to determine joint stiffness, and the negative-mass resource would then cancel out most of that mass so that the whole vessel wouldn\u0027t weigh so much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould that even work?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT\u003C/strong\u003E: logs. Here\u0027s my procedure:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. New game. Go to SPH. Build craft with some parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Put a rotatron on it, scale it to 2.5x.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Use IR control to attempt to rotate part. SOMETHING appears to rotate in the part (sort of...), but the actual rotating platform that normally turns does not. When it\u0027s an extendatron, the part that usually extends instead kind of moves to the side and backward relative to where it would move normally. Eventually (maybe when power ran out?) the IR control window just closed itself and the craft did some weird, mild bouncy things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Closed KSP and copied logs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOutput_log: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59567837/output_logIRLargeScale.txt\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59567837/output_logIRLargeScale.txt\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP.log in case it\u0027s useful: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59567837/KSPlog_IRLargeScale.log\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59567837/KSPlog_IRLargeScale.log\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, just in case that\u0027s a concern, I am pretty sure my TweakScale configs are not at issue - they seem to work flawlessly for anything scaled 2.0x, 1.5x, 1.0x, 0.5x, and 0.25x... I removed all TS modules from part configs and instead put everything (including scaletypes) in an MM patch. This is the MM config: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59567837/Rework_TweakScale_New.cfg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59567837/Rework_TweakScale_New.cfg\u003C/a\u003E - which also eliminates the need to set individual values for every mass or muMechToggle variable for every rescaleFactor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESECOND EDIT: \u003C/strong\u003EBasically don\u0027t have a clue what\u0027s going on with the scaling interactions. I\u0027m using TS 1.44, but same applies to newer (and in some ways buggy) versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECertain rescaleFactors applied to parts makes them not work, basically. I used an MM config to duplicate various IR parts with TS modules built in during duplication, names changed, etc. The parts (rescaleFactor of the part and associated muMechToggle variables) are scaled up 4x by the MM patch. The TS module applied to these new parts allows for 0.625x, 0.75x, 1x, 1.5x, and 2x scaleFactors. The really weird part is that now, after duplicating these parts, the TweakScale configs that previously worked on the NORMAL parts no longer do. The normal parts move fine when scaled to 0.25x, 0.5x, and 1x, but no longer work at 1.5x and 2x. The duplicated parts work fine when scaled to 0.625x, 0.75x, and 1x, but not 1.5x or 2x either. What. The. Hell. This changed even though I \u003Cem\u003Edidn\u0027t change \u003C/em\u003Eany of the code previously applied to non-duplicated parts.
