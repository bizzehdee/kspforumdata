A big reason for this is the ocean. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can change some setting in the config file in the gamefolder so that the maxsubdivision for the ocean is lower, this helps massivly!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBUT this method isn\u0027t foolproof and it might mess up the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I was thinking if there could be a setting that turns the ocean of kerbin to a very simple texture. Personaly I think it could just be blue. It might not be very beautiful but it would help a lot of people including myself and it is something that I think isn\u0027t too hard to do. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr maybe my reasoning is completely wrong.

I have a decent rig and can run most games on the high or very high settings at around 60 FPS as an average. In KSP, I drop to a pain-staking 10-20 FPS whenever I look at not only the ocean anymore, but also the terrain.
