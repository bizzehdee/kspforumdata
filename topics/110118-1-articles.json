Parts will randomly disappear from the parts catalog when I close the game and open it back up again. The disappearances are permanent, e. g., they don\u0027t pop back up into existence with the next reload. I used to put it down to just entropy, since the parts that disappeared were inconsequential, stuff I almost never used. Except, just this morning, the structural panels disappeared (both 1x1 and 2x2), as well as the XL struts. Given that I\u0027m attempting to create a dirigible aircraft carrier, this is a problem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConstructions using any of the disappeared parts do not seem to vanish from the parts catalog, but sub-assemblies using the ex-parts are, sadly, no more.
