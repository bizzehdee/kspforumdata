Not saying it\u0027s bad though.) It managed to fly itself just fine...

I noticed this as once I went past 5.0KM the AI plane slowed down towards the end of the runway before stopping a short ways from the edge. It would seem that if you plan to do a dogfight against the AI you better make sure they can still track you on their radar or else they\u0027ll just go, \u0022Gosh darnit, he got away!\u0022 Not sure if this was a decision to prevent issues with lag or something but I feel it could use a tweak to allow them to continue tracking past the guard range if possible. Great work on the mod Bahamut, really looking forward to what you add next! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E (PS, Autopilot aircraft have always been on my wishlist as I was sick of just bombing ground targets and the KSC. XD)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond EDIT: Oookaaay, so I\u0027ve tested again with a few different aircraft as well as using my new slower more maneuverable fighter aircraft, each one would ignite its engines, run to the end of the runway, then just slide off into the ocean, I even tried just using a rover to see if they\u0027d bother taking off and it would again start up its engines, run down the runway, slide into the ocean, the small aircraft can easily take off halfway up the KSC ISLAND runway, I was launching these tests from the Space Centers own runway so it\u0027s not a matter of the crafts themselves. Not particularly sure what to do now. Perhaps I\u0027ll give in and uninstall KerbinSide then try but I feel like that shouldn\u0027t really be the issue. I\u0027m not a scripter though so maybe it is.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T14:52:00Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 02:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SubjectX07\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ENew Info\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSP_ftw","CreatedById":130074,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T12:52:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BahamutoD\u0022 data-cite=\u0022BahamutoD\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFixed the tweakable slider issue.\u003Cp\u003EI couldn\u0027t reproduce the reticle issue with the fixed guns.
