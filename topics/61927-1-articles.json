I do like it but it is seriously missing a lot of detail .. yes it is cool and like i said i love the co2 scrubber and even the consumption rates .. but guess what? TAC allows me to set my consumption rates .. it now has a scrubber just like ECLSS has BUT it also adds in waste ware waste consumption food food consumption and with that .... that other stuff that doesn\u0027t go in the yellow funnel (if you are an ISS nerd you\u0027ll get that joke). Too many parts? Do like what we all do raid the parts folder and toss out the ones you don\u0027t want!! lol I mean i love Kosmos but its parts are leaky and something like eating a runaway culture ... they bloom and take over ram .. so what do ya do?? take the parts you want toss the ones you don\u0027t! same with TAC .. but at least you have the structure .. which is pretty dang cool.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"celem","CreatedById":91132,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-03T10:21:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have used ECLSS a few times and am quite a fan. My main annoyance is that theres no way to create perpetual systems (realism bah) unless you can leverage some kind of resource mod or tweak the numbers. Even with the scrubbers you slowly lose O2 which makes bases and stations a logistical nightmare unless you are going to close the loop somehow. Longrange interplanetary stuff becomes tricky too, i ended up doing a lot of high-speed transfers for huge dV to fit time constraints.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
