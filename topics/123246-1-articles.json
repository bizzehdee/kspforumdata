Well, as long as you move your platform off the pad your rover wheels will work, and to make sure the delivery craft doesn\u0027t lose control, add a decoupler between the craft and the platform and stage it before releasing the rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsStyle_spoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022 tabindex=\u00220\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/D22tQ6a.png\u0022 alt=\u0022D22tQ6a.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout that decoupler, the rover not in control becomes unusable, but even without it, and if I\u0027m controlling the top rover, the wheels will work when staged because it\u0027s not on the pad or runway and the structural panels will be treated as ground for the purposes of wheel collision.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027d like to try the ramp and the other craft I used to figure this out, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/8q4o6jeigrpn456/wheeltest_craft_files.zip?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline\u0022\u003Eyou can find them here.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, there will be no fixes to these wheels, they are being completely replaced for 1.1 with entirely new wheels and code, they won\u0027t even be Unity wheels anymore so these issues will be moot, and bugs with the wheels won\u0027t apply to the new code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-18T11:45:48Z\u0022 title=\u002210/18/2015 11:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sal_vager\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
