If I accelerate time prior to a launch in order to line my orbit up with some other celestial body I find that my ship is stuck to the launchpad when I return. A few details:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) If I launch immediately rather than time accelerating first I launch just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) This occurs whether or not I am using launch supports and am well away from the surface of the launch pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) This bug still occurs if I take off briefly, touch down, time accelerate, then try to take off again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) If I release tanks/rockets from my ship while trying to take off they fly off just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne last note, it\u0027s less reproducible but I have also returned to my ship after time acceleration and been unable to move although I fire the rockets. It could be the same issue if it\u0027s a matter of effective mass of the ship bugging out (not sure if that one is helpful). I have also been experiencing phantom acceleration on a semi regular basis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point I\u0027m at a standstill as it happens every single time I try to launch and time accelerate beforehand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your time,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Bill\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-17T03:43:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi ManofYak,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t mind providing just a bit more info, such as which Operating System you are using, if you could post log files, and maybe even post a quicksave?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis thread will help you locate some of that info: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92230-Stock-Support-Bug-Reporting-Guide\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92230-Stock-Support-Bug-Reporting-Guide\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ManofYak","CreatedById":122380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-17T16:46:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks very much Claw,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I\u0027m back on my gaming computer I\u0027ll do just that.
