There are lots of attributes, and what they mean mostly depends on the node type they are in. There is a set of attributes, that describe a part, and a different set of attributes to describe a vessel, a kerbal, a contract etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOften you can guess the abbreviations when you know the details of KSP. \u0022rot\u0022 probably describes by a vector, in what orientation / rotation a part is mounted to it\u0027s parent, or in which general direction a vessel is currently looking. \u0022\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0022 is center of mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you see something that you seem to understand, then change it to you liking (name of a kerbal, amount of ressource for some cheating, change path to flag for each individual part, ...).

You can even add your own attributes, but I have seen that KSP drops anything that doesn\u0027t belong there when it\u00A0loads and later saves such a file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe KSP API documentation is also not very helpful about this.
