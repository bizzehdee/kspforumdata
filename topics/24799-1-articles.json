You can argue that you can go with less on the 1m but with the 2m parts 24 is really the minimum on looking good. On small piping and such I typically work with six or eight sides, mesh smoothing will make that generally look good at even pretty close distances. Really, a good guideline is that if you can remove complexity in your model without making it look less complex you should and piping can go a very long way to making your model look complex and visually interesting without introducing a lot of tris. What really generates a lot of geometry are organic shapes, domes and irregular curves really eat into your tricount, avoid them whenever you can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general though it is pretty hard to go really overboard with tris, if you are really worried you can try out your model with an equivalent model of stock parts and take a look at framerates but as long as you pay some attention to your geometry you should be fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MerlinsMaster","CreatedById":112079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T03:06:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat is a sensible poly count limit for IVAs?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T03:28:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cryocasm\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cryocasm\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EKSP in itself calls for a node_collider, so this isn\u0027t of discussion.

For Unity 5, they will all have to be convex. So it\u0027s best to stick to that anyway. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the colliders individually need to be pretty simple, you can use combinations of them to get a slightly more complex shape.
