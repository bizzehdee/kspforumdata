Something the Soviets developed but never really took off. ( No pun intended) It\u0027s a big plane, and the whole class of planes it falls into would seem unable to fly, and to an extent they can\u0027t. But they are able to move fast enough that the air beneath them can\u0027t get out of the way because they fly so close to the ground. This is known as \u0022The Ground Effect\u0022 It\u0027s that cushion you feel when an airplane comes in for a landing just before the wheels hit. \n\nDoes anyone know if this effect is currently modeled? Or will it be in 1.0, or FAR? And if this thread\u0027s been covered already, my apologies.\n\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_effect_vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_effect_vehicle)\n\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspian_Sea_Monster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspian_Sea_Monster)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-13T16:51:32Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2015 04:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Renkov**\n  \nAnswered"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T15:11:36Z","Content":"First of all, welcome to the forums.\n\nSecond your information on the Kaspian Sea Monster is thus far correct (according to my knowledge).
