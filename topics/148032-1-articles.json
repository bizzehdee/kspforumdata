You see that often in large or unrealistic crafts. If this isn\u0027t the case anymore (in 1.2) I will be very happy! And I wonder if I ask something very complicated. But for me it ruined my motivation to make aircrafts in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. There are no proceduraly generated wings, if not using mods. This limits imagination and options drastically.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS. I really love KSP!

I see no problem with placing wings inside wings, as it still adds mass to the plane.
