It results, surprisingly, in a rather nice looking ogive (?). The strakes are longer than the edges of the delta , so they are clipping into the fuselage a little. You could use some rectangular pieces to make the delta start further out from the cargo bays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBig S strakes and Deltas are the min-maxer\u0027s choice of wing part, because they have the same 10:1 lift:mass ratio of the best wing parts, heat tolerance and tankage for liquid fuel. However I don\u0027t see any airbreathers on your design, so maybe this fuel capacity goes unused? In which case, use any wing pieces you like, except one of the swept wings needs to be avoided as it\u0027s lift : mass ratio is poorer than the others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, lack of wing area is not the only reason for your high landing speed. If you fly with F12 (aerodynamic forces display) on, you will see that your elevons are raising the nose by applying downforce to the trailing edge of the wing. Relatively close to the plane\u0027s centre of gravity, they have to use a lot more (down) force to get the nose up than a conventional tailplane further back. But the best thing would be a canard surface up front, which adds lift rather than subtracting it when trying to get the nose up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a minimal change, I\u0027d say\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. add canard\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. as this moves the centre of lift forwards, move the main wing back slightly if necessary\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. remove the elevons from the trailing edge and attach a strake instead, for a .... tapered trailing edge. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy strake over elevon? Because control surfaces like elevons only have 5:1 lift : mass ratio , and no fuel tankage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re worried about the effect of all this on your ship\u0027s performance, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/138291-Wing-Lift-Wing-Lift-to-Drag-Ratio-Charts\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/138291-Wing-Lift-Wing-Lift-to-Drag-Ratio-Charts\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou can see that best lift:drag ratio occurs at only 2-5 degrees angle of attack, which needs a lot of wing at high alt. There are counterarguments, but i\u0027d say a larger wing won\u0027t noticeably worsen performance, at least. My \u0022goose\u0022 doesn\u0027t want to go fast below 10km. However it can climb to 16km subsonic, then transition to supersonic. In the very thin air above 20km, it flies very well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, on the subject of crashworthiness, I\u0027m not yet convinced by the Mk3 cockpit. Yes it has higher impact resistance than others, but its positioning means Jeb \u0026amp; Co are always the first to arrive at the scene of an accident. This type II/III mining hybrid has an inline cockpit with landing gear below, canards either side, a crew cabin, cargo bay with ore tank, type 2 to 1 adapter (rocket fuel), service bay with 2 batteries, and a shock cone in front as \u0022crumple zone\u0022.
