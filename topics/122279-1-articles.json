Unfortunately for supersonic the runway is incredibly too small. Now I\u0027ve searched threads and seen that the reason there isn\u0027t a longer one is because they want to keep the runway (which is already big enough for landing) small for aircraft so as to not make it too easy to land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If there is already a mod with a significant longer runway that would be awesome, and would appreciate a link to it. If there isn\u0027t could you look into making a separate runway or maybe a separate mode entirely just for ground vehicles with a runway that is about 10miles long? Again this isn\u0027t for aircraft landing, this is because my friend and I build vehicles that are stable at speeds of 350 to 450m/s (not rocket engines) and we keep running out of flat land and there is only so much we can do before just doing crazy stuff like overly sized engines on a pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for your time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T18:38:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105247-0-90-Kerbal-Konstructs-%28v0-7-1%29-Fuel-Mah-Spaceplane!\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal Konstructs\u003C/a\u003E has a bunch of new runways and launchpads, and even \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/131555-1-0-4-FASTCORP-Roads-for-Kerbal-Konstructs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eroads\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T18:59:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust like real life, supersonic land-speed runs are best done off the runway.
