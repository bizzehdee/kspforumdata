The number of toggles in each node is too easy to miss click so an idea to fix that would be to, add to the option box that askes when you add a manoeuvre node the three different types of node. I then thought any plane change manoeuvre nodes should automatically appear on a descending node when a target is selected. The toggles on each node are not suited for plane changes so how about a 360 degree protractor for the manual adjustments. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA reason why manoeuvre nodes are great is because they can reduce three burns into one, so when multiple nodes of different types are added onto an orbital path they can be manually dragged on top on the other with a snapping action that creates a node at a distance between the two of maximum efficiency, where the orbit change setup will remain the same. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe blue toggles that shift the orbit could overlay the map view with a sphere in the centre of the orbit, the centre of the planetary body being orbited and the centre of a targets orbit, the orbit could then be dragged to the position most wanted and could even snap to the centres listed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe main reason I thought they needed improved is the difficulty in getting a burn right, there could be a slider that changes the precision of the toggles for large burns at full slider and tiny adjustments at empty slider.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is just a series of ideas that I want other peoples opinions on, any improvements to the idea, why it is a good/bad idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T13:54:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EManeuver nodes should rotate the blue marker over time to reflect the new direction.

If you set up a node that will change inclination by 20 degrees, then the direction of burn should start off being 10 degrees off from normal in the retrograde direction. That makes the 20 degrees of normal change straddle the 90 degree mark in the middle (from 100 degrees at the start of burn to 80 degrees at the end of it) rather than putting the 90 degree mark at the start (from 90 degrees to 70 degrees during the burn).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis suggestion would mean that your orbit gets smaller at first, then halfway through starts getting bigger again until it ends roughly the same size as it started. The way it works right now, normal and antinormal manuever nodes always have the side effect of making your orbit bigger because while they start off being perpendicular to your plane, they don\u0027t stay that way as the prograde direction tilts toward the aiming vector.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T23:18:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI do not, however, withdraw my comment about normal and antinormal burns.
