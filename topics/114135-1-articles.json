This is so that space warships are actually practical and common, so they have to be able to perform a variety of maneuvers and burn for days at at least 1/3 G without 99% of the ship being propellant tanks. (gotta have room for guns and armor and missiles, right?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, it\u0027s sci fi. And, for those who have read the books, aliens show the ability to bypass hard physics with insanely advanced technology, but the author tries to portray human civilization as being far more realistic. So I began wondering if such fusion \u0022torch\u0022 drives even pass a basic pencil test of theoretical feasibility. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey are described in the books as creating a plume of plasma behind the ship vastly larger and brighter than the ship itself, which is described as a tiny spec behind this massive drive flare. Thinking about it, at this level of performance, what you would have to do is somehow contain the ball of plasma right after a modern day fusion bomb explodes using some really big magnets and electric fields and hyper-advanced mirrors to reflect all the light and heat away so your engine doesn\u0027t melt. \u003Cem\u003EIf\u003C/em\u003E you could basically contain what\u0027s a nuclear explosion inside your engine and only let a stream of the plasma at millions of degrees kelvin out the back, you\u0027d have the described performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I glanced at \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/fusionfuel.php\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAtomic Rocket\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s section on this. Glancing at the chart of available fusion reactions, proton-boron sounds like the one to use because it produces less neutrons. Neutrons ruin the party because you cannot contain them with electric or magnetic forces or mirrors and they will impinge on your engine apparatus and heat it up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you had a 10,000 ton space battlewagon (the ship flown by the protagonist in the book is described as being armored and having several decks with a large mass driver gun, etc), and no more than 10% of the mass is fuel, and it\u0027s all boron and hydrogen. The average velocity of the fusion products leaking out the back is 1% of the speed of light. That would give you 300k ISP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to accelerate the whole contraption at 1/3 G (let\u0027s ignore the fact that in the books they can \u0022burn\u0022 at 10 Gs), F=ma, F = (10k tons * 1000 kg/ton) (3.3333 m/s), F = ISP * mass flow rate * g, mass flow rate = 11.1 kg/second. If 10% of the ship is fuel, you can burn for 90k seconds, or 25 hours. You have a dV of 310 kps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1/2 mv^2, so you have an exhaust energy of..100 terawatts. Wow. If just 10% of that energy is soaked up as waste heat that needs to be rejected, you would need to emit 10 terawatts via droplet radiators. You\u0027d need a square kilometer of droplet area via this calculator with 1600 kelvin coolant \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.5596.org/cgi-bin/dropletradiator.php\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.5596.org/cgi-bin/dropletradiator.php\u003C/a\u003E. Those several hundred meter long radiator booms would be a pretty big target. Not sure what you\u0027d use to have a low enough vapor pressure at 1600 kelvin so you don\u0027t boil all your coolant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s not as impressive as I thought it might be. The fusion products from a p-B fusion reaction leave at 4% of the speed of light at best, and I was assuming some losses and products leaving along tracks not aligned with the center of mass of your ship. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean, it\u0027s still pretty fast - you\u0027d be able to reach Mars in a bit over a week. No way you\u0027d be doing 10 G burns, though - the 1/3 G numbers I assumed are far too high as well. And you wouldn\u0027t be under thrust the whole time, either - even with this god-tier engine, you only can burn for a day total, so it would be a 12 hour burn at the start of a trip to Mars, and a 12 hour burn at the end. Same story for a trip to Jupiter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aghanim","CreatedById":76587,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T00:35:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne question: Why proton-boron instead of helium3-helium3 fusion? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst proton-boron fusion still produces neutron, which carries 0.2% of power produced.

Heinlein\u0027s original use of the term meant a handwavium drive that did direct conversion into energy, but this wouldn\u0027t be an engine that even creates exhaust, and isn\u0027t how anyone else has used the term. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/torchships.php\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFrom the very page you linked, modern rule of thumb is that a torchship is simply any ship with a specific drive power of 1 MW/kg or greater.\u003C/a\u003E For reference, the Saturn V at full power was around 30 kW/kg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe description of a drive with only a photon exhaust would also be pretty terrible, too - photons have awful mass, and so you\u0027ll get no usefully high acceleration out of something with a photon exhaust no matter how powerful. Modern torch drives are either fusion drives, antimatter-boosted engines that absorb the energy into something much heavier, or a mix of the two. Occasionally insane ideas like the NSWR pop up, or less insane but still quite crazy ideas like Orion, but it\u0027s primarily the domain of large fusion devices.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the drives being described in the books, there\u0027s actually little need to avoid the neutron radiation - they can be controlled, though are more difficult to, and the heat can be cooled off. You\u0027d need very large radiators to do so, yes, but any sane future spaceship would have these anyway, and most of the neutron energy would be directed into heating the fusion fuel, or another expendable that\u0027s used to reduce Isp, as you actually don\u0027t always want the most excessively high Isp possible once you\u0027re beyond the limits of chemical propellants. Lower Isp would increase thrust possible, making it desirable for high-g manoeuvring ships. As a result, the most desirable option is D-D fusion, due to its large abundance - with He3-He3 being a secondary option if some particular design requirement means you do actually have to avoid neutrons, and you can actually create enough to supply your fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beowolf","CreatedById":48927,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T22:37:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, Rick Robinson, came up with a revisionist definition that bizarrely includes a bunch of boring realistic engines as \u0022torchships\u0022.

And then he fails completely at it. Torch drives have traditional characteristics that not a single one of Robinson\u0027s proposals can even approach. Hell, his designs can\u0027t even get within two orders of magnitude! No nuclear salt water rockets, no fusion drives, not even any hypothetical antimatter drives, have anything remotely like the performance of a torchship. There\u0027s a great excuse for this: You can\u0027t build a torchship that works like a regular reaction drive because every known form of matter would instantly vaporize under that absurd load. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI appear to have the same credentials as Rick Robinson, so I hearby define the term \u0022torchship\u0022 by the thing that makes them special: A torchship can make interplanetary runs under constant acceleration high enough to feel like gravity to those inside. Because of that, they always fly brachistochrone paths rather than Hohmann orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, Heinlein\u0027s total-conversion starships: Torchships.

It\u0027s the way most torch drives I can think of worked. Varley, for example, specifically says that when his bubbles get squeezed hard that\u0027s what happens inside. But Spider Robinson\u0027s \u0022guru meditation\u0022 drive in Variable Star meets my criteria, and it used vacuum energy plus Buddhism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECorey\u0027s Leviathan Wakes is $9.99 for Kindle.
