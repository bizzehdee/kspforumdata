For instance, it can make the difference whether your Eve craft makes orbit or not. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, I\u0026#39;ve started a little testing to see which of the nose cone variants seems \u0022best\u0022 in 1.0.5. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat I have so far was found using this simple rocket lifting to a 100km Kerbin orbit with a different central nose cone (the other nose cones on the side tanks stayed the same each time)...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/BYezrXI.jpg[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI flew it with MJ and used the measure of how much dv was left after MJ handed over control on reaching a 100km orbit. Repeated twice more and results averaged. This measure should take account of drag and mass, expecting both to increase the dv used. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere\u0026#39;s the results so far:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAdvanced Nose Cone - Type A: 1820 m/s. This nose cone got the hottest, it was close to heatploding on the way up. Perhaps due to having a max temp of 2000\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. \u003Cbr\u003E\nAdjustable Ramp Intake: 1833.\u003Cbr\u003E\nShock Cone: 1788. This would likely have been the champion in 1.0.4 but it\u0026#39;s mass was increased a lot in 1.0.5. \u003Cbr\u003E\nCircular Intake: 1838. The best score. However, it does have a low max temp of just 1900\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and came really close to heatploding. \u003Cbr\u003E\nAerodynamic Nose Cone: 1835. \u003Cbr\u003E\nFL-A10 Adapter\u002BSmall Nose Cone: 1823. Also didn\u0026#39;t look good temperature-wise. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, the nose cone I am going to declare as the surprise winner in this particular test is the humble Aerodynamic Nose Cone!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/PIVJJdk.jpg[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt has the lowest mass, pretty low drag and yet a high max temp of 2400\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. Meaning it is pretty darned good.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T13:53:09Z","Content":"\nOk. Let\u0026#39;s repeat that but swap out all 5 nose cones each time. Not sure why didn\u0026#39;t just do that the first time but never mind, it\u0026#39;s all good...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[COLOR=#3E3E3E]Advanced Nose Cone - Type A: 1820[/COLOR]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[COLOR=#3E3E3E]Adjustable Ramp Intake: 1820[/COLOR]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[COLOR=#3E3E3E]Shock Cone: 1771[/COLOR]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[COLOR=#3E3E3E]Circular Intake: 1828 [/COLOR]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[COLOR=#3E3E3E]Aerodynamic Nose Cone: 1799[/COLOR]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[COLOR=#3e3e3e]FL-A10 Adapter\u002BSmall Nose Cone: 1806[/COLOR]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[COLOR=#3e3e3e]This has mixed things up compared to the last test. The aerodynamic nose cone did less well this time, probably because it is draggier and it\u0026#39;s lower mass doesn\u0026#39;t compensate. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe highest dv left was achieved with the Circular Intake. It has low mass and low drag. If temperature is not an issue then it\u0026#39;s probably the one to go with. However, with a max temperature of just 1900\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, it is going fail you at some point. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe worst was the shock cone. Its increased mass in 1.0.5 (why ever did they do that??) has left it looking poor here. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy Editor\u0026#39;s Recommendation is the [B]Adjustable Ramp Intake[/B]. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[/COLOR][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/LjG2UMn.jpg[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt has low mass, low drag and high temperature tolerance.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rdwulfe","CreatedById":107690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T14:00:30Z","Content":"\nGreat info here, sir.
