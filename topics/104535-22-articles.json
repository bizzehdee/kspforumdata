Roll control? Well the ship will already be rolling. The leveled control point on the IR part will just roll If want and it will go off level. However its yaw and pitch im worried about. Or not worried about because i have a theory. If you notice that when it comes to RCS thrusters KSP will activate the thruster that is closet to the axis your inputing control too. So if my ship is spinning and i want to pitch up. As the rcs thrusters spinning on the main ship come into the axis upon which im pitching they will activate, deactivate, activate, deactivate as the ship spins. Might work. IIRC thats how alot of real life space craft who use spin stabilization ( Juno for instance ) yaw and pitch correctly. The thruster thats rolling around fires at the correct axis.

The \u0022rescalefactor\u0022 (which applies to the entire config), and two places in the \u0022model\u0022 reference (for parts that use them).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the \u0022rescalefactor\u0022 is used, then switching away from the craft and back to it sometimes (always?) causes the scaling to be reset.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is one solution that always works, but you might not like it: build your parts to the scale you need, and then use the welding mod to create new subsections. The welding mod always uses model reference blocks, and always sets the scale inside those blocks, which always works. The problem is that you have to create a bunch of new parts if you use this solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me that\u0027s fine, I need to create new welded parts anyway otherwise my craft part count would be ridiculously high. But you might not want to weld parts together. If the only parts you are having issues with are the robotic parts themselves then that might not be so bad since you won\u0027t end up with too many redundant, resized parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother possible solution that you may not have considered: parts being transformed by IR servos can clip through each other.
