Valentina, and another astronaut Agaya, have changed from female to male, their default face ingame is now a male kerbal, as well as their avatar in the astronaut complex. I\u0027ve tried to edit their gender using a save file editor, but it just automatically switches them back to male. Is there some other file that I can edit?\n\nThis is only in my main career. If I start a new career Valentina is fine. I really would like to avoid having to start my career over.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-25T18:38:58Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2015 06:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ThaSaint**\n  \nSolved"},{"CreatedByName":"Papa_Joe","CreatedById":10788,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T01:27:47Z","Content":"Can you provide a bit more detail on what mods you have installed?
