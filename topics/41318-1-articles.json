Can you test and see if this occurs with - say - a single stage rocket with nothing radially mounted, so you can be sure everything is balanced? I only ask because just last night I ran into an issue with some very minor torque from my radially-mounted boosters pushing me off course.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rezdoggy","CreatedById":41340,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-06T16:41:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou need to download the 0.21.1 patch which fixes the drifting SAS\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jarin","CreatedById":71395,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-06T16:44:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI thought the drifting SAS was only with unbalanced thrust?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheHengeProphet","CreatedById":14895,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-06T18:19:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jarin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jarin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI thought the drifting SAS was only with unbalanced thrust?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen .21 first dropped, I strapped a probe core with an SAS unit to a single rocket booster, and that thing would drift every which way with no input, where it should have just gone straight. I tested it without SAS and it flew straight, which meant that the SAS was causing the drift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, if you have .21.1, you shouldn\u0027t have a problem, lest your craft has some sort of uneven drag or thrust. Particularly if you are still pointed vertical and your velocity indicator is the only thing that is moving.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
