I build planes a lot now, and I have to say, I\u0027m disappointed by the lack of a pointy nosecone. Yeah, sure, we have the pointy one which went with the old Mk3 cockpit, but I think that needs to be re-textured. And the small cone which you put on the front? That\u0027s too round for my high speed designs. I have taken to offsetting and rotating ALL THREE Communotrons to get the shape I want. Which really racks up the part count.\n\nSo, my suggestion to Squad: add more nosecones! I\u0027m thinking 5:\n\n1. The old blue and white one\n\n2. A 1.25 version of the C7 adapter (the one with LFO)\n\n3. A 1.25 of the other C7 adapter (the slanted one)\n\n4. A conical 1.25 nosecone- think the one we have now with a pointy end\n\n5.

Given that the wiki is maintained by users interpreting what Squad said in various places, that\u0027s not too surprising. Squad has also been known to change their minds, so it\u0027s not impossible that they had made a no-reentry-heat statement prior to that, but changed their minds.
