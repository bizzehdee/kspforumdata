Those companies develop DLC that will add a few new options to the game while at the same time a whole lot of new features will be released for free with the regular patches that the DLC helps to fund. On the one hand this means that every time a new major patch comes around the game will become a bit unbalanced until the next minor balance patch and people will have to adopt to new options and opportunities. That is obviously not something everyone would enjoy but it keeps the games fresh for everyone and retains mod compatibility for everyone without forcing everyone to buy the DLC.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
