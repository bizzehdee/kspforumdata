I really enjoy the extra challenge and slightly more realistic velocities involved. I\u0027ve gotten pretty decent with it, except that I still haven\u0027t built up good \u0022rules of thumb\u0022 for ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy main problem is, while the atmo in 3.7 is still 70 km, the planet is WAY bigger, so horizontal velocity has to be around 4500. This means I need a shallower ascent path than I used to use. The trouble really seems to be when using a particularly low TWR final stage. I launch, let speed rise to 100, then tip a little. Solids jettison just about as vehicle goes supersonic, and TWR on Mainsail core is around 1.1, so I maintain a very high AoA during the first minute or so of this stage. I let time to AP rise to between 35 and 40 seconds. Lower stage jettisons, and upper stage instantly fires, but has a TWR of only 1.05, so I bring the nose back up quite a lot to compensate. I try to maintain 40 seconds to AP until it reaches 80 km. And here\u0027s where I\u0027m not sure what I should be doing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I at this point in flight, I still need at least two minutes of burn to reach orbital velocity, but time to AP is only 40. So, no engine cut possible, but I don\u0027t quite know how to orient the ship for a continuous burn to orbit. I find that if I aim for the horizon, I end up passing AP well before the half way point of this final burn phase. If I aim to high, I end up pushing my AP up to 90 or more km before I can get close to speed. Is there a happy medium aim point? An angle at which my AP will remain the same while I increase horizontal velocity?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this even possible? Oh, and the final 30 seconds or so of burn is with the final, LV-N powered probe, so TWR drops again to 0.5 for that last little bit. Is there a better ascent path in general I could be taking? Am I just expecting too much performance with too little TWR?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-18T11:15:56Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2015 11:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NFunky\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T17:43:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t played in bigger solar systems for a while, but here are a few thoughts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E If the angle of attack is higher than a few degrees, something is probably wrong.

At 7500 to 8000 m/s horizontal speed, with an atmosphere that ceases to be significant after maybe 120 to 130 km, that\u0027s a lot of very flat trajectory flying to do. Pretty much every real rocket burns for 9 to 11 minutes to LEO, and if the target orbit for the satellite doesn\u0027t mandate pushing the initial apoapsis fairly high, they need to optmize their trajectory a whole lot to avoid falling back down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can especially see this in some of the launch vehicles with longer burn times, like the Ariane 5: Towards the end of the burn, it will actually already have passed apoapsis, and is losing altitude before circularizing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut without computer-aided trajecotry planning, a much more practical approach would be this: after you have pushed your apoapsis to where you want it, allow your rocket to reach it. And then, sit on that apoapsis, and take it with you. If you raise your nose, you will pull it forward, even if it is already behind you; if you lower your nose, it will slip backwards again. With careful steering, you can make it so that it always remains more or less directly on your vessel\u0027s location. This may or may not require you to keep a fairly steep AoA with a low TWR stage, so it\u0027s not the most efficient of maneuvers. It really depends on how much you managed to accelerate by the time you get to that point, too. But it\u0027s practically your only alternative to simply packing more TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing to keep in mind is that in KSP, engine weights and tank dry masses are artificially high, to avoid completely trivializing the task to reach orbit on stock size planets.

The engines simply weigh way too much for the power they output, the tanks simply weigh way too much for the fuel they contain. If you use a smaller system rescale like KScale2, that isn\u0027t much of a problem; if you use a larger system rescale, like 64K or RSS, you generally load up custom engines and maybe even custom tanks to address exactly that issue and keep the game from becoming unplayable because of it.

Typical payload fractions were 4-5%, which made rockets look much better than the current 20-25%. With simple designs, you could have up to 100-120 tonnes of payload on a single launch. I\u0027m not sure what planet size the current stock parts are balanced for, but it\u0027s probably somewhere between 3.7x and 6.4x.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I can remember, the real issue wasn\u0027t with TWR, but with the lack of raw power. The biggest engines were only 3200 kN back then, so you needed a lot of boosters/parallel stacks.

Just wanted to say a big thank you to all you guys for your suggestions.

With that much thrust, I find I can fly an incredibly shallow trajectory and actually get a nicd 75x75 without too much trouble, but if I fly it wrong, or need to incline too far away from 90, I end up having to complete orbital insertion with monoprop (very low TWR), so I\u0027ve been using the \u0022pulling the AP along with you\u0022 technique a bunch.
