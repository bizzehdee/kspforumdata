It comes right off at first stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter all of the small boosters run out, the rocket has enough velocity and height to fire its main liquid booster to carry the weight as gravity grew thin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Will update later with a picture.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPenumbera Rocket can reach over 100Km before all of the fuels from 8 large fuel tanks runs out with 2900Kmps velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I came up with a trick to squeeze out another velocity before switching to my final stage. Using centrifugal force from Pod and Yawmaster-2000 RCS. Penumbera would spin so fast that G-force for the pilots had maxed out the meter. Then it was time to activate the last staging decoupler and fire away the last remaining fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
