It comes right off at first stage.\n\nAfter all of the small boosters run out, the rocket has enough velocity and height to fire its main liquid booster to carry the weight as gravity grew thin.\n\n(Will update later with a picture.)\n\nPenumbera Rocket can reach over 100Km before all of the fuels from 8 large fuel tanks runs out with 2900Kmps velocity.\n\nHowever, I came up with a trick to squeeze out another velocity before switching to my final stage. Using centrifugal force from Pod and Yawmaster-2000 RCS. Penumbera would spin so fast that G-force for the pilots had maxed out the meter. Then it was time to activate the last staging decoupler and fire away the last remaining fuel."}]}
