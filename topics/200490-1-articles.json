I saw the update implemented a new scheme for restoring the corrupted save files so I gave it another try. It seemed to be working after the first few crashes and restored save games, so I started investing some energy in it again. I even bought the expansion content.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow it has decided it won\u0027t load my career save file. The default and sandbox saves load just fine, but when I try to load the one I actually care about the game just happily returns to the main menu like I didn\u0027t select anything. So now it seems I\u0027ve lost my game all over again. Is there any way to get my career save file back without restoring from some other version?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gregbert","CreatedById":203319,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-02T05:45:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI posted this same advice elsewhere recently too but something similar\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003Ehappened to me and I was able to recover my game\u00A0from the PS4 menu in Settings -\u0026gt; Application Save Data Management\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003Esomew\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003Ehere. \u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003EFind KSP and get in there, find your game and it has an option to \u2018restore from \u2018 or something. \u00A0No guarantee it works for everyone and not sure why no one else seems to know to suggest this\u00A0but if you have nothing else to lose, give it a whirl. \u00A0Hope that helps!\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cristiano Kerman","CreatedById":202675,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-15T08:33:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyou have a external folder with your kerbal world? or, if you saved your world in online archivie you should find him with clicking Option in the app and click \u201Cdownload load online\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
