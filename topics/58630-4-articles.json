You start a ship on the launch pad with a ring of mainsail\u0027d boosters. Those boosters are strutted to the payload and to the center. Seems right, moar struts! However, as the boosters drain, the TWR goes through the roof. The struts are rigid, and they start PUSHING ON THE PAYLOAD substantially more than the center booster is! this causes a string of failures that can cause unexpected damage in unexpected parts of the ship, which reorients the structure, which makes it behave unpredictably. Instead, you want your side boosters pushing the central booster, which in turn pushes the payload. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you want to strut parts IN LINE together, and you want to use standoffs and such, but you don\u0027t want to just strut willy nilly.

At the top of the central booster, put a ring of structural standoffs (octahedral struts or girders) and use those to strut higher up the payload. I like to put them on the booster and on the separator.
