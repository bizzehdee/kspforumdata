A recent Manley video on MCE got me interested in KSP again. I see there have been a lot of improvements. The best one is that \u0022moar struts\u0022 are no longer needed. I\u0027m glad spacecraft parts counts no longer require struts to be half the count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, back in August, aerodynamics did not matter. Fairings, such as Procedural Fairings, and such were purely cosmetic. Has that changed? Do fairings help? Do they make the craft more aerodynamic to burn less fuel?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-19T00:02:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2014 12:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Apollo13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-18T23:12:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENope, aerodynamics hasn\u0027t changed yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnless you install mods for it offcourse.
