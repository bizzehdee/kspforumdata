I\u0027m Flyinpenguin117. I\u0027ve been playing Kerbal Space Program for a few months now, after my friend showed it to me in January (I\u0027m now better than him at it, much to his chagrin). I overthink names fairly often. I\u0027m currently undergoing the Iroas Project, a series of rockets where I put an unmanned utility vehicle- like a fuel tank, lander, or rover- in orbit and dock with a command unit, like the Ares rockets (Ares being the Greek god of war, Iroas being the God of Victory from Magic: The Gathering). There\u0027s also the Odyssey lines (starting-technology rockets) and the HAMR (Huge-\\*\\*\\* Moon Rocket), one of few successful endeavors in the Giant Waste of Money Initiative, a series of craft that are over-the-top and horribly inefficient, but fun to build anyways. I\u0027m hardly the most visionary person, but I have fun in the game.\n\nEDIT: Now that I\u0027ve been here more than 5 minutes, I feel horribly inadequate...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-31T21:00:00Z\u0022 title=\u002203/31/2015 09:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Flyinpenguin117**"},{"CreatedByName":"Engineer of Stuff","CreatedById":106757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T21:00:17Z","Content":"Welcome aboard!
