So setting a maneuver node usually doesn\u0027t work right away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what was casually said above about \u0022sync up with\u0022 the other craft is the tricky part. The one vastly important thing you need to understand is that low orbits take less time than higher orbits. So if the derelict is below you, then they will be catching up to you from behind a little bit with every orbit. You can enhance this effect by burning prograde and raising your orbit even higher. That will make your orbits take even longer, and the derelict will catch up a bigger angle with each orbit. And then you wait. You can be extreme about this, and raise your orbit\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ereally\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ehigh -- but that will cause you a lot of problems for the final intercept. The time to make your maneuver node is on the orbit when you know that the victim\u0027s ship is going to be passing you. So you have to keep track of how fast they are catching up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zophos","CreatedById":151234,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-25T13:33:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst (because I don\u0027t think anyone has answered this part of your question): Yes, you will be able to EVA the stranded Kerbal across to your rescue ship. In fact, you can\u0027t generally \u003Cem\u003Edock\u003C/em\u003E with the stranded parts because they don\u0027t come equipped with docking ports.\u00A0 When you get the grabber, you can grab those parts if you really want to avoid EVA.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the rendezvous, there are a few points worth mentioning, some of which have already been addressed:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you put yourself in a lower orbit than the target, you will \u0022gain\u0022 on it (travel a larger angle in a given time). A higher orbit is the opposite.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe larger the difference in altitude, the faster your angle will change relative to the target.\u003Cem\u003E \u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EEither way will work\u003C/em\u003E; if you are close behind your target and in a higher orbit, it will get farther and farther ahead, until eventually it is coming up behind you. Of course, this may take a few orbits.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCrossing the target\u0027s orbit (altitude) is inefficient, as you will spend part of the orbit gaining and part losing relative to the target. So pick one.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf the target is in a low orbit, you have much more maneuvering room if you pick a higher orbit and let it gain on you.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nWith all that in mind, what I usually do is launch to a circular orbit at about the altitude of the target\u0027s apoapsis. Then, \u003Cem\u003Eat\u003C/em\u003E that apoapsis (wherever it falls on my orbit), I will burn prograde to raise my apoapsis some way above the target\u0027s orbit.\u00A0 This puts me in an elliptical orbit higher than the target, so my orbit will take longer than the target\u0027s (it will gain on me). Moreover, my periapsis is at the same point as the target\u0027s apoapsis, \u003Cem\u003Eand it will stay that way\u003C/em\u003E as long as I burn only at my periapsis (raising or lowering my apoapsis).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy goal at that point is just to make sure I hit periapsis at the same time the target hits apoapsis.\u00A0 Generally, only a handful of orbits is needed to get one where the target will be relatively close behind me at the meeting point --- specifically, where it would be ahead of me on the next orbit if I don\u0027t do anything. At that point, I burn retrograde at periapsis to lower my apoapsis; not all the way to match orbits, but just enough to let the target catch up to an extremely close encounter at the next meeting. Finally, at the encounter, a second retrograde burn matches orbits (lowering my apoapsis to match the target\u0027s periapsis).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can apply the same ideas whether you choose to meet at the apoapsis or periapsis of the target\u0027s orbit. But by staying strictly above the target, you will never hit atmosphere as you\u0027ve described.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are also more sophisticated techniques in which you enter a circular \u0022phasing orbit\u0022 and then do a Hohmann transfer to the target at the right point. They are more efficient in some cases, but they involve more burns and more calculation.\u00A0 The technique described above can be done entirely on the screen with maneuver nodes and your eyeball.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Champ","CreatedById":96425,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-25T14:31:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nof course, if you are in career, you must have upgraded
