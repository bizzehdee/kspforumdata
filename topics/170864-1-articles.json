Ivanovich\u0027s\u00A0\u003Cem\u003ESalyut, the First Space Station:\u00A0 Triumph and Tragedy \u003C/em\u003E(Chichester, UK:\u00A0 Springer, 2008,\u00A0 426 pp.) and I\u0027d like to say that it\u0027s really well-done.\u00A0 I haven\u0027t ever seen as in-depth a look at Salyut (specifically the first one, although it does cover the development of the first few DOS stations) before this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt also goes into far more detail on the Soyuz 11 accident than I\u0027ve seen elsewhere, and spreads the blame around a little farther than most treatments.\u00A0 To wit:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\n- The installation and operation\u00A0of the air vents was different than previous spacecraft, and the change was not reflected in the documentation.\u00A0 Fault:\u00A0 manufacturing and documentation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\n- The vent itself was faulty through poor installation.\u00A0 Fault:\u00A0 manufacturing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\n- The crew, having been substituted almost at the eleventh hour, was not as thoroughly trained as they might have been.\u00A0 Fault:\u00A0 administration and training.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\n- Interestingly, Alexei Leonov (who had been the originally intended commander of the crew) is recorded as saying that he had recommended a different procedure to the crew regarding the vents than had been stated by the documentation.\u00A0 The vents were of a double-valve construction with an automatic outer vent and a manual inner vent; the documentation stated that one manual vent should be set to \u0022closed\u0022 and one to \u0022open\u0022 (this one would be solely controlled automatically by the outer vent).\u00A0 Leonov said that he had told Dobrovolskiy to ignore the documentation and manually close both vents.\u00A0 While it\u0027s possible that this is after-the-fact from Leonov, it seems likely that Dobrovolskiy was reluctant to contravene the printed documentation (although that documentation was, unknown to him, outdated and incorrect).\u00A0 Fault:\u00A0 possibly the crew commander\u0027s, although understandable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\n- The flight controllers had also not been informed about the failure to update the documentation, and were therefore going off of incorrect/outdated procedures when they rehearsed them with the cosmonauts.\u00A0 Fault:\u00A0 documentation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\n- The manual vents could not be reached from the cosmonauts\u0027 seated positions.\u00A0 Fault:\u00A0 design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\n- Most obviously, the lack of pressure suits.\u00A0 Fault:\u00A0 a wide swath of the designers and administration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\n- Chief Designer Mishin was widely panned for insisting that the crew could have \u0022put a finger\u0022 or thumb over the vent.\u00A0 This is usually construed to mean that the finger would have to be there through the entire descent, which is obviously ridiculous, but Ivanovich points out that it\u0027s not so far-fetched in the sense that a finger could have\u00A0\u003Cu\u003Etemporarily\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0blocked the vent while it was being manually closed. *\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seems pretty clear that this was, much as the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EChallenger\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0accident would be fifteen years later, largely the result of a space-program-wide culture of rushing and lack of proper attention to details.\u00A0 At least, it can be said that the Soviets/Russians did learn from the mistake; they have lost no more cosmonauts in flight since Soyuz 11.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe book is highly recommended and interesting.\u00A0 \u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n___________________________\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Elaborating:\u00A0 The crew probably did not have time to think of this.\u00A0 From the most logical reconstruction of what happened, the first thought would have been to inspect the forward hatch, which had caused some trouble earlier and was already suspect.\u00A0 Upon discovering it was not the hatch, the radios seem to have been turned off to limit the noise in the capsule to help locate the leak, and, because of the faulty documentation, the crew\u0027s attention would most likely have been directed toward the wrong vent at first.\u00A0 \u00A0The fact that they did locate the problem and managed to at least get a small start on solving it is a testament to how fast they processed all this, even in a very limited time of useful consciousness and after at least two misdirections.\u00A0 \u00A0(Therefore, any blaming of the crew is really a fool\u0027s errand...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-02-13T15:10:54Z\u0022 title=\u002202/13/2018 03:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 13, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by MaxwellsDemon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
