I love how they humanized the astronauts in the Apollo 12 mission. I feel it allowed for people to relate to astronauts rather than think of them as these nonhuman heroes, like George Washington. Moreover people probably dont know an astronaut if they didn\u0027t have their suit on. Even if I showed an average American a picture of Neil Armstrong in training, they wouldn\u0027t know it was him!!
