When I started a RADAR Scan, it caused parts of my interface to disappear (namely the Kerbal Alarm Clock window), but also caused the pause screen to disappear. (I press escape and the game pauses, but the pause screen doesn\u0027t actually appear). I assume that the SCANsat interface is supposed to appear when I start a RADAR Scan, but that isn\u0027t happening either. Any suggestions would be quite welcome. Thanks. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sharpspoonful","CreatedById":83734,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T02:31:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry making a game with only KAC and SCANsat and see if it happens again.
