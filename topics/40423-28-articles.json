Once I have my zipfiles sorted, I convert all non-zip files (the occasional .rar, for example) into zipfiles for my own personal convenience, and I insert dummy .txt files into each GameData subfolder within those zipfiles. The dummy .txt files are named after the mod, which I use as tracers. That way, I can keep track of how many mods write or overwrite to a particular GameData subfolder (for example, lots of mods use firespitter.dll.) This allows me to make sure I have the latest .dll\u0027s for all mods, and it also makes it easier to uninstall individual mods -- before deleting a GameData subfolder, I look at the .txt files within it, and if there are multiple copies, I note those mods to reinstall / recopy, so that uninstalling any particular mod doesn\u0027t result in disabling others that I may wish to keep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of the above allows me to sort and prioritize mods based on intended career savefile use and, potentially, memory footprint.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Miro Beero","CreatedById":67935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-23T06:39:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t quite figure out something about this mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I rotate the ship so the little thingy-ma-bober is 90 degrees on the top in the middle of the screen, and I also have the big target in the middle of the crosshairs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do I know if I push the \u0022J\u0022 key with monopropellant, if I will be flying left or right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I got a docking port, I use to make sure I rotate my ship relative to the orbital body and make sure that the sky matches the sky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find myself with the docking port flying by constantly as I cant seem to figure out which way to \u0027push\u0027 with JKLI buttons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this makes sense.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-23T06:48:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Miro Beero\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Miro Beero\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow do I know if I push the \u0022J\u0022 key with monopropellant, if I will be flying left or right?\u003Cp\u003EI find myself with the docking port flying by constantly as I cant seem to figure out which way to \u0027push\u0027 with JKLI buttons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo slow and watch what happens.
