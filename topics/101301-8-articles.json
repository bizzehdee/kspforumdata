All was going great. Then I reached the level to get a dam. Immediately dammed up a local river where I was getting water and pumping in sewage. Well then the bad things happened. The water level downstream dropped to the point were the river was severed in half causing the current to stop. The water level fluctuated making water sporadically stop flowing. Then the sewage backed into the water pump. This basically caused a plague. This is when I saw a problem was occurring. People were dying in droves as well as leaving the city. I destroyed my new dam but my city fell deeply into debt from the lack of people. Entire districts were abandoned. The tidal wave of water flushed away the sewage and now my city is bouncing back from that catastrophe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T18:55:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ikaneko\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ikaneko\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThanks!!
