Like the rules about the speed of light? For example, as a spacecraft approaches 300,000 km/s, its mass could approach \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00BE, making it impossible to reach the speed of light. And there could be redshifts and blueshifts as things like spacecraft, planets and asteroids moved together and apart at really high speeds. And I\u0027m sure other quantum physics could be applied as well, like maybe using particle accelerators as a form of thrust. I think this would be an incredibly interesting challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Canopus","CreatedById":57774,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T21:39:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat would that add to the game though?

It\u0027s impossible for a stock craft to reach anywhere remotely close to speeds where relativistic effects are significant without cheating/glitching, it\u0027s extremely challenging (and dull) to get a vessel up to 0.01% of lightspeed.

This effect was measured in the Apollo missions and even in high-altitude atmospheric ships. Basically, for the game to be correct time has to move at different rates for all ships depending on which SOI they\u0027re in. For a ship on a long trajectory to Jool, time experienced by those Kerbals would differ from time experienced at KSC by... well... several seconds, maybe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, let\u0027s just fix the fairings and the wheels first.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T05:34:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kaos\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kaos\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EQuantum mechanics has nothing to do with speed of light.
