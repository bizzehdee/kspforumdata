I use the previous stage to line everything up, I really don\\\u0027t need the vectoring. The real key with this was the landing craft. What started as a joke ended up being a really densely weighted dart, surprisingly good for this challenge. Unfortunately, it lags the hell out of my game, and it would be utterly uncontrollable at ~1fps without mechjeb. Also, real Jeb was on board, so it couldn\\\u0027t possibly go wrong.
