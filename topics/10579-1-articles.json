Increasing the energy seems a more interesting challenge to me, but I\\\u0027m not sure how well the physics in KSP work with that goal (I\\\u0027m guessing the answer would always be to drain all your fuel for a heavy impact). It means that maltesh\\\u0027s entry, while having a momentum less than 1/3 of mine, has an energy of 0.066 kilotons, damn near 2/3 of mine, due to the high velocity. The momentum challenge does certainly seem to favour the heavier crafts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELifted from wikipedia are two relevant equations;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/math/4/1/4/4140f53f66a68e92afec2389ba289e25.png\u0022 alt=\u00224140f53f66a68e92afec2389ba289e25.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/math/1/e/8/1e8440b3262d1866bf61293634e00f19.png\u0022 alt=\u00221e8440b3262d1866bf61293634e00f19.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere Ek is the kinetic energy in \u003Cstrong\u003Ejoules\u003C/strong\u003E, m is mass in \u003Cstrong\u003Ekilograms\u003C/strong\u003E, v is velocity in \u003Cstrong\u003Emetres per second\u003C/strong\u003E and p is your momentum in \u003Cstrong\u003Ekgms-1\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn our case when inputting our momentum into the second equation remember to convert from tons/ms-1 to \u003Cstrong\u003Ekg\u003C/strong\u003Ems-1.
