However, as I make larger designs with lower-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E upper stages (still a good bit above the 0.4 I\u0027ve seen cited as a lower limit), it tends to behave oddly, often resulting in not being able to reach orbit (80km) without several hundred extra m/s of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E beyond the commonly-used 3400. One common example of this odd behavior is the rocket entering a coast phase, then moments after starting the final burn, recalculating its profile and pitching up or down nearly 90 degrees while the calculated burn time jumps well beyond what it was listed as during the coast phase.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAny possible reasons why this is occurring? I\u0027ll post some screenshots of various rocket designs - as well as MechJeb settings - once I\u0027m able to get them; in the meantime, are there any fairly common mistakes w/r/t \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E autopilot, perhaps in terms of its settings/parameters?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-12T09:52:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019m not a fan of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E\u2019s auto ascent for this reason.
