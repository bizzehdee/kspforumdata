Since that is no longer possible, i have ahd to use regular decouplers, and to make up for it I needed half a tank more fuel. The new craft is called \u0027The Bare Minimun II\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce on the surface of the Mun, a lot of tricky dancing is required to get the craft pointing upwards for the burn. Another interesting note about this mission was that for the return I burned vaguely in the same direction as the mun, thus increasing my Kerbin apoapsis. Then I burned retrograde at apoapsis to bring my periapsis to 30k for re-entry. I believe this is called a bi-elliptic transfer, and can be more efficient than a Hohmann type transfer. I had enough fuel left to perform my classic landing where the tanks and engine is deliberately crushed in order to slow down the capsule enough to survive intact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: You don\\\u0027t actually need that extra half tank in the core stage, I managed it with just 3 tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
