One or two mod developers have already heard specific comments, sent direct. I have puzzled out a couple of things, but some of you guys can be more than a bit obscure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I thought I\u0027d try to make some helpful suggestions, rather than just ranting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Building in help features is a good thing. But remember that the new user may not be starting quite where you expect. For an example of where this can be a needless puzzle, got look at the Wiki page at \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Subassembly\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Subassembly\u003C/a\u003E Ask yourself this. How do I make and store a sub-assembly? I had to do a lot of digging, in a maze of twisted forum posts, all alike, before I found a mention that you needed Advanced Mode. I eventually found that: click on the icon at the top-left of the VAB screen, an extra row vertical of icons appears at the left, and one of these switches to the sub-assembly mode. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: When you have a Mod pack with a large number of parts, a list is helpful. Plain text is good, with the part-categories. Some part details are more useful than others. For a fuel tank, diameter and capacity. It\u0027s worth knowing the thrust of an engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: For the more complicated items, has some key detail been missed? Be careful of revisions. There is one useful utility that does one job in two distinct steps. There\u0027s a primary window, and you have to use sub-window A to get to the target planet, before the useful semi-cheat in sub-window B. There was a helpfile in an earlier version, and I was able to read the source, and this was mentioned. It isn\u0027t in the current system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: It\u0027s probably useful for you as an author too: include a readme.txt file which details what the Mod does. Include which KSP version it is made for. Some Mods have dependencies. List them. Sometimes a Mod might not depend on a particular item but you won\u0027t get the full effect without it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACyou can do things with the Tech Tree, but Rockomax-sized boosters need Rockomax-sized tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENone of this needs great literature. But. as with so much else in the world, the bottom 10% can be really bad, and not difficult to fix. I have seen a few related things in part.cfg files, such as description texts with a spelling error, and a decoupler labelled with the wrong size. That sort of error is why even professional authors have to deal with copy-editors. Believe me, you can be uncannily blind to your own errors. \u0022Just Read The Instructions\u0022 is a great name for a ship to land rockets on, but somebody had to write the instructions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T18:42:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree with everything above. But its hard enough just to get people to standardize the title of their mod relese threads...ie should have the current version of KSP supported, latest date of the release, and a clear, concise name of the mod. For example some mod names are one thing in the thread title, called another name in the thread, and then the name of the .zip file is something different, sometimes with \u0022_\u0022 or other non-standard characters, and no version number...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHEN, add in, some people still dont follow the \u0022standard\u0022 folder structure...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelhester07","CreatedById":96470,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T19:30:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m guilty of the folder inside not matching the zip or the mod name. I\u0027ve started using my own \u0022company\u0022 folder though. I do try to keep a catalog of parts and the mod description documents most of what you need to know.
