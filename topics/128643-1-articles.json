I use OBS to record in HD and use it for many games but the issue I am having with KSP is when I record it gives me nothing but a black screen. I was wondering if anyone here might have a solution to that. I am unsure what is causing it or why. Thanks.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"billy bob","CreatedById":155892,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-26T02:23:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntry turning off HD if you can\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
