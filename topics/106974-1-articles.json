One of the most frustrating things would be using the coordinate system to lay out the nodes as opposed to a visual editor. Wouldn\u0027t I have to stick a node at (-1519,1355) for example in the cfg and then boot the game to check where it is? Doing that with 50-100 nodes would be a huge pain. And that\u0027s before you get to moving around the 500\u002B stock and mod parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there another option?
