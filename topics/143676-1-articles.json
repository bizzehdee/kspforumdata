This is good. May I suggest a second sticky that adds some hints on \u0027how to help console players\u0027?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost (all?) of the experienced KSP players in this forum have been playing on computers with keyboards, mice, joysticks, and an OS that allows them a lot of freedom and flexibility in doing things to edit/change/enhance the game, including modding. This community is very good at offering advice of all sorts based on this, from the quick tips to in depth analysis and solutions... but a lot of it could be unusable for console players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsole players may not have the option to \u0027press mod-F5, you know, on your keyboard\u0027 for a named quicksave, or \u0027rightclick to open the part menu\u0027, or \u0027install \u0026lt;fav mod XYZ\u0026gt; to get a read-out\u0027, or \u0027check the log for errors\u0027. I for one have none of the consoles, and have zero idea if any of these things even have an alternative on consoles, let alone which one that is. I may know the answer to a question or how to solve a problem, but without knowing what can or cannot be offered, or what the standard console controls are replacing the keyboard and mouse buttons, anything I write may be next to useless and probably only frustrating to the console player.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo... maybe a post can be compiled and stickied that lists\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nthings NOT to suggest to console players, because they don\u0027t have those options (mods? pressing keys? clicking mice? etc),\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nthings not to ask of console players (can console players \u0027provide logs\u0027 - stated as a requirement sometimes),\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\na table of controls \u0027translations\u0027 for common things, like what replaces the left and rightclicks, or the most common keys, or even UI element differences,\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nanything else that can be foreseen to cause confusion when a PC player tries to help out a console player.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI think having something like that stickied up will help avoid confusion and frustration, promote cross-platform assistance, and generally help the console players to benefit from the existing experience and helpfulness of the community.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-13T10:06:23Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2016 10:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by swjr-swis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eugh many typing errors, from late night posting comes\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-15T18:23:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore we can get to the point of knowing what console players \u003Cstrong\u003Ecan\u0027t\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0do (and therefore shouldn\u0027t be asked to do), I think we need to know what console players\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eare\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0capable of doing, if they are already experts at the game.

And the same with screenshots, and craft files, and\u00A0logfiles, and context menus, and key translations, and setting up USB mice, etc. The list of what not to ask about depends on that one key console player who has figured out a way to actually do something. From what I\u0027ve read so far, external USB keyboards and mice are not currently supported, and mods are not supported .... unless someone really clever figures out how to do it.
