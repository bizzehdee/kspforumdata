It\u0027s mission was to deploy and test the MEM Lab, a modified MEM lander that houses several experiments and equipment to survey Kerbin from space. It also functioned as a test for the upcomming Munar Polar Survey mission. It was the first Odin mission that entered a polar orbit around Kerbin and only the second launch of a two stage Sleipnir V. The mission was crewed by Commander Ronald E. Kerman, Flight Engineer Judith Kerman and Mission Specialist Charles M. Kerman.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe booster launched just before dawn from the KSC. As it roared into the sky it turned south to enter a polar orbit while staying over water as long a possible. The Sleipnir V worked flawlessly and once the spacecraft had jettisoned it\u0027s shroud and entered a circular orbit the crew prepared for the MEM Lab extraction maneuver. The CSM separated from the remaining craft, turned around an docked to the MEM Lab. Extraction was a delicate maneuver, making sure that the survey scanner does not get damaged.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith everything set up, Judith and Charles entered the MEM Lab and started to boot up and check it\u0027s systems. The survey scanner could soon be deployed and get to work. During the following days the crew surveyed the complete surface of Kerbin and completed dozens of experiments. Judith performed an EVA to collect a few experiments from the outside of the MEM Lab that were supposed to come back to Kerbin with the kerbonauts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter 15 days in space the crew fired up the SPS to put the spacecraft on a reentry trajectory. They then undocked the MEM Lab and separated the service module and soon were engulfed by the hot plasma of reentry. At an altitude of 5 kilometer Odin 18\u0027s parachutes deployed and the capsule splashed down safely a few minutes later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-30T17:41:00Z\u0022 title=\u002211/30/2015 05:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Xeldrak\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharkman Briton","CreatedById":148040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-31T21:49:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENoice...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlbum: \u0022safely back hocke\u0022 Might wanna fix that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xeldrak","CreatedById":57228,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-31T21:57:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethanks - should be fixed \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xeldrak","CreatedById":57228,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-03T23:22:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/OprTV/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first launch of a fully fledged Sleipnir V since Odin 17, the seventeenth crewed launch of the Odin program and the first all female mission: Odin 19. The crew consisted of veteran Commander Valentina Kerman and the two rookies, Flight Engineer Kathryn and Mission Specialist Sally Kerman.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Sleipnir V that lifted the crew into orbit launched just after sunrise. After the nominal one minute and forty seconds the first stage separated and the S-II stage took over and carried Odin 19 into LKO. Once in in space the crew jettisoned the shroud, as it was now superfluous weight. After half an hour of system checks the craft was ready and in position to fire the S-IVB stage and travel to the Mun. The burn went as planned and another 10 minutes later the CSM separated from the remaining stack, turned around an docked with the MEM Lab. Extraction was once again a delicate procedure that was nonetheless performed perfectly. Once there was enough room between the spacecraft and the spent rocket stage the crew took care of some snacks and decided to take a nap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnly a single, small course correction was necessary after Odin 19 had entered the Mun\u0027s sphere of influence. Once on their closest point to the Mun, past it\u0027s north pole, the crew fired up the SPS and the spacecraft entered a polar orbit. After some more snacks Sally and Kathryn entered the MEM Lab and put it into action. The main experiment, the huge survey scanner was deployed and started to examine the munar surface. Many more experiments were performed during the course of the mission. Odin 19 stayed in munar orbit for 14 days, more than enough time to survey the complete surface of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce their time was up, Valentina lowered the spacecrafts periapsis enough so that the MEM Lab would crash into the munar surface while the SPS fired one more to put the craft on their way back home. With all their experiments completed, the crew once again tended to snacks and naps during the return trip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust before entering Kerbin atmosphere the SM was separated and the crew prepared for reentry. Thanks to the heat shield the crew survived the trip through the upper regions of the atmosphere without any bruises. Once slow enough the parachutes were deployed and the capsule splashed down safely soon after, 15 days, 3 hours and 15 minutes after launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-30T17:41:31Z\u0022 title=\u002211/30/2015 05:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Xeldrak\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xeldrak","CreatedById":57228,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-08T00:57:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/xK12N/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Bifrost Communications systems consists of four satellites that orbit the Mun in a semi-synchronous orbit, allowing future Odin missions to land on\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe\u00A0far side of the Mun. It was launched on a Naglfar-Logi rocket, a tried and tested booster that was also used during the Seer program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuring the ascend the booster worked flawlessly. One minute, fifty seconds into the flight the two outer engines were dropped, leaving only the sustainer engine. About 3 minutes into the flight the first stage was burnt out and to Logi stage took over. Unlike an Odin mission, the rocket did not enter LKO first, but it burns directly for the Mun. Once on the intended trajectory the shroud was jettisoned and the solar panels extended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a one day trip to the Mun the Logi stage was fired a second time to enter into a highly elliptical munar orbit. Every time the satellite reached it\u0027s 1789km apoapsis one of the sub-satellites were released. The sub-satellites then circularized their orbits using their own propulsion system. This phase of the mission took seven tense days. In the end there was a small miscalculation, so the deployment of the satellites is not perfect but it will suffice. The road to missions to the far side of the Mun is paved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce all satellites were deployed the Logi stage fired a final time to make sure that it crashes into the Mun.

This mission marks the seventh landing on the Mun. It is the second visit to the munar surface for CDR \u00A0Eugene A. Kerman and MMP \u00A0Charles M. Kerman, Jr. aswell as the second time in munar orbit for CMP Judith Kerman. Also Odin 20 is the first mission to the far side of the Mun.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe mighty Sleipnir V lifted launched in the early morning hours at the KSC. The ascend proceeded as planned, with the giant booster working reliably as ever. After jettisoning the S-I stage and the Launch Escape System (LES) the second stage pushed Odin 20 into space, where it fired a second time to enter a circular orbit. Once the now spent S-II stage and the shroud were jettisoned the crew spent some time on system checks before heading to the Mun.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Trans-Munar Injection (TMI) worked as planned, with the S-IVB stage spending most of it\u0027s fuel. Odin 20 was now on a free-return trajectory to the Mun. Command Module Pilot Judith Kerman undocked the CSM from the remaining stack, turned it by 180\u00B0 and docked it with the MEM. Using the RCS she then slowly pulled the MEM away from the S-IV stage.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith all crucial tasks performed the crew now had some time for a nap and some snacks.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne day and 28 minutes into the flight Odin 20 fired up the Service Propulsion System (SPS) to enter a munar orbit. As usual this maneuver occured behind the Mun, so Mission Control was once again biting it\u0027s nails during the event. However the burn went exactly as planned and tensions eased at the KSC once Odin 20 reappeared from behind the Mun.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow in munar orbit, the crew prepared for the descend on Eugene and Charles. The entered the MEM and ran a full systems check. The spacecraft seemed to be worked perfectly. So they could undock just an hour after reaching the munar orbit.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter suffering from a lack of fuel on earlier missions the MEM was outfitted with four small drop tank that provide a bigger safety margin on the approach to the landing zone. About three minutes before landing these tanks were separated and Eugene guided the MEM right to the landing zone, where it touched down safely.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter securing the vehicle, Charles and Eugene decided against taking a nap and instead donned their space suits for EVA1.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOnce outside the MEM the two kerbonauts planted their Flag next to the craft and proceeded to deploy the Munar Roving Vehicle (MRV) and the Odin Munar Surface Experiments Packages (OMSEPS). The MRV was also improved since it\u0027s last visit to the Mun. It now has more fuel and more batteries, allowing a bigger operating range aswell as needing fewer stops to recharge it\u0027s batteries. An emergency solar panel will also prevent the Kerbonauts from having to abandon the MRV along with precious samples, as it happened on Odin 16. After making sure that the MRV had deployed correctly Charles and Eugene set up the OMSEPs to their target location close to the Kolmogorov crater.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBack at the MEM the two kerbonauts mounted the MRV and took it for it\u0027s first ride on the munar surface. They headed past the OMSEPs right into the Kolmogorov crater where they collected several samples before continuing into the Lusin Valley. During the 800 meter descent to the bottom of the valley that damaged one of the MRV wheels Charles went out to collect some samples while Eugene took care of the rover.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSome of the eggheads at mission control decided that it was time to return to the MEM, as some of the MRV hardware was not thoroughly tried and tested yet. So the two kerbonauts headed back out of the valley. Charles used a stop to recharge the MRV batteries to collect a few more samples. Once out of the valley Eugene drove along the ridge of Kolmogorov, where some interesting samples were suspected.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBack at the MEM Charles and Eugene transferred all collected samples into the spacecraft and once all were bagged and labeled it was time for some snack and a good long nap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/6LiCc/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sylandro","CreatedById":80729,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-16T00:52:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat?
