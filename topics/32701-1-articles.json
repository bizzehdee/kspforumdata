I believe that, despite what the engineer says, it has enough dv to achieve orbit. However, between 10 and 12km, it begins to spin about its lateral axis. I already know about flame outs, so I\u0027m cutting my jets with about 0.50 intake air and continuing on rockets. Is this a design issue, a bug of some sort, or is it impossible to build an SSTO while using FAR? Please see the attached pictures for more information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/K3e0pdJ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022K3e0pdJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CT32VOC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022CT32VOC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3srnTm2.png\u0022 alt=\u00223srnTm2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WPJitVn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022WPJitVn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I know the decouplers prevent it from being a true SSTO. Those are used to ditch the spent SRBs/ RATOs which have a parachute attached to them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
