Better contracts. Let\u0027s be honest, contracts in career mode are really bad. They are extremely repetitive and (mostly) boring (i.e. \u0022Take a temperature reading at \u0027X\u0027\u0022 or \u0022Test part\u00A0\u0027Y\u0027\u0022). Some missions can be exciting (saving kerbals from orbit, or landing on the moon, etc) but many are boring. Please improve with more variation. Also, they\u0027re reward system is unbalanced as heck. Some may require you to fly a rusty plane half way around the world to make an EVA report for about 5000 funds (okay, maybe that\u0027s a slight exaggeration, but you get my point).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Better goals. Most goals in KSP are kinda pointless. You put a satellite into orbit, and\u00A0you collect science. But after that point, whoopdy doo. I only ever send satellites up to collect science once, and then that\u0027s it. After that point, they\u0027re space debris. I feel that more uses should come from satellites and space stations etc. rather than \u0022one time\u0022 things (such as\u00A0long term science experiments or GPS, or other things that could actually help your space program). The mobile processing lab is the only one I can think of that fits into that category currently, and even that\u0027s\u00A0huge, clumsy and something you don\u0027t get until much later into the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Wheels. The plane wheels in KSP are, all things being considered, horrible. They only extend one way (down) and you can only place them on the wings or on a long body (which is okay, until you make planes with different wing or body structure. Then after that point, you have to fine tune the wheel position so it doesn\u0027t crash and burn off the runway,\u00A0which is quite tedious). I would like wheels like the\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/LY-01_Fixed_Landing_Gear\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELY-01 Fixed Landing Gear\u003C/a\u003E, but mechanical. Or adjustable height/length. That would be great.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Better rover wheels. For rover wheels, they are extremely delicate, and they\u0027re breaking mechanism is frustrating and awful. For some reason, when you go to fast or break a wheel, the wheel stops so hard and suddenly that it flips your vehicle over. Broken wheels have never done this. They should just bust up and make your rover lean and tend to stray left/right (depending on which wheel is broken) when it busts a wheel, or even increase a bit of drag. Not have a spastic tizzy fit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Communication and exploration. Currently, there is little reason to explore other planets. If you want the full Eve\u00A0experience, take a snapshot of Kerbin and apply a purple filter. That\u0027s it. The only mildly interesting planet is Jool, and you cant even land on it. Furthermore, there is no reason to explore anything ever. You see and know each planet from the start. You get no surprises at all when you actually get there. Furthermore, there is nothing to do on the planets either (you run into the same problem as point 2).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. Engineers. Engineers are almost completely useless.
