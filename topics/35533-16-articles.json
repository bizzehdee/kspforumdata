So this is about the problem where a welded part will snap to a node, but then turns red and will not attach. I finally got it to work!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike UbioZur said, it\u0027s due to too many nodes causing a conflict. I took his advice and edited the part file. In there I found two pages of nodes that I did not know were even present! (I had thought they were occupied, but I was wrong about that.) Deleting them cured the attachment problem. Building a launcher for the massive thing is my challenge now! Pics once I make it work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s what I did to delete the correct nodes. The ones I wanted to keep were at the center, at the top and bottom. So they were the only ones with very tiny numbers in the X and Y axes. They look like 7.89234E-7. That E-7 is what I looked for; it is scientific notation to represent a very small number. (In this example, 0.000000789234.) In other words, the X and Y are practically zero. So I avoided those two nodes and deleted all the others. This way is not very precise, but for \u0022quick and dirty\u0022 it worked the first time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother more precise way would be to find the ID numbers of the parts you want to attach to, temporarily mark nodes that attach to those ID numbers, delete all the others, then remove your temporary marks. I know it sounds tedious, but it took much less time than I had spent trying to get the part to work other ways! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T19:45:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022firefrog\u0022 data-cite=\u0022firefrog\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn an completely unmodded .22 version of KSP, I can weld parts and it says they are \u0022saved and shipped\u0022, but they do not appear in the items list.

Happens even with a simple thing like two orange tanks. Additionally (which would be not much of a problem, but still annoying) the assembly I\u0027ve welded disappears with the \u0022crumbling paper\u0022-delete-sound.

It\u0027s been a long work week! So this is about the problem where a welded part will snap to a node, but then turns red and will not attach. I finally got it to work!\u003Cp\u003ELike UbioZur said, it\u0027s due to too many nodes causing a conflict. I took his advice and edited the part file. In there I found two pages of nodes that I did not know were even present! (I had thought they were occupied, but I was wrong about that.) Deleting them cured the attachment problem. Building a launcher for the massive thing is my challenge now! Pics once I make it work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s what I did to delete the correct nodes. The ones I wanted to keep were at the center, at the top and bottom. So they were the only ones with very tiny numbers in the X and Y axes. They look like 7.89234E-7. That E-7 is what I looked for; it is scientific notation to represent a very small number. (In this example, 0.000000789234.) In other words, the X and Y are practically zero. So I avoided those two nodes and deleted all the others. This way is not very precise, but for \u0022quick and dirty\u0022 it worked the first time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother more precise way would be to find the ID numbers of the parts you want to attach to, temporarily mark nodes that attach to those ID numbers, delete all the others, then remove your temporary marks. I know it sounds tedious, but it took much less time than I had spent trying to get the part to work other ways! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood to know it works.
