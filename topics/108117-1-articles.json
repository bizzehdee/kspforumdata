It\u0027s a common misinterpretation of the law that has been spread just like the vague notions on what is, or is not, public domain (for instance, someone made a xenon octo-8 texture and public domained the mod... of course SQUAD still holds the rights to the original model which was included in the mod.)\n\n\u0022Works by the government\u0022 is very vague, if NASA fully designed the rocket, but then hired an artist to draw that, or used software that had a \u0022derivative works\u0022 license (take paper ksp models, the art is still copyrightable even though it is put together to create a derivative work), it isn\u0027t a \u0022work by the government\u0022 (not quite public domain). If NASA claims that the provided model is technical data, it again isn\u0027t a \u0022work by the government\u0022; we don\u0027t just let other governments enjoy the spoils of our research.\n\nThe whole thing is complicated; unless you\u0027re YouTube/Wikipedia/\u0022User Content Sites\u0022 and can ignore copyright laws because you use the umbrella tree to claim you cannot be held accountable for the massive lawbreaking of your users."}]}
