I know the basics of modeling and I roughly understand how to get my model into unity and put that model in-game. I can get it to show up and attach properly. I understand the general idea behind setting up part.cfg files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy issue is that after putting the model in game, the proportions are not the same as in blender or unity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://tinypic.com/r/34nip7n/5\u0022 alt=\u00225\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe model looks right in both blender and unity, but in game it\u0027s too wide. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there something that I\u0027m overlooking or doing incorrectly?

Make sure they\u0027re set to 1.0 to both if you want to come out at a 1x ratio to how you modeled it. From Blender you can hit ctrl\u002BA from Object mode and \u0027Apply Scale\u0022 to save any scaling you did while in Object mode down to the mesh, or zero it out to return to the original scale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also zero out the scales in Unity as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there is also the scaling you can do in a config file as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re using the stock \u0027model = model.mu\u0027 line near the top, then the only line that can apply scaling is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ErescaleFactor = 1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe default value for rescaleFactor is actually 1.25, which means your model will be 1.25x bigger than it is in Unity and Blender.

I actually tried playing with the scale settings you highlighted in blender beforehand, but changing the values just changed the model (I was unaware of the apply scale thing until now) I actually had the rescaleFactor line set to .25 just to get it to the size in the screen shot \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis works exactly as it should now though, thank you again!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould you happen to know of any in depth modding tutorials that are more or less current for this version of KSP? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel like it would be better if I had something to reference in case I get stuck on another issue rather than posting \u0022help me\u0022 on the forums each time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T06:32:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPretty much everything you\u0027ll need to know can be found by looking through the Modding Info Compilation: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/25013-Compilation-of-modding-information-links-for-0-19-20-21-22-Last-update-23rd-Nov\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/25013-Compilation-of-modding-information-links-for-0-19-20-21-22-Last-update-23rd-Nov\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if its not in there, there\u0027s nothing wrong with posting a topic about it, someone will help you \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"karriban","CreatedById":94607,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T06:42:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter checking that page I realized I already have it bookmarked along with a few other pages I found useful.
