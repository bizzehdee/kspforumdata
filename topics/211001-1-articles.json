It is possible to switch between LH2 and RP-1 mid-flight. At launch, RP-1 will be the fuel used, as its higher density only offers advantages for first stages. When RP-1 ends, it will burn hydrogen, being better for upper stages.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll this while\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eusing the exact same engine.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EThis offers obvious advantages for an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E. if the KS-325 has an extendable nozzle, this would probably be one of the best engines for an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E with chemical engines. However, it still has disadvantages...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rocket would have to be insanely tall to store all the Hydrogen, RP-1 and the insane amount of LOX it would need.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only new part that would need to be added would be the engine, since hydrogen tanks are already confirmed (Nerv and\u00A0 NERV-US will use them) and RP-1/LOX will obviously be added.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the most likely one that would be added to the game, considering there are multiple engines that already have mode switches (e.g Panther jet engine). and NERV-US operates in a very similar way,\u00A0 only needed changes will the fuels, performance and model of a NERV-US\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027, Times, serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003ESimultaneous burning\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically it\u0027s injecting a third fuel into the combustion chamber. The hydrogen-fluor-lithium engine mentioned at the beginning is this type of engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis type of motor can theoretically achieve very high efficiencies, but as theory is not reality, injecting room temperature solids or high temperature liquids is not exactly viable. And making an engine that injects two \u0022normal\u0022 fuels would have no advantage compared to sequential injection engines.\u00A0\u003Cspan\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThere are several other problems that will certainly not be simulated in KSP, such as how to maintain the necessary high temperature.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EOne suggestion of mine would be to use rubidium instead of lithium, which has a much lower melting point, only 39\u00B0C.

Things that difficult development should be avoided unless it\u0027s really worth it. That\u0027s why I suggest that only the engine that burns sequentially be added, since only one new engine would need to be added, and the \u0022programming\u0022 of this engine has already been done even in KSP1, with the RAPIER, so overall it would only need to be added a new model, and a change in resource used.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that\u0027s it, I\u0027ll probably write another thread about my ideas on the science \u0026amp; spaceflight topic, where I can write the scientific part (my favorite) more deeply.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003Eso yeah, see you guys later.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EAny criticism of this idea is welcome, I want to know my problems\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vortygont","CreatedById":223549,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-10T20:47:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like especially LH2-RP1-LOX engine, I believe it will fit in game like NERV-US.

Kerbais can stand right next to a rocket taking off and be 100% fine . Kerbals can withstand collisions at 20 m/s and just get up and continue the mission. One problem I\u0027ve noticed is that people think like human engineers, but kerbals are not humans. It would be a lot of fun to use such an engine. And I was planning to put pretty much everything you wrote about Hydrogen and Fluorine combustion and how it releases not so cool stuff. But like I said before, kerbals either die or they continue their mission as if nothing had happened. Think, why does the game let you put a kerbal in a chair for 90 years in space without any radiation protection or life support, and the kerbal doesn\u0027t show the slightest signs of health damage? Because its fun to do this. We are not talking about humans.

It sounds interesting, and easy to integrate with KSP as being similar to the RAPIER. But I\u0027m unsure whether they are adding more of the widely used fuel types to replace the generic \u0022liquid fuel,\u0022 which would be necessary to make this engine. Personally I think they should at least add methane/hydrogen/kerosene equivalents to add some variety to the standard fuels, and use the 3 main rocket fuels that were covered by Everyday Astronaut, but they appear to be reusing the KSP tank design which is bipropellant tanks with ratios to match the engine fuel ratios, which are all the same. Changing this would result in significant changes to a core mechanic of the lego rocket design style, but I think there are better methods, such as tanks with switchable resources. However this adds other complications that may be beyond the interest of the average player.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOverall there is a lot more to consider with adding this type of engine to the game. I know they are adding a few new fuel types like metallic hydrogen, but the current approach is that every engine with a new fuel type needs its own tanks with fuel ratios matching the engine, and this can quickly result in an overwhelming number of tanks. I\u0027m pretty sure they said no to switchable tanks at some point, so this engine may remain in mod territory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe different fuels have already been confirmed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe already know very well that Liquid Hydrogen will be present in the game from the beginning, since the Nerv engine will need it.\u00A0\u003Cspan\u003EThe Nerv-US engine I mentioned works because it uses hydrogen.

I dare say we will have oxygen only tanks as well, as engines like NERV-US will use them. Also we will have to separate \u0022Hydrolox\u0022 from\u00A0 \u0022Liquid Hydrogen\u0022 like SimpleRockets 2, because that would eliminate the problem of having to balance the fuel/oxidizer ratio.
