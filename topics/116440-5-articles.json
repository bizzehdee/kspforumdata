Especially without consent or hasn\u0027t been updated. I\u0027ve seen several mods on SpaceDock that I know for certain that hasn\u0027t been updated for the current build of the game. It just leads to more problems that fills the mod maker\u0027s thread with \u0022this doesn\u0027t work why was it on SpaceDock with the current build\u0022. CKAN is another story, because it gathers mods instead of being submitted. I don\u0027t use CKAN anymore, but I have used it and I can say it causes more problems than it solves. Unless you KNOW for certain the mods you are getting are the ones you\u0027ve been keeping track of on the forums.\n\nManually installing your mods, including this one, makes you read the instructions on the dependencies it needs in order to work. If you don\u0027t make mods, at least have the common knowledge to know how mods work so you can help other people who tend to not know how mods work."},{"CreatedByName":"nukeboyt","CreatedById":68397,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-02T22:56:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 5/1/2016 at 8:17 PM, ComatoseJedi said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Just a friendly reminder: This mod doesn\u0027t need updating since it\u0027s an IVA.

ASET stuff in particular uses custom assets, so even though the stock navball for RPM works for other craft it can have an issue with certain IVA\u0027s specifically. The mod author is around but these IVAs haven\u0027t been updated in a while so those custom pages have issues with certain elements, likely a mod that is trying to display incompatible graphic elements onto the custom navball. \n\nSo basically check your mod directory for anything that would touch the navball: Waypoint manager, docking alignment indicator, Enhanced Nav Ball, etc. Unfortunately once you find which it is you have to either live without it, wait for the IVA author to update the MFD pages or attempt to do so yourself. \n\ne. just saw this now myself, was being caused by the Ven Stock revamp\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-05T04:14:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2016 04:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Terrible Inclinations**"},{"CreatedByName":"alexustas","CreatedById":78632,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-05T05:34:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, ironhawx said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E navball itself is missing\n\u003E \n\nCopy (and replace) \u0022**NavBall000.dds**\u0022 from \u0022***\\GameData\\JSI\\RasterPropMonitor\\Library\\Components\\NavBall***\u0022 into \u0022***\\GameData\\ASET\\ASET\\_Props\\MFDs\\ALCORPFD***\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"ironhawx","CreatedById":141422,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-05T13:18:54Z","Content":"ya its working now don\u0027t ask me what happened, idk if mods got installed out of order or what, but i removed b9 set, launched game and navball was back, put b9 back in and navball still there, so go figure."},{"CreatedByName":"dlrk","CreatedById":60033,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-13T16:27:14Z","Content":"Is there a way to install the MFDs in a different pod?"},{"CreatedByName":"Guderina","CreatedById":164106,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-18T23:21:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 13/5/2016 at 6:27 PM, dlrk said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Is there a way to install the MFDs in a different pod?\n\u003E \n\nYou mean the displays of a pod RPM\u0027s ready?
