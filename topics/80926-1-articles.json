But here is an easy efficient way to get to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most important insight I found was to line up the periapsis of the incoming trajectory with the plane of Gilly\u0027s orbit. This means that the apoapsis after capture is also on the same plane, which means the plane change maneuver can be performed near apoapsis, greatly lowering the delta-v required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis technique should work for any moon, particularly when you\u0027re coming into a planet\u0027s SOI at a high inclination with respect to the moon\u0027s orbit (like Bop for example).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
