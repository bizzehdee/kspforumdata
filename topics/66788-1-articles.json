Planning to install an pair of solar panel on to an previously expended upper stage and use it to serve as an communication relay satelite.. instead of deorbit it and putting up a new satellite, since it has all the components it needs, but power source.. During the launch of the construction components along with an communication satellite, the rocket was misfired due to an configuration error then lost control due to over speed, overshot the orbit by 4000km.. and into an 4800km * 100km weird orbit..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the ship at the behind the huge satellite is the Orbital Maneuver Vehicle that is intended to move the components to the destination...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was shot after the component was acquired, the moment before separation..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-26T05:11:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it would look better without that ugly glowing green thing mussing up the shot.
