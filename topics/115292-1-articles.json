A couple of months ago (pre-1.0) I saw the old ODST Pod. It had a download.

But now we are in 1.0.4, can someone (Good at IVAs, Configs), try to fix this? In a youtube video I saw, it had a complete IVA, but I have searched through files and found that I do not know what I am doing. Can someone try to make this awesome again?\n\nThings it needs:\n\nA GOOD IVA\n\nAerodynamics, Ablator\n\n1.0.4 Compatibility\n\nFuncionality\n\nPreferably TAC and JSI support."},{"CreatedByName":"SuccinctLemon","CreatedById":147644,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T18:51:23Z","Content":"Considering no-one seems to be offering to help, can some people just post advice on what they think about it. I might start work on this, but have 3 weeks holiday and Royal Navy training ahead."},{"CreatedByName":"SSMI","CreatedById":146486,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T01:15:28Z","Content":"So. Actually I saw a youtube video with one earlier today. The made it using some air brakes and then two separations to do the final braking. After seeing this I google searched it and there were a ton of different videos with different ideas. I couldn\u0027t find the one I saw earlier but search for \u0022KSP ODST.\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"SuccinctLemon","CreatedById":147644,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T08:28:40Z","Content":"I mean the mod one, on Reddit. It was quite easy to find.\n\nI was thinking maybe kduffers might add a pod into his mod, but he has not annonced that.\n\nI know its fun to do it in stock, but this mod looked really good."}]}
