AGM integrates with the native action groups, which some people find desirable, especially if they want to share their craft files. Action Groups Extended supplants the native system with it\u0027s own. The advantages are you get more groups, but lose the ability to share the craft as \u0022stock\u0022 (or at least not with all the planned groups working).
