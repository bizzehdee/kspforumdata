After collecting science from 3 biomes on the Mun, I hauled it back up to the orbital MPL... I\u0027ve now spent over 9 years in-game diligently combing through data, and I\u0027ve only used around half the available data.\n\nIt wouldn\u0027t be so bad if you could just load up everything you have at the same time and automatically get science as a result, but damn... all this micro-management and time warping is ridiculous. It\u0027s especially ridiculous since it\u0027s only science from 3 Mun biomes and we\u0027re scanning the data for decades!"},{"CreatedByName":"WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;","CreatedById":78047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T11:59:40Z","Content":"...\n\n![maxresdefault2.jpg](http://wow.game-guide.fr/files/2014/05/maxresdefault2.jpg)\n\n...\n\nDepending of what give some fun to people, some will always rush trough things and others take there time.\n\nFast unlocking the tech tree could be easy for sure, but fact is it offer another dimension of gameplay to do contract with few money and part unlock letting the lab process quietly without using the warp for process result and proceding mission normally during this time.\n\n(As exemple actually i m around day 350 in the first year and have done around 400 mission or so, and so it\u0027s just a personnal choice depending of what aspect of the game you like)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-15T12:23:26Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2015 12:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by WinkAllKerb\u0027\u0027**"}]}
