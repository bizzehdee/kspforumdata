I try and clarify what is an actual quote from Max (if it\u0027s wrapped in \u0022quotation marks\u0022, it\u0027s the best transcript of an official Squad member you\u0027ll find on the web), and what is a summary from myself as I\u0027m aware I switch between the two with 0 notice. When I say \u0027Squad\u0027, I mean \u0027the relevant people who are currently developing the game\u0027. \n\nAs always, this is just a transcript of an off the cuff vlog of a non-native english speaker - **some details may change or be entirely incorrect**.\n\n**Squadcast Summary for 2015-04-11** - [**Watch it here!**](http://www.twitch.tv/ksptv/v/4015996)\n\n\u0022You know, it generally works better if I turn my mic on...\u0022\n\nThe start was mainly setting up the current mission - capturing an asteroid for an eventual space station. Also, stay tuned for a sneak preview of fairings..\n\nAxial tilt for planets - last time they tried it, Unity didn\u0027t really like so it\u0027s something they seriously have to consider.\n\nThere are currently no dedicated heatshield parts, but it\u0027s apparently pretty easy to config-bash say, the fairing parts, to act as one. Hopefully all players like the aero and heat - the default settings are apparently enough to overheat and break up a spaceplane/Shuttle re-entry (though that could be because Max isn\u0027t terribly good at this game..). It\u0027s looking pretty good, way more advanced than current stock aero (not that that is difficult). It even affects EVA kerbals.\n\nThere\u0027s no real clarification from Squad about kerbals and their lives/biology because they prefer each player to have their own canon and having a set backstory would ruin that.\n\nTier 0 buildings (the Barn) - you recall they\u0027re being redesigned to a higher standard? Well, it\u0027s such a big redesign that, not 100% sure but, it maaaaay be that they don\u0027t appear in 1.0. If that\u0027s the case, they\u0027ll be in the update after 1.0 for sure.\n\n1.0 preview videos when? When they\u0027re done ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nFun fact: Squad sometimes actually uses Danny2462\u0027s videos for bugfixing. If they can replicate the steps and consider it severe enough, they will patch it. But sometimes, they just think \u0027oh, attaching 2 claws to a kerbal breaks the universe? How about you just don\u0027t do that..\u0027\n\nSquad has patched a whole ton of bugs and RAM leaks - \u0022KSP is behaving waaahaahaaay better now\u0022. No 64bit yet though, not yet.\n\nAnother fun fact - Squad have fixed the flag planting animation so it doesn\u0027t clip through their helmet anymore. Good stuff. Anyway, fairings!\n\n![5S2Tj5w.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/5S2Tj5w.jpg)\n\nThis is probe to get some science and at the same time, look at the general mineral contents of the planet to check for ore. Gives a rough sense of scale for the clamshell scanner. Also, check the cursor! Just one of many tiny tweaks in 1.0. So yeah, how do we launch this in the new aero? Well, we could launch it as-is, but the airflow around it would be awful and likely tear things off, so let\u0027s put a fairing round it:\n\n![j4X0Q6t.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/j4X0Q6t.jpg)\n\nFirst off, this is an awful, inefficient, and expensive example of 1.0 stock fairings. The way you build them is with your mouse - click on fairing base, it follows the mouse around. Click to make an \u0027anchor\u0027, move the mouse to somewhere else, click again to anchor again etc.It\u0027s like join the dots, but you decide on where the dots are. But wait, weren\u0027t the fairings parts? How can I fiddle with the insides after the fairings are set?\n\n![Rb4KncC.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Rb4KncC.jpg)\n\nBoom. From anchor to anchor is a part and by mousing over the fairing, the parts will separate like shown to allow you to change parts inside of it. Interstage fairings are a thing - Squad is giving you a tool, up to you how to use and abuse them. They fully expect players to come up with some unexpected and creative use for these procedural parts they hadn\u0027t anticipated.\n\nWant more of this kind of thing? Keep an eye out for teasers released soon^TM^ ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nSo that\u0027s it from Max and another episode of Squadcast. I\u0027m Owksp and you\u0027re welcome.\n\nP.S. As with last week, the amount of rep I get from these posts can be overwhelming, so go find your favourite forum goer, be it a modder, builder, moderator, whoever and rep them as well.
