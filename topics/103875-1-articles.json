Also, stay tuned for a sneak preview of fairings..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAxial tilt for planets - last time they tried it, Unity didn\u0027t really like so it\u0027s something they seriously have to consider.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are currently no dedicated heatshield parts, but it\u0027s apparently pretty easy to config-bash say, the fairing parts, to act as one. Hopefully all players like the aero and heat - the default settings are apparently enough to overheat and break up a spaceplane/Shuttle re-entry (though that could be because Max isn\u0027t terribly good at this game..). It\u0027s looking pretty good, way more advanced than current stock aero (not that that is difficult). It even affects EVA kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s no real clarification from Squad about kerbals and their lives/biology because they prefer each player to have their own canon and having a set backstory would ruin that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETier 0 buildings (the Barn) - you recall they\u0027re being redesigned to a higher standard? Well, it\u0027s such a big redesign that, not 100% sure but, it maaaaay be that they don\u0027t appear in 1.0. If that\u0027s the case, they\u0027ll be in the update after 1.0 for sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.0 preview videos when?

If they can replicate the steps and consider it severe enough, they will patch it. But sometimes, they just think \u0027oh, attaching 2 claws to a kerbal breaks the universe? How about you just don\u0027t do that..\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad has patched a whole ton of bugs and RAM leaks - \u0022KSP is behaving waaahaahaaay better now\u0022. No 64bit yet though, not yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother fun fact - Squad have fixed the flag planting animation so it doesn\u0027t clip through their helmet anymore. Good stuff.

Gives a rough sense of scale for the clamshell scanner. Also, check the cursor! Just one of many tiny tweaks in 1.0. So yeah, how do we launch this in the new aero? Well, we could launch it as-is, but the airflow around it would be awful and likely tear things off, so let\u0027s put a fairing round it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/j4X0Q6t.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022j4X0Q6t.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, this is an awful, inefficient, and expensive example of 1.0 stock fairings. The way you build them is with your mouse - click on fairing base, it follows the mouse around. Click to make an \u0027anchor\u0027, move the mouse to somewhere else, click again to anchor again etc.It\u0027s like join the dots, but you decide on where the dots are. But wait, weren\u0027t the fairings parts? How can I fiddle with the insides after the fairings are set?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Rb4KncC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Rb4KncC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoom. From anchor to anchor is a part and by mousing over the fairing, the parts will separate like shown to allow you to change parts inside of it. Interstage fairings are a thing - Squad is giving you a tool, up to you how to use and abuse them. They fully expect players to come up with some unexpected and creative use for these procedural parts they hadn\u0027t anticipated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWant more of this kind of thing?

One that is actually far superior then PF.\u003Cp\u003EIf what I understand is correct I can make multi sectioned fairings that can be individually jettisoned? Because unfortunately with PF the entire fairing you create has to go. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will be great for a Saturn V for instance. The LEM sits down inside the S-IVB a ways and is extracted. You can achieve the \u003Cem\u003Elook\u003C/em\u003E with PF, but when you decouple it the entire LEM is exposed. Where as now you can just have the upper fairings/pedals decouple and keep the one that holds the LEM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAtleast I hope that\u0027s the case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, if you get creative with Procedural Fairings, you \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E make it so the lower part of the LM is still covered when you jettison the petals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did it like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/J4rsHCg.png\u0022 alt=\u0022J4rsHCg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-11T01:36:10Z\u0022 title=\u002204/11/2015 01:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GusTurbo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"forenci","CreatedById":63070,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T01:33:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm.
