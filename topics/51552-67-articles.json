Any altitude will do, so long as you have enough to relay the signal all the way around, but you can set 3 at ~2,868,750m for \u0022kerbo sync\u0022 orbit, and give coverage to pretty much all of Kerbin (adding 3 more at the same altitude but in a polar orbit would make sure even the poles are covered). Trick is to make sure you have enough dishes so each sat can relay the KSC signal to the next, and at least one, or a long range omni to relay signal to an active vessel. Right now I\u0027ve got 4 radial mounted dishes, one large fold out dish, for eventual long range comm (I think it\u0027s the gold one, I should really learn the names of these lol) and the dipole omni. Two of the radial mount dishes point at neighboring sats, one radial points at active vessel, and the last one points at KSC, though I think I was planning on having that point at a lower constellation (think I was planning around 4 at around 300km) once I get it setup.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother way is to delay your gravity turn.
