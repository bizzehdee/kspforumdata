I will also put my vote in for doing the cargo module. Sure the main goal is putting living things in space, but there is also the necessity of getting stuff up to keep those living things still living. Like the current missions to the ISS. I haven\u0027t heard but I\u0027d imagine SpaceX will still keep the cargo pods w/o windows and such for resupply missions. Just like Soyuz has Progress.\u003Cp\u003EAlso I don\u0027t see anything about RCS. Admittedly I haven\u0027t tried the new version yet. Has Dragon and Scripto given you the idea on how to the roll and the such to work yet. I think I\u0027ve mentioned it before, if you want an example of the best way to do it, look at DennyTX, he\u0027s got a \u0027shelf\u0027 in certain areas to put in the RCS pods.

I\u0027ll include this in the upcoming .24 update, but for now, just download and unzip it directly into the GameData/LazTek/Parts folder. It is a supplemental RCS pod that attaches below the engines, directly in between the RCS nozzle pairs in a set of four, just like the SuperDracos. I recommend attaching them before attaching the engines using the same technique I recommend for SuperDraco engine attachment, which is to rotate the capsule 45 degrees before attaching and then rotate the capsule back to its original position. After installing, turn off capsule RCS and torque and it should rotate correctly without needing a reaction wheel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://electrictomatoes.com/ksp/LazTekDragonRealRCS.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELazTek SpaceX Dragon Real RCS\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sp1989","CreatedById":105359,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-22T20:32:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre gonna do the FalconX and the Falcon X Heavy?

This mod is functional, its beautiful, and they look just like the real things. That puts you in an elite group on these forums. Not many accomplish all of those things and you nailed them all.
