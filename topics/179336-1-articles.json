Like, the game detects mouseover in a 45\u00B0 angle reaching about 10 meters from the light.\u00A0I built a\u00A0 probe with an FL-T100 tank, three lights on the top pointing downwards and a Terrier on the bottom, mounted on a transfer stage with an FL-T400 and another Terrier. The lights have rightclick-detection as far as the bottom of the transfer stage:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022AdQa6hT.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/AdQa6hT.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCursor is not visible due to Windows, but it\u0027s right next to the checkered-texture on that FL-T400 in the middle,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enowhere\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0near the light in question, yet you can see the light clearly highlighted for mouseover.
