Just as they appear they can spin off into space. They are not unconscious (does that happen?) but I cannot control them to turn on their jetpack and avoid issues for what seems like too long.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy request is to be able to have control over a kerbal that is spinning about sooner than currently.
