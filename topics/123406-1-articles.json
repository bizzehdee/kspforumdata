However, when I got there and tried to decouple one just wiggles, the other I can\u0027t decouple (I made them as a sub-assembly and attached using dual symmetry, probably 2 bad ideas in a row). I did a simple test on the launchpad after the fact and noticed there when decoupled the object sort of waited then slid down the side of the base. Back in the VAB I used the offset to to pull it out as much as possible, noticing then there was some intersection, and in the test it dropped off as expected. Question is, are my Minmus ones permanent fixtures? I tried using a Kerbonaut to stand on a hovercraft but that didn\u0027t work. Even worse, I had the weird ejection bug happen and he shot straight up, blowing one of my solar panels apart haha. Just screwing around, violently flying the lander can shake it off, but things get destroyed in the process.
