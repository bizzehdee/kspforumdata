I have a plant a flag on eve contract, currently, so I\u0027ve encouraged myself to much around in sandbox mode and design some potential landers (all capable of reaching orbit from sea level). Then, of course, I hyper edit the lander into Evian orbit. At first, entry seems like it will work out.\u00A0However, I have to keep enabling the ignore heat cheat to test my vehicle (more interested in testing the ascent of the lander). However, once I actually want to do the legit mission, I want to design a frickin method of entering and landing on Eve without burning up (and without relying on cheats, obviously)! The biggest problem with all of my landers is that they all flip over halfway through entry and explode. The heat shield seems virtually useless because of this. I have tried normal ablator shield clusters and the inflatable version.
