If I create something, and later decide the terms of the license are too restrictive (or not restrictive enough to avoid unintended abuse), it should be my prerogative to change the license and notify users.

Which strongly suggests the memory usage is caused by the game keeping the decompressed versions of the maps loaded into main system memory, which there\u0027s absolutely no reason to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s also this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/597013822168837832/59A7D6D1125771E047C25D5135A69B4048D0FCB0/\u0022 alt=\u002259A7D6D1125771E047C25D5135A69B4048D0FCB0\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what happens when you suspend your system with KSP running. When you come back, the working set (but not the commit) drops to a SMALL fraction of its normal value...and stays there until you do a scene transition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I believe is happening based on this behavior is that when the game goes through a scene transition, it\u0027s failing to unload all the transitional bits from the system memory. This means, for example, the decompressed versions of the planetary maps, even after they\u0027ve been recompressed as DDSes and loaded into VRAM. The memory usage for the maps, based on my testing, is consistent with two compressed copies and two uncompressed copies of each map being stored in RAM. So if, for example, the game loads the PNG, decompresses it, hands it off to OpenGL, which Recompresses it as a DDS...well there you go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy testing seems to suggest that at most times, the game\u0027s actually only actively using something on the order of 500-800MB of RAM, and the rest is just bloat from the scene transitions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EForgot to mention. Simply not unloading things isn\u0027t in and of itself a bad thing. But it\u0027s clearly not treating them as cache that can be overwritten when needed, if this is in fact what it\u0027s doing. There\u0027s also some indications that the scene loading may actually have a memory leak, where it re-loads things that are still loaded from before. Not all the time, but at least some of the time.

I think that if squad wants to keep it\u0027s modding community alive, they should look into implementing certain mods, if needed hire someone dedicated to use the mods ideas, make it more modular and make it fit the game\u0027s style. Does it kill mods? Perhaps. Look at it another way. Those mods are sacrificed for stock features. IF squad took just a little more effort in communicating with it\u0027s community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat about license? IF squad gave people more what they \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Epaid for\u003C/span\u003E wanted, they would implement more features already present in mods.

Im currently learning to mod (havnt done it since morrowind) and am trying to implement the best parts of Ioncross and TAC, which to me both seem like half finished projects. With those two mods it seems I have the base for a decent life support mod, my thought is to treat each required material as a resource (utilizing kethane) and set different modules to produce/consume resources. Set up fuel routing like monopropellant and it may work.
