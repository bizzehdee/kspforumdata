Specifically, I\\\u0027m getting a paper ?V of 3931 m/s, when it takes ~4400 m/s to reach low orbit in the best case. Less efficient trajectories and ships need 4500-5000 m/s. Vertical performance testing gets me at most ~1650 m/s at burnout. I\\\u0027m guessing that the earlier version had an additional stage?\n\nAs such, I\\\u0027m proposing a revised design:\n\n![mbss2.png](http://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c128/raptor_87/KSP/mbss2.png)\n\nIt needs to be throttled down for much the its flight for maximum efficiency (despite shedding engines), but is capable of reaching LKO and returning safely. vertically stacking additional fuel tanks would greatly increase its ?V budget."}]}
