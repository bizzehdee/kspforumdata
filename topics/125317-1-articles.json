Situation is what sort of \u0027orbit\u0027 the vessel is in, eg landed, flying, low space, high space etc. Biome is what biome the vessel is over. Each science experiment is set to work in each situation either not at all, once, or per biome. Crew reports are set per biome while flying, but once while in space. Mystery goo and materials bay are set once per situation while flying, but per biome while landed. So what you\u0027re seeing is totally as expected.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-13T18:13:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi kingOFspace, last I looked the experiments were only biome specific when landed, and there\u0027s only a few levels for flying and space when using them, while the crew and eva reports take the biomes into account.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can see this too in the SienceDefs.cfg in GameData/Squad/Resources, but there\u0027s a ton of spoilers in there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022missing\u0022 file is usually the settings.cfg, as Steam detects it as something it shouldn\u0027t overwrite after the player has changed it, the error message is unfortunate though,\u003Ca href=\u0022https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3843-OKCB-6345\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline\u0022\u003E more info here.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
