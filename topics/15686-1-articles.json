I was still looking for a name for the craft when I\u0027d finished, and I looked from an aerial view and knew it was destined to be The Arrowhead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s pretty dang fast and glides EXTREMELY well (Probably due to so many wings) along with being very easy to control during takeoff AND flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncluded with just The Arrowhead is an experimental version that has more powerful thrusters and manual control over the angle of each.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe controls for the standard jet are 9/0 to raise and lower the jets,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the experimental version, 9/o to control the left jet and 0/p to control the right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETakeoff is a little strange, i\u0027ve found if you try and do a direct vertical takeoff, you flip backwards, so angle the thrusters a little bit before taking off and be sure to use full thrust. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBundled with the jet is a custom fuel tank I created that has a LOT of fuel in it, sorry for the unrealism, this is meant for aesthetics, not practicality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat should just about do it, happy flying!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, probably should\u0027ve mentioned, you need Damned Aerospace/Damned Robotics for this too.

The air-breathing engines provide the perfect amount of thrust so that it\u0027s not overpowered and rediculous, or underpowered and too weak to fly. The thing flies exceptionally well anyway, with even the lowest of thrusts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d done a few experiments working with landing gear, all of which ended in failure. The craft glides too well to be landed vertically, and instead just drops straight down if there\u0027s no thrust, and just travels forwards if there is thrust. Horizontal/wheel based landing gear would be too impractical (And would defeat the objective of it being a VTOL) so right now, i can\u0027t develop any landing system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for testing, and I apologise about the iffy takeoff. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lazurkri","CreatedById":16624,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-17T12:31:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHoly god. the sheer LIFT of this bird is nuts!
