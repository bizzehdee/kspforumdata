I am writing on behalf of a university team working on the design of a reusable lunar lander architecture. We are looking for modders who might be interested in making a custom mod of our lander in\u00A0KSP, and we plan to use those models to create a video.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe video accompanies a 5-7 page abstract which will be reviewed by members of the aerospace community, including those from SpaceX, Blue Origin, Aerojet Rocketdyne, NASA Johnson, NASA Langley, etc., and you will be credited. Our goal is to have the final version done by December 10th.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease let me know if you are interested and available! DM me with your email and modeling experience so I can provide you with the details.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
