When I rename an object ( that is animated and was imported from an .FBX) the animation is lost. Unity offers me to get rid of the lost curves but not reassign those to the renamed object. Is there a way to do this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore details on my situation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have many parts, including many objects and those are animated. Now I would like to introduce a texture switch to those object. It would make my life so much easier if all the objects I want to switch texture on have the same name:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E@PART[OctoSat_*]:NEEDS[Firespitter]\u003Cbr\u003E{    \u003Cbr\u003E    MODULE\u003Cbr\u003E    {\u003Cbr\u003E    name = FStextureSwitch2\u003Cbr\u003E    moduleID = 0\u003Cbr\u003E    objectNames = [B]OctoSat_textswitch[/B]\u003Cbr\u003E    textureRootFolder = NSS/\u003Cbr\u003E        ...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would allow me to have this MM patch instead of having to list all the objects from all the parts ( probably hundreds).

I could be wrong of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut my understanding is that Unity associates the animation by name \u0026amp; hierarchy, and as you said the baked animations are read-only. Which modeling program are you using? Unity doesn\u0027t care if multiple mesh objects are named the same, but Blender doesn\u0027t permit it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me the work-arounds appear to be: either do the animation in Unity instead of baking it before import, or list all of the separate object names in the Firespitter module config (which of course is the one you\u0027re trying to avoid).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nookos","CreatedById":144067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-07T23:58:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey Thanks. I m a big fan of Fuel Tank Plus. And actually my texture switch problem showed up when I tried to harmonize my parts with yours \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI m using 3dsmax and I export in FBX. In Unity the fbx shows the correct names in the assets window ( 3dsmax is fine with having the same name on multiple meshes). But when I drag and drop that asset in a GameObject Unity increments them automatically and then I m screwed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrustrating. I found a similar thread on Unity\u0027s forum and there was no solution offered there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo as you said I ll have to either reanimate everything or list all my meshes..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ll try listing them I guess especially if I can list them all in one module and not create one module per part. Will try first thing tomorrow if that works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E That initial MM patch was just to good a solution to work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
