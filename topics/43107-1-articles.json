And for that to happen you\u0027d have to have so much energy in one place it would be what we think of as matter, it would no longer be light.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T19:02:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, light does bend space-time. Though, not quite in the same way that a massive point particle would. It has to do with the fact that if light has a lot of energy it also has a lot of momentum, and momentum factors into stress-energy tensor which is ultimately the source of gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a good example, there exists a Vaidya Metric, which is a solution for a star that radiates a lot of energy, and that radiated energy alters the gravitational field around the star.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Winter Man","CreatedById":11358,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T11:29:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheers for that.
