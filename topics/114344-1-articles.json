The game has been functioning normally with those mods for about two weeks with Kerbin moon return missions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* At the current time putting a single mk1 capsule with a mk16 parachute into a 80km x 30km sub orbital trajectory will cause re-entry effects to start between 65km and 68km at ~2.3km/s. Previously these effects only started at ~36km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* At the current time the mk16 parachute will explode due to overheating on touchdown despite functioning normally during the final descent. Previously this did not occur.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* At the current time using the prograde or retrograde hold provided by a pilot results in the craft pointing vector oscillating rapidly and steady drift away from the appropriate orientation. I have never really used this much before but don\u0027t remember noticing this obvious problem; Basic SAS works fine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did have a self inflicted physics oops as discussed in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123867-What-are-the-default-physics-settings\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123867-What-are-the-default-physics-settings\u003C/a\u003E but that was rectified by following the suggestion. The physics.cfg is normal (I have checked that the file contents have not changed since)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have not upgraded to 1.0.4 (title screen still shows 1.0.2.842) and have not upgraded the two mods to avoid incompatabilities. I obtained KSP via steam and have copied the entire directory off to another location to stop it being messed with and I start KSP via a link to the copied KSP.exe rather than via Steam (32 bit on Windows 7 home premium 64 bit). I have not knowingly experienced any of the bugs that the 1.0.4 change log suggests are fixed in that revision. I have not experienced any of the self help issues\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am concerned that my returning 1st interplanetary mission is going to run into some kind of difficulty (unusual re-entry effects and things exploding are not a good sign when your rapidly approaching kerbals are depending on a predictable aero braking manoeuvre).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a known recommendation to restore the \u0027normal\u0027 previous behaviour (or was that itself the bug)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs my only hope to abandon my KSP 1.0.2 game and start a brand new game from the beginning with 1.0.4? (loosing all game progress is not a desirable outcome)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could obtain and post some screen shots showing the new behaviour if that is likely to assist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReporting information and save game at the top of this post\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those that fixate on such things I am deliberately still playing KSP 1.0.2 with my sole existing game to avoid any possibility of the changes from breaking / penalising my in-progress game as a result of the game rule changes. The next game played would be a hard difficulty career game and would be played with the latest release at that time once I\u0027ve finished the current difficulty; I\u0027m am not a fan of rapid feature updates (as opposed to rapid bug fixes and occasional feature expansion updates) and consequently I don\u0027t buy pre-release games but each to their own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for any suggestions you might have,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe lives of several kerbals are on the line (and the accident investigation boards are getting tired of \u0022oops\u0022 as the cause of death),\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERichard\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-29T18:52:49Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2015 06:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RidiculousRichard\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETrying again with a new file host\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RidiculousRichard","CreatedById":144734,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T18:04:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAn update for anyone who comes across this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) It is not clear if there is any heating rate dependence on the altitude at which re-entry effects are shown (36km vs 86km) but I believe that there is although it is not too severe and should be a cause of concern (I can\u0027t get a 36km re-entry effects to make an absolutely unbiased comparison)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) So far the only component that explodes due to overheating as soon as a re-entry vessel touches down is the Mk16 parachute (but I\u0027m only in the early career game); you are simply denied the recovery refund on the parachute\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Pilot prograde / retrograde can be erratic; don\u0027t leave a vessel unattended in these modes.

The parachute is now burning up if you release it too soon (this happened to me until I understood the more realistic physics being applied to re-entry), so wait until the heating effects are gone before deploying. Right click on the parachute before deploying and look for the recommendation on chute deployment in the part window (I\u0027ve seen Unsafe, Risky and Ok flags so far).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also noticed that the SAS modes are much more sensitive.
