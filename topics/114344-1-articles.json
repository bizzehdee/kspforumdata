The game has been functioning normally with those mods for about two weeks with Kerbin moon return missions\n\n\\* At the current time putting a single mk1 capsule with a mk16 parachute into a 80km x 30km sub orbital trajectory will cause re-entry effects to start between 65km and 68km at ~2.3km/s. Previously these effects only started at ~36km\n\n\\* At the current time the mk16 parachute will explode due to overheating on touchdown despite functioning normally during the final descent. Previously this did not occur.\n\n\\* At the current time using the prograde or retrograde hold provided by a pilot results in the craft pointing vector oscillating rapidly and steady drift away from the appropriate orientation. I have never really used this much before but don\u0027t remember noticing this obvious problem; Basic SAS works fine\n\nI did have a self inflicted physics oops as discussed in [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123867-What-are-the-default-physics-settings](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123867-What-are-the-default-physics-settings) but that was rectified by following the suggestion. The physics.cfg is normal (I have checked that the file contents have not changed since)\n\nI have not upgraded to 1.0.4 (title screen still shows 1.0.2.842) and have not upgraded the two mods to avoid incompatabilities. I obtained KSP via steam and have copied the entire directory off to another location to stop it being messed with and I start KSP via a link to the copied KSP.exe rather than via Steam (32 bit on Windows 7 home premium 64 bit). I have not knowingly experienced any of the bugs that the 1.0.4 change log suggests are fixed in that revision. I have not experienced any of the self help issues\n\nI am concerned that my returning 1st interplanetary mission is going to run into some kind of difficulty (unusual re-entry effects and things exploding are not a good sign when your rapidly approaching kerbals are depending on a predictable aero braking manoeuvre).\n\nIs there a known recommendation to restore the \u0027normal\u0027 previous behaviour (or was that itself the bug)?\n\nIs my only hope to abandon my KSP 1.0.2 game and start a brand new game from the beginning with 1.0.4? (loosing all game progress is not a desirable outcome)\n\nI could obtain and post some screen shots showing the new behaviour if that is likely to assist.\n\nReporting information and save game at the top of this post\n\nFor those that fixate on such things I am deliberately still playing KSP 1.0.2 with my sole existing game to avoid any possibility of the changes from breaking / penalising my in-progress game as a result of the game rule changes. The next game played would be a hard difficulty career game and would be played with the latest release at that time once I\u0027ve finished the current difficulty; I\u0027m am not a fan of rapid feature updates (as opposed to rapid bug fixes and occasional feature expansion updates) and consequently I don\u0027t buy pre-release games but each to their own.\n\nThank you for any suggestions you might have,\n\nthe lives of several kerbals are on the line (and the accident investigation boards are getting tired of \u0022oops\u0022 as the cause of death),\n\nRichard\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-29T18:52:49Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2015 06:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RidiculousRichard**\n  \nTrying again with a new file host"},{"CreatedByName":"RidiculousRichard","CreatedById":144734,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T18:04:52Z","Content":"An update for anyone who comes across this:\n\n1) It is not clear if there is any heating rate dependence on the altitude at which re-entry effects are shown (36km vs 86km) but I believe that there is although it is not too severe and should be a cause of concern (I can\u0027t get a 36km re-entry effects to make an absolutely unbiased comparison)\n\n2) So far the only component that explodes due to overheating as soon as a re-entry vessel touches down is the Mk16 parachute (but I\u0027m only in the early career game); you are simply denied the recovery refund on the parachute\n\n3) Pilot prograde / retrograde can be erratic; don\u0027t leave a vessel unattended in these modes. I\u0027ve not had any problems with using basic stability which so far has always been fine.\n\n4) Always keep a pristine zipped up copy of any KSP version; I\u0027m not that trusting in it\u0027s consistency over time\n\nPlease do comment if you have any reason to suspect any of these observations may be untrue\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-28T18:07:39Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2015 06:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RidiculousRichard**"},{"CreatedByName":"Brigadier","CreatedById":147109,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T00:58:32Z","Content":"Well, as far as the re-entry heating is concerned, since I understand the heating algorithms have been significantly changed with the 1.0.x releases, try using a heat shield on the re-entry vehicle. The parachute is now burning up if you release it too soon (this happened to me until I understood the more realistic physics being applied to re-entry), so wait until the heating effects are gone before deploying. Right click on the parachute before deploying and look for the recommendation on chute deployment in the part window (I\u0027ve seen Unsafe, Risky and Ok flags so far).\n\nI\u0027ve also noticed that the SAS modes are much more sensitive. I tend to leave SAS ON and manually adjust the vehicle orientation on descent or use RETROGRADE but sometimes my capsule flips, even with a nose cone chute. It also means watching your battery power carefully."},{"CreatedByName":"RidiculousRichard","CreatedById":144734,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T12:28:00Z","Content":"I\u0027ve only played the demo and 1.0.2 so I\u0027m not sure what the changes were that caused a fuss.\n\nFor light-weight landers using a capsule base has been very reliable. Batteries on the side of a vessel are most likely to overheat.\n\nThe mk16 problem above only happens at the moment of touch-down; they function properly during the terminal descent. As you say, opening them in a fireball is not a good idea.\n\nRegards,\n\nRichard"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T12:50:35Z","Content":"After jumping through the captcha hoops to download the log and save file, it said requested download does not exist. Parachutes exploding after landing is not normal. In fact, I\u0027ve never seen it happen. I was downloading the file mainly to see if I could reproduce it, just because this sounded fun. So, without the craft file or the log, I really can\u0027t do anything other than speculate. Do you have any rtg\u0027s on the craft? Any fuel cells? It sounds like something is heating up the parachute. Re-entry effects at 60km\u002B is not default. Maybe one of the settings is cranked up above normal?"},{"CreatedByName":"RidiculousRichard","CreatedById":144734,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T13:23:00Z","Content":"I\u0027ll check the download and fix it tonight\n\nFrom memory all that I have on such pods are:\n\nMk 1 capsule\n\nClipped Octobody thing (for rescue / kerbal football)\n\nSmall battery\n\nMk16 parachute\n\nI may have:\n\n2 basic solar cells\n\n2 radial parachutes (paranoia backup)"},{"CreatedByName":"RidiculousRichard","CreatedById":144734,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T18:58:46Z","Content":"Download link updated to [http://s000.tinyupload.com/?file_id=71057878838376790157](http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=71057878838376790157)\n\nI\u0027ve concluded that filedropper.com is a scam to try and get you to pay for their \u0027PRO\u0027 version (I should have twigged when pasting the link; it could never be as nice as that.
