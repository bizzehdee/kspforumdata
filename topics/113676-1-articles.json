I attached several of both to a large tank to give it some extra fuel, but at no time did any fuel get used from these tanks. I could do a resource transfer, but doing so with 30 little tanks while lifting off is problematic. (and attaching hoses to each tank really defeats the purpose of those tiny little things). Monopro radial mounted tanks work fine...should the radial mount mini tanks also be working? Or is it a glitch, just not programed right in the mod, or am I doing something wrong?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-26T00:44:49Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2015 12:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SignalCorps**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mastikator","CreatedById":135309,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T05:16:26Z","Content":"LFO Fuel tanks tend to not give radially inward unless you put a fuel duct.\n\nBasically you need fuel ducts."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T08:45:37Z","Content":"There\u0027s no fuel crossfeed between surface attached parts at all, anywhere in KSP.

The reason why it works is that the monoprop fuel itself is treated as a vessel-global resource. It is configured to flat-out ignore all fuel flow rules.\n\nIt\u0027s a good thing too that there\u0027s no fuel crossfeed for surface attachment. Without knowing it, you rely on that feature every day when designing rockets. Because of it, you can actually do things like building rockets with side-mounted liquid fuel stages. Radial decouplers don\u0027t block fuel crossfeed - if whatever tank attached to them was able to crossfeed with the central stack, imagine the chaos! Your outer engines would draw fuel from the central stack that you meant to reserve for your next stage. A lot of designs like this (and others) would suddenly not work correctly anymore.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-22T08:48:58Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2015 08:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T08:56:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E LFO Fuel tanks tend to not give radially inward unless you put a fuel duct.\n\nor unless they are placed on radial decouplers.

Radial decouplers have crossfeed enabled, but it only seems to work when a non-fuel tank part is attached to them. There\u0027s also the new fuel feed rules for basic jets, turbojets, and Rapiers, which will happily drain radially attached parts of LF (and O in the case of the Rapier when in rocket mode)."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T21:00:40Z","Content":"The problem is not \u0022no surface-attach crossfeed.\u0022 If that were the case, 24-77s and Mk55s wouldn\u0027t work. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nThe problem is that surface-attach crossfeed only flows *out,* not *in.* A surface-attached part can *draw* from what it\u0027s attached, to, but no part can *provide* fuel to what it\u0027s surface-attached to.\n\nHence [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76499-0-24-2-CrossFeedEnabler](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76499-0-24-2-CrossFeedEnabler)"}]}
