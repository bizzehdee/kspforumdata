I attached several of both to a large tank to give it some extra fuel, but at no time did any fuel get used from these tanks. I could do a resource transfer, but doing so with 30 little tanks while lifting off is problematic. (and attaching hoses to each tank really defeats the purpose of those tiny little things). Monopro radial mounted tanks work fine...should the radial mount mini tanks also be working? Or is it a glitch, just not programed right in the mod, or am I doing something wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-26T00:44:49Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2015 12:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SignalCorps\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mastikator","CreatedById":135309,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T05:16:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELFO Fuel tanks tend to not give radially inward unless you put a fuel duct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically you need fuel ducts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T08:45:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s no fuel crossfeed between surface attached parts at all, anywhere in KSP.

The reason why it works is that the monoprop fuel itself is treated as a vessel-global resource.

Without knowing it, you rely on that feature every day when designing rockets. Because of it, you can actually do things like building rockets with side-mounted liquid fuel stages. Radial decouplers don\u0027t block fuel crossfeed - if whatever tank attached to them was able to crossfeed with the central stack, imagine the chaos! Your outer engines would draw fuel from the central stack that you meant to reserve for your next stage. A lot of designs like this (and others) would suddenly not work correctly anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-22T08:48:58Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2015 08:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T08:56:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mastikator\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mastikator\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELFO Fuel tanks tend to not give radially inward unless you put a fuel duct.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor unless they are placed on radial decouplers.
