But why actually? Kerbal Space Program demonstrates that this is not just wishful thinking like no other game. I am not just playing an astronaut, I am being an astronaut. I learn details about space travel and physics in space. And on the side I am having a blast. At least if you master the start, because this simulation is not easy. I would have preferred if I had some guidance at the beginning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut once I am in it, there is very little to criticise. I am tinkering in sandbox mode on my dream rocket, in career mode I am falling into a spiral of addiction. If you like, you can invest hundreds of hours into this game without getting bored. This makes it easy for me to get over the weak technology, the redundant science mode and the difficult start. Whoever has just a spark of interest into space travel should buy this. Kerbal Space Program is complex, but unique.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, because I got still time, I\u0027ll add the details to the 87%:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPresentation: (3/5)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B sweet comic look\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B Funny looking astronauts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B Fitting soundtrack\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- outdated technology\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- no voice output\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGame Design: (4/5)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B motivating career mode\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B quite realistic physics engine makes construction and flight demanding\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B educational\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B versatile tasks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- lame science mode\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBalance: (3/5)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B different colors for orientation in space\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B flight guidance\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B nine tutorials\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- not everything is getting explained\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- difficult start\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStory/Ambience: (3/5)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B coherent depiction of space\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B slapstick humor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B time acceleration\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- lifeless planets and buildings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- no one else in the universe but us\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScope: (5/5)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B enormous solar system\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B dozens of hours of game time\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B tool box with over 200 parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B three modes with six scenarios\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B supplies through mod support\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T20:11:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome of those negatives are things I regard as positives! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- no voice output.

I think, starting the game, especially in career mode, probably never was that hard as it is today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need to collect a lot of science until you can get into orbit. This is a much bigger step today than it was before 1.0.

However, many contracts contain targets above 19000m, which is actually a real challenge to accomplish with just a simple jet engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, as it is now, you will spend a lot time at Kerbin before even thinking about space.
