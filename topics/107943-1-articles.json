But why actually? Kerbal Space Program demonstrates that this is not just wishful thinking like no other game. I am not just playing an astronaut, I am being an astronaut. I learn details about space travel and physics in space. And on the side I am having a blast. At least if you master the start, because this simulation is not easy. I would have preferred if I had some guidance at the beginning.\n\u003E \n\u003E But once I am in it, there is very little to criticise. I am tinkering in sandbox mode on my dream rocket, in career mode I am falling into a spiral of addiction. If you like, you can invest hundreds of hours into this game without getting bored. This makes it easy for me to get over the weak technology, the redundant science mode and the difficult start. Whoever has just a spark of interest into space travel should buy this. Kerbal Space Program is complex, but unique.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - - - Updated - - -\n\u003E \n\u003E Well, because I got still time, I\u0027ll add the details to the 87%:\n\u003E \n\u003E Presentation: (3/5)\n\u003E \n\u003E \u002B sweet comic look\n\u003E \n\u003E \u002B Funny looking astronauts\n\u003E \n\u003E \u002B Fitting soundtrack\n\u003E \n\u003E - outdated technology\n\u003E \n\u003E - no voice output\n\u003E \n\u003E Game Design: (4/5)\n\u003E \n\u003E \u002B motivating career mode\n\u003E \n\u003E \u002B quite realistic physics engine makes construction and flight demanding\n\u003E \n\u003E \u002B educational\n\u003E \n\u003E \u002B versatile tasks\n\u003E \n\u003E - lame science mode\n\u003E \n\u003E Balance: (3/5)\n\u003E \n\u003E \u002B different colors for orientation in space\n\u003E \n\u003E \u002B flight guidance\n\u003E \n\u003E \u002B nine tutorials\n\u003E \n\u003E - not everything is getting explained\n\u003E \n\u003E - difficult start\n\u003E \n\u003E Story/Ambience: (3/5)\n\u003E \n\u003E \u002B coherent depiction of space\n\u003E \n\u003E \u002B slapstick humor\n\u003E \n\u003E \u002B time acceleration\n\u003E \n\u003E - lifeless planets and buildings\n\u003E \n\u003E - no one else in the universe but us\n\u003E \n\u003E Scope: (5/5)\n\u003E \n\u003E \u002B enormous solar system\n\u003E \n\u003E \u002B dozens of hours of game time\n\u003E \n\u003E \u002B tool box with over 200 parts\n\u003E \n\u003E \u002B three modes with six scenarios\n\u003E \n\u003E \u002B supplies through mod support"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T20:11:30Z","Content":"Some of those negatives are things I regard as positives! \n\n- no voice output. Good, I just like to put some music on and build or space without anything talking to/at me. (even just Gene annoys me sometimes!)\n\n- not everything is explained. For me KSP is all about figuring stuff out, and were I can\u0027t figure it out, there\u0027s all of you guys to talk to and ask. (I think the community is a very important part of the game, that most reviews will probably miss and sadly some players won\u0027t ever know)\n\n- difficult start. Well I can\u0027t really say what it\u0027s like starting now, but I remember when I first started it took me several days (maybe even a week) before landing on Mun....and that\u0027s what hooked me. Then I discovered the forum, realized my approach was all wrong and I still had way way more to learn.\n\n- no one else in the universe but us. I like that, it really gives you a sense of being the pioneers. You\u0027re the first ones out there....well, apart from some of the anomalies, but that just leaves it up to you to invent a backstory as to why those things are there. If there were aliens then that would just explain the anomalies and doesn\u0027t leave anything to the imagination.\n\n\u002B dozens of hours of game time. !!?! Biggest. Understatement. Ever.

At least hitting F1 should give you a help overlay, or something like that.\n\u003E \n\u003E For many beginners, who did not follow every single step of game development, this is a serious issue.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E - difficult start.

I think, starting the game, especially in career mode, probably never was that hard as it is today.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E You need to collect a lot of science until you can get into orbit. This is a much bigger step today than it was before 1.0. This is actually not so much an issue of engine power, but rather of flight stability, which is actually a few steps up the research tree.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E Before that, you could also easily collect science and money via flight contracts. However, many contracts contain targets above 19000m, which is actually a real challenge to accomplish with just a simple jet engine.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E So, as it is now, you will spend a lot time at Kerbin before even thinking about space. Which is perfectly fine, but KSP is indeed quite a difficult game. A few clues what do next wouldn\u0027t have hurt.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E So I think the criticism is valid. KSP could be even a better game with a little polishing.

KSP certainly lacks a few things here and there to be a reference game. \u003E90 are games like Half life, portal, splinter cell, warcraft, skyrim, deponia or kotor.\n\nIn the video-review of gamestar, the tester says that science mode sits between the chairs of sandbox and career.
