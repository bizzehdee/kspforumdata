Separate everything from your root part (probably the probe core). Delete the root part. Add a new root part like a docking port or decoupler. Then rebuild your rover around this core part. When ready to save it, detach everything from that new root part, and drag it into the save subassembly box. This can be found in the subassembly tab, furthest to the right of the parts tab. Note that subassemblies can transfer between the SPH and VAB, so you can build them with spaceplane symmetry and then bring them over to the VAB to mount on your rocket. Also, do a forum search because there are better descriptions than the answer I just gave (probably with pictures!).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kapakio","CreatedById":94571,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-01T22:20:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou answer was actually very clear.

Whatever your root part is, it needs to have a free attachment node on it; if your rover is built with a probe core as the root part, it needs to have an unoccupied node on it, and that\u0027s the only point at which you can attach it to your rocket when you load it as a subassembly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andersenman","CreatedById":61273,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-02T16:13:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have built an elaborate rover and are now stuck with either rebuilding or building your craft underneath the rover, perhaps \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43208-0-22-Oct17-SelectRoot-Set-a-new-root-part-0-22-fixes?p=552521#post552521\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis mod\u003C/a\u003E could help.

I put a probe on top of the payload drop ship in case I need to move it after dropping the rover to the ground.
