But gravity will always be pulling your ship down. There\u0027s nothing you can do to stop that. But what you can do is move to the side fast enough that as gravity pulls you down, you just keep missing the thing you\u0027re orbiting. So staying in space is not a matter of reaching a place or an altitude, but of going fast enough. Orbit is a velocity, and here\u0027s how to reach it.\n\nHere\u0027s how Isaac Newton figured it out.\n\n![F7HvrMb.gif?1](http://i.imgur.com/F7HvrMb.gif?1)\n\nHe pictured a canon firing from a hill, and the faster the canonball went, the farther it could go before hitting the curved surface of the earth. As it goes faster and faster, eventually, there would be a velocity at which the canonball falls forever without hitting the ground, and that is what we call orbit.\n\nThis is what you want your KSP ships to be able to do, but there\u0027s a complication, which is that Kerbin has an atmosphere, and moving through atmosphere slows you down. So there\u0027s an added step to reaching orbit in the game, and that is that you must go up for a while, to get clear of the air, before you start applying all of your ship\u0027s thrust to reaching orbital velocity. You will start off going straight up, and then gradually rotate so that the ship is pointing horizontally. This way you escape most of the air\u0027s effects while building up to orbital speed.\n\nHere\u0027s a ship you can use to fly this tutorial explanation: the M120 Trailblazer.\n\n![TgMkQsP.png](http://i.imgur.com/TgMkQsP.png)\n\n**Craft file: [https://kerbalx.com/Vanamonde/M120-Trailblazer](https://kerbalx.com/Vanamonde/M120-Trailblazer)**\n\nFor the sake of keeping things simple, this ship was made in sandbox mode, and is not meant to be used in career, as not all of its parts will be available to you at the start of a campaign.\n\n(Note: there is nothing magical about the exact angles and numbers I give in this guide, and others may give different advice. This guide is meant simply to be an example that works, though other approaches will work as well.) \n\nTurn the thrust all the way up with the left-shift key, hit the T key for stability assist, and press the spacebar to fire the engine. The weight of this ship is balanced against the thrust in such a way that you will not need to turn the throttle up or down during the flight. It should either be firing at full thrust, or turned off.\n\nBecause the current version of the game\u0027s aerodynamics can make holding a turn difficult, I like to begin to tilt the ship a few degrees right after launch. This leaves less of the turning to be done later, when the air is fighting you harder.\n\n![I0nmrjT.png](http://i.imgur.com/I0nmrjT.png)\n\nNotice that I am turning toward the east, which is the line marked 90 on the navball instrument.\n\n![A2n6GiH.png](http://i.imgur.com/A2n6GiH.png)\n\nThis is because the planet is already rotating in that direction, so you are adding that rotation speed to your ship\u0027s speed to help you reach orbit. This saves you a little fuel and leaves you lined up better for flying to other worlds, but you can also reach orbit by flying in any other direction.\n\nWatch the highest point marker, the apoapsis, to help turn by steps. When it gets to 25,000m, turn the ship so that it\u0027s facing 45 degrees toward the east.\n\n![5r27sI6.png](http://i.imgur.com/5r27sI6.png)\n\nThe air flow will be fighting you pretty strongly at this time, trying to force your ship to go back to its previous heading. You will need to keep applying steering control until it settles on the 45 degree angle, which is why I have given this rocket those nice big steering fins.\n\nWhen the apoapsis reaches 45,000m, turn the ship so that it is facing just a few degrees above the horizon.\n\n![2JLNQ4R.png](http://i.imgur.com/2JLNQ4R.png)\n\nSomewhere about this point in the flight, the first stage will run out of fuel and should be ejected. Hit the space bar to do so, and continue the flight.\n\nAnd when the apoapsis reaches 60,000m, turn the ship fully horizontal and keep it pointed that way,\n\n![xYK8qdu.png](http://i.imgur.com/xYK8qdu.png)\n\nuntil the apoapsis reaches 80,000m, then shut the engine down with the X key. This is because the atmosphere ends at about 70,000m, so if you go up to 80,000, you will be free of it and air resistence will no longer be slowing you down.\n\nHowever, as you can see in that last picture, you are not going fast enough to stay in orbit yet, and will just fall back down unless you do something more. So let the ship coast until it reaches 80,000m, then make sure the ship is pointed horizontally again, and fire the engine once more, at full thrust, with the Z key. Watch the opposite marker, the periapsis, until it too rises to around 80,000m. (Note that it does not matter if the periapsis and apoapsis are at the same height. As long as both are above atmosphere, that\u0027s good enough.)\n\n![ciJkYPA.png](http://i.imgur.com/ciJkYPA.png)\n\nWhen that lowest point in your ship\u0027s path is also above the upper limit of the atmosphere, the ship can just keep falling forever without hitting the planet, and you are in orbit. Shut the engine down now, and leave it off.\n\n![VaNbnxJ.png](http://i.imgur.com/VaNbnxJ.png)\n\nFrom here you can just watch the scenery for a while, or send the Kerbal out on EVA.\n\n![tnUXslt.png](http://i.imgur.com/tnUXslt.png)\n\nSteering him back inside the ship can be tricky, though, so maybe leave that for another day.\n\nAnyway, when you are done orbiting, it\u0027s time to bring the ship home. Turn it until it is pointing at the retrograde navball marker, and burn the engine.\n\n![8ntrg5r.png](http://i.imgur.com/8ntrg5r.png)\n\nThis will cause the lowest point of your orbit to sink. You do not need to put this marker all the way down to the ground. All you need to do is put that point low enough in the atmosphere that air will slow the ship the rest of the way for you. A higher initial periapsis takes longer to brake to a fall, and lower may expose the ship to dangerous heat or even a surface impact. For the sake of this practice mission, put it between 45,000 and 30,000 to ensure a safe return.\n\n![e3xb9HJ.png](http://i.imgur.com/e3xb9HJ.png)\n\nAnyway, once your descent has been set, you no longer need the engine and any remaining fuel. To make it easier for the ship to land safely without that useless weight, the second stage should now be ejected with the spacebar.\n\n![X8ZmKSQ.png](http://i.imgur.com/X8ZmKSQ.png)\n\nOnce you are on the way down, hit the spacebar to open the parachute and watch the capsule float to a landing.\n\n![QmDJFcW.png](http://i.imgur.com/QmDJFcW.png)\n\n![omthiXv.png](http://i.imgur.com/omthiXv.png)\n\nAnd that\u0027s it: your first orbital flight.

With the new aero that is a very easy way to flip out and as you noted you\u0027ll be fighting atmospheric drag - which wastes dV.\n\nA good Rule of thumb is to be at roughly 45degrees when you\u0027re 10-15km up, and you\u0027ll be wanting to go around 300-350m/s at that stage. \n\nIf you time everything absolutely perfectly, you never shut down your engines and circularise into an orbit just as you reach apoapsis. This is not easy.\n\nAlso, your orbital velocity at ~72km altitude is ~2285m/s which you can also use to guestimate when you\u0027re reaching orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T17:53:27Z","Content":"micha, as I said, this is only one method.
