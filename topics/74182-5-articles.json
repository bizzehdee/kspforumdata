Since I want to use 1 unit of O2/kerbal/6hr period, I altered the ratePerKerbal value of Oxygen to 0.0000462962. Now I\u0027m trying to work on the CO2 value but I\u0027m not really understanding the current value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe average human uses around 500L of pure O2/day and generates around 3500L of CO2/day. If I cut that by 25% for a Kerbal day I get 125L of O2 and 875L of CO2 per day. I know we\u0027re not using liters as units in Kerbal but I can extrapolate that 1 unit of O2 = 125L which would mean my Kerbals should be producing 7 units of CO2/ kerbal day. So I\u0027d think 0.000324075 would be the right value to use. But the default value is a negative number. Why is the default for CO2 generation set at -0.0000021039 and the scrubber value for CO2 set at -0.0000031558?
