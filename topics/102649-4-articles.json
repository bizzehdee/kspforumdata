As fast as the plane? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot that it really matters. A plane sitting on conveyor is just as affected by it as a plane flying over the conveyor: not very much. The plane doesn\u0027t interact with the conveyor, after all, it interacts with the air. Yeah the wheels might spin faster than normal, but who cares. In fact, during takeoff that\u0027s the function of wheels: to decouple the plane from the ground, and only use the ground for vertical support. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat if we stipulate that the conveyor moves as fast as the plane??? Again, doesn\u0027t matter, because by this requirement the plane HAS to move in order for the conveyor to move....as in, it has to move relative to the ground/ air for the conveyor to move. That\u0027s the stipulation. In fact, even a car could move under this requirement, albeit its speedometer would falsely read 2x its actual speed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, this assumes that we measure the airplane\u0027s (or car\u0027s) and the conveyor\u0027s speed relative to the air/ ground. But what if we measured it relative to the conveyor?? First, that\u0027s stupid because why the hell would we do that? Second, that\u0027s stupid because both the conveyor\u0027s and the plane\u0027s speeds are both variables in the question. You wouldn\u0027t measure the plane\u0027s speed relative to a variable, whose very value depends on the plane\u0027s speed. It\u0027s circular. It would become a mathematically impossible situation, basically saying that a = b \u002B a. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically I cannot see any realistic situation where the conveyor would or could keep the plane from taking off because, again, they are decoupled from each other. The best we can do is spin the conveyor so fast that it destroys the wheels (and therefore the plane), but that\u0027s just going out of the bounds of the question and getting into the realm of indestructible conveyors (it\u0027s easier to engineer a fast-spinning wheel than a fast-moving conveyor).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-01T14:53:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Veeltch\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Veeltch\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: maybe if the propeller is big and powerful enough to give the wings the airspeed they need to produce lift, then it might work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA propeller that big and powerful would easily overpower the brakes.
