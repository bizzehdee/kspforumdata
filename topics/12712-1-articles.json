The suit\\\u0027s visor is cracked, but the solar shield is up, making it impossible to see inside. The visor is unbreakable, and the suit is as hard as stone. The suit is a faded orange, bleached a lighter shade due to the sun\\\u0027s constant light on one side, except when the suit passes into the night side. The orbital period is [REDACTED], so encounters are rare, as the suit is going slower than required for orbit, yet never changes altitude. There is a large metal fragment piercing the EVA thruster fuel tank, and the tank is empty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPreventative Measures - DCE-002 should never be approached. This lesson was learned when the previously classified O-1 unmanned test mission came within 10 meters of the suit, and prodded it with the KanadaArm onboard. The suit grabbed the arm, snapped it, and pushed the ship away. DCE-002-B appeared, being an old Noyuz-TKA capsule. The craft accelerated towards DCE-002, and DCE-002 climbed inside. DCE-002-B then accelerated away. On the next orbit, DCE-002 was observed climbing back out of DCE-002-B in an undamaged suit, and DCE-002-B losing control, slamming a solar panel into DCE-002, cracking the visor and piercing the EVA fuel tank, recreating the damage seen before. DCE-002 spun away, and DCE-002-B began decelerating, and reentered. On the ground below, no reports of a reentering spacecraft were filed, and trained DCE telescopes did not observe the incident. DCE-002 spun back into the O-1, and knocked the control computer off. The craft de-orbited, and ejected the footage over DCE HQ, at [DATA EXPUNGED].

The suit can be observed as closely as possible without touching it, or the suit will break whatever touched it, and then be picked up by DCE-002-B. For this reason, neither DCE-002 or DCE-002-B can be contained. DCE-002-B\\\u0027s orbit is unknown at the time. Experiments are only allowed by trained personnel and robots in conjunction.

As DCE-127 is possessed of no obvious powers granting it the ability to inflict long-term harm upon personnel, it is not necessary to wear protective equipment when handling it, but handlers are advised only to touch the detachable pedestal which exhibits no anomalous properties, or the cardboard box in which the object is normally contained.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDescription: DCE-127 is a small (14cm on long axis of symmetry; 5cm in diameter) plastic model of a ciliated bacterium, the only remaining piece of a set of educational childrens\\\u0027 toys called \u0027Build Your Own MICROBES! [emphasis manufacturer\\\u0027s]\u0027 that was discovered in the desk drawer of Simkin Kerman, a 7-year-old child. All instances of the manufacturer\\\u0027s name on the package and the object have either been scratched off or damaged beyond recognition. DCE-127 was brought to the Agency\\\u0027s attention on [REDACTED] after operatives working as doctors at the [REDACTED] hospital informed the Agency of the sudden hospitalization of several children who had been brought in for extreme nausea as well as what was described as a \u0027burning, hot sauce-like\u0027 sensation upon the skin followed by severe rash and dryness. Drs. Folger, [REDACTED], and [REDACTED] noted upon close inspection that the children had begun to develop large patches of \u0027short, but thick, moving hair\u0027 and alerted Site-22, which dispatched Itinerant Collection Unit (ICU)-14 \u0027Plague Doctors\u0027 to obtain samples from [REDACTED] and investigate the origin of the childrens\\\u0027 condition. Investigation found that the children had all been playing at the Kermans\\\u0027 house 4 hours prior to the incident, and had all collapsed suddenly at dinnertime, prompting Simkin\\\u0027s parents to call the hospital. The house was searched and DCE-127 acquired; following the incident, Level-1 amnesiacs were distributed to non-DCE and a cover-up story was passed to the public.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDCE-127\\\u0027s anomalous properties manifest when it is attached to its pedestal in an upright position, standing on its long axis; there are multiple points of attachment present on the model, but anomalous properties will not exhibit themselves when the model is connected in these ways. When it stands on its long axis, DCE-127\\\u0027s opaque \u0027nucleus\u0027 will glow a dull red, and the plastic \u0027cilia\u0027 will begin to move slowly, apparently inhibited by the rigidity of the material from which they are made. No obvious means of mobility are apparent, although testing has confirmed the presence of a small electrical current across DCE-127\\\u0027s surface during periods of activity. If the tip of the model opposite the pedestal is pressed against a Kerbal subject\\\u0027s palm for a period of 1 minute or longer, the \u0027nucleus\u0027 will begin to exude a cloud of what appears to be a dark grey gas, or smog; captured samples of the material reveal that the cloud is comprised of an extremely fine particulate. The cloud will attempt to move toward the subject, and upon contact with the skin nearly instantly disappears. From this point on the subject is known as DCE-127-1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAround 4 hours after exposure to DCE-127, DCE-127-1 will become disoriented and fall to the ground, typically while complaining of one or more symptoms including severe nausea, stomach cramps, severe itch, searing pain across the skin, and weakness in the limbs. They will also develop a severe rash and skin dryness which cannot be alleviated by any known medication. Approximately two hours after these symptoms manifest, the subject will begin to display stubbly hair growth not unlike \u00275 o\\\u0027-clock-shadow\u0027 all across the body, beginning in large patches. This occurs regardless of sex or previous hair growth; and as the condition progresses, hair that was already present will fall out in order for the folliciles to accomodate the new growth. Testing of skin samples from numerous ID-J subjects reveals that the structure of the folliciles is undergoing rapid change during this time. Once the new stubble comes in, it will begin to move, seemingly of its own accord. The stubble itself, which is presumed to be an imitation of bacterial cilia, is nothing like Kerbal hair; although curiously, it exhibits few if any similarities to actual cilia, likely due to the difficulty of reconstructing such a structure on the macroscopic level using Kerbal tissue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOver the course of several weeks, the structures that have replaced DCE-127-1\\\u0027s original hair (or grown in in place of any at all) will grow out to their full size, broadening at their ends in a manner unlike bacterial cilia into a shape vaguely resembling a thin aquatic fin. At the same time, DCE-127-1\\\u0027s rash will spread over their skin until it encompasses nearly all of the dermis; during this period the epidermis will be shed, often in an irritating manner that requires pieces to be scratched off in order for them to fully detach. The rash will then begin to disappear; by the one-month mark, it is usually gone altogether, replaced in the skin by a sickly grey pallor. The skin by this point is extremely tough, save for sensitive areas that were not affected by the rash (usually membranous zones like the eyelids, lips, etc.) and is difficult to penetrate with a blade.

From this point on the subject is known as DCE-127-1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAround 4 hours after exposure to DCE-127, DCE-127-1 will become disoriented and fall to the ground, typically while complaining of one or more symptoms including severe nausea, stomach cramps, severe itch, searing pain across the skin, and weakness in the limbs. They will also develop a severe rash and skin dryness which cannot be alleviated by any known medication. Approximately two hours after these symptoms manifest, the subject will begin to display stubbly hair growth not unlike \u00275 o\\\u0027-clock-shadow\u0027 all across the body, beginning in large patches. This occurs regardless of sex or previous hair growth; and as the condition progresses, hair that was already present will fall out in order for the folliciles to accomodate the new growth. Testing of skin samples from numerous ID-J subjects reveals that the structure of the folliciles is undergoing rapid change during this time. Once the new stubble comes in, it will begin to move, seemingly of its own accord. The stubble itself, which is presumed to be an imitation of bacterial cilia, is nothing like Kerbal hair; although curiously, it exhibits few if any similarities to actual cilia, likely due to the difficulty of reconstructing such a structure on the macroscopic level using Kerbal tissue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOver the course of several weeks, the structures that have replaced DCE-127-1\\\u0027s original hair (or grown in in place of any at all) will grow out to their full size, broadening at their ends in a manner unlike bacterial cilia into a shape vaguely resembling a thin aquatic fin. At the same time, DCE-127-1\\\u0027s rash will spread over their skin until it encompasses nearly all of the dermis; during this period the epidermis will be shed, often in an irritating manner that requires pieces to be scratched off in order for them to fully detach. The rash will then begin to disappear; by the one-month mark, it is usually gone altogether, replaced in the skin by a sickly grey pallor. The skin by this point is extremely tough, save for sensitive areas that were not affected by the rash (usually membranous zones like the eyelids, lips, etc.) and is difficult to penetrate with a blade. The \u0027cilia,\u0027 on the other hand, are more easily cut; and when this is done, the structures ooze a thick, transluscent blue substance. This does not appear to cause much pain to DCE-127-1. Subjects are capable of floating much more easily in water, and can direct their \u0027cilia\u0027 consciously to allow them to move slowly through a liquid substance without normal swimming efforts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the transformation is complete, the effects will last about a week before reverting. The reversion process takes nearly the same amount of time as the original transformation, and can be stalled for another week by handling DCE-127 again in the above-described manner so as to trigger its anomalous effects once more. \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EThere does not seem to be a limit as to how long this process can go on; however,\u003C/span\u003E careful measurements have revealed that with each successive use, the mass of the model decreases slightly, which may suggest a boundary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EADDENDUM: On \u003Cstrong\u003E[REDACTED]\u003C/strong\u003E, DCE-127\\\u0027s mass fell below the \u003Cstrong\u003E[REDACTED]\u003C/strong\u003E-mark and several of its cilia cracked off when it was bumped against a wall.
