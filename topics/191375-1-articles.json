And without those chains you have to bring every gram of base to your destination by Kerbin-launched rocket, which is even harder. I understand that in real life not everything is at your fingertips but in real life you not only get paid real money to move resources, you can build big rockets anyway, and there\u0027s usually something that can work as a substitute.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t figure out how other people get these things set up without hyper edit and without giving up due to kraken/lag. Even with a beefy computer I cannot manage craft with over a hundred parts and the high mass of base modules makes the respective launcher extremely wobbly and laggy and now thanks to 1.8 breaking KJR for me for the foreseeable future (launch clamp bug, etc) I can barely even do normal ksp missions without wobbling to death.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut without these mods I have no reason to go to another planet. Which I have yet to do after \u003Cstrong\u003E871 hours.\u003C/strong\u003E I hyperedited something on Duna once, but other than that I have never been anywhere near another planet, or even out of Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. Every mission that left Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E died because it wasn\u0027t a writhing mass of relay dishes anyway. Granted the vast majority of my time is spent in the editor planning a mission just to scrap it because I know I am one of the worst players of this game, or any game for that matter, or better yet life itself. Pitiful rant aside can someone help me get better?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-02-02T21:30:04Z\u0022 title=\u002202/02/2020 09:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 2, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Autolyzed Yeast Extract\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Atlessa","CreatedById":187974,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-02T21:35:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022rkqxm6m.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002287.00\u0022 height=\u0022388\u0022 width=\u0022446\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/rkqxm6m.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E:\u0026gt;\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vagrant203","CreatedById":202630,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-07T00:39:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Um.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI may be talking out my rear since I\u0027ve only recently started playing, but here is my theoretical approach to future bases and missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo begin with, I plan on a crew of six. Two of each specialty. Two scientists to man an orbital lab. Two engineers to man a drill unit and an orbital refinery. Two pilots to man a mk1-3 command pod, this enabling its use as a probe control point independent of CommNet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe vessel will consist of, at least, the command pod, an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E refinery, and a lab, along with two side mounted 2.5m tanks and engines, likely Poodles for the efficiency. There will be a docking port at the aft, enabling other modules to be docked and pulled by this main vessel.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTheoretically, this vessel should be able to serve as a forward control point and refueling station, providing a foundation for establishing further infrastructure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t been able to test these theories as of yet, since I insist on using a career to establish all of this.
