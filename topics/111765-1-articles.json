I really like that they are simple and just work. I open my sub assemblies and pick the one appropriate for my payload size, and I am good to go.\n\nThey have not been updated since 23.5. I would think the new parts and more efficient lifter motors should be able to make much simpler lifters. Does anyone have a trusty set of lifters that has low part count and simple staging? \n\n**link to thread (or download link) will be much appreciated**\n\nmunshine thread\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/63050-0-23-MUNSHINE-LIFTERS-5-165-tons-to-orbit-including-low-tech-Career-Mode-versions](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/63050-0-23-MUNSHINE-LIFTERS-5-165-tons-to-orbit-including-low-tech-Career-Mode-versions)!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-02T20:42:17Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2015 08:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by nfpinto**\n  \nto make things clear"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T19:34:09Z","Content":"I\u0027ve been giving SpaceY Lifters a go lately, and the part count is not too high (relatively).

[Thread here.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93067)\n\nIf the part counts are too high, the oft-suggested option is to delete the fuel tanks from the parts folders. If you really only wanted the engines, you could delete everything else. \n\nIncidentally they\u0027re both by the same Author.\n\nWhoops!

Further complicated by the facte that you would have to recalculate everything everytime you add a part. KER doesen\u0027t make building any easier, it just removes a lot of the guesswork.\n\nAfter you have built a few lifters for different payloads it really becomes quite easy. If however you definetly want to use a pre built set I reccommend checking out the [Spacecraft Exchange](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/20-The-Spacecraft-Exchange) or asking around in the [Rocket Builders](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/52-Rocket-Builders) sub-forum. Just ask around in the bigger (or the smaller ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)) companies to see if someone is working on something or is interested.\n\nGreeting TXR"}]}
