There are actually many things that can cause the same issue -- and each of those things can have a different solution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, as far as I have seen, the most common problem that causes veering is \u0022too much drag/friction at the front of the craft, and too little at the back of the craft for it to be\u00A0stable.\u0022 Everyone who plays this game ends up being taught this lesson about aerodynamic stability for rockets\u00A0from the school of hard knocks. But\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eit is also true when you are on the ground.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0If a rover has too much friction with the ground at the front end, and not enough at the back -- then the rover will try to flip ends. An airplane on the ground is a rover. When your rover/airplane is trying to flip around backwards on the ground, it always veers left to do so, because of the way the game engine works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, how do you fix it? Very very simple. In the editor you open the context menu for the front wheel/wheels. You click the button to change from Auto friction to Manual friction. Depending on how bad the plane is veering, you manually set the friction to somewhere between 0.0 and 0.6. It\u0027s better to start at .6 and work your way down. If you want even more stability, you can do the same to your rear wheels and move their friction up to 1.2 or 1.4.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Klapaucius","CreatedById":181256,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-30T01:04:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223627219\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022185933\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221561840720\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022194568\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WaitingCynicism\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, WaitingCynicism said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi all,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was using mark thrimms \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E video for 1.3, and it\u0027s mostly stable once it\u0027s in the air, yet on the runway it curves even if I don\u0027t have engines enabled.

Most of the weight has to be deposited on top of your main, non-steerimg gears. The remainig, steering gear (be it a nose or tailwheel) need to have only the little remaining weight pressing on it.
