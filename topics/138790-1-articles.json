I\u0027ve followed the normal steps to create a regular object but I\u0027m having trouble with the model. I created the model in Blender, exported it into Unity, exported it into the .mu and .mbm.

A regular config file has the mesh defined in the PART module, but the wings have a separate\u00A0module called MODEL.
