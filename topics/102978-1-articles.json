However that may have been influenced by the fact that I know that neither of the latter statements are true.\n\nI guess that\u0027s the problem of natural languages: they are not implicitly logical. The same sentence can usually be parsed several different ways, especially if it is an abbreviated headline. Cue all the funny newspaper headlines over the years..\n\nCongrats to the chinese teams for a successful launch!"}]}
