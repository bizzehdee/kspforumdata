Because of Rogue System, I need \u0026 want to learn more about orbital mechanics, so I started searching the net and found that [xkcd cartoon graph 1356](https://xkcd.com/1356/) which most here probably already know. OK, bought Kerbal Space Program, and a whole new world has opened itself to me -- well, a whole virtual solar system of worlds that is. \n\nI like learning as such, but this is such a fun way to do it. It makes me feel young again.\n\nPlaying with far too many addons on my Windows machine (and now deselecting them one by one to figure out which one causes the game crashing, but perhaps it is not any single one but rather the amount/combination of them), and plain vanilla without any toppings on my Linux laptop (I was surprised this morning on how dependent I already am on the addons and how it had caused me to not learn some basic techniques of the game).\n\nIn \u0022real\u0022 life, I am teaching maths, information systems and philosophy of science at Brussels University (VUB) and working on a PhD about axiomatic systems for relativity theory. Before that, I worked as a programmer/electronics designer/sysadmin for about 20 years, among others at the Royal Observatory of Brussels (not observing the king, but the celestial bodies)."},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T19:51:51Z","Content":"Welcome!

I grew up fully expecting that by the time I was in my forties, there was a reasonable chance I might be knocking lumps off rocks on Mars. Instead of which we never got further than Luna. KSP lets me have a go at the sorts of things I dreamt I;d be doing, even if only virtually. Good luck with your games, nad may you have lots of fun along the way!"},{"CreatedByName":"Old Boar","CreatedById":147167,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T20:36:39Z","Content":"Thanks all for the warm welcome.\n\n@Esme: yes, that is exactly what I mean."},{"CreatedByName":"Plume \u0026amp; Akakak","CreatedById":142955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T20:39:50Z","Content":"Hi Old Boar, I played *Elite* on Amstrad CPC back in the 1980s.\n\nBrussels is a wonderful town. I\u0027ve been there a few times, for professional reasons or leisure, and I am definitely charmed by this city\u0027s open-mindedness and prolific cultural scene.\n\nWelcome to the forums, and enjoy your flight !\n\nCheers"}]}
