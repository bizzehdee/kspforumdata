Because of Rogue System, I need \u0026amp; want to learn more about orbital mechanics, so I started searching the net and found that \u003Ca href=\u0022https://xkcd.com/1356/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Exkcd cartoon graph 1356\u003C/a\u003E which most here probably already know. OK, bought Kerbal Space Program, and a whole new world has opened itself to me -- well, a whole virtual solar system of worlds that is. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like learning as such, but this is such a fun way to do it. It makes me feel young again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlaying with far too many addons on my Windows machine (and now deselecting them one by one to figure out which one causes the game crashing, but perhaps it is not any single one but rather the amount/combination of them), and plain vanilla without any toppings on my Linux laptop (I was surprised this morning on how dependent I already am on the addons and how it had caused me to not learn some basic techniques of the game).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn \u0022real\u0022 life, I am teaching maths, information systems and philosophy of science at Brussels University (VUB) and working on a PhD about axiomatic systems for relativity theory. Before that, I worked as a programmer/electronics designer/sysadmin for about 20 years, among others at the Royal Observatory of Brussels (not observing the king, but the celestial bodies).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T19:51:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome!

I know what you mean about the game making one feel younger. I grew up fully expecting that by the time I was in my forties, there was a reasonable chance I might be knocking lumps off rocks on Mars. Instead of which we never got further than Luna. KSP lets me have a go at the sorts of things I dreamt I;d be doing, even if only virtually. Good luck with your games, nad may you have lots of fun along the way!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Old Boar","CreatedById":147167,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T20:36:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks all for the warm welcome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Esme: yes, that is exactly what I mean.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plume \u0026amp; Akakak","CreatedById":142955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T20:39:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Old Boar, I played \u003Cem\u003EElite\u003C/em\u003E on Amstrad CPC back in the 1980s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBrussels is a wonderful town.
