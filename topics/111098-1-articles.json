The only \u0027corrupted\u0027 files I\u0027ve ever encountered were from drives with failures, and the occasional cross-system file conversions that weren\u0027t properly mapped. I\u0027ve never been \u0027successfully\u0027 hit by a virus on any of my machines. Since retiring in 2005, some of my spare time is spent cleaning and fixing other people\u0027s computers - virus removal. I know where they get their viruses from - sites and apps they shouldn\u0027t be visiting/playing with.
