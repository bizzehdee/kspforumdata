Also what the district can use.\n\nTurning in our laptops at the end of the year, is a long and tedious process. I was called down to bring my laptop down. I dropped it off, and headed back to class.\n\nThe next morning, I was called down to the media center. They then say they found a couple of viruses.\n\nMe, being the techie I am, asked how that was. They showed me the screen on my laptop- a \u0022free\u0022 virus scanner showing a virus.\n\nI kinda giggled on the inside at this.\n\nThey then gave me a little bit of a talk and I just nodded and said I had learned my lesson.\n\nthis just cracked me up on my way back to class.\n\nAnyways, TL: DR, my district doesn\u0027t know credible sources."},{"CreatedByName":"Duckytrask","CreatedById":92258,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T04:14:09Z","Content":"Thats it, pretty lucky.\n\nMy district failed so badly they got investigated by the FBI for wasting so much money.\n\nAnd of course they managed to mess up the firewalls, we could get anywhere.\n\nLast, we could get apps on their account.
