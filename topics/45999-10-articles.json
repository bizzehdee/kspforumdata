To set a color in an HSV-space be simply apply a flat tone to the entire object. Instead KerbPaint sets the hue, multiplies the value, and adds or subtracts from the saturation by the set amounts.

I think a custom colour saver would be a great addition. Sorry if I sound rude, and I don\u0027t intend it, I just really want to be able to have these colours in-game, if someone could maybe tell me if, withought editing the dll, I can adjust the default colours so I have my green instead of the default green, my blue instead of the default blue, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-28T21:36:17Z\u0022 title=\u002202/28/2014 09:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Espresso\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ESpelling and grammars.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mythbusters844","CreatedById":72313,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-02T09:58:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/f93CsLol.png\u0022 alt=\u0022f93CsLol.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a bit of fun, I too was sadly struck by the SRB FX bug.
