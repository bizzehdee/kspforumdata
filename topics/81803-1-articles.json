Sun is a dwarf star meaning it is smaller star than normal stars eg.our sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin was formed about 4 billon years ago it is the 3rd planet from the sun it was life less for most of its life a cold rock with a thick atmosphere and had no smaller celestial body (no mun) so it had a wild rotation and axis meaing it was very un stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis un stable ness would cause a it to go wildly off orbit meaning a hit would be inevitable and roughly 3.5 billon years ago an asteroid (25km wide)was coming straight for kerbin! It hit you can even see the crater on kerbin \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that hit carried vital elements for life to grow and spread! Eg.oxygen carbon hydrogen after the hit the debris from the hit now formed into a new mun that fixed the axis and rotation.the planets orbit also got closer to the sun making it hot enough for life to survive roughly 34 Degrees higher than kerbin today because of the thick ash in the atmosphere from the asteroid \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand then about 3 billon years ago a there was a flurry of single celled organisms into the world because the atmosphere had got cooler and a higher percentage of oxygen vital for small organism.and now the cold dead planet just 1billon years ago has been turned into a living breathing planet\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.7 billon years ago a smaller Asteroid hit the crater not visible because it\u0027s under the sea but this small Asteroid brought enough oxygen to support multi celled organism. also creating minmus in the explosion! Bring enough stability for organism to survive. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen 2.5billon years ago plants spring up turning grey rock to lush green grass and shrubs,meaning carbon Could be taken away and converted to oxygen then 2.3billon years ago small animals in the sea appeared like irl shrimp trilobites feeding on the new plants creating some of the first Eco systems!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut if there are herbivores there shall always be carnivores! One of the earliest killers was the thran it\u0027s was almost 30cm long! that at the time where most animals where 3cm it was the best killer it had a big back scales for changing direction quickly.Its main tactic was fast burst of speed it was green but when it did it attack it turned bright red because of the blood pumping everywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is where the kerbal\u0027s story starts it was one of the first animals on land (not including planets they already have a strong hold on the land.) they were called kaza like a lizard (5cm long babies only 2mm long and weighs100grams)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreen but only on its back it can turn yellow to blend into the barren desserts (that were most of kerbin only a few shrubs survived) it had a herbivore mouth it was also cold blooded so it would bask in the sun for the moring and in the evening go forging it was doing quite well because most carnivores dint have enough herbivore to eat to survive on land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.5 billon years ago more a herbivores move to the land because of the planets thriving this means big carnivores can come to the land and the main predator of the early kaza was a giant lizard almost 1m in length this was a giant at the time they were so big that they couldn\u0027t run to catch there prey so they would use there size and stomp there feat killing most small animals in a 10meter radius shaking the ground and making the animals unconscious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1billon years ago life has been the same with cold blooded animals but the kerbal\u0027s were warm blooded this is were the cold blooded animals survive the atmosphere got denser a lot denser thicker meaning it got colder less of the suns heat came through around this time the lizard had became a primitive type of monkey with big eyes and fast nimble legs and hands after it got colder most cold blooded animals dying! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.1billon years ago the start of what we would recognise as kerbal\u0027s they would thrive in the open fields there main group of these early kerbsls were In old koulous\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey would start using primitive tools the first tool was made out of bamboo it was a straw?\u0022 they think early kerbal\u0027s were scared to go down from the trees and needed water to they made a straw to drink from the near by lake very odd but there early shelters were tree houses they would clime to the top of a tree canopy and then use the thick leaves as a floor and twist the other branches and the roof very strange as well they were herbivores so they would pick the fruit from right in there house \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E250 million years ago they had a form of farming. they would find are fruit bearing branches and turn then up above the canopy so they can grow quicker and run across the top of the trees and pick them these farms could be 20km big and kerbal groups up to 100 so everybody was farmers for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen on old koulous the kerbal population was Booming and there was now where to go they could not go north the kevlastar complete ice up there no way to survive so they made rockets!!!! Or like them they would get a log of bamboo carve out seats and sails and make a boat load up at most 5 kerbal\u0027s but a mix of the acidic Kano a spiky plant and then light it on fire it would burn and the kerbal\u0027s would go shouting into sea the kerbal\u0027s thought there would be land some where and they found it young koulous they called it it was tropical at first landing pardise only problem not many trees so the kerbal\u0027s had to become omnivore\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E100 million years the kerbal\u0027s had flooded all along the coast line not going into the nearby deserts a smart idea because what was lurking in the deserts were something horrifying but almost 75 million years ago they found them even today we don\u0027t now if they were the same kerbal\u0027s the came from old koulous or if a different strand completely they were yellow so they blend into the desert but they were carnivores looke like kerbal\u0027s in almost every way but vicious teeth and claws but they attack first\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey were so aggressive they almost wiped out kerbal\u0027s on young koulous the kerbal\u0027s needed to think for once! They were quite peaceful for most of there existence but they made weapons swords shields made out of wood the Kano rockets they would kill any of the enemy\u0027s basic camps!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey were so effective they our wiped out last one killed 50 million years ago but now the kerbal\u0027s got a taste for explosion...!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHANK YOU FOR READING !!!!!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was just my imagination but you may not of realized but you learned there is some parts of this that our true \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will do more at a later date on my blog hopefully!!!
