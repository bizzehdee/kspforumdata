Changes include:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Uses pure LF fuel tanks rather than LFO ones. They have a much higher impact tolerance so the ship is more useful in the battle club.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Redesigned the rear half of the ship to look nicer and more distinctive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- More docking ports have been added.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The Co-102 is essentially an improved and modernised Co-23, which was itself heavily based on the XC-305. Due to using only liquid fuel I\u0027ve been able to remove a couple of the LV-Ns and some of the weapon mounts have also been removed to improve the shape. The result is a warship that is only 180 parts!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E As is tradition the TWR is very good at 0.5 though the LV-N nerfs have reduced the dV to only 4km/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027ve added docking points for both probes and 1.25m payloads allowing the Co-102 to act as a hauling ship or freighter is military isn\u0027t your thing. In the craft file these spots are occupied by a couple of fighters though these can easily be removed and things such as drop-tanks or rovers added.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Co-102B Download: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://bit.ly/1IFZm16\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://bit.ly/1IFZm16\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Co-102A Download: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://bit.ly/1Qynqpy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://bit.ly/1Qynqpy\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Fully armed with fighter escort\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tTyU4L0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tTyU4L0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECo-102A\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BoOXmvx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022BoOXmvx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna Approach\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dHZvoXk.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dHZvoXk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Loaded with I beam rockets, SRBs, and spare fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JWjt0dN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022JWjt0dN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-15T19:48:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2015 07:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Frozen_Heart\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ENew version\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMSP","CreatedById":124853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T14:01:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice spacecraft!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been waiting for another delivery ship from you!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooks great!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snowtiger","CreatedById":143589,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T19:19:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks amazing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KotDemopan","CreatedById":98561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T19:35:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStill the Corvette of my choice \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--ehtgZ6lm--/lj5tpgfvgdesamhdxcgz.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lj5tpgfvgdesamhdxcgz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T20:05:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EStill the Corvette of my choice \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHad people thinking I meant the car on several previous ships.
