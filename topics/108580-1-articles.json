Changes include:\n\n- Uses pure LF fuel tanks rather than LFO ones. They have a much higher impact tolerance so the ship is more useful in the battle club.\n\n- Redesigned the rear half of the ship to look nicer and more distinctive.\n\n- More docking ports have been added.\n\n The Co-102 is essentially an improved and modernised Co-23, which was itself heavily based on the XC-305. Due to using only liquid fuel I\u0027ve been able to remove a couple of the LV-Ns and some of the weapon mounts have also been removed to improve the shape. The result is a warship that is only 180 parts!\n\n As is tradition the TWR is very good at 0.5 though the LV-N nerfs have reduced the dV to only 4km/s\n\n I\u0027ve added docking points for both probes and 1.25m payloads allowing the Co-102 to act as a hauling ship or freighter is military isn\u0027t your thing. In the craft file these spots are occupied by a couple of fighters though these can easily be removed and things such as drop-tanks or rovers added.\n\n Co-102B Download: [http://bit.ly/1IFZm16](http://bit.ly/1IFZm16)\n\n Co-102A Download: [http://bit.ly/1Qynqpy](http://bit.ly/1Qynqpy)\n\n Fully armed with fighter escort\n\n![tTyU4L0.png](http://i.imgur.com/tTyU4L0.png)\n\nCo-102A\n\n ![BoOXmvx.png](http://i.imgur.com/BoOXmvx.png)\n\nDuna Approach\n\n![dHZvoXk.png](http://i.imgur.com/dHZvoXk.png)\n\n Loaded with I beam rockets, SRBs, and spare fuel tanks.\n\n![JWjt0dN.png](http://i.imgur.com/JWjt0dN.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-15T19:48:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2015 07:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Frozen\\_Heart**\n  \nNew version"},{"CreatedByName":"DMSP","CreatedById":124853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T14:01:15Z","Content":"Nice spacecraft!\n\nI\u0027ve been waiting for another delivery ship from you!\n\nLooks great!"},{"CreatedByName":"Snowtiger","CreatedById":143589,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T19:19:29Z","Content":"Looks amazing."},{"CreatedByName":"KotDemopan","CreatedById":98561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T19:35:18Z","Content":"Still the Corvette of my choice ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n![lj5tpgfvgdesamhdxcgz.jpg](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--ehtgZ6lm--/lj5tpgfvgdesamhdxcgz.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T20:05:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Still the Corvette of my choice ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nHad people thinking I meant the car on several previous ships.
