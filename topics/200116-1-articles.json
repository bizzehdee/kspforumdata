However, my Kerbals seem rooted to the ground there now. Did this change?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Fortunately I saved game before trying this, so I guess I can skip planting a flag if I have to.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK, so I kind of answered my own question. Turns out if I just sit there with the jetpack running they stay stuck to the ground, but if I also jump, they (just barely) can start to fly with a (just barely) positive rate of climb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-02-06T07:46:42Z\u0022 title=\u002202/06/2021 07:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 6, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by mikegarrison\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-06T07:47:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe EVA pack used to work.
