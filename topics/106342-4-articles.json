The reviewers who are new didn\u0027t notice them as much, or otherwise overlooked them assuming some of them to be legitimate physics quirks. More travelled reviewers probably felt nostalgic, and didn\u0027t believe that they took much away from the overall experience of the game, keeping their role in the score low. Non-specific scores probably compound this, as **Cpt. Kipard** notes.\n\nGraphics don\u0027t matter so much in sim or simlike games such as KSP, and thus play less a role in the reviews. I would agree that the game isn\u0027t well polished, but parts of that were likely taken into consideration.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T01:14:37Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 01:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NFUN**"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T02:26:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Can you list the flaws you found? (Not a snarky comment, actually interested in what you will say.)\n\nFirstly, a lack of time-based mechanics very much hurts this style of game. That\u0027s as much as I\u0027ll say about that.\n\n*Disclaimer*: What comes is my opinion that career mode should start as a guided tutorial and open into a free-form, player-guided experience.\n\nCareer mode being the default, this is the first thing most new players will see. I seriously doubt most will even touch the tutorials. They\u0027re over-rot and separate from the main game experience. This brings me to my first point. Contracts are a perfect method of slowly introducing the mechanics to new players. Contracts could teach players fundamentals over time, rather than the current info dump that is the tutorials as they are now. This being the case, beginning contracts need to guide the player; teaching them good habits based around part testing and world records. Part testing, as it is now, only teaches bad habits and not what the part should actually be used for. Players should not have to deny contracts because their current situation makes them illogical or impossible. The excuse that you can just deny poor contracts is not good design.\n\nThe tech tree should also accommodate this. As new nodes are unlocked, new, appropriate contracts will be introduced. Technology needs to accommodate the players needs. Basic solar panels should be unlocked before Mun missions. Ladders need to be accessible once the player can build a functional jet / lander / rover / rudimentary architecture. No part should be available before certain counter parts. 2.5m decouplers, engines, or pods should never be available before 2.5m tanks.\n\nIn an attempt to slowly teach the player. Not every building needs to be accessible from the start. Strategies can wait tell players are comfortable with contracts.\n\nSpeaking of buildings. Let\u0027s talk upgrades. The game should not be harder at the start. By locking conics and maneuvers behind upgrades, you are insuring that early career is several times harder for new players and only truly passable by experienced players. The difficulty of career should come from trying to get to the next planet, not artificial barriers.\n\nSo, that\u0027s some of my thinking. There\u0027s more, but, honestly, I\u0027ve seen so many good ideas on this forum with little improvement to the actual career mode.

It\u0027s hard to feel it\u0027s worth typing it all out.\n\nYou make some really good points. Some I agree with, some I do not. My main point of contention being the structure of career mode. I do not believe starting as a tutorial is the best solution, and that is because experienced players like myself who enjoy career for the challenge of not only managing funding but also giving a sort of sense of progression over the more freeform sandbox mode.\n\nI simply suggest that the difference be that a career tutorial be an option that you tick at the beginning on the save. That gives experienced players a way to skip the \u0022getting to know you\u0022 phase and get right into running their space programs.\n\nAs for technology and unlocks, I do agree that there are some really silly layouts for the whole tree. I actually just found myself looking for a 2.5 meter tank because I saw the skipper engine as an option. Ended up trying to slap an adapter to the bottom of a 1.25 meter tank to still get the power I was looking for.\n\nI also agree about the conics. I am practically able to make maneuvers accurately for rendezvous without needing the node whatsoever. It\u0027s sure helpful for getting to Duna, but even then I\u0027ll have that building upgraded well before I attempt such a mission.\n\nI\u0027d really like the \u0022Program\u0022 part of Kerbal Space Program to be added to the game. Right now, all I have to do is check to see if funds are there to launch a rocket or upgrade a building. I really enjoy Kerbal Construction Time and Kerbonomics, both add a sense of the program being much larger than its current representation. I recently purchased Buzz Aldrin Space Program Manager, and that is exactly what I\u0027d like to see in Kerbal Space Program. Maybe not so in-depth as to worry about flight controllers and SET personnel, but like you said but did not elaborate on, time needs to be a factor. In the craziness of finals, I\u0027ve left Kerbals on Minmus for 3 years and 407 days. I need to penalized for that. Perhaps a mod has done that.\n\nAnyway, thank you for your input. Although I feel out levels of dissatisfaction are vastly different, at least we can remain civil and discuss them."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T06:20:10Z","Content":"KSP is an extremely complex game, and at its core it\u0027s hard to play. The game is SUPPOSED to be hard, and for a while the hardness is softened by explosions and teh funnay that so many forum members think is horrible.\n\nSome parts of KSP are hard because of UI problems. Right clicking parts and then having to click on buttons (that, if your ship is rotating, are very hard to click) is a core mechanic and it\u0027s needlessly hard to do. Bugs in patched conics cause you frequently to not be able to place maneuver nodes or trust what they\u0027re telling you will happen. You have to bounce around the Space Center screen, loading and unloading screens when a simple \u0022take me to the VAB\u0022 button or menu would be far more elegant. However, most of these things do not become apparent until you have invested a significant amount of time into the game. The amount of time that reviewers simply do not invest.\n\nSome parts of KSP are hard because - well - the game is hard, especially for a beginner. You\u0027re launching freaking rockets into freaking space, after all, and any misstep along the way can sever your entire rocket stack into two (or more) pieces, explode your parachutes, land sideways, or any of dozens of other outcomes that aren\u0027t \u0022successful mission!\u0022 And that\u0027s assuming you can even get to space, which is unlikely without - again -investing a lot of time that reviewers simply don\u0027t have.\n\nSo the reviewers see this hugely complex system for building rockets.

I\u0027d just like to make it clear. I do really like KSP 1.0, but in no way consider it a masterful game experience. Sometimes the internet forgets there are states between 1/10 and 10/10. I just want to make it clear I think it\u0027s neither of those numbers.\n\nI agree about reviewers in general. I wouldn\u0060t trust them to tell me the time of day after all the turkeys they have given scores in the 70s for economic reasons. Dragon Age II is quite possibly the worst game I have bought in the last 20 years; certainly the worst one I was looking forward to a lot. And it got like 75%s to 85%s across the board. So I get your beef on that score. But I think your definition of a game is slightly weird. A sandbox is a place where children play games is it not? So you could say that the adult supervision of the traditional game designers is removed, allowing the players to make up their own games within a defined set of parameters. But you\u0060re still playing games. The sandbox itself just isn\u0060t the game. Just like a football pitch isn\u0060t a game either. You do need it to play a game though. The more regulated the gaming experience is the less replayability you will have, just like football would be very boring if it was choreographed. The free movement of the participants is what makes each game different. And KSP is similar to that.\n\nIf you work with children you see these two basic kinds of approaches to games as well. Some kids hate adult supervision and want to play their own games - with or without rules - while others become apathetic if they aren\u0060t told by an adult what to do. Rather than forcing freedom of choice on kids who don\u0060t want it or aren\u0060t ready for it yet you treat them differently instead. Sandbox games for big children who like freedom and your traditional games for those who don\u0060t.\n\nUsing your definition of this I do think it\u0060s fair to say that KSP is a masterful sandbox. Certainly one of the most impressive I\u0060ve experienced. Maybe it\u0060s up to the players to make masterful games in it. Let\u0060s see how it goes. The community seems alive and well, so if MP can be introduced ( I have a hard time seeing it considering the time compression aspect of things, but who knows?) even more walls will come down. Those who like to set their own goals may never run out. Or at least very slowly.\n\nAnyway, rave review at Eurogamer as well:\n\n[http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-05-07-kerbal-space-program-review](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-05-07-kerbal-space-program-review)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T07:22:54Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 07:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fishslap**\n  \nSpeling erorrs"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T06:55:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E No offense, but breaking down reviews into \u0027objective\u0027 slices is pointless at best.

I even agree on some of the minor points about heat balance for parts and faring separation could use a touch-up, its just the tone here that is totally effing ridiculous. 1.0 is amazing, the aero is basically there, it just needs some tweaks to how parts handle it to fudge into that real-and-fun zone. Roverdude and Porkjet\u0027s work is brilliant. I just feel like we got into this ugly weird loop after the Barn debacle that a minority of people felt like if they whine and moan loud enough they could get what they wanted, whatever the general prevailing opinion was.

If they didnt play through the whole thing, they\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4d explain why (\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4the game broke at this point\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4, \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4it was sooo bad, that after 3 hours, i seriously had it with it and there was no indication of anything getting better...\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4, \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4we made it up to the final boss, but couldnt kill him in time for the deadline of this month\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s issue - and we decided we\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4d still give the review this month, in the hopes that this final scene will not have a significant enough impact on the overall expression, to justify the delay of publishing next month, instead\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4, or something along those lines). \n\nIf someone doesnt even manage to get to orbit, in a game which is about space-travel, freedom of speech still allows said person speak about the game in private terms, but that person surely is not eligable for a professional review of it, imo. In that sense, a game like KSP can hardly be reviewed in less than a full workday by someone who has not played it before. Just like you cannot review a movie, that lasts two, in just one hour. A pro who does this, is not doing his/her job properly, imho. A pro-reviewer, especially one that likes the game in front of him, should be enthusiastic enough about gaming, that extra-hours kinda go without saying, if need be. To just dabble with it for like an hour or two is not fitting the bill of a pro-review. Putting a game that got rated top-notch back on the shelf by the same reviewer after such an amount of time, never to touch it again... well, that\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s like a car-reviewer keeping his ferrari in the garage all the time - it would show a lack of dedication to the medium, which is required for the job that person is doing. \u0022If you like that game, and if you even get paid to play(test) it, why did you stop after 1 or 2 hours?\u0022 The answer better not be: \u0022Well, i am not so much into gaming, really...\u0022, but its hard to come up with another, for me, at least.\n\nEDIT: Seriously, if a review has to be done in 90 minutes, there is something fundamentally wrong with the industry. It sometimes takes me 90 minutes to write an email (if i put some effort into it)! Like i said above 90-min-reviews on computer games is like basing a \u0022review\u0022 of a movie on nothing but the trailers for it. Under such conditions, the reviewers will have to look not for an \u0022objective\u0022, independent judgement, but for the fast and easy way out. \u0022Let\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s see what others have said... Oh, good reception overall? Okay, some 80\u002B% score then... - Now let\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s have a quick look at it to find some stuff to write about...\u0022.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T12:43:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 12:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mr. Scruffy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sonny_Jim","CreatedById":103060,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T12:43:01Z","Content":"I\u0027m interested to see a review from someone totally new to the game and not someone who\u0027s been playing it for years already."},{"CreatedByName":"Hanuman","CreatedById":116709,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T12:54:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I can remember a gamezine from the late 80\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s, early 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s, which would not publish a review before the reviewers have *finished* the game in question. .\n\nAnd what do those two things have in common?

The only thing you can do if reviews are that important to you, is try to find a source for them that you can trust, which is the same as it always was. \n\nIt\u0027s not really had much of any effect on me, as a demo or trial version was always my go to solution. If a game didn\u0027t have a demo, but still looked really cool, I might fall back to a review, but more often I\u0027d simply wait until I considered cheap enough to risk it. KSP has a demo, one that I put many hours into before I ever got the full game. \n\nGenerally speaking, I think that most everyone that posts here really likes KSP. Whether or not they feel it should be changed this way or that way or is perfect is moot, because that\u0027s something that always happens. There will always be people that want X or Y to be done super realistic or just the way they want, so you can\u0027t always take them at their word as being a life or death issue. The problem comes that even though they genuinely like KSP and want it to do well, they also spread hysteria over their own pet issue and bring things down for everyone. That\u0027s a shame. \n\nThis review stuff is just an outgrowth of it, which is even more of a shame. It\u0027s completely possible for a reviewer to consider something as being a 100/100 masterpiece game and not consider the world-breaking issue someone is a champion for as being anything important, or necessary to include in that score. If you call the review flawed because they don\u0027t dislike or even care about the things you dislike, then you are wrong. The review isn\u0027t flawed, you simply just don\u0027t happen to agree with it.
