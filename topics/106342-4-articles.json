My main point of contention being the structure of career mode. I do not believe starting as a tutorial is the best solution, and that is because experienced players like myself who enjoy career for the challenge of not only managing funding but also giving a sort of sense of progression over the more freeform sandbox mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI simply suggest that the difference be that a career tutorial be an option that you tick at the beginning on the save. That gives experienced players a way to skip the \u0022getting to know you\u0022 phase and get right into running their space programs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for technology and unlocks, I do agree that there are some really silly layouts for the whole tree. I actually just found myself looking for a 2.5 meter tank because I saw the skipper engine as an option. Ended up trying to slap an adapter to the bottom of a 1.25 meter tank to still get the power I was looking for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also agree about the conics. I am practically able to make maneuvers accurately for rendezvous without needing the node whatsoever. It\u0027s sure helpful for getting to Duna, but even then I\u0027ll have that building upgraded well before I attempt such a mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d really like the \u0022Program\u0022 part of Kerbal Space Program to be added to the game. Right now, all I have to do is check to see if funds are there to launch a rocket or upgrade a building. I really enjoy Kerbal Construction Time and Kerbonomics, both add a sense of the program being much larger than its current representation. I recently purchased Buzz Aldrin Space Program Manager, and that is exactly what I\u0027d like to see in Kerbal Space Program. Maybe not so in-depth as to worry about flight controllers and SET personnel, but like you said but did not elaborate on, time needs to be a factor. In the craziness of finals, I\u0027ve left Kerbals on Minmus for 3 years and 407 days. I need to penalized for that. Perhaps a mod has done that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, thank you for your input.

Right clicking parts and then having to click on buttons (that, if your ship is rotating, are very hard to click) is a core mechanic and it\u0027s needlessly hard to do. Bugs in patched conics cause you frequently to not be able to place maneuver nodes or trust what they\u0027re telling you will happen. You have to bounce around the Space Center screen, loading and unloading screens when a simple \u0022take me to the VAB\u0022 button or menu would be far more elegant. However, most of these things do not become apparent until you have invested a significant amount of time into the game. The amount of time that reviewers simply do not invest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome parts of KSP are hard because - well - the game is hard, especially for a beginner. You\u0027re launching freaking rockets into freaking space, after all, and any misstep along the way can sever your entire rocket stack into two (or more) pieces, explode your parachutes, land sideways, or any of dozens of other outcomes that aren\u0027t \u0022successful mission!\u0022 And that\u0027s assuming you can even get to space, which is unlikely without - again -investing a lot of time that reviewers simply don\u0027t have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the reviewers see this hugely complex system for building rockets.

I\u0027d just like to make it clear. I do really like KSP 1.0, but in no way consider it a masterful game experience. Sometimes the internet forgets there are states between 1/10 and 10/10. I just want to make it clear I think it\u0027s neither of those numbers.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree about reviewers in general. I wouldn\u0060t trust them to tell me the time of day after all the turkeys they have given scores in the 70s for economic reasons. Dragon Age II is quite possibly the worst game I have bought in the last 20 years; certainly the worst one I was looking forward to a lot. And it got like 75%s to 85%s across the board. So I get your beef on that score. But I think your definition of a game is slightly weird. A sandbox is a place where children play games is it not? So you could say that the adult supervision of the traditional game designers is removed, allowing the players to make up their own games within a defined set of parameters. But you\u0060re still playing games. The sandbox itself just isn\u0060t the game. Just like a football pitch isn\u0060t a game either. You do need it to play a game though. The more regulated the gaming experience is the less replayability you will have, just like football would be very boring if it was choreographed. The free movement of the participants is what makes each game different. And KSP is similar to that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you work with children you see these two basic kinds of approaches to games as well. Some kids hate adult supervision and want to play their own games - with or without rules - while others become apathetic if they aren\u0060t told by an adult what to do. Rather than forcing freedom of choice on kids who don\u0060t want it or aren\u0060t ready for it yet you treat them differently instead. Sandbox games for big children who like freedom and your traditional games for those who don\u0060t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing your definition of this I do think it\u0060s fair to say that KSP is a masterful sandbox. Certainly one of the most impressive I\u0060ve experienced. Maybe it\u0060s up to the players to make masterful games in it. Let\u0060s see how it goes. The community seems alive and well, so if MP can be introduced ( I have a hard time seeing it considering the time compression aspect of things, but who knows?) even more walls will come down.

They might call the devs for hints, even cheat, but pull all-nighters, if needed, to actually give a competent review in time for the next issue\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s publication.

In that sense, a game like KSP can hardly be reviewed in less than a full workday by someone who has not played it before. Just like you cannot review a movie, that lasts two, in just one hour. A pro who does this, is not doing his/her job properly, imho. A pro-reviewer, especially one that likes the game in front of him, should be enthusiastic enough about gaming, that extra-hours kinda go without saying, if need be. To just dabble with it for like an hour or two is not fitting the bill of a pro-review. Putting a game that got rated top-notch back on the shelf by the same reviewer after such an amount of time, never to touch it again... well, that\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s like a car-reviewer keeping his ferrari in the garage all the time - it would show a lack of dedication to the medium, which is required for the job that person is doing. \u0022If you like that game, and if you even get paid to play(test) it, why did you stop after 1 or 2 hours?\u0022 The answer better not be: \u0022Well, i am not so much into gaming, really...\u0022, but its hard to come up with another, for me, at least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Seriously, if a review has to be done in 90 minutes, there is something fundamentally wrong with the industry. It sometimes takes me 90 minutes to write an email (if i put some effort into it)! Like i said above 90-min-reviews on computer games is like basing a \u0022review\u0022 of a movie on nothing but the trailers for it. Under such conditions, the reviewers will have to look not for an \u0022objective\u0022, independent judgement, but for the fast and easy way out. \u0022Let\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s see what others have said...

The only thing you can do if reviews are that important to you, is try to find a source for them that you can trust, which is the same as it always was. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not really had much of any effect on me, as a demo or trial version was always my go to solution. If a game didn\u0027t have a demo, but still looked really cool, I might fall back to a review, but more often I\u0027d simply wait until I considered cheap enough to risk it. KSP has a demo, one that I put many hours into before I ever got the full game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally speaking, I think that most everyone that posts here really likes KSP. Whether or not they feel it should be changed this way or that way or is perfect is moot, because that\u0027s something that always happens. There will always be people that want X or Y to be done super realistic or just the way they want, so you can\u0027t always take them at their word as being a life or death issue. The problem comes that even though they genuinely like KSP and want it to do well, they also spread hysteria over their own pet issue and bring things down for everyone. That\u0027s a shame. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis review stuff is just an outgrowth of it, which is even more of a shame. It\u0027s completely possible for a reviewer to consider something as being a 100/100 masterpiece game and not consider the world-breaking issue someone is a champion for as being anything important, or necessary to include in that score. If you call the review flawed because they don\u0027t dislike or even care about the things you dislike, then you are wrong.
