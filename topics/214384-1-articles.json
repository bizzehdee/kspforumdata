We know a lot of them are there; we don\u0027t know how far along they are.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI think the 2019 alpha build was scrapped and what we\u0027re seeing is all-new codebase.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYes they will. There\u0027s a lot of \u0022low-hanging fruit\u0022 optimizations there. I think GPU min requirements will drop to somewhere around the GTX 1060 neighborhood. CPU min req will probably not fall that much because the game is CPU-heavy. I also think it\u0027ll look a lot better than it does now!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI think it\u0027s going to be straightforward peer-to-peer co-op/competitive multiplayer for up to 16 players, with some simple solution for the different timelines -- e.g. you can always see each other\u0027s game state as it is in their timeline, but if you want to interact, you need to sync your timelines\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt would be highly unconventional to have prepurchase with alpha/beta access, and Steam might even just not allow that. That\u0027s what EA is for.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI think funding is secured for at least FY 2024, starting April. Budgets for FY2025 aren\u0027t made yet although there likely are projections/plans. I think the publisher will keep supporting it as long as it\u0027s clear there\u0027s interest in the game; however if it looks like it\u0027s treading water or otherwise in trouble, I think the publisher will intervene e.g. by changing studio leadership, appointing some tough get-it-done producers, or similar. This will be very easy because the publisher owns the studio.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI think the price was set high for a number of reasons -- because they don\u0027t want it to be too much lower than the final price, and also because they must have known the EA is rough, which means they didn\u0027t want too many people jumping in yet.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI think it\u0027s extremely unlikely the price will go down before release, and if it sells like they\u0027re expecting, I think it\u0027ll likely stay pretty high for quite long.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-04T19:30:28Z\u0022 title=\u002203/04/2023 07:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 4, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Periple\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mcwaffles2003","CreatedById":180102,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-04T20:54:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224251727\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214384\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677935924\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022227067\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Moons\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, Moons said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is this EA build?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- is it pretty much everything that has ben developed up until now minus some assets that have no function yet?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- is it just a part of what is already there to show off parts of the product?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhen will this game be released?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- what is a reasonable expectation for the 1.0 build?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-- 6 Months\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-- 1 Year\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-- 2 Years\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-- 3 Years\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-- 3\u002B Years?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat happened since this Alpha Build from 2019?

I think colonies will have an assortment of hilarious or frustrating bugs depending on your patience and sense of humor. I cant wait to see peoples colonies they\u0027ve meticulously build get stomped like a sand castle by the kraken.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Interstellar update I believe will go smooth as I don\u0027t think it will add many new systems, just new planets/star systems and engines which should all be dependent on systems in the game right now being fixed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe exploration update adding resources and logistics systems I bet will be buggy as again, like the colonies update, it will be introducing new mechanics to the game. Supply routes will disappear and scouted patches dense in minerals will have nothing in them. The mechanics to retrieve resources will be be exploited to the utmost and a lot of balancing will occur.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, the multiplayer update I think will be a hilarious crapshoot as connection issues become great concern and people phase in and out of others realities possibly destroying plenty of thing (it will be a great time and meme content will be heavy)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat happened since this Alpha Build from 2019?

There seems to me a lot of inefficient processes going on and as those get worked out hardware requirements for the same performance should lower in kind. Some people on this forum I\u0027ve talked to that work say they work in the industry have mentioned obvious graphical inefficiencies that can definitely be made more performant in time and the current state is predictable assuming its development stage. I think KSP 2 can either go the route of similar fidelity with greater performance, greater fidelity with a slight performance improvement, or somewhere in the middle (but I believe we are seeing the worst state the game will be in right now)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:20px;\u0022\u003EWhat type of MP is planned\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003Efor this game?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey\u0027ve already announced in the Matt Lowne interview that there will be 4 agencies players can play from and each agency can have up to 4 players working cooperatively.

Also, I don\u0027t think IG necessarily wanted the game to get flooded with new players yet either as they probably want less total bug reports and ones of higher quality which would be more easily found amongst the more hardcore player base that would get this game at such a price tag knowing they will keep playing it no matter how it looks at the start. I think our community is uniquely capable of assisting the devs as a lot of people who play this game are engineers or engineering minded.. For instance, how many games have successful mods that introduce coding as a mechanic to play the game (kOS)? I think people like that will be of the greatest assistance to the devs as a whole and even the current community manager said our community is less likely to threaten murdering devs and instead write a short angry essay about a bug they encountered and how to specifically reproduce it with speculations as to what may be causing it (the entire forum right now).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-04T20:56:24Z\u0022 title=\u002203/04/2023 08:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 4, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by mcwaffles2003\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moons","CreatedById":227067,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-06T19:07:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224252048\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214384\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677963277\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022180102\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mcwaffles2003\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/4/2023 at 9:54 PM, mcwaffles2003 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy was the game released as EA and not as a pre-order with alpha/beta Access?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nno clue, semantics?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the answers i hope we get some more official info soon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSadly thats not just semantics thats actually a really important detail from a consumer perspective.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as im informed EA means you actually purchase the product as is at the time of purchase without any further guarantees etc. meaning even if the game wouldnt change from that point you couldnt even complain get a refund etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is also why i know almost no other EA game at this price since the price has to reflect what you actually buy at that point in time since everything else is out of your hands.

Its not about how much time has passed since a launch but about how much more investement is needed for release and what can be earned with the product realistically. And yes the time of release (why not simply delay the release to\u00A0 avoid negative press?) -\u00A0 the quality of the product released - and the price of the release (knowing the state of the game why sell it at 50 USD?) at least seem weird to me (everyone involved should have know that this release wont lead to a positive start - so why do it anyways?). Especially combined with the Fact that it was an EA release and not a pre-order etc. since EA actually means i buy the product as it is in the time of purchase which gives me as a consumer a lot of risk for 50 USD. Obviously thats just a worst case scenario that hopefully will never happen - i just wanted to point out that something like that can happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know but i honestly dont do that - especially since im one of those people that spend probably the first 2 hours optimizing the settings ^^\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes i get your point on Cyberpunk 2077 and Fallout 76 but i wouldnt compare them to this since both were pretty much the flagship product of those companies and i doubt that CD Project Red could even have afforded to drop a project that probably was 80% of their work-output as a company. I also dont think Cyberpunk 2077 was nearly as bad as people pretend it was - i was able to play it at release with rather few bugs compared to its size and missing standard features were bad but still left the game in a playable state.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-07T14:00:01Z\u0022 title=\u002203/07/2023 02:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 7, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Moons\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Uuky","CreatedById":226804,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-07T14:39:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224251727\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214384\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677935924\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022227067\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Moons\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/4/2023 at 2:18 PM, Moons said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy was the starting price for this EA game set so high - what are the chances of it going down to a more reasonable level before release?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP2 is a once in a lifetime experience with a once in a lifetime price. :p\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-07T14:39:41Z\u0022 title=\u002203/07/2023 02:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 7, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Uuky\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-07T17:13:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224251727\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214384\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677935924\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022227067\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Moons\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/4/2023 at 4:18 PM, Moons said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is this EA build?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP 2.0: Fetus Edition.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot a ready product, but wannabe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224251727\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214384\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677935924\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022227067\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Moons\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/4/2023 at 4:18 PM, Moons said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhen will this game be released?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- what is a reasonable expectation for the 1.0 build?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-- 6 Months\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-- 1 Year\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-- 2 Years\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-- 3 Years\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-- 3\u002B Years?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnnounced 2022.10.21.
