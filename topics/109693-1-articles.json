Remember that memory usage scales up exponentially with texture size so 2048x2048 will take up for times as much memory. You would actually save memory by splitting the objects up across a couple of textures. \n\nThat being said, I\u0027ve made IVAs for similar sized pods using a single 1024x1024 sheet. It\u0027s important to consider what areas of the internal space the players will see a lot of and allocate texture density accordingly."},{"CreatedByName":"cxg2827","CreatedById":57380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T20:31:08Z","Content":"Though, when you make the textures, isnt it a good idea to make it on a larger swatch since you can always scale down the resolution in unity? for instance, making it on a 2048x2048, but writing the part to have a texture resolution of 1024x1024?"},{"CreatedByName":"Beale","CreatedById":70533,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T21:19:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m working on the IVA for my 2K Command Pod.

How common is a 2K or even 4K IVA texture?\n\nPersonally, I\u0027d recommend 512x512, as low as possible.\n\nHere a little comparison between 512x512 (Downscaled from 1024x1024) and 1024x1024 on my own Gemini IVA.\n\nYou can save a lot of texture space by spinning things off into props, plus you can re-use them in other IVAs ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**512**\n\n![376884ab57.jpg](http://puu.sh/hR22N/376884ab57.jpg)\n\n**1024**\n\n![b1e591c7a1.jpg](http://puu.sh/hR295/b1e591c7a1.jpg)\n\nSo, it is the little things that suffer really, the chevron stripes get a little ugly and some of the \u0022panel\u0022 lines get fuzzy, but overall - depending on complexity of the IVA scene - 512x512 is okay, IMO.\n\nOf course, this is a really basic IVA scene, for something like a station part or lab, absolutely go 1024x1024 (But, I wouldn\u0027t recommend higher).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-17T21:22:56Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2015 09:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Beale**"}]}
