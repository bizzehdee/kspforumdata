They were inside a fairing. When the rocket blew up, the broken solar panel parts said no to gravity. Here\u0027s the screenshot.

I see your pictures, and that looks like quite the mess. However, with things like this, it\u0027s often necessary to know exactly what\u0027s happening to arrive at this point. And really, in this case, I think the most helpful thing would be if you could post the .craft file itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are several things that could be causing this. It\u0027s a lot easier for us to know what was happening within the game before hand in order to narrow down what the problem might be. There\u0027s been a variety of strange things that happen with fairings, cargo bays, and service bays. Any of those things may or may not be related. It could be clipping, it could be an add-on, it could be some other completely unrelated error that isn\u0027t being seen until you launch one of these vessels. That\u0027s a big part of the reason we ask for so much info in the stickies. If we aren\u0027t sure right off hand what the problem is, then we need more before we can even try to figure it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this does it with several craft for you, then it\u0027s better for us to see the various craft before exploding to see if there is anything consistent in what\u0027s happening.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
