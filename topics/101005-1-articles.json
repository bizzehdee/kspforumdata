My kerbal is on EVA on the Mun. I switched to a nearby vessel, switched back, and he falls through the ground. Possibly the most frustrating way to end an early career mission. Or indeed, a career as a whole, since I can\u0027t revert.

Having it set low risks kerbals and craft \u0022falling\u0022 through the terrain (although it generally seems worse for kerbals). Try bumping up your terrain detail a little.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as saving your kerbal, his status will depend on what difficulty settings you have. If kerbals are set to respawn, then your kerbal will reappear back at KSC after some time. If respawn if off, then you will indeed need to edit the save.
