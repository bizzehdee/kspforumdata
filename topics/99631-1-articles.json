My opinion maybe a little weaker, they are usable for large craft stabilisation where they should be for fuel saving smaller movements. Maybe 90-50% what they are now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB: Should they build up a non-direction speed? Like PlonioFludrasco said they could build up speed or heat so that they can only run for a certain time. The down side to this is that it is not true to how the real things work (see question C) but it is easier to implement, faster to run and easier for new player to understand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC: Should they build up direction speed speed? I reality reaction wheels have three (or three with a forth backup) wheels in different axis. The wheels build up speed as they exert a force. If they need to exert a 2 newton force clockwise to rotate a craft then 2 anti clockwise to stop the rotation this is fine and they are at rest in the end. However if as PlonioFludrasco they are trying to constantly right a craft on a slope then they will build up rotation until they fly apart. A craft making left AND right adjustments may not build up rotation but would stop working under option B but wouldn\u0027t in the real world. The 3 direction option would require tracking 3 variables and might be complex for new players\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConclusion: In my opinion maybe reaction wheel should track 3 directions. if right clicked on the wheels would show Clock or anti Clock and a percentage of top speed for the three directions. To make it easier for the new players each reaction wheel could have a bar like engine heat (starting at 50% of max?) that would only show the highest wheels speed and only if above 50 or 75%.

Designers therefore supplement reaction wheel systems with other attitude control mechanisms. In the presence of a magnetic field (as in low Earth orbit), a spacecraft can employ magnetorquers (better known as torque rods) to transfer angular momentum to the Earth through its planetary magnetic field. In the absence of a magnetic field, the most efficient practice is to use either high-efficiency attitude jets such as ion thrusters, or small, lightweight solar sails placed in locations away from the spacecraft\u0027s center of mass, such as on solar cell arrays or projecting masts. Most spacecraft, however, also need fast pointing, and cannot afford the extra mass of three attitude control systems.

So coding in regular saturation would only implent a new problem, which would force them to come up with some way to remember rotational speed during timewarp, which only adds to the lag and doesn\u0027t actually add anything meaningfull.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot to mention the Kraken itself, and phantom forces that would need to be fixed before you could even concider saturation in space\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Psycix","CreatedById":76916,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-14T22:25:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow about this:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReaction wheels get saturation in 3 different axis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPushing back and forth on the same axis cancels the saturation out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can dump saturation with a button, utilizing RCS to spin down the wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen in-flight using thrust vectored engines, SAS could automatically use the thrust vectoring the spin down the wheels as well whenever little torque is required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPreserving angular momentum in timewarp will need to be implemented.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor balancing reasons, the reaction wheels could now use much less electric charge to operate, and the saturation capacity should be quite big.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor simplicity, saturation is done for the vessel as a whole, no need to do it for each separate wheel.
