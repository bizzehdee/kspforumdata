Are there any special considerations to take into account when flying around on Laythe?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs a TurboJet the best engine for Laythe, or would a standard jet engine be better? Are the two radial air scoops sufficient for this ship at Laythe air pressures?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow does one typically mount the avionics package? It looks like something that should go on the front, but there didn\u0027t seem to be a way to do that, so I mounted it in the vertical tail (with a cubic strut and clipping on).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t meant to be a spaceplane, but I will need to drop it into Laythe from orbit. Will I need to add RCS to control it during entry, or will the cockpit torque be sufficient to keep it pointed prograde on into the atmosphere to the point where aerodynamic surfaces can control it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan I add a probe body to fly the plane? Does it need to be oriented in a certain direction or placed in a certain location in order for the Avionics package to play well with it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for your input.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-01T02:09:50Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2013 02:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Brotoro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NannerManCan","CreatedById":27019,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T02:14:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell usually people use the other 1 man plane cockpit with a flat front so you can fit the avionics on the front\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ROFLCopter64bit","CreatedById":58314,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T02:16:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat airplane... is better than anything I can make.
