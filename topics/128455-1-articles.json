I named her the Tantalus III, and while the backend isn\u0027t quite right compared to what we have in the movies, this backend does mean it can actually go somewhere because this is where I gave in to function over form. It\u0027s got around 3,400m/s \u2206V, a starting TWR of 0.37 and weighs in around 181t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd for all that you get 357 parts (once hyperedited to orbit) and space for a paltry two Kerbals, two usable docking ports, but no RCS. I\u0027d like to have gone further with the greebles, but my poor laptop is already straining with this part count, so if anyone with a supercomputer wants to have at it and add more greebles - please be my guest! So what can you do with it? Meh, you could stick something into the service bay (not that there\u0027s that much room) but probably space for a teeny weeny compact box of solar panels... If\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFuel flow.. Every tank does drain (eventually), but thrust is fairly well balanced, just remember to use SAS or Mechjeb, torque really is negligible. You shouldn\u0027t notice anything horrible unless you highlight the resources and cry as your OCD kicks in. And if you\u0027re an OCD kinda person... Don\u0027t even think about peeking inside the fairing or into the back end of the engine section. You\u0027ll cry. I did.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen loading, you\u0027ll need to select the probe core in the service bay as your control from here point. Sidenote - does anyone know how you can make a certain cockpit/probe core the default controlled from? Just open the doors and you\u0027ll see it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EDownload from \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalx.com/flipnascar/Corellian-Corvette---Tantalus-III.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbalX.com\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/zdMNU/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bubbadevlin","CreatedById":136524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-22T20:18:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVery cool!
