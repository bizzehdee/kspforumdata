The GUI for configuring the fuel tanks doesn\u0027t appear to work, nor does it work through the \u0022action groups\u0022 tab. Furthermore, cycling through the different fuel tanks types in the B9 pack only change the skin, and not the tank contents.

The issue persists with ModuleManager 2.3.5, or 2.4.4, or both. I\u0027ve attempted deleting the mod folders and re-installing them to no avail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks all for your help\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"skiparay","CreatedById":75467,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-03T01:50:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EApparently KerbPaint snuck in a rather defunct version of ModuleManager when I installed the it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFIXED.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
