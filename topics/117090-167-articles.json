The larger the torus, the larger the lab adapter. You slap that on one side, and if you want symmetry, you use the adapter part on the other side. Maybe the -H torus could have a larger hub than even it would with an inflatable, so the lab is even bigger in diameter. The idea is the smallest way to add lab functionality, and larger tori (meaning larger diameter matching lab parts) could have more capability (science storage, etc).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-24T20:59:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222728319\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022117090\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221472066324\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022138730\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shadowmage\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, it may well come to that if PBR is not a thing in 1.2.\u00A0 I\u0027m decently familiar with GLSL from my stints doing Android game development (its basically a trimmed down C variant).\u00A0 Shouldn\u0027t be too hard to add another texture slot and mix it with the diffuse texture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMostly I would be concerned if PartTools can export custom shaders to .mu files, whether KSP can read/load the custom shaders properly, and how much stuff in-game is hard-coded around the KSP shaders (as you\u0027ve found out regarding the transparency and highlighting bits; they rely specifically on the shader and texture-slot names from the KSP shaders).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExporting the models should work according to my limited understanding (I don\u0027t think PartTools treats the KSP shaders differently than any of the other ones). \u00A0Loading into KSP ...

shader name and material(s) setup (it is intended to work with user-created shaders as far as I know).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever the workflow for using AssetBundles is a bit... inconvenient from my experience (have to keep a separate .prefab file of each model up-to-date (separate from its actual exported bundle file), and it takes custom loaders to get them in-game).\u00A0 I would much rather stay away from AssetBundles if at all possible for those reasons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn that note I\u0027ve been deliberating on making a custom part-model exporter and loader that supports arbitrary shaders, materials, and animation types.\u00A0 Not that I really want to put that much work into it (and it would be a fair bit of work), but I really dislike the AssetBundle workflow that much, and am getting sick of the incompatibilities and lack of updates for the .mu

torus).\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n1.) Should the two largest torus be inflatable or rigid/metallic? (different answers for each is okay)\u003Cbr\u003E\n2.) How heavy should the inflatable tori be? (I\u0027ll be basing the other inflatable hab masses off of the bigelow module masses).\u00A0 The smallest one will likely be ~4 tons (HAB-E), with the next largest one being 6-8 tons (HAB-F).\u00A0 The G and H models will highly depend on if they are inflatable or rigid.\u00A0 Other input/suggestions are welcome though.\u003Cbr\u003E\n3.) Any desire for inflatable greenhouse/aerponics versions of the HAB-A/B/C (or even torus?).\u00A0 These would share external dimensions with the others but include some windows and shrubbery, would still include some habitation space so that they were not useless in a stock game... but in a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS game they would be enabled with converters (fertilizer\u002Bmulch-\u0026gt;supplies).\u003Cbr\u003E\n4.) Crew capacities of the inflatables.\u00A0 Should they be usable as space-hotels (\u0026gt;10 capacity), or intended as long-term habitation for smaller crews (e.g. perhaps 10 crew for even the largest torus)?\u00A0 I\u0027m leaning towards smaller crew capacities per-part.\u00A0 I rarely use more then 4-6 crew on a mission, and even if I did, I could/would include multiple different habs and other parts with more seats.\u003Cbr\u003E\n5.) Usable storage volume.\u00A0 Even at \u0026lt;10% storage volume, some of those inflatables will end up with several hundred thousand EC in a stock setup (~500,000 on the largest torus at current balance).\u00A0 How much of the volume of these modules should be dedicated to storage?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have been trying to answer this for two days but I am been quite busy lately. I hope i didn\u0027t miss the bus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1: I like the idea of largest centrifuge being rigid/metallic. I would have like\u00A0small\u00A0rigid deployable centrifuge that are not torus but its all good. Can I suggest non torus for the large part? Cylinder would do, but fancy centrifuge like the 2010 Leonov would be\u00A0intresting as well. Inflatable habitat might be innovative, but they are not magic, there is plenty of scenario where rigid part are preferable. As a exemple\u00A0I suspect that your centrifuge will end up on interplanetry ship more often then on station, so there\u0027s that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2:\u00A0Torus should be relatively heavy compare to their capacity\u00A0regardless of rigid/inflatable.\u00A0There is much more surface on a torus than on a balloon like bigalow. If you decide to go for non-torus like cylinder for larger part, then there would be some opportunity to have a lesser mass/volume ratio. So they might still be heavy but give a nice bonus compared to a larger number of\u00A0smaller part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3: Yes for greenhouse,\u00A0but no window please! It doesn\u0027t make any sence to have windows\u00A0on anything in space anyway. About habitat and greenhouse sharing the same part, see the next point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4: A station/Interplanetary Starship will never have the crew dencity of\u00A0airliner or luxurious room of a\u00A0ocean liners, regardless if its a space hotel. they will more likely have a compact barrack or pack of small room and the rest will be fonctionality/labs/storage space. A ratio of space dedicated to bedsroom of about 20% seem resonable,\u00A0Having said that, Kerbalism use the number of empty\u00A0seats\u00A0to calculate confort. I have a suggestion regarding this. If you design a habitat with 6 beds, put extra seats\u00A0around a table and other\u00A0utility location.

It is not a lab, it does nothing, it\u0027s an adapter. Make a copy of the adapter as a stand alone part, it\u0027s an actual lab.\u00A0Give it 2 seats, and lab functionality. The larger the torus, the larger the lab adapter. You slap that on one side, and if you want symmetry, you use the adapter part on the other side. Maybe the -H torus could have a larger hub than even it would with an inflatable, so the lab is even bigger in diameter. The idea is the smallest way to add lab functionality, and larger tori (meaning larger diameter matching lab parts) could have more capability (science storage, etc).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAye, I\u0027ve never personally liked the _models_ in EPL either -- I\u0027ve always used the MKS/OKS/UKS replacements.\u00A0\u00A0 The code and plugin however are pure awesome; well polished with good and continued support, more stable between updates than many other mods, but still with active development and improved features being added.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nRe: science labs -- might be a workable idea; a small selection of add-on lab parts using existing models, configs files are easy enough to put together.\u00A0 Hopefully the bit of info above ^^^ will make all of that uneccessary though \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222727699\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022117090\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221472027378\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022144204\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022StickyScissors\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 hours ago, StickyScissors said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally got my GPU\u00A0issue\u00A0sorted out,\u00A0here\u0027s some testing screenshots.
