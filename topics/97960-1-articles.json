You have to know delta-v of many maneuvers, launch windows, basic orbital mechanics for dockings etc. One way to do it is to use suitable mods and tools. MechJeb is an excellent mod. It can show dvs of stages, calculate maneuver nodes, launch windows and even execute burns. In my opinion space flight game without such capabilities is a joke (or good modding platform). But seemingly other people find the long series of guesses without information and failed experiments as a fun and basic calculations and planning as a cheating or at least too nerdy stuff.

Then you can make a lander. Real planetary lander probes go typically straight to the atmosphere, but you should to do a low orbit first, because you learn for future. You find out what landing needs. After that the last step is an unmanned return probe. You need also Duna orbit rendezvous and return to Kerbin.

It will fluctuate, but after watching it once you\u0027ll get a pretty good Idea of what\u0027s going on.

If you imagine a straigt line from Kerbin to the sun, and a straight line from Duna to the sun, the angle between Kerbin and Duna should be about 45 degrees (I think it\u0027s about 44 degrees, but 45 should be just fine).

How I used to do interplanetary transfers was to, eject from kerbin going the right direction. Away from kerbins direction around the sun to go inner. Or faster than kerbin to go outer. Get your kerbol periaps (inner) about matching somewhere on the destination planets orbit. Fix any inclination (burn normal on decending node or vice versa). Then when you get to the periapsis, fiddle with a node until you get an encounter on the next orbit. You may have to time warp a lot. try to manipulate your orbit so that it more closely matches the destination planet, so for duna, you\u0027d want to burn retro grade at the periapsis to get your encounter, not Prograde (this helps not waste deltav once you arrive to make orbit). Overall it\u0027s not much more inefficient than using correct transfer windows. You just waste a lot of kerbal years timewarping.
