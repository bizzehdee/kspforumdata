A colony of some sort. \n\nScoreboard (lightest colonies)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nThe mission:\n\nLand 12 kerbals on Eve. 8 of them will be in a colony.\n\nLand a glider, a rover, and a boat. Drive 10km with the rover.\n\nFly 5km (within 1km of the ground) with the glider. Drive 2km with the boat(we all know how glitchy the water is.)\n\nThe 4 other kerbals will return to orbit.

The imgur album format is REALLY convenient.\n\nYou can also post images from other sources by using the \u0022img\u0022 tag: \n\n    [ img ]http://www.somewebserver.com/myimage.jpg[ /img ]\n\nAgain, take out the spaces from my example.\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/faq.php?faq=vb3_reading_posting#faq_vb3_attachments](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/faq.php?faq=vb3_reading_posting#faq_vb3_attachments)"}]}
