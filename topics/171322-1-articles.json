I even make sure that the rocket isn\u0027t travelling too fast as to limit air resistance. I don\u0027t even try a gravity turn, even when flying perfectly straight up it finds a way to start flipping.

That\u0027s it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnsure the payload is either fairly aerodynamic, or encapsulated in a fairing. Ensure the fairing isn\u0027t much wider than the rocket it\u0027s launching on. Don\u0027t leave small stuff laying around on the surface of your rocket, unprotected by a fairing. If that\u0027s not enough, put some fins way down low to help pull center-of-pressure beneath center-of-mass. I feel this trick is a bit cheaty, but you can also set fuel priority to drain from the bottom tanks first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPast that, it would help to have screenshots.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-24T03:54:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCommon issue since the atmosphere was reworked a while back.
