I originally intended to do a full-on orbital insertion; but, well, I got into Kerbin orbit and found I didn\u0027t have quite enough fuel to both enter Munar orbit and get back to Kerbin, so I ended up doing a flyby instead. My Kerbin orbit was slightly inclined, due to some instability on the way up, and my final orbit ended up being both highly eccentric (extending about two-thirds of the way to Minmus\u0027 orbit) and highly inclined (roughly 60 degrees). Hilariously, when I did my retrograde burn to bring my perikee down to the surface, I actually \u003Cstrong\u003Ereversed direction\u003C/strong\u003E, so technically I never did complete a full orbit of any body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy capsule consisted of the Mk1 command pod, with a nose chute, two goo cans and a battery attached, sitting on a materials lab with three landing legs and two radial chutes. The legs turned out to be completely superfluous, as I came down in one of the oceans, but I was damned glad I put the extra parachutes on it as the materials lab actually survived to be recovered (another first for me). Total science gained: 166, bringing me to a total of 183 and allowing me to access three more tech nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"[email\u0026#160;protected]","CreatedById":80529,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T21:53:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell congratulations! I believe my first Munar encounter (wow its been a year since I started playing KSP...) was an experimental manned bunker buster test.
