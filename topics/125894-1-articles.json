Other than the direct game mechanic benefits, doing science has no impact on the player. And the more I thought about this, the more I see it as a missed opportunity. It could be done better.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nDon\u0026#39;t get me wrong, as a game mechanic, I think the current science system is very good and necessary to the game. It slowly introduces new parts for the player while providing an obvious goal/success metric. So I propose this change in two parts. First, overhaul the current system to make room for something new, and second, let us do some [I]actual[/I] science.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo first things first. Lets look at the current system. We make rockets, put experiments on them, collect the science numbers, and they let us \u0026#39;buy\u0026#39; new parts. But obtaining new parts, really that\u0026#39;s more of an engineering thing. So lets start with that:\u003Cbr\u003E\nLets change \u0022Science Points\u0022 to \u0022Engineering Points\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhile we\u0026#39;re at it, let\u0026#39;s tweak how we get these Engineering Points (Since we want to make science to be its own thing). So getting points from \u0022science\u0022 experiments is out. That\u0026#39;s OK, we still have a number of viable alternatives for getting these points: Ship Recovery and Contracts. Lets make it so that when you recover a vessel, you get a much greater amount of engineering points, based on how much of the vessel has returned, where it went (similar in concept to the world first achievements), and maybe a bonus for new parts used (With diminishing returns to encourage the player to progress and prevent abuse). And contracts, especially those part testing contracts, should be a larger source of Engineering points. \u003Cbr\u003E\nThink of it like this: the players pushing the boundaries of current technology spurs the development of new and better parts to further progress. These changes should be relatively easy to implement as it would be mostly renaming labels and tweaking values, as most of the coding infrastructure already exists for this. And gameplay wise, this wouldn\u0026#39;t change too much; part progression would largely remain unchanged, the tech tree wouldn\u0026#39;t need to change, etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo now we\u0026#39;ve taken all our old \u0022science\u0022 things and freed them from the shackles of gameplay, and now we can do something to really make them shine. So here\u0026#39;s my proposal:\u003Cbr\u003E\nLet the player do science. Actual science.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo imagine we are starting a new career mode. We click on the science center, and instead of a bland list of \u0022you did this experiment here\u0022, we are greeted with a mini encylopedia about the various planets, moons, and other things in the Kerbol system. We can click on the various entries, and it brings up a blurb about that topic, some data facts, maybe a picture or two, or a map with known (or suspected) biomes. But for the most part, the description is very vague, and filled with questions or other statements of uncertainty. Lots of questions, and maybe even some suggestions at how to answer them, giving the player a hint as to how to answer them. \u003Cbr\u003E\nSo then the player builds a rocket and sends a probe to the Mun with some experiments, runs them and transmits the data back. And when they look back at the encyclopedia, its changed. The findings of these experiments are added to the original entry, answering some questions, and asking more. The player has now actively contributed to Kerbin\u0026#39;s knowledge of the world. \u003Cbr\u003E\nThis research doesn\u0026#39;t have to be limited to the planets and moons either. Perhaps there are unexplained phenomenon happening on Kerbol. Or whats beyond the Kerbol system? What about the distant stars? What can we learn from them? Do they have exo-planets around them? Let the player point a telescope at them and see what they are doing. Add their entries to the encyclopedia.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd this can have direct game play effects as well. Maybe some of the smaller planets and moons aren\u0026#39;t initially visible: they haven\u0026#39;t been discovered yet. But our encyclopedia hints at their existence. So you build a telescope to discover them. Or you take a surface sample on the Mun that turns out to be way different from what general scans of the mun have hypothesized: you\u0026#39;ve discovered a new biome. Or revealed the presence of mineable ores on the surface.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOk, that\u0026#39;s cool and all, but lets make it magical: Make the science the player does parallel \u0026#39;real world\u0026#39; science. How do we know what Mars is made of? We use spectography and other experiments. So why shouldn\u0026#39;t my kerbal scientists do the same thing to determine what Duna is made of? There are numerous different experiments that we use in the real world to figure out what we know about our world: Telescopes (of each of the various spectrums), Spectography, Magnetometers, Cameras, LIDAR, soil samplers, space dust collector, seismic detectors, cosmic ray detectors, and many others. Each of these tells us something different about our world. We should be using those same experiments to figure out what kerbin is made of. The results we get in game don\u0026#39;t have to be \u0026#39;hard\u0026#39; science, a fictitious blurb for a fictitious planet would suffice, but the results should correlate with what is being done. This also gives the science experiments some value, connecting [I]what[/I] were doing in game to [I]why[/I] it\u0026#39;s valuable (beyond a numeric score), something I find the current game lacks. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhy do all this? Because I think it is in the spirit of the game. Many of us started playing this game with little or no knowledge of rocket engineering or astrophysics, but through playing, we learned about those topics. The game taught us what worked and what didn\u0026#39;t. And through that interaction, I\u0026#39;m sure some people were inspired to learn more. This change could help extend that inspiration to the rest of the space sciences. You perform an experiment in KSP, and it gives you a bit of text about what you learned from it, and then you go out and learn that NASA or the ESA is doing a similar experiment, and you know why! Or at least know what questions they are hoping to answer, or what the results could teach us. And that kind of connection is exciting!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;ve more ideas on the \u0022how this could be implemented\u0022, but for brevity I will leave it here. What say you daring kerbonaut explorers?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KrazyKrl","CreatedById":65849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T15:29:34Z","Content":"\nI don\u0026#39;t think we need \u0022Engineering Points\u0022 to replace the tech tree.
