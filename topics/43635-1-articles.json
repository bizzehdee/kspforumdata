First post here. I\u0027ve been playing for a couple weeks now and am having way too much fun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I just got a couple rovers to the Mun with a base but have noticed a problem. If I switch ships away from the local view with the rovers (to, say, an orbiting ship) the rover\u0027s brakes are off when I get back and start to roll away. It doesn\u0027t matter if the rovers are crewed, if I use the right-click menu or hit B, they always have the brakes off when I come back to the base view. Is there something I\u0027m missing to keep the rovers i one place when I go do other missions?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m in 0.21.1 and using the BobCatInd parts and cart.dll plugin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-23T21:39:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/47257-How-do-you-stop-a-rover\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u0027How do you stop a rover\u0027\u003C/a\u003E, beyond that it\u0027s likely your mods.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"annallia","CreatedById":75681,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-23T22:28:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMight sound like a silly question but it happened to me...
