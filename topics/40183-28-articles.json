This is a KSP check, and not a MCE check. So anytime you leave the scene or flightMode you can no longer revert that vessel.

So I\u0027ve been working on a mission pack the last couple of days.

These missions are designed to encourage players to do things they normally wouldn\u0027t do with a limited budget, like a Mun base or a Eve station. Missions that sound believable, but are different from the norm. They wouldn\u0027t be taken often, and they\u0027d be high risk high reward.

Basically I attempted to make a mission that would be done in flight test mode, given it has cheaper construction costs so I could do lower pay outs to cover the costs of the test ships. However it did not register the ship as valid at all. Or at the very least did not run the mission I had set up while in that mode. Is that intended or did I stumble on a possible bug?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StarLiner","CreatedById":64071,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T08:02:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf your game crashes mid mission, is your progress on that mission lost forever?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
