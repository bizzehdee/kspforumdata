As far as I\u0027m concerned, MechJeb and a lot of other mods, are tools, to be used to enhance to game play. I use MJ to teach me how to play the game better. The same goes for a lot of other mods and aids that are available. If one feels like not using a mod, for what ever reason, then that is that persons prerogative. The fact that I can learn by doing, trying different ideas out, some that work and others that end up in nasty fireballs, gives me the feeling of growing a space program. Without the aids that have been provided, by the hard work and grace of others, I would feel limited in my play, making me much less likely to continue to play after that first landing, or disaster, or whatever. While some people may feel that using mods is cheating, without the use of mods is just cheating ones self. I believe that one needs to start without mods, get a hang of how thing work within the kerbal universe, then slowly expand your playing experience by adding, and removing, mods, till one has the balance one seeks from the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI for one love this game.
