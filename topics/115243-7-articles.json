Thus you have to tell MechJeb to get into orbit. You are now the pilot.\n\nExample ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) You want MechJeb to do an interplanetary transfer, you will have to tell MechJeb do it. \n\nExample C) You want MechJeb to do a powered landing on Eve, you MUST tell MechJeb to do this. \n\nAs soon as you are taking an active participation in the controlling(directly or indirectly) of the aircraft, YOU become the pilot. \n\nAnd by pilot, I am referring to ANYONE who is in direct control, indirect control, in the present-time, in the past-time or in the future-time. That can be a service-technician doing some adjustments to the flight path on a automated drone 2500km away. It can be an active pilot flying the aircraft while it is in the air, it can be 50 people on the ground in a giant room. Someone, somewhere will have to take an active action in order for the air/spacecraft to do something.

I\u0027d actually be happy to see d/v and TWR figures put into the stock game. Maybe even a \\*really\\* difficult-to-unlock Tracking Station option for calculating launch windows - that would be really neat. I just don\u0027t ever want to see anything approaching \u0022autopilot mode\u0022, or \u0022here\u0027s what will happen if you launch this\u0022.\n\nCheers.\n\nOn that last point, I quite like the way that Kerbal Construction Time does it. You can simulate your flights all you like - for a price - before the actual launch. You can also start the simulation anywhere you like, from the launchpad to Eeloo orbit - again for a price. It\u0027s a nice way of having the game tell you \u0027here\u0027s what happens when you launch this\u0027 but it\u0027s still entirely up to the player to do the engineering and design iterations - that part doesn\u0027t get any easier.\n\nI don\u0027t have KCT installed at the moment but being able to sim my flights really appeals to me for the reasons described earlier and might also make me more inclined to try hard mode. Of course you could reasonably argue that sims do take much of the point out of a \u0027no revert\u0027 mode. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"TheSoundOfTrees","CreatedById":146842,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T20:27:06Z","Content":"I use MechJeb often.

As far as I\u0027m concerned, MechJeb and a lot of other mods, are tools, to be used to enhance to game play. I use MJ to teach me how to play the game better. The same goes for a lot of other mods and aids that are available. If one feels like not using a mod, for what ever reason, then that is that persons prerogative. The fact that I can learn by doing, trying different ideas out, some that work and others that end up in nasty fireballs, gives me the feeling of growing a space program. Without the aids that have been provided, by the hard work and grace of others, I would feel limited in my play, making me much less likely to continue to play after that first landing, or disaster, or whatever. While some people may feel that using mods is cheating, without the use of mods is just cheating ones self. I believe that one needs to start without mods, get a hang of how thing work within the kerbal universe, then slowly expand your playing experience by adding, and removing, mods, till one has the balance one seeks from the game. \n\nI for one love this game. I love the fact that the community has developed a vast amount of mods for this game. As I play, I also am learning more and more about how to code, learning how to mod the mods to best suit my game style. And more then anything, learning what really works best for me and my computer, and what bogs everything down, which can be unfun. So for everyone out there, play to the game style that best suits you, and only you, and enjoy yourself. For isn\u0027t that whats important?\n\nLastly, thank you community and Squad, for all of your hard work.

If I\u0027m using RemoteTech signal delay, which makes an autopilot mandatory for unmanned crafts, I still prefer kOS to MechJeb, as with it I\u0027m still the one in charge, as it\u0027s my code running on the kOS interpreter, and not the code of the geniuses who write MechJeb.\n- To plan maneuvers, I personally use a spreadsheet. For me it\u0027s way more fun to calculate stuff myself, instead of just using the results of MechJeb.\n- And last, but not least, data readout. This is the one function of MechJeb I\u0027d actually consider using, if there wouldn\u0027t be VOID, which does basically the same thing, but in a visual representation that better suits my taste.  \nWith 0.90 I\u0027ve been playing without data readout mods, as I wanted the \u0022stock experience\u0022, but after building dozens of crafts and always checking wet and dry mass by manually emptying the tanks, it got boring. For this reason I installed VOID again when starting a new save for 1.0.X.   \n(In 0.23.5 I did an Eve return mission without data readout mods. There was no mass readout in the VAB, so I added up part masses in a spreadsheet manually. Those were the times...)\n\nOn the question, if MechJeb is cheating: It\u0027s a single player game, you can make (and break) your own rules.\n\nIf you don\u0027t like piloting, go install an autopilot (or write one yourself either using the modding API, kOS, or kRPC). If you don\u0027t like fiddling with maneuver nodes, install a maneuver planner mod. If you got fed up with manually checking the dry mass of your craft, install a data readout mod.
