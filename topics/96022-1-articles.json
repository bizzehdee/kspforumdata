Outsorced RnD (funds to science) is considered OP by many but would be quite worthless if you were straped for cash and cant even make use of extra science because your research center isnt upgraded enough yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I somewhat favor rep to funds once I\u0027ve built up enough of a rep reserve to activate it while still keeping access to decent payout contracts (if your rep is crap you get comparably crappy contracts) and will sometimes do science to funds as well if I\u0027m flush with science points I cant spend because I need cash for upgrades. I usualy find cash is a biger constraint early on when needing to fund big ticket KSC upgrades and unlocking parts (I have it set to require funds to unlock the parts as well as science) on the other hand once you can spam sat contracts funds becomes less of an issue if you design a cheep one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
