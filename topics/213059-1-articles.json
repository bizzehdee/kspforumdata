You can easily tell the difference when replacing the problem parts with an equal sized fairing or resizable tube and normal nose cone. This makes rockets with these parts virtually unusable as it takes an insane amount of control authority to override the tendency for the high drag parts to flip the ship backwards. This is most easily reproduced by creating a rocket with a high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E and the cargo bay parts at the top\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"000PainKiller000","CreatedById":226566,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T12:47:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have noticed that the Mk2 cargo bay when closed generated more drag, then when it\u0027s open.\u00A0 Making it basicly unusable.
