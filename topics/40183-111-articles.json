Now I play hardcore mode most of the time so I can tell you that its pretty tough to get started in hardcore mode (Its basically a grind fest). And some of the early contract are really not enough to get your space program off the ground without grinding survey and EVA ground contracts on the ground (these themselves are not hard they just are annoying to try to do with NO TECH).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we need a new contract thats for early game development only. And will go away once the satellite contracts start to show up. So I\u0027m trying to think of something that is not to easy but has to do with space flight, crawing around on the ground on kerbin is not fun in my opinion and we need something to fill this gap? I will keep working on it but if anyone has any idea for a new early contract type.

This contract is to help out what I think is a huge hole in the early years of a campaign game. The basic idea is to launch a vessel (rocket) with early tech and land in a specific Biome on kerbin. Once landed conduct any type of research to conclude the contract. A lot of the early contracts are very difficult (hardcore mode) because you don\u0027t have the tech to do the fineprint contracts in early years without it being a grind fest. This helps if you turn off PartTest contracts and rescue kerbals to fill those gaps. The contract does not pay huge amount so you won\u0027t get rich off it.
