Today I updated some of them and decided that the subassembly in question \u0022Liquid Booster 2\u0022 should replace \u0022Liquid Booster\u0022 which in turn should be scrapped. So I clicked the old \u0022Liquid Booster 2\u0022, and then clicked on \u0022Liquid Booster\u0022, it asked about overwriting, and I confirmed. I then created a new replacement for \u0022Liquid Booster 2\u0022. The current \u0022Liquid Booster 2\u0022 works just fine.\n\nI swear I get more bugs than anyone else ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T15:06:31Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 03:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MathmoRichard**"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T06:52:08Z","Content":"You should try posting this in the Support forum section, since it apepars to be a technical issue."}]}
