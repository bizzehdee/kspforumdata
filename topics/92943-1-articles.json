While it is inferior to the turbojet in general (and has rather poor range, u need nukes for laythe expeditions ect), it is the EASIEST method to begin learning how spaceplanes work, and its not that bad of an engine provided you want to just get into orbit and do some docking or rendezvous whatnot (i use it alot for combat SSTOs due to teh ability to accelerate in space very well). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need to make sure ur center of gravity NEVER goes behind you center of lift at all times (or you get a plane that will do everything its capable of to flip backwards and fly backwards).

Ive found for efficiency you want approximately 0.01 intake/ton of craft. While many say its per engine, from experience, ive found that you need less intakes regardless of number of engines when you have less mass to obtain an equal AP on pure jet mode. so a 10 ton vehicle will most likely have 10 RAM intakes, others work, but are inferior in terms ofintake area/mass, so they add alot more dead weight one in space (ofc if you just want LKO/docking, this doesnt matter at all, but for say duna, laythe, ect, you need to use as much low mass as possible). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake sure its able to take off, this means ADD WINGS! Wingless SSTOs arent going to be efficient in teh slightest. Im not the best person to ask what the best lift/mass is (as i tend to use very subpar lift rating and above average TWR). One craft i had recently has a TWR of about 2-5 depending on fuel loading, and has around 20 tons of mass (18 without ordinance), and has approx 9 lift rating total (less then .5 lift / ton, which i know isnt very efficient), but i did that as i couldnt clip 500 wings together and make it look right, i lie my stubby wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, all you really need over a normal jet is LFO storage, and RCS (optional unless you plan to dock to stuff)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-15T20:04:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a link to my general advice for spaceplane noobs - \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100334-SSTO-Why-u-no-fly?p=1546536\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1546536\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100334-SSTO-Why-u-no-fly?p=1546536\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1546536\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeptin\u0027s Basic Aircraft Design - Explained Simply, With Pictures is something I\u0027d consider an absolute \u003Cstrong\u003Emust\u003C/strong\u003E read for anybody wanting to get started with planes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMod-wise, you might want to consider RCS Build Aid; it has a nice feature that shows just how much your CoM will shift in flight - which is one of many problems that usually squash the dreams of aspiring spaceplane enthusiasts.

And don\u0027t worry if you don\u0027t make orbit on your first try.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith spaceplanes, every change you make to one part potentially affects how you need to place other parts. That\u0027s one reason to start small. Large planes have lots of parts, making changes becomes tedious quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith smaller planes, you can very quickly see how different parts produce different results. And it can be simpler to adjust the locations of your COM and COL- center of mass and center of lift. Their relationship is critical to a plane which flies well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough air-hogging may benefit you eventually, I don\u0027t recommend immediately jumping to put 10 intakes on a plane with one engine. One or two intakes for your first single engine jet should be plenty. Again, keep it simple at first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your goal is to reach orbit, you will need to make a plane fly really high and really fast before switching to a rocket. You\u0027ll probably want to reach 30,000 meters if possible, and speeds of over 1800 m/s. If you can reach those goals, one or two tiny 48-7S engines and a little rocket fuel should be enough to get to orbit. By the way, that is absolutely possible without air hogging. It\u0027s a little easier with 2 intakes per engine however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI normally try to get to about 42,000 meters at 2300 m/s on jets, at that point a little nudge from a rocket gets me to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, my advice is start small.

The Surface Info screen, which is only available when flying/orbiting/landed and not in the VAB/SPH, will tell you a number of key pieces of info about your plane\u0027s situation: such as the climb or sink-rate (how fast you are gaining or losing altitude) much more precisely than the stock logarithmic altimeter, your precise heading and Pitch/Roll (which is EXTREMELY useful if you are near maximum cruising altitude, and know your plane starts to stall above a certain Angle of Attack), and just how far you actually are above the ground (rather than sea-level)- which is IMMENSELY helpful when you are landing a spaceplane and coming in low over the mountains west of the KSC...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll thank yourself (and me) later, if you install and get accustomed to these two mods now...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EP.S.\u003C/strong\u003E DON\u0027T try to use MechJeb2\u0027s Spaceplane autopilot features to get to orbit or land.

I read some other threads on basics to aeroplane building...\u003Cp\u003EI actually got a plane off the ground and made it to the island runway!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I crashed...whoops.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut even so! That was so exciting! I do have some more questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The plane didn\u0027t actually get off the ground until the runway ran out. I noticed that the stock wings didn\u0027t have any of the moving parts you typically find a plane (elevons, they are called?). Is this why my plane wouldn\u0027t take off? I also noticed the pitch was horrendous while flying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Every time i tried to turn my plane left or right while leveled out it wanted to completely roll so the wings were vertical. Any help with that would be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks guys\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Well, it sounds like you didn\u0027t add any control surfaces to your craft; \u003Cstrong\u003Ethe stock wings don\u0027t include them\u003C/strong\u003E (the only part that does at all is the Delta-Deluxe Winglet, and you won\u0027t want to be using that as a main wing body unless your plane is really, really light; as a control surface, I\u0027ll just say there are better options). The Elevon parts are the ones you want to add; I find Elevon 4 good for elevator controls and Elevon 3 makes a pretty good aileron. Standard Canard is a decent choice for a rudder. The AV-R8 winglet also works well as a rudder; never really have tried it for any of the other control surfaces but if your tech level\u0027s low you might give it a shot. KSP\u0027s stock aerodynamics also favors the use of canards up front to help out with pitch, but they aren\u0027t 100% necessary. The other thing you might be experiencing is having your rear gears too far back; you want them positioned so that they\u0027re slightly behind the CoM of the craft - too far forward and your plane will pop a wheelie before takeoff, too far back and your plane won\u0027t take off until it hits the end of the runway. Using the entire runway to takeoff isn\u0027t necessarily bad - you definitely avoid the risk of tail-strike entirely that way - but it is satisfying to see the thing take off much sooner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Again, I\u0027d have to see what kind of control surface you\u0027re using. But if you weren\u0027t using any control surfaces at all, I imagine that would have a lot to do with it.

It\u0027s easier to remember that the back gears should be mounted higher on the plane than the front gear(s). This causes the nose to be angled slightly toward the sky so that as you build speed on the runway, your plane will lift without even having to pitch up. If you mount all of your gears at the same height, you can either rotate the angle of attack on your wings upward to passively generate more lift (heavy crafts), or pitch up (hard) on the runway (light crafts). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) This is isn\u0027t normal. If the plane is level and you just point the nose left or right, the entire plane should NOT begin to roll over. In my experience, this can be avoided by giving the plane a tail fin (or two) with a control surface. It will act as a rudder.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketScientistsSon","CreatedById":83151,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T17:04:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys.
