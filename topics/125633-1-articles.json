I am making a few parts in Blender and I wanted to know about scaling. I read somewhere that 1m in Blender would be 1.25m in KSP. That makes no sense to me. Somewhere else I read that you\u0026#39;d make your part 1m and then scale it by 1.25 in the config. The stock parts don\u0026#39;t use scaling though.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is information is conflicting. Normaly, I\u0026#39;d just load up a part andsee how it looks in the game, but I can\u0026#39;t find the latest part tools. The ones I found don\u0026#39;t seem to work.
