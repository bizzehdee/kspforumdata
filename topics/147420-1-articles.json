What changed?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnywho, IMHO whatever was changed is a bit...aggravating? I\u0027m no rocket construction engineer (as I\u0027ve proven to you over and over LOL) but let me give you an example of the latest problem. The screenshot below is of a craft I\u0027ve built to, eventually, bring fuel tanks for attachment to my Sunoco Minmus refueling station, in orbit around...guess (I crack myself up!). This is not a new \u0022layout\u0022 for me as I\u0027ve used many similar builds in the past...but now they have a pronounced \u0022wobble\u0022 problem. I don\u0027t understand why...they have, what I assume are,\u00A0solid attachments at the decoupler/separator points. If the \u0022long, skinny\u0022 at the top is a problem, I don\u0027t see how going all \u0022Rockomax\u0022\u00A0would help (I want to bring a Rockomax Jumbo64 to the station on each flight)...it would only be \u0022skinnier\u0022?\u00A0? Anywho...this one\u00A0only wobbles in one spot...right at the Rockomax/Kerbodyne connection. I can alleviate the wobble\u00A0problem by going Kerbodyne all the way to the one Jumbo I\u0027m trying to bring to the station, but that craft has so much mass it is ungainly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Wobble%2001.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://users.frii.com/viciii3/Wobble%2001.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat am I doing wrong now?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-10T23:44:08Z\u0022 title=\u002209/10/2016 11:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by strider3\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-11T00:01:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTank-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003Esas\u003C/abbr\u003E-decoupler-engine junctions are known to be wobbly (a lot).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMagical solution to wobbling is struts.
