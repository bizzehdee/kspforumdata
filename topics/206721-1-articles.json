I built a ship (it has hinges, servos and telescopic poles), got it into orbit around The Mun, but when I create a save file while flying that ship, that save file will be forever stuck on a black loading screen. If I hit escape, it ends the black loading screen and shows the ship but the command pod is glitching and flying off. Same if I go to the tracking center, select that ship, and click \u0027Fly\u0027. It will get stuck on a black loading screen forever, until I hit escape, then I can see the ship, but I can\u0027t play the ship because the command pod is glitching off the ship. I did try to EVA a Kerblin from the glitchy ship, and it immediately caused the ship to explode into 300 pieces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I tried building a different ship, put it in orbit, and ran in to the exact same loading error/glitchy pod problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is going on?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-05T09:15:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScreenshots please. If you\u2019re using auto struts, those are particularly prone to glitching when robotics are involved so turn them all off before moving the robotic bits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
