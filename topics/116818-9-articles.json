Even without station keeping, unmanned orbits jump around even through saves. Simple scenario: manned craft trying to dock with unmanned lander. During approach, orbit changed a few times, making me miss the rendezvous by a few kilometers. After tweaking, I was at 1km away, saved, nudged it closer, my target started to jump around by a few kilometers. Loaded, target was now at 25 kilometers away. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Switched to the lander but craft suddenly dipped and orbit changed from 100x100km to a -70km x -400km orbit. So far I haven\u0027t had problems with manned pods. Mods too numerous to mention, but suffice to say, disabled all important ones one by one and ended up with Orbital Decay.\n\u003E \n\nSomething definitely is, rendezvous is a big problem, as for manned pods and unmanned I am unsure what is going on here, to be safe I am going to remove the download link again until I can get some stability back to everything!"},{"CreatedByName":"Whitecat106","CreatedById":140086,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-10T17:00:01Z","Content":"[@Svm420](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/136047-svm420/), I am starting to wonder whether the game bug [#9619](http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/9619)might even be intentional by squad rather than an actual bug, if so as you can imagine I will be pretty annoyed.. but I believe this is negatively influencing my testing and bug fixing of the plugin.\n\nBeen working on the Kerbal Eva bug today, fixed the vessel jumps on Eva bug, next I will be working on the rendezvous bugs and other close proximity vessel issues.\n\nUpdate 11th May,\n\nBeen working on 1.4.2 today, solved some bugs with Eva and proximity\u0027s, working on a new big bug with station keeping and resource rates, should be solved soon.
