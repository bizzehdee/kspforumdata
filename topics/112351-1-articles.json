I got lucky to start with in that I had several contracts spawn around the same time, each to to take 4 tourists to Mun and Minmus (with some wanting to land on each) and that got me started on running bulk missions to take a whole bunch of them in one go and to make the process as reusable as possible. So now I wait and stack up lots of those contracts until I have a large group of tourists (16) wanting to go to do various things at Mun and Minmus. \n\nI\u0027ve got a a shuttle craft (Moon-bus) that can take 16 tourists (and 3 crew) from LKO to Mun orbit, then transfer to Minmus orbit, land on Minmus and return back to LKO. I\u0027ve got a 5 man lander that waits in Mun orbit to take a few down to Mun\u0027s surface and a fuel tanker that can refuel the lander twice. I use an SSTO to take the tourists up to the moon bus 8 at a time and then bring them back down after. Once setup, the process is very reusable, just requires a fuel tanker to refuel the Moonbus and every other mission a fuel tanker to go to Mun for the lander.\n\nThe first run of this mission had high setup costs, to launch the moon-bus to LKO and launch the Mun lander \u002B it\u0027s spare fuel and put that in Mun orbit. But even with that overhead I made over 2 million profit on the first mission. Now I just have to launch spare fuel for the MoonBus and Mun lander so it\u0027s even more profitable. \n\nI\u0027ve been able to run that mission 3 times, taking 16 tourists each time. Unfortunately I don\u0027t seem to be getting any more of those 4 tourists to Mun/Minmus missions anymore, but it was a good run while it lasted. \n\nI also stack up several of the orbit/suborbital on Kerbin missions and use an SSTO to complete those. The SSTO I use for tourists is a turbo-jet based SSTO as those missions appear long before you have enough science to unlock the rapier. I\u0027ve posted the SSTO and the fuel tanker I use in these missions on KerbalX:\n\n[http://kerbalx.com/katateochi/TurboJet-CrewSSTO](http://kerbalx.com/katateochi/TurboJet-CrewSSTO)\n\n[http://kerbalx.com/katateochi/FuelTanker](http://kerbalx.com/katateochi/FuelTanker)\n\nBasically I think the key to tourism profitability is running as many contracts in one mission as you can and having craft that are reusable. \n\nI think it\u0027s a pity that as soon as your pioneer astronauts get out to further planets that tourists start wanting to go there too and loose interest in Mun/Minmus. That\u0027s not really very realistic, both in terms of what a real space program would offer and from a business economy point of view. I don\u0027t think virgin would be putting effort into space tourism if they thought that after a handful of flights that customers would stop wanting orbital flights and would be demanding to go to Mars instead. It would be nicer if the game gave you a steady stream of Kerbin-SOI based tourism and really encouraged you to design an efficient/reusable approach to doing those and made it a source of income you could rely on."},{"CreatedByName":"Enkiel","CreatedById":145063,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T16:22:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Basically I think the key to tourism profitability is running as many contracts in one mission as you can and having craft that are reusable. \n\u003E I think it\u0027s a pity that as soon as your pioneer astronauts get out to further planets that tourists start wanting to go there too and loose interest in Mun/Minmus.
