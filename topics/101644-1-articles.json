I\u0027ve tried the fix where you edit the persistent-file as to set all values in ScenarioUpgradeableFacilities to 0. What happens, is that after first saving the persistent-file, closing the document, and loading the career, buildings are still fully upgraded, and all values are re-set to 1 in the persistent-file.\n\n0.90 offers wonderful new features for me, coming directly from 0.24.2, but this really ruins the game for me. \n\nHere\u0027s the content of my GameData-folder:\n\n000\\_Toolbar\n\nAnimatedDecouplers\n\nBackgroundProcessing-0.4.0.1.BTSM.dll\n\nBoulderCo\n\nBTSM\n\nChatterer\n\nCoherentContracts\n\nContractConfigurator\n\nContractPacks\n\nContracts Window\n\nCustomAsteroids\n\nDeadlyReentry\n\nDiazo\n\nDistantObject\n\nFinalFrontier.dat\n\nHyomoto\n\nJSI\n\nKerbalEngineer\n\nKerbQuake\n\nKittopiaSpace\n\nksp-advanced-flybywire\n\nKSP-AVC\n\nKWRocketry\n\nMechJeb2\n\nmods.txt\n\nModuleManager.2.5.9.dll\n\nModuleManager.ConfigCache\n\nModuleManager.ConfigSHA\n\nNASAmission\n\nNereid\n\nRCSBuildAid\n\nRcsSounds\n\nRealChute\n\nRemoteTech\n\nSCANsat\n\nSDHI\n\nSquad\n\nStageRecovery\n\nSurfaceLights\n\nTextureReplacer\n\ntoolbar-settings.dat\n\nTweakScale\n\nVesselView\n\nUpon startup, no erroneous versions show up.\n\nPlease help!=)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-10T00:26:05Z\u0022 title=\u002203/10/2015 12:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kerbrud**\n  \nAdded information"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T00:02:46Z","Content":"32 bit or 64 bit?

After you have completed that, I would suggest that you delete the *ModuleManager.ConfigCache* and *ModuleManager.ConfigSHA* files, then boot up KSP. If that does not work, and you are running Steam, I would verify the integrity of the game cache. Or if you are not running with Steam, to uninstall, and reinstall the game.

Cache-files can make a lot of fuss when one is facing config-trouble!\n\nWhat\u0027s weird, is that although I installed KSP via Steam, I don\u0027t run it through it - I use ksp.exe manually. Also, in case 0.90 was borked altogether, I moved all the 0.24.2 to a different folder, making it playable still. Therefore, there\u0027s no conversion, as this install of 0.90 was practically a clean install. I may try reinstalling it, and from there install one mod at a time (which is hell, I imagine) until it breaks, if applicable.\n\nThanks for your suggestions!"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbrud","CreatedById":92900,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T20:43:33Z","Content":"I think I found the culprit!\n\nAs it alters things that has to do with upgrades, I suspected that Better Than Starting Manned was the reason why the buildings start off being fully developed. First, I got rid of everything in GameData, except for the Squad and NASA folder. I then installed BTSM, MM and Toolbar only. In the first test, I started a new career, and everything worked as it\u0027s supposed to. In the second test, it broke again.\n\nThe error COULD be due to MM as well, I might add.\n\nI noticed a few other things as well (here, \u0022modded\u0022 means that BTSM and MM ONLY are installed)\n\n1: Difficulty settings in vanilla had more options, such as starting funds etc - when modded, these were not present.\n\n2: The gizmos worked in vanilla - not when modded\n\n3: With ALL mods in the OP installed, RemoteTech worked, but the Stayputnik had no omni antenna capabilities.\n\nI hate upgrading KSP."},{"CreatedByName":"Thnd3r","CreatedById":137708,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T20:50:42Z","Content":"The BTSM mod doesn\u0027t support upgrading the buildings.
