I had created my own engines and got them all happy and working in career mode, then I noticed I made a small mistake. I had meant to give them an ISP of 320 in vacuum but I had fat fingered the 3 and hit 6 somehow.. Long story short I noticed the problem a short bit later and felt bad about my great career being made too easy so I fixed the problem and restarted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E170 science short of unlocking solar panels I was desperate for a good mission. I was getting tired of flying around kerbin and collecting science. No solar panels meant limited ability to transmit data. I designed a new ship, I used capacitors from future propulsion to store charges. My intention was to basically just send it straight up, burn all that I needed to get a kerbin escape then manage my burns to refill the batteries before discharging the capacitors all the while doing science and sending it home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch had a small hiccup from the start, the launch clamps hit one of my booster stage engines knocking it off (Only a 1.10 TWR at launch) this made me drift a little to the west, I was going to revert but I noticed with the help of the sas I was able to keep it almost upright. So I burned off the boosters and dropped them, burned off the core stage and dropped it then I started a burn on the final stage. I took a look at the orbital map and saw I had a mun encounter, I hadn\u0027t been to the mun yet on this play through so I decided to cut the engines. This is when I noticed my orbital path. I was going to get my mun en counter, sling shot around the mun and right back to kerbin. I swear this is a flight I couldn\u0027t have done if I tried. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I approached the Mun I opened up the goo canisters and the science module and transmitted the data back, I then waited until I was at my lowest point (12km) where I repeated the experiments, this time saving the data which I intended to return to kerbin. It was a great plan. Until I got to kerbin.. I completely forgot that this ship was not meant to return, was instead meant to drift out into nothingness until it ran out of power. But as I said, I forgot all of this so I did my usual return procedure, I staged down to just the science capsules/command capsule (probe core) at which point my chutes should have deployed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout 100m from the ground I finally realized why my chutes weren\u0027t deploying....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T12:44:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEyup.

I built a nice system explorer ship (capable of going from planet to planet). I had built simple small landers and attached them to the ship.

My next goal was to send a probe to the Mun to do a flyby in preparation for a following manned flyby.

Then, I launched my rescue craft, full of fuel and space for the crew. The Mun lander didn\u0027t have docking ports, so I just planned to EVA the intrepid crew into the rescue craft. After 20 minutes of fiddling with orbits and alignments (I don\u0027t use MechJeb - I would use it, but it doesn\u0027t seem operable on my system), I got an orbital rendezvous within 200 meters. I cannot describe the incredible satisfaction of manually reaching orbital rendezvous as I saw the two ships hover in space.
