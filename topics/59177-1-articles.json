I don\u0027t actually know what kind of information Protractor adds, but I would like to see a 360 degree protractor around the body you are orbiting, or focusing on, with the ability to set 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 as the body\u0027s prograde, retrograde or your craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere would then be a button to toggle orbit information, which would display various angles in the orbit view, such as inclination, argument of periapsis and the angles between your craft and the body\u0027s prograde and retrograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen creating maneuvers, it would show lines indicating the body\u0027s prograde, retrograde and rotational axis, and display the angles to these axes relative to the maneuver node.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
