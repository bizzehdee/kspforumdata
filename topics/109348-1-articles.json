There seems to be a limit set to 8 for lights being able to affect the terrain. It only applies to terrain and not vehicles. As seen on pictures below.\n\n![KSP_Lights.jpg](http://www.lacroixdidier.com/temp/KSP_Lights.jpg)\n\nIs there a way around this with an easy modification of a file somewhere? I have no experience at all in this domain. Or is there a way to select which lights affect the terrain?\n\nThanks in advance. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-17T12:06:21Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2015 12:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nookos**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nookos","CreatedById":144067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T12:05:22Z","Content":"Well. Turns out the problem is more complex than just a limit. The way lights behave is very messy it seems. Even with with 1 or 2 lights it doesn t work properly quite often. I had the most problems on the Mun so far.\n\n However there is an option in graphic settings. Pixel light count. This parameter can solve some of the problems but not all. And still no clue why there is a difference between terrain and vehicles. But anyway I ll just drop it and hope in future fixes they improve lighting so we can build outpost that are easy to work with at night.\n\n![KSP_LightsPixelCount.jpg](http://lacroixdidier.com/temp/KSP_LightsPixelCount.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T13:55:30Z","Content":"Just in case anyone is wondering, this is a Unity3D engine limitation."}]}
