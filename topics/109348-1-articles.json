There seems to be a limit set to 8 for lights being able to affect the terrain. It only applies to terrain and not vehicles. As seen on pictures below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.lacroixdidier.com/temp/KSP_Lights.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP_Lights.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way around this with an easy modification of a file somewhere? I have no experience at all in this domain.

Turns out the problem is more complex than just a limit. The way lights behave is very messy it seems. Even with with 1 or 2 lights it doesn t work properly quite often. I had the most problems on the Mun so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E However there is an option in graphic settings. Pixel light count. This parameter can solve some of the problems but not all. And still no clue why there is a difference between terrain and vehicles. But anyway I ll just drop it and hope in future fixes they improve lighting so we can build outpost that are easy to work with at night.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://lacroixdidier.com/temp/KSP_LightsPixelCount.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP_LightsPixelCount.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T13:55:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust in case anyone is wondering, this is a Unity3D engine limitation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
