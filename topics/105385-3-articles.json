The previously tame stock Aeris A3 is now a high-speed deathtrap.\n\nIn fact, many of the Squad-built stock craft can no longer perform their intended functions due to the aerodynamic rejiggering: Most of them are simply too fast.\n\nThis all illustrates an important point: Since drag is no longer added by every single part, only the parts directly exposed to the airflow, many designs that were already aerodynamic are now *too* aerodynamic.\n\nMost rockets don\u0027t have to deal with compressive heating on the way up because they\u0027ve already left the worst of the atmosphere by the time it starts to set in.\n\nAlso, most engines seem to have a fairly absurd heat tolerance, so re-entering tail-first is still a viable option even without a heat shield, depending on the speeds involved.\n\nAlso, if you use MechJeb, it really helps to use the \u0022limit angle of attack to 5 degrees\u0022 option in the ascent guidance (possibly changing it to something more reasonable like 10 degrees). This prevents longer rockets from tumbling when they try to turn.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T17:36:59Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 05:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by zxczxczbfg**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kagame","CreatedById":141304,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T17:17:54Z","Content":"Here\u0027s a helpful tip for re-entry: carry three \u0027chutes.
