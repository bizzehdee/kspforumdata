I am more of a progress type of player and i believe there are a lot more like me.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-size:16px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E\nThe lack of achievments in the career mode bothers me. Ofcourse the satisfaction of landing on an interplanet etc. is great on its own, but the lack of reward after a great misson is something to be worked on.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-size:16px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E\nHere are my suggestions;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-size:16px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E\n1. Funds are pointless after some point. After completing some big contracts with efficient spacecrafts\u00A0like interplanet explore, and you reach lets say 3m funds, you pretty much wont run out of money unless you have a fantasy of crashing all your vessels into somewhere without any reason.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-size:16px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E\nSolution:\u00A0Periodic astronaut/engineer/scientist applications to your facility when you reach certain reputation tresholds;\u00A0whom are higher level, have specific skills but require HIGH salary. Specific skills might be for example a pilot specialized landing,\u00A0ascending(more efficient launch), interplanet node master\u00A0etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-size:16px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E\n2. Science tree being the only progress.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-size:16px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E\nSolution: Some exoplanets can be added but locked at first. A requirement of a small tracking station should be landed on a moon or another planet to track them. Because we dont have enough technology to observe outermost planets or the alignment of planets do not allow us to observe them(this sounds dumb i know), we need to set up an observatory on another planet or moon to serve as a bridge and gather more information before planning a trip there. After we have done it, more planets unlock.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-size:16px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E\nSo far i have came up with these ideas.
