The first, and last apparently, time I was in orbit, I chickened out because I couldn\u0027t tell what was land and what was... uhh... not-solid. At the time I had no idea if there was even actual water on the other worlds and also had no idea if KSP had any mechanics to handle other liquid forms that could incinerate my craft. I was also only actually in space because of mechjeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I know a lot more, and I\u0027m still scared to land there. This is one situation where knowing more about your destination does not make it any easier to land there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would probably have survived the landing though. That was one awesome little craft I had. I used two giant half-spherical fuel tanks and anchored a huge toroidal fuel tank to the center to create a sorta-spherical setup for the main hull. Stuck RCS thrusters on the outer edge of the giant toroid and a cupola on the top of the top-side half-sphere. I then attached a bunch of fuel tanks and a few fuel generators (yeah, a bit of a cheat, but it did take some time to generate that fuel and it took a lot of power to make happen.) on the bottom, followed by a procedural fairing ring (non-decouplable) and then a large multi-adapter for a ton of engines. I then made it really smooth looking by forming my procedural fairings so that there was only enough room for the engine nozzles to barely stick out and have a little room to gimbal. Attached three symmetric landing legs to the outside of the fairings, strutted them in (quantums, cause they were still new to me and super strong), and that was that. Added a few lights to the edges and a few spotlights to light up the surfaces I landed on. A guant array of boosters for launching and I was good to go. Made it into orbit, waiting for the fuel to generate back up, and I was off. Landed on almost all the inner planets, and managed to get into orbit of Jool only to get my orbit screwed up and get smacked by one of it\u0027s orbitting moons and obliterated. A sad day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I\u0027d had KSP for about two weeks at that point. Haven\u0027t been out to the rest of those planets again since.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to projectile winches, I beleive all the winches can \u0022eject\u0022 their attachments at quite a bit of force so that you can attach to something at some distance, but there does not seem to be anything like an aim and fire sort of mechanism. You pretty much have to fire it out at the angle it\u0027s already in and hope for the best. I remember trying to tow a craft that ran out of fuel into an unstable orbit when I was experimenting with ways to de-orbit dead crafts without simply using the map interface to obliterate them. I spent forever lining it up, fired them out (dumbfire, got lucky) and attempted to fire a short, low-thrust burn to yank that offending craft out of its orbit. The damn thing didn\u0027t even budge, but my winches tore the back end of the tow craft off and send me into a wild turn-kerbals-into-green-goo high-speed spin which left even \u003Cem\u003Eme\u003C/em\u003E feeling ill in front of my computer screen.

If these are not equal in number, bad things happen (or so they tell me). The exponent data itself doesn\u0027t need to be referenced by the part config or the scaletype, they just get applied to any module found in the part when it is scaled. The way it was explained to me is that the name \u0022TWEAKSCALEEXPONENTS\u0022 is really a bit misleading. If only one number is provided, that number is used as an exponent to apply to the variable specified. If multiple values are specified then it treats it like a specific value where the value\u0027s place in the list coincides with the scaling level\u0027s position it the list of scales.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis lets you simply call this scaletype with this in the part config:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003EMODULE\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E    name = TweakScale\u003Cbr\u003E    type = KFScale\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s all there is to it. You can now make any changes you need to make for expanding the list of scales, or the values for the variable-handling, or even replace the specific values with an exponential value instead and all parts that reference that scaletype will take on those new settings. Now you don\u0027t have to edit every single part (including the stock-wheel configs that you have under a different project) to reflect any scaling settings you decide to change in the future. One possible problem could be if you want to create configs to handle other mod wheels, such as teh ASET wheels for that ERS rover system. If those parts already have specific settings for their scaling levels, then your specific values will not amtch the number of scale sets that the other wheels have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis brings me to another interesting little factoid about exponents and how it relates to your implementation. Exponents, as you probably know, have their identity properly at the \u0022#^1\u0022 (whatever-number raised to the single power). I noticed that the values you have in the scale levels exactly match the values for your variable. I think, though I\u0027m no expert here, that, technically, the value for a scale of 1.5 on the wheel would result in a \u0022 tweakScaleCorrector\u0022 valued at 1.5. Is that not, then, the scale-value raised to the single power? So, if you changed the \u0022tweakScaleCorrector = 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5\u0022 to \u0022tweakScaleCorrector = 1\u0022 then you would get the same result. This basically means it\u0027ll modify the \u0022tweakScaleCorrector\u0022 variable to equal the current scale setting. This would then allow you to freely expand on your own scale levels, and allow parts that use their own scaling sets to also use your plugin to drive their wheels without having to change how they scale themselves. Since you\u0027d be using an exponent to handle the variable change, it would never cause any issues with the scale levels and the exponent values matching.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027ve rambled on long enough. I have yet to be able to verify this stuff because I still can\u0027t figure out how to get the wheel parts to show the current setting for that variable in the context menu while in the editor.

I also added the file to the root directory that contains the TS definitions. One thing to note, however, is that all the wheels start as if they were all the same size. They haven\u0027t been scaled yet though, so scale of 1.0 on the really big wheels is, as far as TS is concerned, equal to 1.0 on the really tiny wheels. Some testing might need to take place on those extreme wheel sizes to see if the current levels those can be scaled to will work as intended. I\u0027m mainly worried about the tiny ones being scaled so small that they become completely useless. Also, I thought of something else that could cause problems with your exponent variable. I don\u0027t think that TS necessarily is able to change a variable that\u0027s not present in the part itself. So, we\u0027re going to need to update the part files to make sure that the default level for \u0022tweakScaleCorrector\u0022 is defined for each of the modules in the parts. I\u0027ll be looking at that next. The part I\u0027m a bit shaky on is how to determine if that variable in your code can be defined/overridden in the config or not. I have a good feeling that TS needs the variable to be defined not only in the exponent definition, but also in every instance of the module in the part configs themselves.
