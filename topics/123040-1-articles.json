The last I known they worked correctly. However, the radial decouplers always seemed to have absolutely zero ejection force. When I use them, they detach from the ship, but they do not \u0022push\u0022 parts away. In fact, I have to use the small sepatrons to get any kind of \u0022push.\u0022 But all this does is increase part count, costs, and complicates staging. This also limits me to using the decouplers that stick out from the ship so that I don\u0027t destroy a fuel tank with the sepatrons (I actually don\u0027t know if this is an issue, but I\u0027m not risking it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the STEAM version.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-14T21:33:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi deltalambdamu.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey do have ejection force, if you would like \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E ejection force please edit the \u0022ejectionForce\u0022 line for the decoupler of your choice in GameData/Squad/Parts/Utility/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\tMODULE\u003Cbr\u003E\t{\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tname = ModuleAnchoredDecoupler\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tanchorName = anchor\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tejectionForce = 250\u003Cbr\u003E\t\texplosiveNodeID = srf\u003Cbr\u003E\t}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
