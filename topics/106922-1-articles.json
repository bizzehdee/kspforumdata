As you know, there are several mods that currently or have tried to implement such a system in an interesting way, but the nature of life support means that this system is going to be mostly passive. Each of these mods does things a little differently, but it ultimately boils down to \u0027do I have enough X resource on the ship?\u0027 rather than adding any meaningful gameplay decisions. \n\nNow, I suppose one could ramp up the interactivity of life support mods and implement a system that would need to be monitored and checked and adjusted continuously. That may fix the passive problem, but then you run into the very likely situation that it becomes micro-management, grindy, or just plain annoying to deal with. So no matter which type of system you make, passive or interactive, there are gameplay problems that come with them, and not a lot of benefit to be gained. As well, there are varying opinions on how Kerbals should respond...should they die? or simply become inactive for a while? Or maybe even some other gameplay detriment/effect. There are many possibilities, so no 1 system can effectively cover what each player expects.\n\nThe best bet with this is simply to allow the player to choose which type of life support system (or not) they want to use. There are several mods that do the job wonderfully, but differently enough that they are distinct. If Squad implemented such a system into stock, it would maybe satisfy 1/4th of the players, while the rest are looking for something completely different anyway. I\u0027m not saying they couldn\u0027t do it...they certainly could...but their time is probably better spent implementing other features and fixes to the rest of the game, while leaving relatively minor stuff like this to the modders."},{"CreatedByName":"rodion_herrera","CreatedById":66284,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T18:11:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E As well, there are varying opinions on how Kerbals should respond...should they die? or simply become inactive for a while?

A number of other features really do need to be present for that to work, most notably some sort of overview system that lets you track at a glance the current profile of each and every mission. We have a framework for that with the tracking station, but it would need considerable expanding for life support to work. We\u0027d need at-a-glance knowledge of how long each ship is going to last with current life support supplies, if nothing else. The VAB/SPH scene would also need a new widget to tell us how long the crew can be expected to survive on what they have. And of course, you\u0027d see a lot of players who don\u0027t use life support complaining that their Kerbals are dying on their long missions because they didn\u0027t give them enough LS. Getting the Engineer\u0027s Report to correctly assess your life support needs would be quite a trick indeed, given that the editor has no way of knowing where you\u0027re planning to send that thing (or when, for that matter)."},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T18:30:21Z","Content":"I think a possible solution to the Kerbal death in space issue would be to have Kerbals be to LS as probe cores are to ElectricCharge. Kerbals don\u0027t die when they run out of LS, they simply cease to function, and could be brought back to life with a resupply mission. You could also have hibernation type missions where after launching you lock the LS resources and have a probe core guide the mission to a destination."},{"CreatedByName":"rodion_herrera","CreatedById":66284,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T18:31:53Z","Content":"I have a feeling this thing is again going the fun vs. realism route, and I\u0027m sorry but I\u0027m really biased towards realism. I mean, I believe people will appreciate WHY space missions are difficult (and more expensive) for living beings (as compared to just sending probes) better, if such a system is in place in KSP. I mean when I first found out that KSP did not have one back in 2013, I said to myself, so there\u0027s practically no difference in sending Kerbals to do a mission, and doing the same mission with a probe, so why bother with Kerbals? Sure, sure, the addition of the science aspect, and now the resource collection aspect makes their presence on a surface more meaningful now that just automate the entire process with robotic explorers. But if Squad DID eventually allow for science and resource collection, I think the next great revolution is the implementation of a life support system, again, to GIVE MEANING as to why we use Kerbals for our missions. Remember the PC Gamer review? I liked the line which says \u0022WE DID THAT.\u0022 but we did it with great effort and difficulty, remembering Kennedy\u0027s words, \u0022...not because they are easy, but because they are hard.\u0022 Manned missions are hard, and KSP should evolve just to show how hard it can be.\n\nOr just flip the LSS off with a toggle. That alone can make both sides of the debate happy.\n\nKSP has so much potential to convince the general public that space exploration is the future of humankind, thus the suggestions I often make are more or less pushing towards this encouragement.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T18:34:27Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 06:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rodion\\_herrera**"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T18:32:03Z","Content":"Life support should not be essential, but it would be cool to have as an optional thing.\n\nFor one simple example, tourists would pay more for their joyrides if they never run out of snacks. You\u0027d have to account for life support used in the interim each time you took control of a spacecraft, but that would be easy to accomplish - just give each manned ship a variable stating what was the last time it went from a full simulation to being on rails, and then subtract N rations per kerbal per hour since that time.\n\nYou could also make it a new mission type, to deliver supplies to one of your space stations."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T18:33:40Z","Content":"Guys, if they are going to implement life support they might as well implement N-body physics.

At the moment, you can rescue the pilot by sending another rocket any time in the future to match velocities and have the pilot spacewalk across. But you can only do this because the pilot can still function days or years in the future.
