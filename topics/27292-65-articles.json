Redesigned the booster for my Barn Burner Superheavy 7 and was finally able to get it up without UVDs or cannibalizing the payload\u0027s fuel. The booster had just enough fuel to get it into an 80k orbit, drop the payload, and burn to de-orbit (I ordinarily put stuff down to 1700 m/s for deorbit; she had just enough fuel to get down to 2100 m/s but that\u0027s enough of course).

Used it to set out the 10k, 15k, 20k, and 25k marks (stopping to re-label each one as a base, then targeting the one I dropped when I moved on to the next mark). I included a KER flight computer to help keep things lined up within one ten-thousandth of a degree (latitude, of course, since it\u0027s an east-west runway). Went ahead and set the rover itself out at 30k and made it the 30k marker (if I hadn\u0027t already earned my ground transport instrument for Kerbin, I would\u0027ve last night). Tried the system out with a Ravenspear Mk4 after I finished docking the Barn Burner (so I\u0027d have some daylight for the trial run); it worked for the alignment. Unfortunately, I still need to learn how to pilot spaceplanes; lithobraked just short of the runway. At least I was aligned properly...and didn\u0027t take out the 0k marker in the process......\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday, I plan to finally launch the Castle Romeo mission.
