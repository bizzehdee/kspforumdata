The following is compiled from \u0022interviews\u0022 with NovaSilisko on the IRC, questions answered in this thread, pictures and comments posted in this thread and on the devblog, and the Game Info section. Oh, and a lot of fictional science. Here goes, it\u0027s no TR;DL.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I have determined about the laws of gravitation in the Microverse; It seems that although there is an attractive force that behaves along the inverse square law, that attracts all matter constantly, there is no gravitation. Matter does not attract to itself by means of a mass-based gravital force, instead the only source of \u0022gravity\u0022 is provided by the Static Gravitational Cores (SGC). These cores seem to produce similar effects to a moving vehicle as would a black hole, and a certain amount of matter will find itself distributed amongst the SGCs in the system. SGCs do not \u0022suck\u0022 things in (unlike the aforementioned black holes of our universe), they do seem to have a surface by which matter will fall upon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn odd incidence has been noted, that gas seems to be attracted to a SGC more than solid or liquid matter. However, unlike what one may expect from following the simple laws of gravitation, the atmospheres of \u0022planets\u0022 Do not extend to such large sizes as they ought to. Indeed, a thin atmosphere only 50 meters tall may yield a pressure of around 1 atm at the bottom, and a near-vacuum at the top. This certainly must not be correlated to a lack of natural gaseous materials in the Microverse; as then you would expect to find very low atmospheric pressure at the bottom of an atmosphere. A mathematical law has not yet been named which can describe the attraction of gaseous material to a planet. Perhaps it is not even more attracted to the SGC, and it is the planet itself which is attracting the gas. The only explanation seems to be that the state of matter that we know as gas is replaced by a much more exotic state of matter in the microverse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot all matter in a \u0022star system\u0022 has been found on an SGC. There are chunks of rocks and ice which hold themselves together by normal atomic forces that can best be described as \u0022Asteroids\u0022. These asteroids rarely get larger than 6 meters, presumably because they will find themselves torn apart by gravitational forces if they are too large. Asteroids are almost never in stable orbits, though there has been a recorded incidence of a semi-stable orbit of the asteroid labeled \u0022Greg[roxmun].\u0022 This orbit is powered by the static gravitation of all planets, and found itself skipping off of the surface of the planet and back into an orbit several times before finally crashing into the surface. Because there are no permanently stable orbits, the older a system is, the less asteroids you would find. All matter will inevitably either be knocked out of the entire system or fall into and become part of a planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the \u0022center\u0022 of every \u0022solar system\u0022, there is one (although perhaps more could exist close by) LARGE static gravitational core. It seems that it is a similar object to a SGC, but it is so hot that it will vaporize anything near it\u0027s surface into a gas (which will then cool down or become part of an atmosphere), and the radiation pressure from the \u0022star\u0022 will push away any gas more than gravity will pull it in. The interesting thing about \u0022Stars\u0022 is that they always form near the gravitational center of the other SGCs. This calls into being an explanation of the formation of Star Systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs best as can be determined, here is the hypothesis for which the microverse forms. None of which has been entirely proven. It is as follows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Microverse started with a non-uniform, but mostly static cloud of elements. These elements behave almost identically to our elements, so they can be given traditional labels that correspond to the elements of our own universe. Most of the cloud is lint and dust, but also gases. The elemental cloud uniformly spans the entire Microverse. The composition is in the same order of the most common known elements of our universe. Over time, \u0022Star-SGCs\u0022 spawn (or simply \u0022pop\u0022 into existence) around randomly, and they attract the cloud to them (until they get to close and are blown back). Then, around these S-SGCs form normal SGCs. At first it is rapid, then over time it slows down exponentially until the rate at which SGCs spawn is practically 0. Larger SGCs have more \u0022gravity\u0022, and attract more materials. Since most of the material is gases like Hydrogen, they are blown by solar radiation out to the outer SGCs and away from the inner SGCs. The inner SGCs attract ices and silicates and metals which would not have been blown away. This continues until all of the mass in the immediate area of the star system is in the system. The S-SGCs seem to spawn in clumps, what we may call \u0022Galaxies.\u0022 The mass in between stars gradually falls into their systems and the mass in between galaxies gradually falls into them as more SGCs and S-SGCs spawn. After millions of years, the rate at which SGCs spawn is practically 0, and the cloud is now semi-stable in Static Gravitational Cores. SGCs and S-SGCs only ever seem to spawn around eachother.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is also evidence to believe that there are superdense SGCs that are not static. They have not been directly observed, as they would be naked. These naked gravitational cores (or NGCs) would move randomly with some slight tendency to gravity. They would be dense enough that they would have an event horizon that would rip apart matter to its subatomic particles if they went near enough. No material would adhere to their surface. This could be the answer to the problem of how different elements could form, as the subatomic particles may recombine to heavier elements in certain conditions. It is unknown if fusion could occur with Microverse Matter, but if it can then fusion would likely be common \u003Cem\u003Enear\u003C/em\u003E the event horizon of a NGCs. NGCs could have formed much earlier than SGCs, and perhaps they disappear over time. If so, this could be the explanation for the diversity of elements in the Early-Microverse Cloud.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Microverse is not expanding over time like the UnivPrime4 is, but there will be an end. Although the amount of SGCs that spawn over time does decrease exponentially, it never QUITE reaches zero. In trillions and trillions and trillions of years, the amount of SGCs in the microverse will have filled it up so that it is uniformly filled with SGCs. At that point, the Microverse is dead.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-28T12:32:46Z\u0022 title=\u002210/28/2014 12:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-28T00:02:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENova, you ought to get on the IRC more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-28T00:34:24Z\u0022 title=\u002210/28/2014 12:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-28T12:10:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just realized that Hoppers somehow remind me of WALL-E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-28T12:29:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are only a few species of animals observed in the microverse.
