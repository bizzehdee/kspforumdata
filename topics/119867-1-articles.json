(c/Planck\u0027s time). You couldn\u0027t exactly fit a non-singularity through them, those theoretical black holes they are talking about are singularities. Gravity must be a bizarre instance of superhuge quantum gravity, which if true means that classic gravity has a whack connection with quantum gravity. Whoa is physics going to tumble on this one. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead of calling them wormholes we should call them Residual Quantum Threads . At the quantum scale time and space act more statistically than linearly. Since light and electrons travel at light speed they don\u0027t age, electrons a little. So when they need to finally talk only our space dimension has significantly aged. In this way we don\u0027t neccesarily need to jump over to string theory. If this is true then think about the difference of space-time on the quantum scale and our scale. On the quantum scale it means that a fragment of space time way over there can be also here for a brief moment and then back over there. And stranger thing is that it can get from here to there and back and momentum did not shift. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big thing that you guys probably don\u0027t realize, there is entangled physics all around us, many events in the natural world create pairs. If every time a photon strikes its destination a worhole is created, the universe is then filled with these wormholes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-02T04:07:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll I have to say is \u0022called it!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA while back I had an idea that perhaps all pairs of entangled particles are effectively one-dimensional (insofar as all but one dimension are very small) wormholes, and that by generating a large group of them one might be able to form a structure that absorbs objects from one side and emits them from the other - essentially an extended wormhole or a \u0022beaming\u0022 device.
