In career/science mode it also adds a further time constraint on unlocking nodes in the tech tree.

To go even further, I would recommend MKS with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E life support. I have used many different life support mods and game mechanic altering mods that add difficulty and complexity but MKS has the right balance for me. It adds a colonization system that requires management but rewards you with science and funds. It also lets you (with the correct parts on your ships) resupply from a planet that has infrastructure without having to actually fly that boring mission. Add the above mods plus maybe Dangit and you have disasters and crises waiting to happen. Imagine needing supplies on Duna in 400 days(or everyone dies!) but the supply ship blew up when the second stage ignited and a new ship will take many more days than you are comfortable with to build. What do you do? That is the type of problem I enjoy solving and goes way beyond just funds and science collection.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternatively, there is Kerbalism that is a life support mod and much more. It adds radiation belts and part failures plus revamps the science collection. I feel like this mod could use some fine tuning and polish(better integration with other mods) but all in all it gives a real sense of space being dangerous. It\u0027s not so much adding management to the game but it makes you think about redundancies and protecting crew which adds weight and cost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StarStreak2109","CreatedById":118557,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-05T10:27:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have never tried Kerbalism, although it sounds like an interesting concept.

Plus I like a bit of complexity. I never tried the Pathfinder mod but it looks about like MKS (or as you said MKS lite). I have had problems with WildBlueTools/BARIS not playing nice with other mods, even ones they say are compatible. Which is the reason for not trying it and dropping Kerbalism.

A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E contract configurator(with packs of contracts) and Dmagic\u0027s Orbital science(also scan sat). Better contracts with contract packs(all different kinds available) and the orbital science adds longer term missions that can take hundreds of days to complete once the designated orbit is achieved. That ties up your cash in a mission and potentially limits other contracts you can do. I\u0027m sure there are many mods that say they do one thing but don\u0027t sell the fact they add complexity to how you play a career save when you consider money management. This game, with mods, is as complicated and micro-managey as you want to get. For instance look at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E/RP-0 thats almost a different game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
