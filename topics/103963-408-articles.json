When scatterer is enabled, it completely changes the lighting for the cloud layer. [Here\u0027s a couple images to show what I mean.](https://imgur.com/a/52C3fGa) I really prefer the lighting of the first one, and it feels more realistic as well. But when a scatterer atmosphere is present, suddenly the lighting becomes flat and the shadow becomes sharp. This is especially jarring and apparent in real-scale solar systems for some reason. Is there a way to control that kind of lighting? I think having softer shadows would be really nice.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-07-05T22:49:48Z\u0022 title=\u002207/05/2024 10:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jul 5\u0022\u003EJuly 5\u003C/time\u003E by rheaunderstars**"},{"CreatedByName":"Errol","CreatedById":118622,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-06T14:31:11Z","Content":"[@blackrack](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/104258-blackrack/)bug report:  \n\nInstalling the new deffered rendering mod I\u0027m getting this weird visual bug where everything looks washed out and overexposed, there is also a ton of glare/haze around the sun.
