To add, the ability to auto action when certain flight parameters occur.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA practical use of this would be when using an abort sequence to safely eject a capsule from a rocket. Currently, if you were to assign a decoupler, emergency rocket, and parachute to the button, all three actions would happen at once. That\u0027s obviously no good as we want the pod well clear of the ship before deploying the parachute. On the other hand, if I didn\u0027t assign the parachute to the abort, I would have to waste another action group to deploy the parachute, or try to right click on the parachute than push that small moving button to deploy it manually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf my suggestion were implemented, you could set a delay of 0 seconds to the decoupler and emergency rocket, and a delay of 8 seconds to the parachute. When you push the abort button, the pod is immediately disconnected from the ship, the full burn is allowed to commence, burn out, and the pod is allowed to stabilize before the parachute opens in exactly 8 seconds. Alternatively, the parachute could be instructed to open only when a certain capsule speed is attained after the sequence begins. Instead of 8 seconds, it could be 1000m or when the pod is traveling at 100 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has practical purposes for actions like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDecoupling stages: Instead of multiple space bar presses for timing, one would decouple the stage, wait 3 seconds, then activate the new engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecovering boosters: I put parachutes on my boosters. Immediately deploying the parachute after the booster separates either destroys the parachute or holds the booster against the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComplex landing sequences into the atmosphere of a planet: If I want a lander to have parachutes deploy at certain speeds over a planet, then cut away to open more ideal parachutes, than to have a last second retro-rocket (like the Soyuz, for example), I don\u0027t want to tie up a bunch of action groups to do it. I will have needed them for launching and other sequences, so I will be limited by the time I get to a planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know some people are against adding more automation to the game. I think that part of the enjoyment is putting together a plan in the beginning and seeing if all of it works out without any intervention. The way I imagine it, trusting a Duna landing to the action group setting I worked on an hour prior is way more tense and difficult than doing it manually or with MechJeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of this also helps to prevent inadvertent spacebar presses\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve looked into this before, but there are so many ways of wording this I couldn\u0027t find a mod prior thread or if one exists.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
