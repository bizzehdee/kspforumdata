A spaceplane trades engine and fuel mass (since you can use less thrust) for additional wing mass and losses to drag.

But jet engines are not going to work on Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, efficiency and low mass don\u0027t need to be your goals. If you can make an ascent using a plane with many acres of wing area, pushed by many ion engines - perhaps using much more \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv than a traditional ascent, you might still make it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarlier in this thread I saw the concept of \u0022maximum \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv\u0022 tossed around. I\u0027m unfamiliar with the concept. Does it relate to SSTO limitation, or planetary launch limitations? (I could see an engine having a max \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv because it can\u0027t lift more than X amount of fuel). How is this \u0022max \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv\u0022 calculated, how does using a plane style ascent rather than a vertical ascent affect the calculation?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: more thinking on maximum \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv. In interplanetary space, and with a willingness to stage away spent fuel containers, no engine has a maximum \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv (well, except as dictated by part count or a craft\u0027s maximum size, arbitrary game engine limitations).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn direct planetary ascent, an engine has a maximum effective \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv because it can\u0027t lift more than a certain amount of fuel and maintain a TWR \u0026gt; 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis consideration is affected by doing a spaceplane ascent; you can have TWR much less than 1 and still go up. However, there\u0027s still a maximum amount of fuel a given engine can lift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still not seeing the \u0022single stage\u0022 limitation on my own, though. Even if you start with 100 orange fuel cans and a single mainsail, assuming it can go \u0022up\u0022 at all, the mass of the craft will only go down as you continue to thrust. Sure, it\u0027s inefficient to carry all that dead weight, but 101 orange cans will still have more \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv, right? 102 cans has more than that... Or is that not true?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding more fuel mass reduces the effect of thrust, which reduces the \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv of all the fuel you\u0027re already carrying.

One of these concepts just considers the mass ratio of the stock fuel tanks, which is 9 for all bipropellant tanks except the tiny ones.
