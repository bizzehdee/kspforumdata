Now I have a new laptop I want to see just how good the game can look!\n\nI\u0027ve been trying to use the latest release of CKAN to integrate all my mods - the game simply refuses to even load and crashes without errors.\n\nSo I am reverting to doing things manually and would like to know the best way to install various graphics mods that is known to work on 1.0.4\n\nI have tried installing the following all together using CKAN plus any mandatory ones it recommended on top.\n\n- Active Texture Management\n- Astronomers Visual Pack - all options, 4k textures where I have that option\n- Planetshine\n- Smokescreen\n- Distant Object Enhancement\n- Environment Visual Enhancement\n\nEven installing \u0022only\u0022 these makes the game crash on startup ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nIs there a guide somewhere which shows what I can achieve and what order I should installl the improved graphics mods? Once I get the graphics stuff sorted I was then planning on installing things like remote tech, life support and so on.\n\nI tried looking for a sticky but can\u0027t see anything."},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T07:38:18Z","Content":"Order doesn\u0027t matter, but there\u0027s a memory limit around 3 GB because KSP is 32-bit on Windows and Mac. You\u0027re probably just hitting that memory limit. See [this post](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92229-How-To-Get-Support-%28READ-FIRST%29) on how to check the logs.\n\nKSP is 64-bit on Linux, so if you dual-boot to Linux, you can run as many mods as you have RAM for.\n\nPart packs (KW, B9, LLL, etc) and graphics textures (Astronomers Visual Pack, Environment Visual Enhancement) use up the most memory.\n\nThe conversion to Unity 5 (currently under way) may or may not offer a 64-bit KSP for Windows. There\u0027s no ETA."}]}
