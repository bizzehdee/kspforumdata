Hope you enjoy! \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027m having ideas about a real life Mars base system that is sort of based off Mars One\u0027s habitat but more modular and adaptable. You could consider this as my idea for a \u0022harder, better, faster, stronger\u0022 Mars base, since Mars One\u0027s has good basic ideas, but won\u0027t be as viable in the long run. I am thinking of where every piece of equipment is constructed of standardized parts that can be salvaged from one thing and used to repair another, in a lego-like fashion; similar to the American Jeep. All parts will have a standard attachment method for easy, but sturdy construction. Each module is the same (except for the power module) at launch but can be modified, upgraded, and specialized as time goes on and more and more modules arrive. Also like Mars One, SpaceX\u0027s Dragons will be used as the Cargo and Crew Delivery vehicles, and will be used as both the connectors for everything as well as the \u0022wet areas\u0022 showers, bathroom, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Power is from large external solar panels which are easy to clean and are robust, but unlike Mars One, fuel cells like on the Space Shuttle will be used as Backup power for emergencies and times when there is low-sunshine. The power module (P.O.O.L.E., named after Frank Poole from 2001: A Space Odyssey) has batteries, capacitors, a small heat sink/radiators, electrolyzing equipment, a water filter or boiling thingy, a non-potable water tankand Hydrogen and Oxygen tanks for use with the fuel cells. I chose fuel cells because when solar power is plentiful the water from the fuel cell can be either sanitized for consumption or electrolyzed to form Oxygen and Hydrogen, to be used in the fuel cells when solar power input is low. Half of the water produced from the fuel cells is sanitized as the crew\u0027s drinking water, the other half will be stored in P.O.O.L.E\u0027s non-potable water tank for either electrolyzing or as a coolant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The Water Retrieval, Analyzation and Storage Module (W.I.Z.A.R.D.) retrieves water from the ice in either of Mars\u0027 Poles (Preferably the South Pole, near Mars Polar Lander\u0027s resting site which will give more info on how to improve Mars landers and to see how it\u0027s held up after all those years), this polar location is the reason for the inclusion of a secondary power source, the fuel cells in this case. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The Scientific and Medical Laboratory (aka. S.M.A.L.L.) is a triple purpose module which functions as a scientific lab, a \u0022mini-hospital\u0022, and a medical lab which can be used to both perform medical experiments on the Human body and to gather data for medical use (like DNA tests, disease testing, etc.). S.M.A.L.L also has several scientific airlocks (like the ones on Skylab) which prevent the need of EVAs in order to run external scientific experiments. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://bollerandchivens.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/skylab4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022skylab4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the scientific airlocks on Skylab, which is what the parasol was deployed through.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The Habitat module is basically the same as on Mars One. The furniture for it is packaged in an \u0022IKEA\u0022 fashion, but the furniture is designed especially for Mars\u0027 low gravity as in weight-saving methods, ground anchors and a different center of mass than normal Earth furniture would have; so for example the Mars chairs would flip over if someone sat in them on Earth but not on Mars. The hab module would also have the living area for a dog/s (not cats due to their \u0022always landing on their feet thing\u0022 that would freak out in micro/low gravity) which would serve as moral support for the crew. The dog/s would be named after Laika, Belka, Strelka, Dezik, Tsygan, and other Soviet space dogs, because the universe says so, \u003Cstrong\u003Edon\u0027t argue!\u003C/strong\u003E The dog/s would be fed vegan dog food (like Ellen\u0027s) because meat is not a viable food source on Mars. The Martian canines would be trained on Earth to obey certain commands from the crew and be taught things like don\u0027t chew on any furniture or base equipment, stay away from airlocks, and how to operate onboard equipment like the canine treadmill for walking since dog EVA\u0027s are not intended, but can (but most likely will not happen) be a future possibility through modifications. Canine waste will be handled in the same manner as human waste.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/O9XtK6R1QAk?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECats in microgravity, as mentioned above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The ECLSS module is essentially a mini-farm in a box; it has plants for both food and oxygen, storage for water, food, oxygen, Co\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E, gases like nitrogen for internal atmospheric (this is due to pure oxygen environments being \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEXTREMELY\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E big fire hazards, like Apollo 1) use, waste containers (different kinds of waste are separated, so #1 isn\u0027t mixed with #2), waste processing modules (which remove water from waste, for reuse.

The other two rovers, called Unmanned Repair and Reconnaissance Rovers (U.N.A.R.E.S.) are solely unmanned and meant for maintenance/exterior damage detection, reconnaissance, and have some external experiment slots which allow various experiments and instruments to be installed, they are also equipped with two robotic arms similar to the ones on Curiosity but have hand-like manipulators as well as swappable instrument/slots. Both types of rovers are housed in the \u0022garage\u0022 which is similar to an Earth garage in that they are stored internally within it, the entire thing essentially functions as an airlock (not really, but that\u0027s the only way I know how to describe it) by venting (in this case the air will not be vented and stored for later pressurization) all it\u0027s contents, like how the LEM did. The \u0022garage\u0022 also houses the charging and repair supplies as well as a small model of the Lunar Roving Vehicle as a memento of Earth. All rovers are NOT delivered by Dragon, instead using a vehicle similar to the cargo lander from the MTV Copernicus Mars Mission, I decided on this for two reasons, First is that a Dragon could not deliver an ERV without on-site assembly, which could compromise structural integrity and would be more expensive (maybe not, but I\u0027m too lazy to do all the financial calculations, so let\u0027s just assume it is) and more time-consuming than just one big launch. The second reason is that I REALLY liked the Copernicus Mars Mission and was kinda sad when Project Constellation got cancelled, although I have heard rumors about it not really being affected by Constellation\u0027s cancellation I am not 100% sure that those are true.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://constellationprogram.com/startpage/ntr_marsmission/NTR_Mars09.32.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022NTR_Mars09.32.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Copernicus Cargo Lander I was talking about. It was planned to be launched on the Ares V, but due to\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProject Constellation\u0027s cancellation the entire Ares family was scrapped. But the cargo lander could easily be launched using the SLS with a NTR (basically the irl LV-N) powered upper stage or possibly a Falcon XX, so all hope isn\u0027t lost yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/uUBhn3_P3hU?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe MTV Copernicus mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The Control and Communications Module (C.O.C.O.) has multiple high and low-gain antennae on top for \u0022ET phone home\u0022-stuff, computers, lots of buttons and screens, logistics equipment, and a cool window on the back for exterior viewing (like the one on the Mk-2 lander can). C.O.C.O. is also capable of controlling M.U.M.B.O. without humans in a semi-autonomous mode which keeps all of the resource systems running but not maintenance, which can either be done using an U.N.A.R.E.S. controlled by either mission control or the crew, preferably the latter due to speed of light delay stuff. The next module is the External Access Module (E.X.A.M.) contains the Astronauts\u0027/Cosmonauts\u0027 space suits and EVA equipment, like surface sample collectors, flags, golf clubs, corned beef sandwiches \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E, etc. as well as the Airlock for EVA access.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/jamescameronsavatar/images/4/42/Utilidor_Airlock.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110110192834\u0022 alt=\u0022latest?cb=20110110192834\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Since a lot of you were confused about the whole thing about covering the modules with nearby soil, the soil will be kept in place by a cement-like paste that will harden and then will be covered by a non-rusting (that is VERY important as almost all of Mars is made of rust) metal tarp that will help to protect the base from wind damage and meteorites/debris/etc. and reflect heat/aid visibility. The tarp will be held down by tent pegs that unlike regular ones, have outward deploying spikes that help to keep it in the ground. All areas of the base will be covered in soil and metal except for areas (not entire modules) that have external openings like the scientific airlocks in S.M.A.L.L., C.O.C.O.\u0027s window, the \u0022garage\u0022 door, and E.X.A.M.\u0027s airlock door.
