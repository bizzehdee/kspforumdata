See #6 entry for latest issue. It seems Location Based Contracts are not triggering. So far I\u0027ve noticed Launch Site Engine Tests with NO Green Checks, and a Tourist Minmas Flyby that didnt trigger after 3 Sphere of influence penetrations.\n\nUsing 1.0.2 and the terrier engine test at launch site that I saved so I would have access to EXPERIMENTAL engine is not allowing me to complete the test. \n\nIt says Test the engine at the launch site. I did so on the launch pad (or do I have to fly to the inland launch facility?) Used staging as requested and there are no other parameters. Tried probe, and crewed. \n\nHelp? Simple contracts should not defeat me.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-25T21:22:08Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2015 09:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MrDude**\n  \nSolution found but need help MOD Glitch Hunting"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T05:23:07Z","Content":"Read the contract again, and triple-check all the parameters. You shouldn\u0027t even need fuel for an engine test on the pad. A simple 2 part craft of the Stayputnik or starter pod on top of the engine should be sufficient. Once on the pad, check the contracts mini panel thing, to see what is ticked and what is not ticked. And, make sure you\u0027ve not run out of battery for probe cores.\n\nThe island is irrelevant.\n\nOther than that, you\u0027ll need to give us the exact criteria from the contract.\n\nDo you have any mods installed? Which ones, and their versions?"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPropelledGiraffe","CreatedById":143863,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T10:43:48Z","Content":"In Beta some test would be run by staging and others by using the part menu entry \u0022test engine\u0022. \n\nI did not take a lot of test contracts since 1.0, so I am not sure if that difference still exists.

I strongly suspect it could be caused by one of your mods, but can\u0027t be sure of that, it just seems likely. I\u0027ve had loads of contracts just like that, no problems with them at all.\n\nIt has nothing to do with biomes, I know all the biome names around KSC, and that is not one of them. \u0022Launch Site\u0022 is the main pad at KSC. For \u0022landed at the pad\u0022 contracts, no flight is necessary, you just put together whatever you need in the VAB, launch it onto the pad, then do the test (typically hit staging, but could theoretically be \u0022Run Test\u0022 on the part\u0027s menu). That isn\u0027t a biome name, it\u0027s just the name the contracts system uses.\n\nCan you try it without mods? (N.B. I don\u0027t know what impact that could have on your save file, so backup first.)"},{"CreatedByName":"MrDude","CreatedById":134194,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T18:27:49Z","Content":"Tried it with a purified Game Data folder and it worked. Now I wonder about the Minmus Tourist Flyby failure I had a week ago.

After all that I just hacked the save file.\n\nHOW DO I TRACK THIS GLITCH TO THE OFFENDING MOD? \n\nI have a bunch - would it have to be a mod that deals with contracts? or Biomes (since they all seem to be linked with contracts that need a certain place)? It would take a long time to turn off each mod in turn, load the save, and test. What rules can I use to find the biggest culprits.\n\nOnes that look red flagged to me:\n\nCacteyes orbital telescopes (because it is not technically compatible with 1.0.2)\n\nContractsWindow - Deals with contracts\n\nFinal Frontier - Awards based on biomes and activities\n\nAny other catagories of mods to prioritize?

If the problem disappears, the offending mod was in that half. If not, it\u0027s in the remaining half.\n\n(If needed, swap halves, ie if you deleted the problem mod delete the existing mods and reinstall the half you just deleted.)\n\nGo to step 1 until only 1 mod remains.
