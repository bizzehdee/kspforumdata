But now the people of Kerbin needed something more, something to distract them from the fact that the planet had literally been wiped blank by the ravages of war. So, the newly created United Kerbin government created a new administration, with one simple goal: to explore beyond the skies of Kerbin, and to take kerbalkind to the stars. The Global Space Administration set to work immediately, coming up with a project to accomplish the governments three primary goals: To reach orbit, explore and land on both moons, and establish a foothold in space. Project Trident will accomplish these goals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMISSION LOG:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79928-GSA-Project-Trident?p=1156853\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1156853\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E1.

The first project, Trident (Named as such because of its three main goals), will basically be just me harvesting all the science from Kerbin\u0027s SOI so I can unlock the tech tree. While I can accomplish interplanetary missions without doing so, my next project as it was pre-designed requires most of the tech tree to work out. Thus, Trident will come first. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am using Tac Life Support (without respawn), as well as Science Revisited and Stock Rebalance. I\u0027m also using a lot of other mods, as will become apparent. I have trimmed a lot of the mods to just the bits and bobs that I actually use. I have also edited a few things. Namely, the J2 engine from FASA was changed to be a bit more powerful (I found it too weak, and even in the 5 engine configuration my TWR was still under 1.0 even when using all FASA parts above the engines), and I\u0027ve edited several command pods to be KAS containers to spare myself the headaches of trying to integrate the normal KAS containers where they didn\u0027t really fit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first mission log will start off right as I start the game. And go on from there as I see fit. I\u0027ll likely skip supply missions and certain maintenance bits. And as I\u0027m sure it\u0027ll be asked, I do intend on having a unique mission badge/flag for every project. The basic flag for non-project missions will just be the NASA flag. We\u0027ll pretend it says GSA, because I\u0027m too lazy to do up an actual GSA flag.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-14T07:01:38Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2014 07:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by G\u0026#39;th\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-14T07:00:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMission Log: The Kerlington Command Capsule test and Kerbin Space Center Inspection\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoal: To test the Kerlington Command Capsule in preparation for the first launch and to inspect the grounds of the Kerbin Space Center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E_____________________________\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday, team commander Connor Kerman has his work cut out for him.
