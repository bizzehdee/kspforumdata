Given that mining is never going to be enormous as you have to actually play through (and assuming it takes a considerable amount of time to do in game) every mining instance, you could have the standard map, then overlay a circular \u0027reduction\u0027 centered on where it has been mined. At the center it reduces a lot, proportional to how long it has been mined, and around it this reduces depends on distance. The available resource at any given point on the map is the standard, based on the resource map, minus the circular overlay map. To simplify you could also make the circles fairly large (say a few kilometers diameter) and if you mine again within a percentage of that radius (say 25%) it just increases the amplitude of the circular reduction\u0027s effect rather than adding a new circle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to show this on the map would vary. Given Fractal\u0027s current display system a similar \u0027hotspot\u0027 system in reverse (with a different color) to show low spots due to mining would be valid. If there is any way to overlay the overall map onto a planet/moon with something similar to Majiir\u0027s overlay but with a continuous map it would be interesting. I\u0027m not sure how easy it would be though to map over.
