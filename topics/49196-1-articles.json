And I thought it would be good to see that reflected in some way in an individual mission log or a career file. We could have the number of missions they took part in, how long they spent on those missions, which bodies they orbited and where they landed, how long they spent on EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt could even become something useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s say a more experienced Kerbal sees is \u0022stupid\u0022 rating go down. As a consequence, his crew reports and EVA reports would earn more science points.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"possum","CreatedById":84085,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T18:55:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe crew history would be nice bu the science reports could be really useful. Having a log of data could be useful to make planet characteristics something that has to be researched. It could really help with mission planning and give another purpose to the science.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
