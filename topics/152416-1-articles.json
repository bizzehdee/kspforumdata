I was doing a stream last night and listening to music, and the song, Monody by TheFatRat came on right as I lauched a probe to go to the mun, and I started making some actions that were lined up with the song.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/QKEDH9bwdIk?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you guys think?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-22T15:00:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNice spin-separation.

Separate the moment booster tanks are empty - you must watch fuel levels because with crossfeed the side engines will keep burning even with their tanks empty. (alternatively, instead of enabling crossfeed, use fuel pipes). That way you get a better \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E early on - main engine is providing boost instead of being dead weight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) much flatter ascent trajectory - air drag is much less of a problem than gravity drag - you want to gain much more horizontal speed sooner. 45 degrees tilt at 10km is one data point to look for; circularization burn should be less than 300m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) don\u0027t raise your initial orbit so much if you don\u0027t need to - results in higher orbital speed, and as result more efficient departure burn (Oberth effect.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) For operation in orbit you should use high-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E, low-thrust engine.
