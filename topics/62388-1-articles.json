The problem is slowing down the air to a usable speed also heats it up too hot, so now you have to cool it down, and it looks like they have achieved that, for the first time. The alternative is something like a scramjet which is another option that has it\u0027s own challenges to overcome. Problem is scramjets don\u0027t work at subsonic or even low-supersonic speeds, so even if you could get a scramjet to work at high enough speeds to run you out of the atmosphere at orbital speed and then switch to a closed cycle (i.e. rocket) mode, you\u0027d still need another engine for the lower, slower part of the flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now I\u0027ve wasted enough of your time.
