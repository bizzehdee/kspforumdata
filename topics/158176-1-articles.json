But KSP went for the other model, which is \u0022ground based stations are so much more powerful than satellite based ones, the best way to phone home is via a direct link\u0022. This, incidentally, is the way it works in real life. NASA\u0027s Deep Space Network frankly just overpowers everything else by orders of magnitude, and that kind of power is also the only thing that even makes it physically possible to talk across the vast distances between Earth and spacecraft in outer space. We only really have one single satellite-based spacecraft communication network in operation today (TDRS), and that only exists in order to bridge the gap in communications between ground stations for launch vehicles ascending through the atmosphere, which are unable to deploy sophisticated antennas themselves due to aerodynamic forces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a player, if you prefer the first model, you will need to apply tweaks. Perhaps also look at RemoteTech itself, the mod still lives today and is much more suited to satellite networks than the stock system is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-26T12:15:20Z\u0022 title=\u002203/26/2017 12:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 26, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sarxis","CreatedById":130923,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-26T13:23:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the info Streetwind.\u00A0 Yes, I\u0027m kind of leaning towards the first model, if only because it makes for more interesting gameplay in trying to manage a comms network.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cunjo Carl","CreatedById":162109,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-26T22:48:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/130923-sarxis/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022130923\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/130923-sarxis/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Sarxis\u003C/a\u003E You can also get an idea of what range you\u0027ll have using \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/128643-poodmund/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022128643\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/128643-poodmund/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Poodmund\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s antenna range calculator.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/149099-commnet-signal-strength-calculator-antenna-selector/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt models the non-linearities in KSP\u0027s range calculations accurately as I understand, and I\u0027ve heard the upcoming version won\u0027t have any notable differences for com range.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-27T22:07:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother possibility, instead of changing the range on settings use modified antennas.
