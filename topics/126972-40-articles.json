There were quite\u00A0a few new mods I wanted to get to in 1.1.3, but I ended up taking a vacation in the middle of it.... At least one of those will see use in 1.2 (spoilers: small\u00A0story-point). If certain mods look to never be updated again I\u0027ll just find an easy way to stop using them like I did with TAC-LS.

Sort of. The small static antenna coming with 1.2 will replace all of the like antennas from RemoteTech, and the Communicatron-32s will just revert back to being 16s. And if any of the larger dishes have decent equivalents in stock they\u0027ll get swapped out too.

Had it been years? Decades? He could barely remember. What was its name? That other program? All those years ago, when it had become Jonbald\u0027s duty to be hired on as the radar and telemetry expert. In that position he would hide everything that was already in orbit, keeping the kerbals outside their group none the wiser. Letting them carry on in ignorance of their true purpose: To provide the means to rescue and recover the stranded and forgotten from space.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYet plans change, worlds change, programs fail and disappear. It was bickering and infighting that led to the end of that experiment. Two groups formed from the survivors, one that wanted to keep to The Plan, the other that had a far more radical approach to rescuing their friends. Little did any of them realize how much damage their disagreements would cause. It was almost a relief when the splinter groups didn\u0027t reemerge after the inevitable collapse, though Jonbald had often wondered what happened to them. What had happened to his friends?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow one of them was returning home: Rosuki. The Boss. Her last trip to space was against her will, at the behest of madkerbs and maniacs, yet it allowed her to escape the horrors that had befallen Kerbin afterwards. She had found her own horrors\u00A0of course, first at the hands of The Party Boss, and later as a \u0022guest\u0022 of Queen Sieta and her lapdog\u00A0pirate, Captain Hallock. The former having threatened the lives of Rosuki and her workers, her friends, her self; the latter having forced upon her the sounds and visions of the death of Kerbin, the death of the Universe, the dark whispers from dark places.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd as always, things changed. Plans changed. Somehow Rosuki had escaped from Sieta in the queen\u0027s own Nitrogen capsule, Nitrogen TC-8, which she was now using to land at the Cape. To escape from her orbiting prison.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe knew what to watch for, he\u0027d seen it a hundred times or more. It would start as a speck against the western sky. And then another speck. And another. Small specks of fire, streaking through the air. Some would explode. One would spit out parachutes and land. Hopefully with a kerbal inside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFires in the sky, The Boss come home from her work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160926_ksp0084_n.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022555\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160926_ksp0084_n.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160926_ksp0095_n.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022554\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160926_ksp0095_n.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe would be forever amazed by the automated pilots. Back in his day..., great powers he sounded like one of the really old kerbals.... Back in his day they were lucky if they landed on Kerbin. Luckier still if they were on land. More than one of the missions had ended on the sides of K-2, rolling endlessly down the mountainside, or way out in the ocean, bobbing helplessly so very far from the shore.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHad Harler been right? Should they have replaced all of their pilots with these cold machines? Shadows in a box? Hard to say, but he couldn\u0027t argue the results.

His thoughts were interrupted by the Nitrogen, drifting down to the exact spot where it had been programmed to land.

He climbed into his jet and taxied over to her capsule. No reason to wait until the new recovery crews showed up. He laughed as he realized it must seem insane to these new kerbals. They thought they were setting up a space program. Thought they would be the first to explore the great black beyond the sky. And then this old, bald, crazy kerbal shows up, claiming one of his own will descend from the heavens and land on their lawn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey were taking it well, all things being equal.

She seemed to be ok with the gravity, no obvious signs of adaptation sickness. It was good to have her back, another of the forgotten who knew who he was and where he came from. Too many lost over the years. Too many had slipped through the cracks of time. Was he the oldest now? Hard to say.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two old friends spent the better part of an hour at her landing site, talking about everything that had happened. How The Party Boss had forced her into space, had followed her there to finish the job she had failed to fail at. How they spent the next several munths living in the fear The First Citizen would send more goons to finish them off. Little did they know the bugs had already taken over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe then talked about how she had fallen into the clutches of Sieta and Hallock. They weren\u0027t insane she insisted, not exactly, but there was definitely something off about them. They wanted to know about fuel, about other stations, about other kerbals in space. Rosuki mentioned something about the Chlorine tugs and their fuel reserves, a subject both of her captors seemed rather interested in. And so she woke one morning to find the Memory of Tomorrow gone, the station empty, and every drop of fuel drained.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that\u0027s how she came into possession of the Nitrogen. The shuttle was useless without fuel, but the Nitrogen had enough monoprop to push her into a rendezvous with Kelgee. Just as she was about to leave, Jonbald radioed up from the new tracking station at The Cape, and so plans changed again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that\u0027s when she noticed the monolith.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160926_ksp0115_n.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022588\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160926_ksp0115_n.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Has it always been that... large?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No. Something has changed both this one and the monolith at North Mountain. Shall we take a look? The council meeting\u00A0can wait.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sure.\u0022 It was perhaps a bit undignified, but The Boss dangled off of the jet\u0027s ladder as Jonbald taxied to their new distraction. He wondered if she was happy to be back, if the wind blowing through her hair made her feel alive again, but Rosuki was such a hard kerbal to read. It was one of the many reasons Elite had singled her out to be the head of their secret upstart space agency. Stoic, to the last.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160926_ksp0118_n.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022586\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160926_ksp0118_n.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIndeed, this monolith was much larger than before, just like the one at North Mountain. Was it perhaps even larger? Maybe. He kept his distance, too afraid of it to walk up and touch it. Who knew what would happen. He had no idea what any of the changes meant, if they meant anything, and he wondered if perhaps any of the Bobs had something to say about it. Surely at least one knew its secrets. Somewhere. Somehow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe he could ask the new Bob. There was inevitably one on this Kerbin, likely already recruited by this new agency. There was always a Bob. Always a Bill.

No doubt their new council was waiting to meet them, wondering where these two enigmas had wandered off to. The grounds crews had already gathered around the capsule, a strange, alien sight to these kerbals who had never even known the skies, let alone the stars. They would shortly drag it off to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and dismantle it piece by piece, studying, recording, learning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We should get going.

It was a new room in a new building, having been hastily constructed in the corner of the Research and Development park. So many new buildings were going up that Wernher was having a hard time keeping them straight. The space center was just a dirt mound and some trailers a few munths ago, now it was a bustling and sprawling complex.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor hours they had been here, waiting for the newcomer to return with his friend.\u00A0The conversation had devolved into the usual sports, snacks and social noise, so Wernher escaped to the windows to watch the sunset. He was joined a few moments later by Gene. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220161005_ksp0074_continuum.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022588\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20161005_ksp0074_continuum.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What a sight, I tell ya. It\u0027s a nice spot Wernher. Good view of the mountains. Good view of the plains.\u0022 Gene waved his hand past the window, undulating up and down as he moved from left to right. \u0022Peaceful scene, trees on the horizon, calm beaches, beautiful sunsets.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ja.\u0022 Wernher nodded and smiled, not really sure how to respond. His was a world of physics and math, perfection and measurements. Yes, it was a beautiful sunset. Beautiful how the light diffused into so many wavelengths as it refracted through the atmosphere. Pure, scientific beauty. And a very nice spot, this cape. At the equator, good for slinging things into orbit with maximum efficiency. Lots of water to dump things into when they failed. Easy access to beach sand for when they needed to make glass or put out fires.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I could live my entire life here and be a happy kerbal.\u0022 Gene folded his arms and leaned against the window. \u0022You?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher shook his head, pointed towards the sky. \u0022Up there. That\u0027s where we belong. Not here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hmm, maybe.\u0022 Gene absentmindedly banged his helmet collar on the window and then tugged at his fingers. \u0022Say, why are we wearing these mittens again?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA ruckus at the far end of the room interrupted them, the newcomers having finally arrived. The strange little monk was bowing to one of them, who returned the gesture in kind. Odd lot, these. Wernher moved to rejoin the crowd and motioned for Gene to follow. Might as well finish the introductions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220161005_ksp0085_continuum.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20161005_ksp0085_continuum.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bald newcomer seemed to be in charge, and garnered the most respect from his group. He had arrived a few days previous before leaving again, held aloft on wings of metal, propelled by fire. Concepts not out of reach of science nor the dreams of kerbals, but his machine was unlike anything Wernher had ever seen. This bald one was speaking as Wernher and Gene rejoined the party.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Munlin, it\u0027s good to see you again, even if you weren\u0027t expected for a couple days. How\u0027d you get here so fast? I just left North Mountain a few hours ago and I didn\u0027t think Archibald had called yet.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe monk smiled back, just as peculiar as ever. \u0022Oh, I have my ways.\u0022 Truth be told he had been at the Cape for nearly a munth now, helping out here and there, but hadn\u0027t bothered to explain why. Quiet and strange little kerbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bald newcomer motioned towards his companion, introducing her to all as Rosuki Kerman. She had just fallen from the sky in a tin can. A can Wernher was excited to start digging around in. He drifted off in thought of what secrets it might hold, what wonders it could reveal. His short daydream was interrupted by the same bald one, who suggested they take their seats and get the meeting started.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220161005_ksp0107_continuum.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022588\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20161005_ksp0107_continuum.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ladies and gentlekerbs, I\u0027d like to thank you all for meeting on such short notice. I know it must seem a bit strange to some of you. Hopefully after tonight your questions will have answers and things will start to make sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We have a few items to cover before I turn the meeting over to Rosuki. First, the existence of this council must remain secret, at least for now. Officially we\u0027ll each hold an administrative position in the agency, which will hopefully quell any suspicions. Second, this is your space program. It\u0027s why you have the majority of the positions on the council. If at any time you feel we\u0027re moving too fast, please speak up.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey first went around the table introducing themselves, going over each of their histories, strengths, weaknesses, et cetera. This Rosuki character had been an astronaut many years ago before her own space program had fallen apart, she then went on to start her own. As it turned out their own boss, Cartina, had a similar story. She had thought to hide her past, but Rosuki and the bald one had seen through it, and somehow knew she was an old space tourist. \u0022There can be no secrets here,\u0022 the bald one warned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that came their own first astronaut, Zeldrien, head of the astronaut corps, who had yet to fly. As the winner of the 28th Annual \u0022Stale Snack Shack Stale Snack Struggle,\u0022 she was judged the most likely to survive for years on end without fresh snack supplies. Perfect trait for a spacekerb. Then Wernher himself, who had just completed his undergraduate physics work and was deep in the Masters of Applied Physics program when Cartina called to recruit him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wait,\u0022 the bald one asked, \u0022You don\u0027t have a PhD yet?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher shook his head. \u0022Nein.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So you\u0027re not the Doctor Wernher von Kerman?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nein.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Interesting.\u0022 Knowing looks were exchanged between the bald one and his boss.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey continued to Gene, who had almost completed his associates degree in team management. That brought more inquisitions and strange looks from the newcomers, who had apparently expected more. The monk, the strange kerbal who had appeared unannounced, had apparently been responsible for climbing into rockets left assembled outside of an old launch facility and firing himself and other monks into space. This garnered the attention of some other agency, who then proceeded to strand him on The M\u00FCn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, the bald one introduced himself again, Jonbald Kerman, possibly the oldest kerbal still on Kerbin. He had been to The M\u00FCn with two of his friends, Harler and Geofsy, before being assigned to the first work crew for their space station, Baile Speir. Space Station. M\u00FCn Landings. Kerbals in Space. Wernher was never more certain he was in over his head.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe meeting dragged on long into the night. The bald one and his team wanted help reestablishing communications with their crews, and suggested they needed to build a large ship to rescue them from Jool. Their own boss, Cartina, wanted to conduct research on the space-worthiness of kerbals. The bald one protested, saying they had known of kerbals who were in microgravity for decades without \u003Cem\u003E_too_\u003C/em\u003E much damage, but in the end they agreed to the research anyway. Wernher asked what he thought was a good question, \u0022How do kerbals get to space?\u0022 A question that was answered with laughter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe hadn\u0027t meant it as a joke.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSnacks and drinks were brought in at one point when they took an intermission, and once consumed the council went back to work. So much of what they talked about seemed pure fantasy to Wernher, ships orbiting The M\u00FCn, Duna, even Jool; crews having landed on most of the worlds in the solar system. Five days before he was blissfully unaware of all of this, now he was expected to design things that would take kerbals safely into space. To the stars.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u002220161005_ksp0139_continuum.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20161005_ksp0139_continuum.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFinally they had exhausted their list of things to discuss, and the bald one moved to end the meeting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ok then, we have our goals. Construction will continue here at the Cape. We\u0027ll have our crews recover our designs, research, and technical documents from storage and bring them to us. Doc, uh, Wernher, once we have the plans I\u0027ll have our engineers walk you through them. After that our two main goals are to build out our communications systems, and to conduct space survivability studies on living kerbals. Any questions?\u0022 He looked to each of the six others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ok then, we have our missions. Good luck. Meeting adjourned.\u0022 They all stood and started stretching, have sat for entirely too long. The bald one had been walking towards the door when he stopped, turned, and addressed them again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022One last thing.\u00A0Welcome to Continuum.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNavigation: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/126972-forgotten-space-program/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=2808486\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ENext Page\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-04T06:14:03Z\u0022 title=\u002212/04/2016 06:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Cydonian Monk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wahgineer","CreatedById":59292,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-09T21:35:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, this time the space program actually has knowledge of their\u00A0forebears existence?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-09T22:07:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222794947\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022126972\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221476048953\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002259292\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022awsumindyman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 minutes ago, awsumindyman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, this time the space program actually has knowledge of their\u00A0forebears existence?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome of them, at any rate.

It felt like munths since they\u0027d arrived, or even minths, but Gletrix knew she just landed less than an hour before. And what a landing that was. She had barely put wheels onto the ground when the LDAV started its descent. She had hoped see it as it entered the atmosphere, streaking across the sky, but it landed so far to the West there was nothing more than a small flare. And that might have been one of the other moons.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ground at her landing site was strange. A mixture of ash, sand, and other inert matter, it was easy to lose your footing and go sliding down the hill. The Aluminium 10 was doing just that: sliding across the face of the dune. Wait any longer and she may not make it over to her friends. At least it wouldn\u0027t slide over her flag, as there\u0027s no way an aircraft can slide uphill.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce the team was down and safe, Gletrix relit the Aluminium\u0027s engines and prepared for takeoff. Time to join to party. Getting airborne again was a bit tricky, what with the strange surface, but in the end she pulled back on the stick and her metal steed soared into the alien sky.

From the air it didn\u0027t look like a bad place to land, but Gletrix changed her mind after the first flyover. The rolling dunes would force her to land somewhere to the North or South of the Sulphur and taxi over to the craft. That ridge was too dangerous looking to risk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo big deal, the tires and wheels of the Aluminium were up to anything, or so it would seem. Who would think they\u0027d explode just for coming into contact with the ground? It\u0027s not like they blew up because she took off. No, that\u0027s crazy talk, and she wouldn\u0027t have it. The wheels were fine. No bugs to be found. Perfect round little examples of flawless software they were. Sure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few minutes later and she was drifting up to the front door.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160817_ksp1044_laythe.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022589\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160817_ksp1044_laythe.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then through the front door. The inside of the shuttle was disorienting. Sulphur was designed as a lander, yes, but the internals were best suited to use in microgravity. The seats had swivels on them to point forward, upward, but not sideways, so most of the time they ended up sitting on the seatbacks. Thankfully the designers had to foresight to build a ladder into the floor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMacfred and Thomlock were discussing where best to plant the flag while Agake was trying (mostly successfully) to pull data from the various science instruments. She had already collected a handful of sand to experiment with once they were back in orbit. Gletrix had brought samples with her from the first landing site, and Agake was poking through them gleefully.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGletrix looked around. One missing. \u0022Where\u0027s Jeb?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMacfred pointed towards the hatch. \u0022He took off to play in the dunes. Said something about building a sand castle. He\u0027ll meet us at the flag planting.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe flag planting. They had two chores to complete before the first exploration flight could depart, and Gletrix was anxious to get airborne again. First, they had to plant the flag. The official flag. And all the pomp that comes with that circumstance. Second, they need to remove the now-useless hardware from the LDAV. The less mass they had on ascent, the easier they could get to orbit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo one by one they filtered out of the lander. Each had already had their run-in with the Laythe air, having almost immediately taken their helmets off only to taste the terrible air. Was it breathable? For a short time, yes. Was it worth it? No, not really. Once all were outside and agreed on where to spot the flag they set out, single file.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160823_ksp1071_laythe.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022586\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160823_ksp1071_laythe.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWalking over the dunes wasn\u0027t as easy as walking on Kerbin\u0027s beaches, though none of them quite understood why. Walking in general felt a tiny bit awkward, each step taking a short time longer to complete than their bodies were used to.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb was already waiting for them at the top of the hill, having happily and easily bounded up the hill from the beach. Gletrix couldn\u0027t help but wonder: Was everything always so easy for him?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was a good spot, perched at the top of the tallest dune between the lake and the ocean. To the south they had a clear view of the landing site. None of them knew much at all about the environment of Laythe, but they hoped this spot would be safe enough for the flag to survive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160823_ksp1142_laythe.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022555\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160823_ksp1142_laythe.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160823_ksp1154_laythe.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022589\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160823_ksp1154_laythe.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMacfred shepherded them, gathered them around his chosen spot. He shoved the flag into the soft soil, flipped the switch, and was about to start into a speech. A speech he never got to deliver because Agake jumped in fright.

It floated waist-high off the ground, and appeared to be level with the soil underneath. He ran his fingers along the edge and corner, then pushed his hand through the top of it. \u0022The sides feel like they exist, but the middle is just, well, fog? Hard to describe.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGletrix didn\u0027t much care what it was made of, and was more than a little creeped out by it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027ve seen this before.\u0022 Jeb, standing across the square from Thomlock. \u0022They locked me up in a hospital for munths after I reported it.\u0022 He cocked his head as though trying to remmeber something distant. \u0022Come to think of it the hospital visit might have been after the plane crash.

The size of a small city.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMacfred walked up to the edge and started to pull himself on top when Agake and Gletrix stopped him.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Are you insane?!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Possibly. Likely. Might be we\u0027re all insane, and Sieta and the rest are the stable ones.

Why did everything have to get so weird? Gletrix had a good life back on Kerbin, back before she was recruited by the space program and trained by Thomlock. If she\u0027d known everything was as weird as it really was, she would\u0027ve stayed put. Lived on in ignorant bliss.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey spent the next several minutes debating the strange black square. Well, the rest of them did. Gletrix had tuned out and was watching one of the small moons as it drifted behind Jool, barely visible in the haze. Eventually Macfred decided it was time to get their next chore, and agreed they would revisit the strange square apparition in the future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext on the list was cleaning up the debris left by the Sulphur LDAV. When the heatshields were jettisoned prior to landing, they ended up creating a great deal of garbage. Structural pieces, I-beams, and whatnot. Macfred didn\u0027t want the garbage to still be laying around when they took off, so he sent the crew around to gather all the pieces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGletrix found a few small cubic struts and an I-beam to drag back, much the same as everyone else. No doubt other pieces had slipped into the sand and sunk halfway to the core of Laythe by now.

Before long all the bits were gathered in a pile at the lander. Afterwards, Macfred had them go around to remove excess mass from the lander.

We\u0027ll be stuck here either way, but we may not be able to land at all with the extra mass still attached.

Ok, so it wasn\u0027t officially on the flight plan, but all of them agreed it was the best way to tell leave their mark for future generations. (And much better than just leaving trash strewn about the surface.) Gletrix thought it was cool enough that she didn\u0027t even mind it cutting into her exploration time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt took the better part of an hour. All of them had to work together, most holding pieces while Macfred bolted them together with his space wrench.

Future explorers would no doubt find it and wonder what lunatics had built it. Why would they keep so many parachutes and explosive decouplers here, on the side of a dune? What madness was this? Were the lights supposed to be eyes? Why didn\u0027t it have any power? Did those that built it intend it as an offering to the Space God Jool? To the Great Powers?
