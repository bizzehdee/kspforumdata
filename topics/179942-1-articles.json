Torque acts like fuel in that it only flows through parts specifically that allow it to or by a fuel-line/axle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen a propeller or wheel is attached directory to an engine or motor, the axle is not needed; but if you use a single engine/motor to drive several wheels, I need a visual way to present the transference of torque from the engine to the wheels (or wheel blocks). Instead of consuming ElectricCharge, wheels will consume Torque, and that torque can be generated through various\u00A0means: turbine, engine, motor, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nightside","CreatedById":150244,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-21T05:07:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReally cool idea!

They use a new resource called Stamina to drive pedals that produce Torque, which in turn drives the wheels or propeller. They can replenish their Stamina by eating Snacks. The next chapter is about developing Steam engines, which leads into LiquidFuel engines, and so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-21T17:27:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223490773\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022179942\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221542739300\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022109593\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Electrocutor\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n22 hours ago, Electrocutor said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m looking for someone to make an animated model for me; or perhaps just an animated texture?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWish I wasn\u0027t so busy with existing projects; would offer to knock this out for you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you wanted to do the \u0027animated texture\u0027 routine, you could make something look like it is rotating by offsetting the UV coordinates of the texture.\u00A0 AFAIK you can do this straight from plugin code (grab the material, use the UV offset methods on it), with no need for an animation.\u00A0 I do similar in KerbalFoundries to animate the tank-track tread textures -- \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/shadowmage45/KSPWheel/blob/master/VSProject/KSPWheel/PartModules/KSPWheelTracks.cs#L56-L57\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/shadowmage45/KSPWheel/blob/master/VSProject/KSPWheel/PartModules/KSPWheelTracks.cs#L56-L57\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou -might- even be able to use the above code based method along with the existing stock \u0027fuel line\u0027 model and a custom texture, at least for initial testing/development purposes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
