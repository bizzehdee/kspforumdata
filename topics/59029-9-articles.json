I decided to share with you guys some images that have arisen from testing, \u003Cstrong\u003Eas long as you promise to understand that these are not final config of the upper stage and there are a lot of core properties such as textures, lower basket and engine config, attach points, fairings etc etc... which are incomplete.\u003C/strong\u003E For example, the images below where it\u0027s scaled to match the Orion model I had to use a really small upper stage nozzle because the shroud is not ready and I had to cram the whole thing into the KW Decoupler shroud from the old system. Also that scale of the model will have a totally different lower basket... you\u0027re just seeing the large scale one reduced to fit Orion. Also the small scale version will have different textures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img46/9206/e0le.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022e0le.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img203/6673/g2xg.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022g2xg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img560/8328/ol37.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ol37.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img21/1879/bdrv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bdrv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img34/558/ulbl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ulbl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img819/9863/l4k2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022l4k2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img11/5301/pjym.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022pjym.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img585/7886/a6yb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022a6yb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img268/2209/z800.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022z800.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img839/158/zn32.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022zn32.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img23/1633/9iue.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229iue.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor complete updates on the TALUS project see Talisar\u0027s WIP thread here \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65862-WIP-Talisar-Aerospace-Current-project-Large-Upper-Stage-coop-with-Chaka-Monkey-ES\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65862-WIP-Talisar-Aerospace-Current-project-Large-Upper-Stage-coop-with-Chaka-Monkey-ES\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-21T06:17:35Z\u0022 title=\u002201/21/2014 06:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by YANFRET\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"likke_A_boss","CreatedById":94697,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-21T06:26:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022YANFRET\u0022 data-cite=\u0022YANFRET\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Snip of Prettyness-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Chokes on banana* OH MH GAWD IS DAT A BLACK ALCOR POD ROVER WITH DA BMW LOGO!?!

Next thing you know there are three of them sitting on Duna, properly flown there using the the heavy lift system. It works really well they landed with fuel to spare. The first few pages of this thread have more pics of them sitting there with the Monkey Activity Landers and Rover Support Landers.
