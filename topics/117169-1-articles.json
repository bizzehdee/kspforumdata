Payload at the front, fuel at the back should work for takeoff.\n\nBy the time you start to run low on fuel and your CG starts shifting, you should be going ballistic and be in air so thin that it doesn\u0027t matter much (especially when at zero AoA).\n\nThen the problem is that you \\*must\\* release your payload, and come down with nearly empty tanks.\n\nAlso, you payload \\*must\\* always be within a certain mass range, or its not stable.\n\nI\u0027ve even made VT-HL rocket/airbreathing spaceplanes.\n\nThey launch normally like a rocket with CoL far behind CoM, and then go into a gravity turn fairly low, so that the turbos and rapiers can give a good push, and then after they detache the payload, they re-enter as a spaceplane.... very shuttle like... except its an SSTO (I\u0027ve considered some SRBs with cutes, and launching from the runway so that its more likely the SRBs land where they can get 100% recovery.\n\nLike so for the Vertical launch spaceplane:\n\n![11406970_10103666692715233_797871287752292423_n.jpg?oh=87a4373ff9843e82e1fc2545f08bd7ce\u0026oe=55FD5729](https://scontent-fra3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xtf1/v/t1.0-9/11406970_10103666692715233_797871287752292423_n.jpg?oh=87a4373ff9843e82e1fc2545f08bd7ce\u0026oe=55FD5729)\n\n(shown before using the fairing base to encase the payload.... which wasn\u0027t actually worth it because it made the frontal area so much bigger, and it was a 1.02 fairing that was 2x as heavy)\n\nAnd like so for SRB recovery to assist a vertical launch: \n\n![11057974_10103669579530033_499678238987866084_n.jpg?oh=4cb8f66d92ef693bc969afc33396ac1e\u0026oe=563DA757](https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/11057974_10103669579530033_499678238987866084_n.jpg?oh=4cb8f66d92ef693bc969afc33396ac1e\u0026oe=563DA757)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-29T16:15:28Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2015 04:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KerikBalm**"},{"CreatedByName":"Frank_G","CreatedById":100000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T16:16:04Z","Content":"If you maneuver carefully, the only thing you\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4ll need is a horizontal docking port inside the cargo bay.
