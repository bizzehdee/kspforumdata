There are things I want that simply will not happen, like being able to replay your flight from start to end, but a lot more could be done than what I listed here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I would like to be able to (but not obligated to) give a name to each and every part I use in my craft so that I could not see that \u0022Jumbo tank and Jumbo tank disconnected from each other\u0022, but rather \u0022Stage 3 Jumbo tank 1 disconnected from Stage 3 Jumbo tank 2\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, instead of a simple log that only helps you see which parts need more struts, I would like to have a tool that actually helps me improve the craft even when nothing goes wrong.
