Obviously, the easiest way out is to send more fuel from Kerbin, refuel the rover and take off. But, what\u0027s the point in making it the easy way?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I\u0027ve used Bon Voyage to travel to Tylo\u0027s highest point (or near enough that it doesn\u0027t matter) at around 11,000 meters (it is kind of cheating, as the rover can\u0027t climb those slopes, but Bon Voyage doesn\u0027t take that into account). Fortunately, my engineer happens to have a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E drill on hand, so if I remove everything that isn\u0027t needed nor I planned to stage away plus I remove the outer fuel tanks in flight I can squeeze juuuuuuust... nope, not enough fuel. I\u0027m short of some 200-300 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, so the kerbals can use their eva packs to get into orbit where I can later rescue them with the return ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut Tylo being Tylo, I have enough time to send one or maybe two kerbals to the safety of orbiting an alien body millions of kilometers away from home and protected from the void of space by just their spacesuits. But the third one will always crash before I get to him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, if I could get the three on EVA at the same time and keep them within physics range, they can theoretically burn prograde and achieve orbit. The problem is that manually jumping from one kerbal to the other wouldn\u0027t work, because the moment I loose control of a kerbal, the eva suit would shut down. So I need to somehow assemble them into a single \u0022ship\u0022 (but they can still use their eva packs. Kerbals grabbing each other during evas?) so I control them manually, or I need some sort of autopilot which works with kerbals on EVA (I haven\u0027t tried \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E autopilot yet, would it work?) or something that keeps them firing their eva suits prograde while I\u0027m not piloting them. .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, is it possible?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, album, because pictures\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/2yfsF\u0022
