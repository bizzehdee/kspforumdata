I tend to build in the 15 to 20 ton range and most of the space planes I get in atmo with the aerospike tend to have ~200 to 500m/s delta v to spare. Which is ok as long as I dock before I leave a planet to refuel but it\u0027s always tight and isn\u0027t enough for a few places. Most of my attempts to use atomic engines have had issues maintaining speed while trying to push out of atmo. In general I will be flying at around 1200 to 1600m/s and at 22k to 24k altitude but even in my smaller craft the atomic just doesn\u0027t have the umph to get me up and out before I lose too much speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain this is an issue with my personal limitation of not wanting to place more then 1-2 intakes per jet engine preventing me from getting out of atmo with an atomic engine. I can air hog and get into a LKO with 3000\u002B m/s of delta v but I don\u0027t find that a fun way to play.

Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere at 20km is less than 2% of the surface density, which means that rockets perform with nearly their vacuum ISP (the LV-N for example has 789s at 20km). The main issue is that you typically need a rocket TWR of at least 1 to get an efficient to-orbit transfer from 25km. But suppose we could do it with 0.5: that means that you would need one LV-N for every 12t of vessel (though the LV-N eats up 2.5t of that), so you will need at least to 2 for a 20t ship if those are your only engines, but I don\u0027t know if that leaves enough mass for the rest of the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing to consider is replacing your aerospikes with LV-T30s. the T30 has 5% less vacuum ISP (and we already established that sea-level ISP is irrelevant here) but 47% more TWR.

If the T30 is overkill for your rocket then the mini-rockomax engines (the 24-77 or the 48-7s) are great options for boosting TWR for the early part of your rocket ascent, plus they add vectoring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need to carry all your engines with you wherever you go.

I don\u0027t see a way to do it nuke-only, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe normal jet-and-rocket spaceplane has 2 main stages of flight. First the \u0022jet phase\u0022, where it builds up speed and altitude, then the \u0022rocket phase\u0022 where it goes the rest of the way out of the atmosphere and circularizes. These 2 phases require different things from the engine. In the \u0022rocket phase\u0022, thrust is the dominant factor, but in the \u0022jet phase\u0022, it\u0027s Isp. While nukes alone MIGHT be able to handle the \u0022rocket phase\u0022 (although probably not lifting much more than the fuel they need for it), the real problem is in the \u0022jet phase\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the \u0022jet phase\u0022, you don\u0027t need any more thrust than the bare minimum needed to move forward and generate just enough lift to climb, however slowly. Not saying you can\u0027t thrust your way through this phase, too--most folks do--but you don\u0027t have to. If you have enough wing, the wings can keep you in the air and do the actual climbing, and all the engines do is build up speed. So far, that fits nukes because they have very low thrust. HOWEVER, the less thrust you have, the longer it takes to accumulate the necessary speed and altitude to enter the \u0022rocket phase\u0022. And the longer the \u0022jet phase\u0022 lasts, the more fuel you need during it. This is where nukes fail miserably, because most of the \u0022jet phase\u0022 is happening in thick air where nukes have pathetic Isp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENukes in atmosphere have 220 Isp and produce only 60 kN thrust anywhere. The stock Basic Jet Engine has 7200 Isp and 100 kN, so you need 2 nukes to match the thrust of 1 jet. But each nuke burns 32x as much fuel as the jet to produce this thrust, so a 2-nuke spaceplane would need \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E64x\u003C/span\u003E the amount of fuel of a 1-jet spaceplane during the \u0022jet phase\u0022. Of course, that much fuel would add massive amounts of weight, so you\u0027d need even more nukes just to get it off the ground, which would in turn require another huge helping of fuel, which would require yet more engines in a self-reinforcing cycle of futility. Nukes in atmosphere are just too fuel-hungry, even with wings helping them, to do the \u0022jet phase\u0022 of flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"saik0","CreatedById":57205,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-28T19:19:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s possible with a 3:1 intake to turbojet ratio. My strategy was once near the max velocity I could get with the turbojets (1820 m/s at 27km) at full throttle, I pitched up, throttled back and burned both the nuke and the jets until they didnt have enough air to keep climbing. Then killed the jets and maxed the throttle on the nuke until my Ap was a the desired alt. I used MJ to control the throttle to prevent burnout.

I\u0027ve done it vanilla but with a pair of Rockomax 48-7s for some extra thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the craft I used:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/DR7GF\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

I don\u0027t see a way to do it nuke-only, though.\u003Cp\u003EThe normal jet-and-rocket spaceplane has 2 main stages of flight. First the \u0022jet phase\u0022, where it builds up speed and altitude, then the \u0022rocket phase\u0022 where it goes the rest of the way out of the atmosphere and circularizes. These 2 phases require different things from the engine. In the \u0022rocket phase\u0022, thrust is the dominant factor, but in the \u0022jet phase\u0022, it\u0027s Isp. While nukes alone MIGHT be able to handle the \u0022rocket phase\u0022 (although probably not lifting much more than the fuel they need for it), the real problem is in the \u0022jet phase\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the \u0022jet phase\u0022, you don\u0027t need any more thrust than the bare minimum needed to move forward and generate just enough lift to climb, however slowly. Not saying you can\u0027t thrust your way through this phase, too--most folks do--but you don\u0027t have to. If you have enough wing, the wings can keep you in the air and do the actual climbing, and all the engines do is build up speed. So far, that fits nukes because they have very low thrust. HOWEVER, the less thrust you have, the longer it takes to accumulate the necessary speed and altitude to enter the \u0022rocket phase\u0022. And the longer the \u0022jet phase\u0022 lasts, the more fuel you need during it. This is where nukes fail miserably, because most of the \u0022jet phase\u0022 is happening in thick air where nukes have pathetic Isp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENukes in atmosphere have 220 Isp and produce only 60 kN thrust anywhere. The stock Basic Jet Engine has 7200 Isp and 100 kN, so you need 2 nukes to match the thrust of 1 jet. But each nuke burns 32x as much fuel as the jet to produce this thrust, so a 2-nuke spaceplane would need \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E64x\u003C/span\u003E the amount of fuel of a 1-jet spaceplane during the \u0022jet phase\u0022. Of course, that much fuel would add massive amounts of weight, so you\u0027d need even more nukes just to get it off the ground, which would in turn require another huge helping of fuel, which would require yet more engines in a self-reinforcing cycle of futility. Nukes in atmosphere are just too fuel-hungry, even with wings helping them, to do the \u0022jet phase\u0022 of flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou seem to be assuming a lot and not really understanding what the original question was. I have no problem in the \u0022jet phase\u0022. I am not trying to use the atomic engine to get off the runway. The specific impulse of the atomic engine at 24km is almost exactly the same as it is at 100km. I do not and would not use the atomic engine until the jet engines were so starved for oxygen that they ceased to function. My problem is specifically not having the thrust necessary with the atomic engine, unless I air hog, to maintain the speed necessary after the jet engines cease to function to reach LKO at my space plane size.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kozenger","CreatedById":80386,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T01:06:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022arq\u0022 data-cite=\u0022arq\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGenerally I end up with 2-2.5 intakes/jet on my SSTO\u0027s. As for getting into orbit with only an LV-N, I have not succeeded in doing so but I haven\u0027t actually tried. Still, with 9 intakes, 4 turbojets, 2 LV-T30s, and 1 LV-N I have been to the surface of Minmus and back.\u003Cp\u003EThe issue with rockets for SSTO ascent isn\u0027t ISP, it\u0027s thrust. Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere at 20km is less than 2% of the surface density, which means that rockets perform with nearly their vacuum ISP (the LV-N for example has 789s at 20km). The main issue is that you typically need a rocket TWR of at least 1 to get an efficient to-orbit transfer from 25km. But suppose we could do it with 0.5: that means that you would need one LV-N for every 12t of vessel (though the LV-N eats up 2.5t of that), so you will need at least to 2 for a 20t ship if those are your only engines, but I don\u0027t know if that leaves enough mass for the rest of the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing to consider is replacing your aerospikes with LV-T30s. the T30 has 5% less vacuum ISP (and we already established that sea-level ISP is irrelevant here) but 47% more TWR. Because of its low TWR, the aerospike is only really useful in thick air where it can take advantage of its very high ISP (even on Kerbin, it\u0027s only really useful for the first 10-15km, otherwise I use T-30s). If the T30 is overkill for your rocket then the mini-rockomax engines (the 24-77 or the 48-7s) are great options for boosting TWR for the early part of your rocket ascent, plus they add vectoring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need to carry all your engines with you wherever you go. Bringing a load of aerospikes to Mun or Duna is heavy. Thus it is best to use a single LV-N and let the rest of your engines have high TWR, so that you can minimize engine mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving three types of engines was going to be what I was trying next. It means a larger ship which is something I wished to avoid but like you said the thrust on the atomic alone just isn\u0027t enough, if you don\u0027t air hog, to do the trick. You make some excellent points for the T30s over aerospikes. An aerospike is enough TWR on smaller ships like mine to reach LKO. The main reason why I got into using aerospikes over T30s is the lower profile. Before I got my stick it was tough to have a strong angle of attack and not clip the engine on take off. The only issue of having the lower thrust to weight, aside from trying to get to speed to hit orbit, is longer burn times. Once you are in orbit the extra thrust to weight doesn\u0027t have as much value, as long as you have above 1 to escape from where ever you are going you can plan for longer burn times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for the information.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dangerous_Beans","CreatedById":78059,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T12:57:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere here is my attempt; two nukes, one jet, achieved orbit with 1.3km/s Dv\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/dw4D8\u0022 alt=\u0022dw4D8\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-30T00:45:56Z\u0022 title=\u002208/30/2013 12:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Dangerous_Beans\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T18:12:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ED_B, try \u003Cimg src=\u0022the%20url\u0022 alt=\u0022the url\u0022\u003E.

(Yes, that aproximates its TWR of 2.7) In those same tests, it turned out that both the aerospike (launching with a total mass of over 14.5 tons) and the LV-T30 (launching with a total mass of over 22.5 tons) were able to achieve escape V after converting their payloads (fuel) into thrust. In contrast, when the atomic was done converting its fuel payload into thrust, its projected apoapsis was about 185000 meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess it really boils down to what the mission is, and if you can afford it, how cool you want it to look. :-) Good luck on your project!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
