Personally i do not consider swapping OX to LF a cheat, and ive actually done this to my 0.90 capital ships, as im too lazy to rebuild outdated designs from scratch.\n\nThat said, if you arent happy modyfying files, there is just no way to do it, either use the spaceplane tanks, drain oxy and have twice as many tanks, or if you dont like either of those, wait for an update (assuming we ever get it) that lets us pick what fuel and how much goes into a tank (with a hard limit being its capacity)."},{"CreatedByName":"DerekL1963","CreatedById":57091,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T05:49:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Marginally, like less than half a ton for the tallest 1.25m\n\nThat\u0027s on the order of a full ton just for the outrigger engines on my standard tug - about 3% of it\u0027s max standard payload.
