So how do I do a Jool-5 ship with multiple landers that doesn\u0027t look like a fire extinguisher making love to a hat rack? This stowable SSTO for Laythe may be part of the solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ran a quick test to see if I could make a working SSTO plane that can pack down to fit in a Mk3 cargo bay. So far, everything looks great! Here\u0027s the Korigame assembled, in atmosphere:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CeONAkw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CeONAkw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s marignally stable, and I mean that in a good way, as in I can aim it anywhere and it tends to go that direction. When it does flip and spin, reaction wheels are enough to recover. SSTO on Kerbin with fuel to spare. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt comes in two pieces that fit together in a 5-segment Mk3 bay.

View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was probably a couple of degrees off matching front to back but I don\u0027t think that will matter. I may also experiment with a triple mount of small ports to ensure perfect alignment every time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am also quite happy with the arrangement of RCS thrusters. Note the groups on the wingtips; one four-way thruster and two place-anywhere pods on each side gives full symmetric 3-axis control for the back end. Similar arrangement on the pilot section. My previous designs had four-way thrusters all around, and typically the top/bottom mounts were not symmetric due to obstructions like the vertical stabilizer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow all I have to do is invent a stowable Tylo lander \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deutherius","CreatedById":125381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T13:38:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, we\u0027ve got a Base-in-a-box, Space-station-in-a-box, and now an SSTO-in-a-box.

I also tried mounting to the side wall, but did not have enough room for the engine in that direction. An even more space-efficient arrangement would have been to put a pair of ram air intakes in the rear section on either side of the fuel tank, and change the inline cockpit/shock cone for a pointy Mk1 and an extra FL-T100.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tweety","CreatedById":115567,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T16:12:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have built something like that before for an egg challenge but mine was a whole plane in a mk3 cargobay, the idea of carry it in pieces is a very good idea that I may steal though.

Actually I looked in the Egg Challenge thread for ideas when I was trying to do this, and I do remember your Egg from that. I ended up going with the break-apart concept after realizing that none of the Egg ships looked both (1) Laythe-SSTO capable, and (2) as though they would have enough wing area for a dead-stick landing in V1. I could well be wrong on both counts, but am pretty pleased with how this ended up none the less.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tweety","CreatedById":115567,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T16:31:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re not wrong.
