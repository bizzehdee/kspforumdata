So I\u0027ll spend maybe an hour trying to stop a certain gigantic launch rocket from exploding, but then I\u0027ll just get fed up with the issue entirely and just cheat it into orbit since the math I have tells me the rocket should have been able to make it to orbit anyways and it\u0027s not my fault KSP\u0027s part attach nodes are all effectively on springs. If that part-welding mod for KSP 1 still worked, I\u0027d love to use that and KJR quite a lot, because \u0022just because I didn\u0027t put a strut between those two parts that are already attached by nodes doesn\u0027t mean that the joint there is supposed to be weak\u0022 I mean we\u0027re using smaller parts to emulate large contiguous parts, and large contiguous parts of rockets IRL don\u0027t just \u0022fold in on themselves\u0022 when the engineering is sound and the execution of constructing the thing you engineered is done to a high level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbals can build rockets that get to Eeloo, the idea that they\u0027re bumbling idiots that can mysteriously produce rockets just breaks my immersion. Therefore, the idea that they would be incapable of welding multiple fuel tank barrel sections together to make one of the requisite length with enough fidelity in the welding process to generate the needed structural strength is simply beyond ludicrous to me.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf they can build rockets, they can build rockets. Rockets that explode when they aren\u0027t meant to explode aren\u0027t rockets, they\u0027re Unintended Explosive Objects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause of this, I would be just fine if KSP 2 entirely did away with simulating in-vessel structural loads. Like in Space Engineers, I believe that it should be left to the player to engineer things so that they look like they would survive the loads put on them. Simultaneously, I wish that the mass fractions and thrust-to-weight ratios were much more realistic in this game, along with the scale of the planets. Basically, I\u0027d be fine with a Real-Scale Kerbal Solar System, provided that the rocket engines and fuel tanks performed similarly to real-world rocket hardware (for which specifications are readily available). This would make it much more obvious to players that while you need a lot of thrust to get off the ground, you don\u0027t need a lot of thrust to get to orbit, and getting to orbit should take roughly 15 minutes from liftoff to final circularization. It would also make it much more interesting to design vessels with limited Delta-V budgets, as right now with vanilla KSP 1 it\u0027s almost trivial to get to Eeloo with just chemical engines, whereas if you wanted to get to Pluto IRL and enter orbit there (not just doing a fast fly-by like New Horizons did a few years ago), you\u0027d basically give the player a REALLY GOOD REASON to use that LV-N \u0022Nerv\u0022, especially if it had realistic statistics!\u003Cbr\u003E\nRight now the LV-N \u0022Nerv\u0022 has such a poor \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E that you could get out and push with the suit jetpack faster, and such a high heat production that I just basically ignore it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat high heat production only further reduces \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E because you have to pack radiators now to keep it cool, and did I mention that those radiators are more parts on your vessel, which increases lag? Yet another reason to steer clear of the LV-N Nerv.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI remember the LV-N being a REALLY GOOD (not \u0022overpowered good\u0022, because it was long and skinny which makes using it in a lander really hard, and it\u0027s horrible in an atmosphere, and the shroud stays on the engine instead of sticking to the decoupler) \u0022in-space\u0022 engine, but that was long long ago before KSP was even on Steam, back before the LV-N was changed to only run on Liquid Fuel and not \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E. For a very long time, that change to run on only \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E and not the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E mix meant that you basically couldn\u0027t use 90% of the game\u0027s fuel tank parts with that engine because even with taking out the not-needed Oxidizer in those tanks, you still had to carry around the dry mass of that empty part of that tank. Even now, the Mk3 liquid fuel fuselage doesn\u0027t have as good of a mass ratio as your typical cylindrical \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E tank and it generates MUCH more drag in an atmosphere to boot, both of which really don\u0027t help things for a craft using those and the Nerv.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEven with those changes, the LV-N Nerv has always had this really arbitrary high heat production that makes it have a real problem with overheating, something LITERALLY NO OTHER ENGINE CURRENTLY IN KSP has. The Mainsail used to have a similar issue, but they got rid of that.\u003Cbr\u003E\nReally, the LV-N Nerv ought to be more rightly called the LV-N \u0022Nerf\u0022, because they\u0027ve nerfed it\u0027s performance so much that you basically have to go out of your way to find an excuse to use the thing, which is NOT the way it should be. It should be well suited to moving large payloads long distances, but don\u0027t try to prevent an ingenious player from using it on a lander if that player manages to make it fit, and they feel like making their already green Kerbals glow in the dark. Now that I think of it, the radiation danger the engine poses might be a MUCH BETTER way to \u0022limit\u0022 the LV-N to use in \u0022mothership\u0022 type vessels where you can make a long spine to keep the engines away from the habitation section.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EnderKid2","CreatedById":145622,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-20T19:42:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat heat production?
