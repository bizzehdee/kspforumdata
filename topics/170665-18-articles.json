The theory that Rey is Kylo Rens Lint side equivalent is disgusting. That\u0027s is why Rey has \u0022Raw \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPowaaa\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u0022!\u00A0Then why does Kylo Have Raw Power in the first place. If the light needed a counter to the dark why give the dark a foothold in Kylo in the first place. It can\u0027t end well someone will win so how can they be a counter. Second If the force would create a equal opposite of A user to maintain balance why didn\u0027t all the Sith and\u00A0Jedi Pull a Yoda and disappear. It didn\u0027t it created Anakin to destroy both the Jedi and Sith in numbers. I think it\u0027s ridiculous, Rey\u0027s power. Implying she is more or less powerful than Kylo is wring if she is the polar opposite always adjusting to the enemies power. When Kylo is shot in TFA Rey should have been weakened too if this is the case. My point in this post is them being adjusting opposites of the force just can\u0027t happen like that without destroying the entire last 2 trilogies of Star Wars. Rey is a overpowered Charachter\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cheif Operations Director","CreatedById":183218,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-05T08:51:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nok here is an idea Instead of the disaster of a plot we get what if they went with the fan theory that Rey was ONCE TRAINED.\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003ELet me explain PLEASE!\u00A0\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EOk so in short that Rey once trained at the academy and escaped/evacuated either or\u00A0and then had her memory erased by skywlaker and let her on Jakku. When she wasn\u0027t reminded of the force we tapped into her former self and began to remember. Especially when Kylo said the word force. It would trigger her mind to use all her trained power. THIS WOULD DESTROY THE ENITRE ARUGUEMNT OF A MARY SUE! It would make complete sense. She has a higher than normal force ability but inst over powered but instead was trained and \u0022forgot\u0022 She was still not proficient but used her former knowledge to her ability. In Ep 8 this would be revealed on Ach To. Luke would still be a grumpy person and say the Jedi would end but instead would help her develop her abilities like Mace Windu. Using the Dark and the Light But for the benifit of others. She would be pretty much in terms of light and dark Mace Windu. This way Luke sets up the 3rd Jedi Order in the canon The Users of the light and the dark for Lightside ideals such as mercy, compassion, \u00A0etc. This way Luke isn\u0027t wasted. Rey has a legitimate reason for her power. Also further adding some obstacles in her path like the inability to remember her former training and self and the Luke Temple and such would be nice to make her more relatable to the Audiance. Lastly a scene would be her about to be killed By Kylo Because she was arrogant when he strikes she falls of the edge of a railing. Into a escape pod. Kylo Jumps down as the door closes. The lightsaber penitrates the pod and goes down her arm into her bone verticly so her arm is stil, attached but useless. The pod fires as this happens. This requires a Cybernetic Arm. This way it shows she isn\u0027t perfect and needs to study more and also shows some physical trama for her Hero Status. This would make Rey into SUCH A BETTER CHARACTER in my Opinion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurther to represent her Balance of Light and Dark.

Gets thrown around by Snoke and only escapes because Kylo manages to disguise his intentions and kill off his master. Defeats Snoke\u0027s guards by teaming up with Kylo. And then - her plan falls apart. Kylo aint for turning and, as Luke warned her from the outset, things didn\u0027t go the way she thought they would.

Powerful - sure. Overpowered - possibly. That\u0027s fine - I think we need a foil for Kylo (a film about the First Order overpowering everybody because of Kylo would be pretty dull as well) and any such foil needs to be powerful to be credible. But a Mary Sue - I\u0027m not seeing it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsider her story arc in TLJ.\u00A0 Persuades Luke to give her three lessons in the Force against his better judgment and so (at last) gets some sense of her place within the Force. Is shown to be careless and prone to overexcitement (chopping that rock in half for example). Misreads her Force link with Kylo and as a result devises a plan to turn him. Gets thrown around by Snoke and only escapes because Kylo manages to disguise his intentions and kill off his master. Defeats Snoke\u0027s guards by teaming up with Kylo. And then - her plan falls apart. Kylo aint for turning and, as Luke warned her from the outset, things didn\u0027t go the way she thought they would. Finally, she\u0027s shown to be a match (in one sense) anyway for Kylo but can\u0027t defeat him. She also had to come to terms with her parentage, which may or may not turn out to be a weakness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor all her raw strength in the Force and skill with a lightsaber, she \u003Cem\u003Elost\u003C/em\u003E. And without Kylo\u0027s intervention she would be \u003Cem\u003Edead. \u003C/em\u003ESo I have to say I disagree with the idea that she\u0027s a bland, two-powerful-to-be-interesting character. Right now, I\u0027d say (in classic Star Wars style) that she still has much to learn. How that learning is\u00A0depicted in the next film will make all the difference and yes, depending on the quality of the script I can see her \u003Cem\u003Ebecoming\u003C/em\u003E a Mary Sue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut for now I don\u0027t think that label is justified.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRead my alternate Rey charachter post.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext the problem is why do we have \u0022RAW POWAAA!\u0022 Now in the franchise why didn\u0027t Anakin get \u0022RAW POWAAA!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cheif Operations Director","CreatedById":183218,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-05T17:42:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223260318\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022168580\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221515167648\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022175356\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MiffedStarfish\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, MiffedStarfish said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour arguement is that Kylo shouyld have destroyed Rey, right?
