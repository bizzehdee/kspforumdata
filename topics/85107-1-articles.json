Never tried mods before? Want to know where to begin? Then start here. I offer this project for community input on the various mods listed. I present two mod lists: a KSP Bare Essentials mod list that doesn\u0027t include multiplayer and parts, and a KSP Essentials mod list that adds mods that introduce game features and concepts that are most likely to be in a gold release of KSP. The aim of this mod list is to get you started trying out different mods on your own and help you resolve any incompatibilities with the mods in this list. I invite the community to help me fully test out the mods in the list, and generate information on how to resolve incompatibilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Mod Developers! Want to grow your fan base? Want to help the community discover solutions to incompatibility problems you\u0027ve been having with other mods? Then post here if your mod is listed in the KSP Essentials Mod List below, or if you\u0027d like to be considered for inclusion. I will attempt to contact all mod developers on the KSP Essentials Mod List in their respective mod development threads in order to elicit their support and participation in this thread as necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy goal is to eventually include these listed mods and any incompatibility solutions we discover, into a downloadable KSP Essentials Mod Pack. \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EWe will not include any restricted license mods in the KSP Essentials Mod Pack that we do not have permission to redistribute.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E If you decline having your mod included in the KSP Essentials Mod Pack, then your mod will not be included in any released mod pack, but your mod may remain on the KSP Essentials Mod List until we find a more open alternative. That said, we hope you will support the purpose of this thread to provide the KSP fan base a much-needed service to evaluate the compatibilities of your mod with other mods in this mod list, and provide solutions for any incompatibilities that are discovered. We hope you would also be willing to let us share those solutions in a released mod pack, where you get the credit, and this thread handles the initial support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy \u0022Inigma\u0027s\u0022 KSP Essentials Mod List?

I\u0027ve found that the vast majority of you are in favor of maintained mod lists, but I also know there has been a lot of emotion involved with the discussion of mod packs. I figured I\u0027d start with a mod list, invite mod devs to participate in confirming or resolving compatibilities, and then seek building a mod pack with permission from any remaining restricted mod developers as necessary. It may turn out that the KSP Essential Mod List will differ from the KSP Essential Mod pack based on restrictions. I want to invite mod devs to help with this project regardless. Information on mod compatibility should be every developer\u0027s concern. If anyone should have a say in how mod packs should be created, maintained, and supported, it is our wonderful mod development community. I offer you to have that say now, especially if you are in fact one of the mod developers listed above. Let\u0027s see what we can do to work together to provide a service the KSP fan base needs now that the number of mods to choose from is growing every day, and not every mod developer is testing for incompatibilities with every other mod. Let\u0027s make this a community project where I as a mod list and possible mod pack manager set the theme, and you as the mod dev set the terms, and you as the KSP fan set the standard of what is really wanted.

So far, multiple versions of mod manager dll is installed in GameData after installing all these listed mods.

I hope to cull this mod pack list of mods that have restrictions on redistribution.

When starting DMP for the first time, the persistent.sfs file is not properly populated so users who click on Resume Game, prior to having ever connected to a DMP server, will get prompted by KSP to delete the invalid save file. Fix is to simply include a valid persistent.sfs file in DMP on DMP install. Issue reported to DMP dev. Can be fixed by dev, or by KSP Essentials Mod Pack when its published.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. 64 bit KSP is not fully supported by some mods in the mod list, such as Toolbar. In one of my stock save games, KSP will crash on game load when either DMP is loaded with TAC Fuel Balancer or Kerbal Alarm Clock. Removing DMP prevents the crash entirely. Keeping DMP but removing TAC Fuel Balancer and Kerbal Alarm Clock prevents the crash too. 32 bit version of KSP has no such issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-22T07:18:20Z\u0022 title=\u002209/22/2014 07:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by inigma\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"inigma","CreatedById":69310,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-21T04:53:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EInigma\u0027s KSP Bare Essentials Mod Pack\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ETheme:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe theme of this mod pack is a minimalistic set of tested mods that are universally accepted, and do not conflict with other mods in this pack or the KSP Essentials Mod List, or most other mods for that matter, and introduce concepts and add or fix missing parts that should be in a gold release of KSP.

Looking at this thread, you have checkmarks for compatibility. What does that even mean? Unlike in other games, KSP mods very rarely conflict.

You upload your pack, a bunch of people download it, and... you get the download counts. On Kerbal Stuff, mod visibility in search and the home page are influenced by hits. The same is true of Google Search and all kinds of hosting providers.

Some basic dependency management skills are essential to installing KSP mods, and it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Ereally not hard\u003C/em\u003E. Modders are very careful when introducing dependencies to make sure they soft-fail as much as possible, and many mods will automatically work out which dependencies to use at run time. Downloading one file is nice, but it\u0027s entirely offset by the possibility that one mod is out-of-date, and the user has to uninstall it, install the correct version, and then sort out whatever differences there were between the original and packed versions. The benefits are so quickly washed out by complications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest you push the envelope on mod lists, and work on ways to make it easier for users to find and use them. There are a lot of possibilities here, including tools for managing automatic installation of lists, or even first-class mod list support on sites like Kerbal Stuff.

Simple eh? Stick to that response, forever, and there will be no issues. In fact, isn\u0027t this what is already being told to mod users that are having problems? So my approach is nothing different than what is already being done. I wouldn\u0027t expect mod devs to change what they are doing now anyways. It really is a seamless response. Except now the community has another point of support: this mod pack\u0027s user community, where I hope this mod pack user base collective intelligence will resolve problems even faster than the current user-mod dev support model. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Majiir When not addressing major KSP version compatibility, the majority of the time Kethane releases new versions, those versions contain new features, not necessarily always a removal of old features. So even current documentation of Kethane features is usually sufficient to assist users of deprecated mod packs. In fact, this is true for most iterations of software anyways. But even if not, users of this mod list/pack are encouraged to post their questions here first anyways so users can benefit from the collective knowledge of the user base. Regardless though where they may initiate their support request, if you ever received a question from a user of an old version of Kethane, what do you tell them if they are asking a feature or bug question? You should be telling them to upgrade first and then ask their question! Why would you think twice about saying anything different to mod pack users, or even wondering if they were mod pack users? Your support answer should always be the same to users of old Kethane versions regardless of where they got it: Upgrade! When those users upgrade and still have questions... then what? Are you saying you\u0027ve worked hard to not handle support questions from new users? Does this mean you\u0027ve worked hard not to have new users then? I\u0027m confused. I think your desire to reduce support request workload is commendable. But with new users comes the increase, mod pack or not. Are you saying then you don\u0027t want new users? After all, if we eliminate the worry over supporting deprecated versions by both accepting the real need for users to be running updated mods anyways, then it should be a non issue. I as mod pack owner should be responsible for updating the pack, of course, but it\u0027s beside the point: upgrade individually or via pack is the universal response we both have to the deprecated version concern. If this project can draw in people who\u0027ve never used mods before and can teach them by osmosis to manage their own desired mods individually whenever they run into a major problem or out-of-date feature questions, I will have achieved another goal of this thread: KSP fan base mod education. I would hope Kethane would be an integral part of this introduction to KSP mods to such users - if you\u0027re interested in the increased fan base (and ok with the increase in support questions from users using updated versions of Kethane).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the suggestion about mod management tools. I want to investigate them in the future. Do you know of any you\u0027d recommend? If there was an easy way to have a mod pack inform users of new versions of mods that are out, I would adopt it for this project in a heartbeat! If not, then I only have time to test mod list compatibilities, and publish a mod list. I haven\u0027t even assembled the pack and probably wont until .25 comes out, although I might release the Bare Essentials pack before then.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-23T05:15:37Z\u0022 title=\u002209/23/2014 05:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by inigma\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
