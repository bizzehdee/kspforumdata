Currently trying to polish things up and follow the rules. In doing so, I encountered three instances of part clipping, as seen in the three images in this Imgur album. The first one is an instance of a strut clipping through a fairing. The second is an instance of a separator clipping into a external command seat, and the third is a minor case of a radial parachute clipping into a radial decoupler. Might not even be visible from the image. Is any one of these in violation of the rules?
