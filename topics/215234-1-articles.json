The reason for this is that the spacecraft is required to burn at the maneuver in a straight line, while it is on a curved path. At the start of the burn, the maneuver marker is directly on top of the prograde marker, but with each second that passes, the spacecraft will \u0022nose up\u0022 more with respect to prograde. After a quarter of an orbit, the spacecraft will be facing fully radial-out, and not burn prograde at all anymore.

Unfortunately, the maneuver planner doesn\u0027t just not support either - it actively interferes with both, because (a) you cannot plan any trajectory that doesn\u0027t follow the maneuver marker in a straight line, and (b) you cannot plan any trajectory that the spacecraft cannot execute in a single burn. As a result, any spacecraft which cannot reach Kerbin escape velocity in roughly 10-ish minutes cannot plan any interplanetary trips from low Kerbin orbit; they need to be manually piloted to escape velocity and enter solar orbit before maneuver nodes become usable once more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m currently working on a large, detailed feedback report which I will submit through the launcher; cross your fingers it won\u0027t get lost...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-17T10:12:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is what the path along the burn will look like, it\u0027s correct.

To give me a preview of my trajectory before I light my engines. So even if I, with a four-digit number of hours in KSP, can in fact fly a low-thrust probe to Moho without making a maneuver node, that doesn\u0027t excuse the maneuver planner from being unable to calculate this trajectory for all the players who don\u0027t have my experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAcceleration under timewarp for low-thrust propulsion is one of \u003Cem\u003Ethe\u003C/em\u003E headline promises of KSP2.
