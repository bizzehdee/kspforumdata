The engines velocity curve is capped so if your ascending properly, it wouldn\u0027t do you any good. You should have enough air to get to 1200-1500m/s @ 20-25km, do that and air hogging is unnecessary because the engines will soon cut out due to speed, not air. It depends on the engine, I\u0027ve found speed gains are too low for turbo jets around 1300m/s. Rapiers are a bit higher. Don\u0027t bother trying to air hog, just get to 20km, level off an accelerate till your engines just can\u0027t accelerate anymore and then pitch up. You should get 30-40k apoapsis at that speed before they finally cut out and most importantly, your periapsis should be much higher. Maximize horizontal speed and you will make it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- How do people generally power bigger space planes but avoid flameout yaw trouble without clipping lots of engines together?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can do the intake/engine placement trick above. Or you can just set them to an action group and shut them off when you hear them start to die. They make a rather distinctive noise just before flameout and some tiny control may waver. At that point, hit the action group and stage your rockets in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Is there a way to work out the optimum speed/altitude curve for turbojets/shock cones against aircraft drag?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe velocity curve is in the engines config section in the far config files for stock engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Is my approach of getting to 40km and as fast as I can to get the apoapsis out beyoned 100km and then coasting to apoapsis to use the rockets to bring my periapsis up the correct approach?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo. As mentioned above, Horizontal speed (periapsis) is the most important. It costs a lot to cirularize, and by going faster before switching off air breathers, you lower the amount you have to circularize in the end. Follow the instructions above to maximize horizontal speed before switching to rockets. Once you do switch to rockets, you can likely throttle way back and still climb as not to burn fuel needlessly. Continue with your nose at 15 degrees till you hit 70km and you will find your periapsis is very close to positive. You will end up with a circularization burn of 10 seconds or less, and finally you will find a lot of fuel left in your tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: One other thing, LFO engines are more efficient at a lower throttle, so rather than powering up at full throttle, climb slow and steady and increase that periapsis at the same time. It seems like your burning longer, but at a lower throttle your actually saving fuel. If you have engineer you can see this fact in the dV estimation. A engine with 30 seconds dV at full throttle may have 3 minutes at 1/3 throttle. That\u0027s a lot more than 1/3 gain.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-11T13:15:22Z\u0022 title=\u002211/11/2014 01:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RizzoTheRat","CreatedById":123362,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T13:15:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry, failed to properly describe my relationship with FAR, I\u0027ve taken it off for now and am back on the stock aerodynamics model.

I know a lot of people don\u0027t care for them due to their weight and low thrust compared to the turbojets, but I was sold when I realized how much less air they require before flaming out. I currently have a spaceplane powered by two RAPIER engines, with one shock cone and two structural air intakes per engine, and I can usually get going to around 1500m/s around 30,000m before they autoswitch over to oxidizer. It has all the mission-equipment installed: large cargo bay, docking port, full RCS systems, solar panels, and spare batteries. The one downside of the RAPIER engines is they don\u0027t have alternators so you\u0027ll need to bring enough battery power to run your SAS and/or reaction-wheels until you get to orbit and deploy solar panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA couple things to remember, when you do switch to rocket power (conventional rockets or RAPIER closed-cycle mode) make sure you have a hotkey programmed to toggle your intakes closed; this will take away drag, especially if you have a bunch of them. Also, look at tailoring your fuel balance for your spaceplane trajectory. You have two ends of the spectrum: a steep ascent requiring a longer gravity burn at your apoapsis, or a flat trajectory gaining high speed across the ground while in the upper atmosphere requiring a short gravity burn at the end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Steep climb: requires more raw thrust-to-weight ratio and oxidizer for the rocket engines since those will be burning much longer than air-breathing engines. Not very ideal for RAPIERs due to lower thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Flat high-speed atmo trajectory: requires a more precise balance between weight and lift, but requires less oxidizer (which is heavier) for the rockets. RAPIERs take advantage of this method.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManual switching the RAPIERs can squeeze out a little more altitude if you manage your throttle, but you\u0027ll be fighting the asymmetric thrust tendency of the stock aero as the engines start getting air-starved. These are just my techniques, so take them as suggestions, not what\u0027s right or wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: some guy did a youtube video testing various engine configs using turbojets, rockets, aerospikes and RAPIERs.

There is no such air breathing engine in existence or even theorized that can go that fast. The top existing one, the SR-71, can go ~1150 m/s. The work in progress Skylon (the basis for the RAPIER engine) is theorized to go 1700 m/s. 2000m/s... that\u0027s just shy of Mach 6!

A TWR of 1 gets you a vertical launch, which is a rocket with wings, more like the Shuttle, but it\u0027s going to cost you. You don\u0027t need that much.

As best I can tell, here\u0027s the parts you\u0027ve got: 3 Mk2 Bicouplers, 2 Advanced Canards, 6 Shock Intakes, an Inline Cockpit, a Mk2 LF\u002BO Tank, a Mk2-Mk1 Adapter, 4 24-77 engines, 3 Turbojets, 2 Delta Wings, 2 Elevon 2s, a Tail Fin for a vertical stabilizer in the back, 3 Small Gear Bays and 2 Reaction Stabilizers. That sound about right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming the fuel tanks are all full and my part analysis is right, your plane\u0027s mass is just over 18.5 tonnes - it carries 810 units of Liquid Fuel and 990 units of Oxidizer, and has a total lift rating of 5.9.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGeneral rule - you want 1 lift rating for every tonne of aircraft (the actual ratio is 1.15 lift rating per tonne, but the 1:1 relationship is easier to manage and remember). Based on that, you\u0027ve got about a third of the amount of lift you want for a plane of that mass. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I\u0027ve got that backwards - it\u0027s 1.15 tonnes per lift rating, or roughly 2.3 tonnes per Delta Wing (lift rating = 2).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother general rule - for Turbojets, you want one per 15 tonnes of aircraft. Since you\u0027ve got only 18.5 tonnes, two turbojets should be sufficient to do the job. If you\u0027re worried about asymmetric flameouts, add rudders - I had a two-engine design with four rudders that did an asymmetric flameout and remained controllable - it even maintained its heading. I still throttled back to get the other engine working again, but I didn\u0027t have to correct a flat spin as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow\u0027s the handling on the design? I\u0027m not seeing a large number of control surfaces there, though from what I\u0027m seeing you should have reasonable pitch and roll authority. Yaw authority, not so much...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPretty sure you\u0027ve got an overkill on fuel, Oxidizer in particular. Unless you\u0027re going to the Mun with the design, you probably need about 530-540 units of Oxidizer tops, and that\u0027s probably an over-estimate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, you\u0027re making space.
