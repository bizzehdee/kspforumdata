Also where I put a second set of boosters are also awkward but not sure how to feel about it apart from it being structurally unsafe (Thanks KSP Joint Reinforcement Mod). Something awfully pleasing however is that the LSEs combined with the weight of the rocket create a nice suspension strain when it spawns in which is weirdly pleasing. Anyways as I\u0027ve not yet tested this (Around 6000 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E min 1.18 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E all rising) I\u0027m gonna get to that, thought I\u0027d just send a progress update of where I\u0027m currently at since I came back to KSP. Enjoy those LSEs I\u0027m sure someone out there understands my pain and pleasure about them.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022jCWlAkX.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022154.80\u0022 height=\u0022952\u0022 width=\u0022615\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/jCWlAkX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
