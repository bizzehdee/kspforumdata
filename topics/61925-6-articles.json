That is the current state of all the working engines and tanks (-exhausts. You can see I started with the first one, but it\u0027s got two nozzles, so it didn\u0027t really work. Also, as I said, the placement needs to be a bit more precise). I don\u0027t know if I bothered with fixing the quads because they were so difficult to even get working. Like, in the VAB, they might sometimes have 3 or 4 effects, but on the launchpad, you only get two, and they\u0027re in different places than the VAB effects (you\u0027ll notice it\u0027s the same on the 1m twin nozzle - in the VAB, the exhaust looks \u003Cem\u003Eok\u003C/em\u003E, but on the launchpad, it\u0027s reversed and off to one side).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll I really need from you is a way to make more than two effects in 0.3.. I can do placement and everything myself, but it gets frustrating when when what I see in the VAB isn\u0027t necessarily what\u0027ll be seen on the launchpad. If the ARM engines/tanks want to play nicely, I\u0027ll sort them out now (well, apart from the engine cluster). Also, I found a conflict too: whenever something gets highlighted by the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/50143-0-23-5-Editor-Part-Highlighter\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EEditor Part Highlighter\u003C/a\u003E, the effects no longer work in the VAB, nor on the pad.

The thing is, the game somehow doesn\u0060t recognize effects that are numbered higher than 2. I tried to add the effects to the cluster engine, and it would only show me the 2 effects that have their name end in 1 and 2. So I tried around a bit with the naming, and the only thing that ever loads are the effects named \u0022PreLaunchEffectEngine1\u0022 and \u0022PreLaunchEffectEngine2\u0022. So I tried using those twice each.
