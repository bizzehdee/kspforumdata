This time around, Duna I was a more sophisticated mission. A combination orbital lab and lander was launcghed with the return supplies on board, while a 7-man shuttle launched at the same time witht he other half of the supplies. The orbital lab, named \u0027Dunalab I\u0027 achieved a stable near-equatorial orbit before Duna I rendezvoused and docked. The lander made planetfall and returned, and the seven crew (two pilots, one engineer and four scientists) processed the data while they waited for a return window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere were three mission critical failures in Duna I:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- None of the ships possessed an antenna capable of transmitting the data back to Kerbin,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The fuel pipes on the lander failed en route, causing the crew to have to manually pump fuel between tanks on ascent, and\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The decoupler for the reentry module was jammed by poor strut placement, nearly causing the deaths of seven Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the only surviving photo of Dunalab I from during the mission.

Duna I was not a wash (the original data still brought back several thousand science points) but the costs of sending Dunalab I was non-trivial. Hence, Duna II was planned. It had two goals: rendezvous with Dunalab I and send back the research data, then continue to research stored data that had been abandoned by the Duna I astronauts when the return window came up. Duna II would be a smaller mission, only three Kerbonauts, and no fuel would be brought for the lander, so no planetfall would be made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the planning stages of Duna II, a massive contract was awarded to the Agency for the consctrution of an orbital base around the red planet. Therefore, Duna II\u0027s mission parameters were altered. As Duna Station would be launched in the same transfer window, The small crew of Duna II would be charged with towing Dunalab I to dock with the much larger, permanent orbital station, and performing caretaker maintenance and systems tests of the new station. Priorities shifted to the construction, 200,000km above Kerbin\u0027s surface, of Duna Station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst the spine of the station was launched - a custom built structural pillar with four hubs placed along its legnth, with a pre-installed but disposable nuclear engine for trans-Duna injection, orbital insertion and manouvre. Then, in four separate launches by reusable tug, the fuel for the nuclear engine was docked with the spine. Then, two kerbitats and two aeroponics odules were launched to fulfil the contact\u0027s life support goals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the first aeroponics module, having left atmosphere, jettisoning its protective nosecone before orbital insertion burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/395547605758846795/8146E44064BC07200393EDF99582F6FEE446FC56/\u0022 alt=\u00228146E44064BC07200393EDF99582F6FEE446FC56\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere it is approaching the Station.
