So lets create it ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nAs you can see in your ingame callendar there is a date indicator of how old your space program is.\n\nThat makes me thinking a bit.\n\nI do really like this concept of using 1960\u0027s technology mostly.\n\nBut what if NASA still launching 60\u0027s rockets only in 2015? \n\nSo why not make our belowed tech tree a twist of adding time related additions to it?\n\nI mean if you looking \u0022old\u0022 scifies most of their ideas soon be real things.\n\nLike Ion drives, holographic screens, and so much more. (the Maglev train was a scifi too now it is reality)\n\nSo if you managed to make your carrier streching trough decades you should research more \u0022futuristic\u0022 things.\n\nIn this way a deflector (engine / (heat)shield) can be incorporated in the core game as well as offworld mining and building and factoring equipments.\n\nIs this can be make available to us players inside KSP ? Mods do adds new categories to the techtree. So it must be managed somehow to make scifi time relatedly available. \n\nI don\u0027t mind a 10000 science worth techtree-node when I just get bored out of my 50 year old space programs possibilities. So there should be again a challenge.\n\nIt would add a plus layer of the game experience: \u0022How to step out of the 60\u0027s? after 50 year of R\u0026D\u0022 ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nAnother requirements should be not time related but achivements related tech tree unlocking. I mean if you landed on a cellestial body, made it a super high detailed map, depleted all the soil analysis/temperature, mistery goo experiments and got all the science it can offer made a perfect satelite coverage even crashed some bases with extensive and self sustainable life support, etc,etc. And if it has something usefull maybe a place from launch rockets or build a factory or a mining operation base. Why not research something how to use these features? \n\nAlso improved/\u0022newly available\u0022 contracts should be created for them.\n\nJust thinking again on the fly ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nOffKerbin resources which was unknown before all these science analisys should add us a possibility to utilize them.\n\nMaybe for upgrades materials on already used parts, maybe for conversion of more versatile fuels, even for new brand of engines.\n\nMaybe just like reallife diamonds... they should worth a whole lot of a fortune money if hauled back to kerbin.\n\nDon\u0027t forget the contracts possibilities... \n\nDiversification, abundancy/raerity should make planets/asteroids much more use and distinction.\n\nJust think about it please.\n\nI am aware of some of the suggested features in this post is inside the \u0022DO NOT SUGGEST\u0022 it thread, but still I think these features should be in the CORE/STOCK game. I can\u0027t think of another way around. Nasa would mine and utilize new materials if found on another planet, even create offworld launch bases as well as orbital stations for factoring and launching vehicles if they can, and do have the technology for it. And they willing/comitted to do the R\u0026D necessary already. Why shouldn\u0027t Kerbals? \n\nAnd with a content/or at least elapsed-time aware tech tree possibilities this would blend seamlesly into the stock feel of the game.\n\nAnyway keep up the great work. It is a very neat game already.\n\nchears\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-23T12:08:15Z\u0022 title=\u002202/23/2015 12:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ricardo79**"}]}
