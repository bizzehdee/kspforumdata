At first it just starts slowly rotating... then undulating. All of which are fascinating until you realize the scale of the thing! Unclamping the various service craft I used to assemble it calmed the beast but returning to it from the tracking station or, god forbid, time-warping lead invariably to a cascading resonance that in mere moments leads horrifying events of catastrophic proportions! Key features of the event typically involve rapid bending, stretching, breaking, violent explosions, and three enormous rocks cast randomly into new orbits (one hopes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI nearly gave up trying this because of how hard it was to maneuver the third asteroid into position. The final linkage to create the loop is achieved by unlocking a joint and applying thrust.

The ship in the lower left is one of the refuelable asteroid tugs used to capture, circularize, and bring the inclination to 0 degrees. Barely visible in the top right is a fourth claw strut I brought as a spare and for symmetry on the lifting craft.
