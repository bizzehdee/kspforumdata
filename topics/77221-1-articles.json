Add a rocket fuel tank into a Mk.3 unit with 240 less liqulid fuel, and both the problem of COM and oxidizer solved. you also got more fuel in it. For the case of \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003E dumb \u003C/span\u003E weird attachment points, use the BZ-52 Radial Attachment Point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut note that these are botch solutions. 2 options for the fuelsage should be added: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eone is for carrying fuel, or LFO, or nothing ( structural fuelsage), \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eone for its type: Lots of fuel, or courrent fuel ammout(with a lot better fuel-mass ratio), and \u003Cstrong\u003EMOST IMPORTANTLY\u003C/strong\u003E a cargo-bay. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E For making optimal desgins, there should be another Mk.3 fuelsage with the half of the courrent one\u0027s lenght, and this Mk.3 Fuelsage Short should have the mentioned options. The low COM gives more stability for planes, and comes quite handy with shuttles. Adjusting the COT to it would be a bit hard, so still use attachment points for that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
