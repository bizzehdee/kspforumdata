Don\u0027t put fins in the middle of your rocket. The fins need to be at the back of the rocket to keep it stable. Remember, rockets are not airplanes, they have a thrust to weight ratio well over 1.1, often exceeding 4.0. This means that they need no wings, just tail control surfaces. The purpose of the tail control surfaces is to swing the vehicle back so the nose points towards the trajectory. It does this because the center of lift is BEHIND the center of gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anton P.

If you got out of atmosphere in time you\u0027d have no problem, but it looks like you\u0027re still in atmosphere when the design goes back to being top-heavy and then your rocket tries to fly like a plane... a plane without wings, that is. Adding reaction wheels above the CoM mitigates this but make the top-heaviness worse... so that\u0027s why you\u0027re seeing limited results. Add in that reaction wheels aren\u0027t as powerful as the old \u0022shake-rattle-n-roll\u0022 SAS and I think that\u0027s why your design doesn\u0027t work in 0.21.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemoving the upper fins would help move the CoL back behind the CoM, increasing the rocket\u0027s stability.
