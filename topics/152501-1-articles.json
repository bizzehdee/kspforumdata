The first thing I would use it is probably a flying bomb.\u0022\u00A0But then I thought \u0022Aren\u0027t spacecraft actually controlled from platforms like the ISS on their docking approach?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo how it would look: you have vessel/aircraft/station and detach something from it. Now you can control that thing even though you are still focused on your \u0022mothership\u0022.\u00A0You would have a navball for each vessel and use the numpad to control it, or something. They would have their pro/retro/normal/antinormal, etc. autopilot marker thingies, of course. A little bit more automation for these things. You would put the antennae on the things you want to control and pick their channel (1,2,3...). That way even a few things could be remotely controlled at once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould that be any useful? I\u0027m thinking maybe things like the MAKS shuttle or Pegasus-like spaceships could be controlled easier that way?
