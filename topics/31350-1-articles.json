So our engineering officer kindof sortof figured out in a round about way that they were trying to get to some southern place on the Mun. After heading out and searching about for about 6 hours, a faint hum was detected in some hole and was investigated. Not much was learned but when Newlin Kerman touched it (agaist the others recommending him not do that), he started talking in some weird language and yabbering about \u0022the answer to life, the universe, and everything.\u0022 Like anyone would be interested in that sort of stuff?!?... We asked him about some important stuff like what the optimum temparature for baking muffins would be, but he had no useful answers. Like I said in my report.
