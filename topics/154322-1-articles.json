Tried to make a screenshot again, same happened, but also damaging the steam launcher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUbuntu version is 16.04 (64bit), not much stuff installed so far. Steam (with 4 games), Wine with 2 games, some browsers, and some smaller apps like Kazam, QMMP, but those should have nothing to do with this, especially that they were not running. The PC is an Acer Aspire v3-772g, with memory expanded to 16Gigs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRe-rooting solved the basic problem, I can now fit the subassy to the tank correctly (big shoutout to Harry, thanks mate), but if you\u00B4re hunting bugs and I can help you with further information please let me know!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"faceeasyg","CreatedById":173141,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-02T09:21:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222907479\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022154322\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221483311359\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022119953\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Harry Rhodan\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, Harry Rhodan said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou see the icons in the uper left of your screenshot?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Assemblymodes_icons.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/0/0b/Assemblymodes_icons.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe one on the right is the re-root tool.
