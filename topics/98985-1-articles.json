While the game is still very playable, it definitely doesn\u0027t get the FPS the windows version does on my system. Not sure what I can do about that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut anyway on to my question:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I run KSP using the x86_64 I don\u0027t see anything in the lower right on the start up screen to indicate that I am actually running the 64 bit version. It looks Identical to the default I get when I run from steam. Is this correct or am I getting derped somwhere?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerBlam","CreatedById":134309,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-07T08:46:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106292-Running-64Bit-in-Steam-with-Linux-Solution\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106292-Running-64Bit-in-Steam-with-Linux-Solution\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso check that you\u0027re using the proprietary drivers for your GPU..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-07T08:52:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELeszek, it\u0027s correct, if you start the x32_64 binary you\u0027ll be using the 64 bit version, but there\u0027s nothing in the game to tell you this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big change is in how much RAM you can use with it, it\u0027ll easily go over 4gigs and that\u0027s why it\u0027s popular with people using a lot of addons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeed varies a great deal but making sure your graphics driver is up to date definitely helps \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SPA","CreatedById":136486,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-07T14:47:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ego to the launcher, and go to the settings icon, and disable the log.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Leszek","CreatedById":119053,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-08T01:07:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk good to know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the drivers, I am using the ones that openSUSE used during OS install. Yesterday, I installed the AMD ones and it destroyed my linux, made steam complain, and KSP wouldn\u0027t work. It took half a dozen re-installs of the OS to get it working again because well I don\u0027t know exactly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong story short, I have dual AMD 5770\u0027s and I am not sure I want to touch the video card drivers again.

For AMD cards on Linux, the proprietary drivers underperform compared to Windows and don\u0027t have a great reputation for stability, while the Free Software drivers perform a little worse still, but are nonetheless enough to handle less demanding games and are much more stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could try a different distribution. The latest version of Xubuntu would be a good bet. Steam recommend *buntu; the X variant has a more traditional interface and uses less RAM than regular Ubuntu. Try the Free Software driver, it might well manage KSP alright especially if Xubuntu has a newer version than OpenSUSE did. If you want to use the proprietary driver, install it using the Ubuntu Software Centre or similar, rather than downloading it from AMD\u0027s website.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
