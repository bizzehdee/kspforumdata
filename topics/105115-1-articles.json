The movement system is sluggish in a way that restricts movement, and the weapons are lot less controllable while more stable. I play BF to play BF, those advances are kinda pointless when there is CoD to go to otherwise. BF3 was imo the perfect balance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-27T05:59:19Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2015 05:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Temeter\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Corw","CreatedById":7116,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T06:01:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022gmiddlemass\u0022 data-cite=\u0022gmiddlemass\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ll wait till i actually play V1.0 myself before passing judgement...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis.

I see nothing in this release to make it fundamentally different than any previous. Sure, there may be more features than average, but that makes it bigger rather than different. Since there is no real difference in the process, I expect no more than I did from previous releases. The longstanding bugs will remain (ie the ones we are so used to we don\u0027t notice anymore). Some recent bugs will have been squashed, but there will also be new ones. There will be no \u0027balanced\u0027 gameplay, nor will the aero physics deserve to be called aerodynamics. It\u0027s just another features update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom watching the view numbers on Youtube and other social media, I don\u0027t think I am alone in this opinion.
