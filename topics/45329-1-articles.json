I\u0027m working my way through part creation, so this thread will serve as a place where I post any progress. I\u0027m very new to modelling/texturing, so any comments/criticism is welcomed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use a wide variety of mods, but I feel that the unmanned side could be expanded upon - so my first project is creating satellite parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst up is a few parts I\u0027ve created over the past few days. From top to bottom we have a fairly useless GPS sensor array that I saw whilst browsing the internet and decided my GPS satellites had to have one. In the middle is a hexagonal drone core. It\u0027s purposefully fairly large and is designed to be used for large RemoteTech satellites/Kethane scanners. The larger size allows for a stronger reaction wheel system and a considerable internal battery. The bottom component is an expanded battery, for probes/satellites that require a large power draw during dark periods of orbit and lots of RTGs is undesirable for whatever reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/d6gtlbAl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022d6gtlbAl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rDeh5J1l.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rDeh5J1l.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScaling and texturing isn\u0027t final yet, but this initial set of components is scaled at 2.5m.

I can\u0027t take all the credit for the normals, I chopped up some pre-made ones I found on the internet. I can bake normal maps in Blender, but I have absolutely no idea how to make some thing like that. I\u0027ve seen there are plugins available for GIMP to \u0027create\u0027 normal maps from images, but I\u0027m having enough issues adjusting from PS to GIMP, let alone getting any 3rd party plugins to work (and me actually understand them!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DarthVader\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DarthVader\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Edo you have any parts for release?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally would say \u0027no\u0027 as I don\u0027t think the parts on here are really ready, however if you want to play around with the HexProbe core/battery/GPS sensor/RCS etc I\u0027m happy to email/Dropbox you the parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll edit this post with an update on the SAR array later. I\u0027m close to finishing the texturing. If all goes smoothly (does it ever?) and I can export the part from Unity properly - I\u0027ve read that there\u0027s no special export needed for parts with animation as long as the animation itself is imported correctly, which I think I\u0027ve done - then I\u0027ll just need to write a .cfg and it\u0027ll be done. It\u0027s currently at 1800 tris, and 2 1024^2 textures. I may reduce that to 512^2. I suppose I should have a look at .cfgs for animations and any modules that SCANsat uses!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMini-update: Well, the textures are about as good as I\u0027ll ever get them. I\u0027m not entirely happy, but I think that\u0027s more a problem fundamentally with the design than anything else - I have more ideas for radars/scanners/dishes, so hopefully I can apply what I\u0027ve learnt making this one to the next. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe base joint\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2jBRlMU.png\u0022 alt=\u00222jBRlMU.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe arms\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iLUCFNi.png\u0022 alt=\u0022iLUCFNi.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe transducer arrays - I\u0027ve added a small amount of blue into the specular reflections. I kind of like it, and with what I\u0027ve learnt making the normals for the transducers and the specularity of this I think I can apply to PV panels as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xohr7hq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xohr7hq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main mounting \u0027body\u0027 is plain white with some edge darkening and a specularity that makes it looks quite like some sort of polycarbonate.
