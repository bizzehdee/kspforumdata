The first time it was because I had not removed unused textures and materials in blender before importing to unity. This time it really is creating materials out of nothing when importing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI checked the outliner in blender and in the picture below you can see that there are NO materials or textures in the entire file. Somehow while importing into unity it creates a bunch of random materials and assigns textures to them. I tried appending just the suspect objects into a new blender file and importing and the same problem occurs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DpazNX7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022DpazNX7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1DXQOny.png\u0022 alt=\u00221DXQOny.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-19T02:00:26Z\u0022 title=\u002210/19/2014 02:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by raidernick\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
