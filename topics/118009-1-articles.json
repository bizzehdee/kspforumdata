Their job was to anticipate all possible scenarios for such a conflict. Arkhipov\u0027s case was different, as there was no chain of command for him to report to. His decision would\u0027ve been final, and I doubt US forces would have hesitated to respond once a carrier group went up in a ball of fire."},{"CreatedByName":"kmMango","CreatedById":109375,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T19:45:46Z","Content":"What says Nobel Peace Prize more than actively stopping a potential global war?"},{"CreatedByName":"ColKlonk","CreatedById":137078,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T09:47:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What says Nobel Peace Prize more than actively stopping a potential global war?\n\nNot starting wars ??"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T11:36:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Not starting wars ??\n\nYou would think so, but after all those years of not starting wars I still have not received one Nobel prize ![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"ColKlonk","CreatedById":137078,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T18:21:04Z","Content":"I know .. life is just not fair... ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nbut...
