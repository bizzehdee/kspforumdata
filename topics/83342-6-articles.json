I don\u0027t use Kerbal Konstructs so I don\u0027t know anything about compatibility between them other than that one comment I linked from July. And, as I\u0027ve previously mentioned in this thread about this topic, it\u0027s on my TODO list but toward the very end. You will definitely have to turn off Reconditioning and there\u0027s a chance that using KCT\u0027s Launch button from storages will only place you on the normal launchpad. But I have no idea and I have much more pressing concerns at the moment than trying to add Kerbal Konstruct support. Right now I\u0027d like to just have a working version of KCT in dev since it\u0027s currently completely non-functional.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spacepetscompany","CreatedById":119734,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-21T03:03:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIts not so much a bug, as an annoyance. It forces one to have to switch between the VAB and the Space Center Scene. Lets say you want to build a craft: First you construct your vehicle, then (Using KCT) you press the build button, then, you exit the VAB, timewarp to craft completion/Do other things. When the craft is complete, you go into the VAB, choose your launch site (using Kerbal Konstructs), exit the VAB, and THEN, launch. It\u0027s quite an annoying process really.
