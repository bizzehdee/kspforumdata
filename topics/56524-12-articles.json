This should really be fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGeneral question: Is the dv needed to ascend from Laythe @ zero altitude correct at 2800m? I am finding I need more than that @ about 1Km. It seems more like Tylo amounts of dv are needed to me ~3100 @ 1Km altitude.

It would make sense that your first rockets would be the very very weak kind, but that you should have a \u0022camera\u0022 science part and a \u0022radar mapping\u0022 part. You have to radar-survey and photograph the planetary body from an appropriate altitude to unlock the biomes. The biomes could be a separate tech-tree kind of thing...so having so much data about each biome captured by radar mapping and photography would unlock it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarly on you don\u0027t have electrical storage or radio antennae so you have to return the spacecraft to Kerbin and recover it. (similar to early space exploration where remote sensing was essentially a film camera in a pressurized box with a mechanism to flick the shutter) Later you can send the data back (so... exploring the Mun and Minmus and Kerbin are easy in early game...and then other bodies become more feasible).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest reason I came up with this idea was...not really knowing what the biomes were...how in the heck you identify them...without going outside the game to the wiki. (a big no-no IMHO) This gives a tech/science based path to \u0022learn\u0022 about them and a reason to develop small probes instead of just making a kerbin-sized lander straight out of the gate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aknar","CreatedById":68073,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T16:47:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou are absolutely right, isa maps and ScanMaps are nice, but they are still insufficient since they don\u0027t show biomes, only anomalies (easter eggs). Majiir, Kethane Mod creator, is working on a new mod using his hexagon grid system to give that info. This will allow you to plan your trips according to what you haven\u0027t discovered yet.
