I had the same occuring to me after assigning joystick controls. If your are using the windows version, please do the following as a temporary workaround:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Delete the settings.cfg from your KSP directory\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Open KSP and set all the options to your liking\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Exit KSP\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Make a copy of your new settings.cfg and copy it into the folder Launcher_Data\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Backup the file settings.cfg.bak in the Launcher_Data folder and rename the new settings.cfg (which should be in the Launcher_data folder) to settings.cfg.bak\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis should solve the problem. It is likely that deleting the settings.cfg from the KSP is the sole solution, but I haven\u0027t tested that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
