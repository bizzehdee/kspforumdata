I posted a thread saying this earlier today but incorrectly thought it was fixed (I relaunched KSP and settings had been saved) but it appears to have happened again.\n\nI\u0027m using the steam version of KSP and think it might have something to do with assigning axis inputs with a joystick (this reddit post suggests the same thing: [http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/342w0j/10_bug_settings_reverting_each_time_the_game_loads/cqrbhga](http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/342w0j/10_bug_settings_reverting_each_time_the_game_loads/cqrbhga) )."},{"CreatedByName":"Andy81le","CreatedById":95393,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T19:28:48Z","Content":"This has been reported elsewhere and afaik is a known bug. I had the same occuring to me after assigning joystick controls. If your are using the windows version, please do the following as a temporary workaround:\n\n1. Delete the settings.cfg from your KSP directory\n\n2. Open KSP and set all the options to your liking\n\n3. Exit KSP\n\n4. Make a copy of your new settings.cfg and copy it into the folder Launcher\\_Data\n\n5. Backup the file settings.cfg.bak in the Launcher\\_Data folder and rename the new settings.cfg (which should be in the Launcher\\_data folder) to settings.cfg.bak\n\nThis should solve the problem. It is likely that deleting the settings.cfg from the KSP is the sole solution, but I haven\u0027t tested that."}]}
