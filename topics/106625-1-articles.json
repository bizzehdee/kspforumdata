I notice that the percentage taken off for R\u0026amp;D is much higher than stated. I first noticed this when I put 50% of my income for science. When I completed missions, I learned that it was actually taking all my money. With a bit of experimenting, I found that 25% took around 33% of my money and 10% used around 15% of my money. I then tried to trade reputation for science and found that if I trade 50% of my reputation for science that I actually loose more reputation that I would have gained from the mission. (around 120% total loss) I stopped experimenting after that. Am I missing something or is this an actual bug? Thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
