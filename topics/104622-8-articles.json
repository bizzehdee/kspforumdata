I went away for a bit the found mention of Nyrath\u0027s \u0027Orion\u0027 mod and came back in hurry.

Release Day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack in 2011, I wondered if Squad would make it. I started playing with version .7. I posted a lengthy diatribe on their development maturity (or lack thereof) back then, and a long list of milestones that they would need to achieve to make it. Unfortunately it was eaten by the great April Forum crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am happy to note that all of my \u0022predictions\u0022 came true. Squad really buckled down and became a serious gaming development team, comprising development, staging, QA, play testing, bug tracking, Project management, marketing, social media, kerbalcon, and so many other major activities that were needed to get to this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had faith in you then, and plunked my money down a soon as I could after you started taking \u0022donations\u0022 as they were called back then (I paid 10 bucks). I remember flying to the sun when there was no sun. I remember trying to figure out how in the H** do I get back to kerbin???\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI remember \u0022begging\u0022 for docking back around .15. I remember so many days of patiently listening to all the moaners about an alpha game that had much more polish than most alpha games. I remember the day you hit 25,000 forum members... I remember...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, thanks for creating such a fantastic gaming environment. I will enjoy this game long into the future. Thanks to the community that was patient with me as I started modding and thanks to those that use my meager offerings and push me to make it better. Thanks to the amazing modders that have made KSP something special since the beginning, and that have helped me to \u0022learn the ropes\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, thanks harvester and team for \u0022seeing it through\u0022 when it seemed like the pressure could break you all.
