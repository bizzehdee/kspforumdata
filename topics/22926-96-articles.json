Even though I very carefully balance the thrust (four engines mounted radially at the corners so it takes off like the cancelled NASA constellation lander) I can\u0027t get it to fly without going nose down. It\u0027s like the catfish has a higher mass than what shows up on the mass center. Looks like Felbourn had the same problem during his project odyssey testing of this part. It happens even while taking off so I don\u0027t think it\u0027s an aero effect. The best I can do is put the rear engine thrust limit at 74.5% and then it takes off ok but as soon as I start moving it around it will nose over. I have the two sets of engines mounted to a fuel tank each and TAC balancing enabled so I think I\u0027ve ruled out shifting fuel too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AntiMatter001","CreatedById":100129,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-12T19:22:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei keep hearing \u0022LLL trucks are out\u0022 but i don\u0027t see a DL can Lack or Mr.wizard uhm help me out here? i think i must be blind x.x\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mach_XXII","CreatedById":94457,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-12T20:00:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AntiMatter001\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AntiMatter001\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ei keep hearing \u0022LLL trucks are out\u0022 but i don\u0027t see a DL can Lack or Mr.wizard uhm help me out here? i think i must be blind x.x\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/...-17testing.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/...-17testing.zip\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AntiMatter001","CreatedById":100129,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-12T20:11:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mach_XXII\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mach_XXII\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/...-17testing.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/...-17testing.zip\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethank you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Speeding Mullet","CreatedById":62635,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-13T10:29:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m doing a mission report called the Sunrise Manifest which is going to be making extensive use of LLL parts, so I thought I\u0027d share this teaser here. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s called the Sunrise Corvette.
