Now we\u0027re about to essentially take two planned updates and merge most of this content into one mega update, 0.24. It\u0027s big, folks. Really big. Ever since we launched Career Mode, this has been a major update in the making, and it deserves a name. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got a few ideas - if you fill out the survey, which asks for some general demographic information that helps us learn more about our players, you\u0027ll see them listed. You\u0027ll also see a blank line with a chance to name it for us. I\u0027ll be honest, this isn\u0027t a contest where the name with the most votes wins - but we\u0027ll obviously take that into strong consideration. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo go here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://goo.gl/wuONr5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://goo.gl/wuONr5\u003C/a\u003E and let us know what you think.
