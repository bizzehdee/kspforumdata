Also as for you\u0027re reentry attempt, I am too interested in what your AP/PE was. But just a general rule I have found helpful is that 30-50km is your target PE but this depends on your AP, so 30 if your AP is lower, 50 if its in the higher range.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pirx","CreatedById":149331,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T07:14:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood Morning Champ, Glaran K\u0027erman:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks a lot for your replies, I finally managed to make succesul landings and reentries into kerbin (yesterday I managed 3 succesful missions without any new cassualties YAY!) and with the science I won I\u0027ve been able to substantially improve my rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn relation to the question I opneed my post with I must say that as you told me, I was able to perform the experiments again with no science reduction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding the reentry I think that I was coming in in a really acute angle, the heat shield overheated and exploded, as per the missions I performed yesterday I tried to reenter really shallow thus staying in the atmosphere more time but having less friction and also aerobreaking more (the heat shield life when I finally touched earth was 175/190 more or less)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have other question (this time regarding ressurrected kerbonauts) but ill open another thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks a lot for the help and the welcome \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Glaran K\u0026#039;erman","CreatedById":146334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T18:24:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGlad to be of assistance!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
