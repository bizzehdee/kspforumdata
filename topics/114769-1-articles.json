Definitely much harder than building a rocket. It took me weeks to figure out how to design this ship to do what I wanted it to do. It\u0027s main objective was to be able to get into a 100km orbit and dock with my fueling station. It can also survive re-entry to Kerbin and land (chutes are for an emergency).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1281.photobucket.com/albums/a513/jbakes727/X-14%20Complete_zpsjjqeiltl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022X-14%20Complete_zpsjjqeiltl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not the best looking but it does the job.

I actually just changed the design to something a little more appealing. It functions pretty much the same but it can re-enter Kerbin atmosphere much better.
