First of all, I\u0027m very stoked about this whole feature. The constraint of having so few parts at the beginning has turned reaching orbit from a routine task to an interesting challenge again. I was thrilled when Jeb logged his first crew report during a sub-orbital flight, and I have not felt so proud to land on the Mun since that first crash landing several versions ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E That said, there are a few things that just don\u0027t feel right. HarvesteR has posted before about how he wanted to implement science and career mode in general without imposing a certain style of gameplay on people, and while that sentiment is obvious in this first iteration of R\u0026amp;D, I find it still promotes a particular kind of mission. Because of the way specimen containers work and the fact that most experiments can only be done on planetary surfaces, there is a bias towards missions that land on other bodies, do some experiments, and return to Kerbin. That might seem to be the obvious way to go about exploring the universe, but it leaves out some styles of gameplay that are not only realistic in terms of real exploration, but also just fun to do in the game. For instance, I always like to set up large bases on other planets with infrastructure to allow for crew rotation and such. But there doesn\u0027t seem to be any incentive to stay on a planet for longer than a minute. Just do a few experiments and then head on home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E There\u0027s also still no reason for permanent satellites around any body. I know that HarvesteR has talked about setting up some kind of communications relay system, and i think that there will probably be some kind of space-base telescope parts someday. Currently though, there is a serious lack of science to be done in orbit. Most of the experiments don\u0027t even work in space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I was also hoping there would be more for the kerbals to do. What I really wanted to see was a lab module, rather like the hitchhiker can. Something that made it worth it for kerbals to be there on the spot rather than just get the data back with the spacecraft. Perhaps, rather than imposing a penalty for transmitting results (other than the actual samples), you can instead get a bonus if there are kerbals present in a lab module. I must say though, I do like that crew/EVA reports and surface samples give you incentive to send crewed missions rather than just probes. I just wish they were there doing actual science instead of just talking about what they see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E As for the new parts, I\u0027m not sure what they\u0027re supposed to be exactly. I can\u0027t think of any real equivalent to the Mystery Goo in the specimen containers. I don\u0027t think we do science by simply exposing some material to various conditions. The Materials Bay seems to be just a more sophisticated version of Mystery Goo. The closest thing to the Materials Bay I can think of is the experiments the Viking landers brought to Mars. But they were testing regolith from Mars, not some mystery substance brought from Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I love the biomes system. Its great that there is a reason to go back to the Mun and find different landing spots. I just hope that they release biome maps for other planets in mini patches instead of waiting for the full .23 update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E To sum up my comments:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-More reasons to stay on planet and do experiments over time\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-More experiments to do in space\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Lab modules for kerbals to do science in\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Model science parts after real experiments instead of mystery science boxes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Give me more biomes!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this post doesn\u0027t sound too critical, because I\u0027m loving this update. I\u0027m aware that this is just the first iteration of science, I just thought I\u0027d give my feedback for future tweaks and such. And of course, I would love to see what others think.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"paleorob","CreatedById":60059,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T21:48:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Matt56\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Matt56\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E-Model science parts after real experiments instead of mystery science boxes.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is quoted for TRUTH right here.
