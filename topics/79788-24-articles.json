The refresh leaves \u0022ghost\u0022 contracts sometimes, so it may appear as if there are more than two, but there are not. If you see more than two, and can go to the VAB and back, and there are still more than two, that\u0027s an issue.

If you match the target plane by burning at the marked ascending and descending nodes, that will be enough to put you at the correct LAN. (It can be hard to see how close you are to the nodes since the markers appear on the target orbit and not yours. A trick that I\u0027ve found is to focus the map-view camera on the planet, rotate your view so the points of both node markers line up, then stick a maneuver node on your orbit where it crosses the markers.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you would rather use MechJeb to set your LAN, converting from FinePrint\u0027s decimal degrees to MechJeb\u0027s degrees-minutes-seconds is pretty easy. Multiply the fractional part of the degrees by 60 to get minutes, then multiply the fractional part of the minutes by 60 to get seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd you\u0027re right: a LAN of 353 degrees east is equal to 7 degrees west. Since the planet is rotating and the orbit isn\u0027t, LAN is measured from a particular direction relative to the background stars. On Earth, the zero is the vernal equinox: one of the points where the plane of the ecliptic and Earth\u0027s equator intersect. In KSP, where Kerbin\u0027s equator is exactly in line with its orbital plane, that type of reference doesn\u0027t work, so there\u0027s no clear visual reference for the zero. It may just be the direction Kerbin\u0027s prime meridian is pointing at the epoch.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-20T15:03:35Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2014 03:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by undercoveryankee\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dingbat1967","CreatedById":75953,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-20T15:33:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo things (Maybe it was because I was running an older version of \u0022Fine Print\u0022) ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Plant flag missions seem to dissapear.
