This will cause the stars to drift off, along with their systems. While this may seem small, already Hyper-lanes are collapsing. The galaxy\u0027s center is also showing powerful fluctuations. The energy from the incident is building up, along with other black holes. this could explode by post 200. We should evacuate now just to be safe. All planets should be abandoned, along with tech. A galaxy nearly identical to ours has been found within a 2 post traveling distance. We should begin now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat transmission came from research post Epsilon. I personally think we should comply. Apparently, once we get used to it, it\u0027ll be exactly the same as the Milky Way. In fact, we\u0027re naming it the Milkier Wave. I think we should rendezvous at TRANSMITTING COORDINATES immediately. That will be a good place to start, as there are many habitable systems. Also, Vinster, NO MINING TOO MUCH! I have already loaded my entire fleet for the journey.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUhhhh...xarrani is going to be none too pleased with this...i do not think he/she is going to be too pleased about leaving\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
