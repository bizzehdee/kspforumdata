One of the contracts is to fly to different anomalies drive around in a rover and then fly back (hopefully) to recoup the cost of the craft. So I\u0027m no good at doing planes let alone buggy planes so I take the design of one of my ssto\u0027s designs from my old sandbox and rebuild it from scratch as just a air breather. This is it in the VAB:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lkd8hha.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lkd8hha.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we launch, get to about 15,000 ft and get a good speed going - occasionally I would need to adjust its course so taking sas off and taping the pitch or yaw could send it in to a flat spin - very hair trigger at that speed! When that happens I would cut the engines, wait until the spinning slows down, get it pointed back in its right direction, sas on and throttle up the engines while jeb and bill clean themselves up. We get going again no problem. Get about quarter of the way around kerbin, land near the anomaly and undock the rover and complete the mission. We redock back up and launch back to KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout 10 minutes in to the flight we are cruising height and everything is doing well - air intake is about 50% full and all if a-ok but then out of no where the craft pitches down and spins. I havent touched a button and the sas can\u0027t cope so I cut the power wait till it stop spinning point the craft in the right direction and spool up the engines again. Almost immediately the craft nose dives again and spins out of control. At this point I notice that the bottom engine closest to the ground is a darker orange than the rest and when I cut the engines its the first to go black before the others join it. I F9 (as I save a lot) and disable the \u0027faulty\u0027 engine and its twin and launch on just the two engines. Get no problems until I\u0027m half way home and the craft spins to the left - one of the other two engines are having the same fault now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI check fuel and intakes (which at the time was at 99% full as they have half the amount of engines to supply) and all are okay. I had quicksaved mid flight so I f9 back to that point and decide its best to ditch the craft in to the ocean and get the navy to pick them up at a cost - a percentage is better than nothing. So I cut both of the remaining engines. Point the craft skyward and watch as my horizontal velocity decreases and my vertical increase - I then start spooling up the drives to slow the decent down and halfway in the craft spins again - same engine is slowing down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy is it doing this and how can I save my poor boys??\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etl;dr - the same single jet engine keeps slowing down while the others are operating normally - air intakes and fuel not to blame.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emods:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eoblivion cloud pack and city lights stuff with EVE of course\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efineprint\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egoodspeed fuel pump (this was set to move the fuel from inside tanks to the nacelles - checked the fuel balance too and ruled it out)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAS (no kas objects on the craft)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emechjeb2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enavyfish docking dooda\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Estage recovery mod\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETAC Life Support\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Alarm Clock\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: been watching the \u0027faulty\u0027 engine stats on the right click context menu and the electrical charge drops for a split second just as it starts to spin - also notice that I can hear a faint pinging noise when it does so as I have my speakers volume up higher this time :/\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-24T09:29:50Z\u0022 title=\u002208/24/2014 09:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by psyper\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-24T13:56:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs the \u0022faulty\u0027 engine the last one you placed?
