But before coming here and yelling \u0022OMG, Squad and KSP suck because my game won\u0027t do this or that!\u0022, you should make extra sure you\u0027ve done everything possible to ensure the problem is not on your end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game does have a garbage collection stutter, you need to just accept it. The hardware you use doesn\u0027t matter. On a brand new stock install on a non-garbage pc it will almost not be there, but give it enough time and flights/flags/debris the stutter will return.
