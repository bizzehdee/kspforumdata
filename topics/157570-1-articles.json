The EVA experience even shows you how the helmet blocks your periferal vision, the scenery\u00A0was awe inspiring, I even got lost and it was a little terrifying to feel what poor little Jeb and Val must feel when you leave them floating away from the Station. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think every KSP fan will really enjoy this experience, if there\u0027s interest I could upload a short unedited video, but VR videos are not very good at transmitting the feelings or the sense of scale.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;","CreatedById":78047,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-16T08:13:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe glove and the arm approve ^^ i think the mit gift a year back or so approve too ^^\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-16T08:14:01Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2017 08:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
