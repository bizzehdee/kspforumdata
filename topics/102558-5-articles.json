I played back in late 2015...got bored with it, and set it aside. Started watching KSP vids on youtube a couple of months ago. The vids, combined with all the new features in 1.2, re-ignited my interest in the title. Started playing again mid-november, i believe...got really into it, but found some of the stock parts lacking, so i started getting mods. Kept it limited at first...just a few small parts packs, a couple of little tweak mods, that sort of thing.. It was bound to happen; a fatal interaction between mods (with a generous dose of outdated mod/plugin) caused a lot of things to break. Only figured out the solution a week or two ago. And now, due to technical limitations of my gaming rig, i\u0027m looking at having to completely rebuild a plane that took me 50\u002B hours to develop....i\u0027m not taking any more chances. I\u0027m almost at the point where i don\u0027t want to play anymore, because all that time is essentially down the toilet.\n\nI could probably sort the performance issues by picking up a new video card...but i really don\u0027t feel like dropping 300 bucks on that right now.\n\nI fear we\u0027re getting very much off topic though, eh\u0027?"},{"CreatedByName":"RealGecko","CreatedById":162682,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-13T10:00:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 minutes ago, Numberyellow said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I fear we\u0027re getting very much off topic though, eh\u0027?\n\u003E \n\nWe can discuss it in PM ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Numberyellow","CreatedById":172745,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-13T10:01:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 minute ago, RealGecko said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E We can discuss it in PM ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nrgr, switching to PM.\n\nEOL."},{"CreatedByName":"RealGecko","CreatedById":162682,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-29T09:41:46Z","Content":"[Recompile for KSP 1.3.0 is here!](https://spacedock.info/mod/1006/Lights%20Out)"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-13T13:15:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 5/29/2017 at 5:41 AM, RealGecko said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [Recompile for KSP 1.3.0 is here!](https://spacedock.info/mod/1006/Lights%20Out)\n\u003E \n\nCan you start a new thread?\n\nAlso, I\u0027ve released a 1.3 version of the JSI Part Utilities, I think this uses it?"},{"CreatedByName":"RealGecko","CreatedById":162682,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-14T05:51:37Z","Content":"I don\u0027t see need for a new thread, this one works really well.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 16 hours ago, linuxgurugamer said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Also, I\u0027ve released a 1.3 version of the JSI Part Utilities, I think this uses it?\n\u003E \n\nNope, this mod is standalone."},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-15T06:19:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 6/14/2017 at 1:51 AM, RealGecko said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t see need for a new thread\n\u003E \n\nyou could at least control the version number in the thread title and have your rebuilds in one spot rather than scattered throughout the thread.
