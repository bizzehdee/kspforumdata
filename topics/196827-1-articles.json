Because of numerous problems in the development phase, the first flight of an XAGM-53A missile did not occur before March 1970.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe engineering development and operational evaluation phases of the Condor program were completed in July 1975, and procurement of 250 operational AGM-53A missiles was planned for 1976. Condor was to be used mainly by the A-6E Intruder, but the A-7 Corsair and even the F-14 Tomcat were at also considered as launch platforms. This was not to be, however, because the AGM-53 program was cancelled in March 1976. Its long range and potentially high precision made the Condor a very powerful weapon, but it was much more expensive than contemporary tactical air-to-ground weapons. The secure data link contributed a signficant portion to total missile cost, and it certainly didn\u0027t help that this link was still somewhat unreliable. Additionally, the relatively small warhead made the missile possibly ineffective against those larger targets, which would have warranted the use of such a costly weapon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-53.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-53.html\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s where it goes full Kerbal:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EOriginally, it was intended to develop a storable liquid-fuel rocket engine\u003C/strong\u003E, but because of technical problems this had to be replaced by a less powerful solid rocket motor\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou see, I actually learnt of that thing from Sutton:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Condor program was started by the Navy in the mid-1960s using a high-energy, high-density oxidizer, namely chlorine trifluoride (C1F3) and the fuel was a mixture of hypergolic amine compounds. \u003C/strong\u003EThis oxidizer is very toxic and corrosive with most materials. Some of the Navy operating people were not enthusiastic about putting C1F3 into any ship. The thrust was in the 3000-to 4000-lbf thrust range with deep throttling (15 to 1.0 range). It used thin collapsible stainless-steel bladders to confine the propellants and separate them from the pressurizing gas, which would otherwise dissolve in the liquid pro-pellants. The technical problems of corrosion and deep throttling caused delays and overruns, which in turn brought on the canceling of the project in 1967.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid someone say \u0022small warhead!?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m fascinated by fluorides.
