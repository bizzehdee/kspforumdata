The computers and software were not designed to handle such an event so it had to be done by eye and timing.

Once satisfied with the location the player could hit a key or click something to finish it. It would also need an automatic landing override for when the fuel reaches a minimum safe amount to finish landing. Think of the Apollo 11 landing where they had to hover and move over a bit to avoid some rocks.
