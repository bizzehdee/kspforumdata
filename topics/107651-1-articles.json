So it will always appear in the tracking station as an active flight. \n\nI don\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t want to delete my dead ships, maybe sometimes they come in handy for... something. Also, historical artifacts.\n\nSo is it possible to write some kind of script, that checks for the following:\n\nCrew = 0 (even for capsules)\n\nAND\n\nElectric Charge = 0\n\nAND\n\nno power generators (solar panels, RTG, etc...) AND power consumption \u003E= 0\n\nIf all criteria are met, relabel the flight as debris.\n\nCould someone do that?"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T15:08:21Z","Content":"Could be bad for some instances.\n\nBut can you not change it from the tracking station on Kerbin?
