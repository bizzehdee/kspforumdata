And I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s realistic or not, so I\u0027m putting this here so you can respond and say if it\u0027s realistic. (Why am I so bad at introductions?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, The Soviet Union still exists, it adopted a form of Democratic Socialism after Stalin\u0027s death, and the USSR\u0027s economy is strong and thriving. The Cold War is still going on, the US suffered more in the Repression, and there were some Democratic Socialist revolutions in NATO/Western Europe. Anyway, the space stuff. The USSR becomes the 2nd nation to land a man on The Moon in 1971 with Soyuz-19, the Buran is a thriving, safe, and reliable manned spacecraft, the Soviet Union made Mir-2 with the help of using the Buran, starting in 1993, and the US made Space Station Freedom using the space shuttle, starting in 1988.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the Is-This-Realistic-Questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. In it, the Space Shuttle program still shuts down in 2011, and Space Station Freedom is still in orbit, so NASA put\u0027s it in a \u0022Shutdown\u0022 mode, with all non essential systems shutdown, to be turned on again when the US can once again send crew to it. They also raised it\u0027s orbit so it would De-orbit due to \u0022Orbital drag\u0022 in 15 years, so NASA would have time to make a new spacecraft, with an upper stage attached to the station on the last Shuttle mission. Is this realistic? I\u0027m not sure if NASA would still operate the Space Shuttle regardless of cost\u0027s to service and send crew to and from the space station, or if the US would just De-orbit Space Station Freedom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. In the beginning of it, NASA has to make a new launch vehicle. The Soviet\u0027s Energia rocket can get 100 tons to LEO, and in comparison, the US\u0027s largest launch vehicle, the Delta IV Heavy, can only get 29 tons to LEO. NASA end\u0027s up deciding, to instead of continue developing the Space Launch System (SLS), to use a modernized version of the Saturn V, with the 3rd stage replaced by a HydroLox stage with 6 RS-68 engines, basically a widened and lengthened Shuttle External Tank with cheaper and simpler SSME\u0027s. (That\u0027s pretty much what the RS-68 is). The 3rd stage is also the diameter of the 2nd and 1st stages. That\u0027s the Saturn VH (The H stands for HydroLox). Is this realistic? I know that some of the companies that made the original Saturn V parts have gone bankrupt, so I suppose NASA would pay some companies like ULA to build the Saturn VH parts. I see that this would not need the costly development of a new launch system, but would NASA really do this, if they had to make a new launch vehicle in a hurry to compete with the Soviets? Or would they still continue development of the SLS?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, now that you\u0027ve read them, if you know the answers, please post them!

If space station freedom is just there as a scientific endeavor like the ISS they would probably deorbit it. 15 years is a long time considering the breakneck speed of technological innovation nowadays, so the station would be horribly outdated. So if science is its only function they\u0027d probably just deorbit the thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, if it has a propellant depot containing large amounts of fuel they\u0027ll want to keep it up there. A propellant depot is extremely useful in orbit regardless of your technological innovation. As for the method used to boost the station, sure that\u0027d work. Strapping a centaur stage to the station would give it plenty of dV to lift its orbit to the 600ish km you\u0027d need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E2.

Then, they erupted into very loud chanting and clapping, and it stayed that way for about 5 seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERaising his voice to talk over the noise through the microphone, he said: \u0022I also choose this goal to be completed by 2026, and for another goal to be to set up a permanent base on the Lunar surface\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crowd erupted into clapping and chanting again, as it seemed that those few sentences spoken by one man would usher a new age in space exploration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EALESKI KOMAROV walked down the halls of the building with the biggest smile on his face in years. The Politbureau had voted to multiply the budget of Roscosmos by 4. He walked around a corner, nearly bumping into an engineer and then opened the door to the confrence room. He then walked to the seat labeled \u0022Chief Designer\u0022, ploncked down onto it and put his briefcase on the table. \u0022Aleski, what are the documents for this meeting?\u0022 Said an anthropomorphic Bobcat, Sergei Ivanovich, the head of OKB-2, which was responsible for several modules of the Mir-2 space station. The excited anthropomorphic yellow scaled colored Raptor opened the briefcase and grabbed the papers in it and put them next to the case in a sloppy pile. He then picked up a stapled group of paper on the top of the stack and flipped it to the first page.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027s a paper I made showing a few manned Mars mission concepts I thought of\u0022 He said while holding up the paper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAleski then pointed to a somewhat poorly made diagram while saying: \u0022I call this concept \u0022Mars 2X4\u0022, and it works by having 2 spacecraft that go to Mars. One, the ERV (Earth Return Vehicle) Lands on Mars with no crew, and once the crew has landed in a seperate spacecraft and done there experiments and what not, they board the ERV. They then lift off to Low Martian Orbit, do a trans Earth injection burn, reenter the atmosphere, and land safely in the USSR\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe then waited for a moment to see if there were any questions, but no one sitting at the table said anything, as they were more focused on reading the paper in Aleski\u0027s hand. Pointing to another diagram on the same page, he began speaking again: \u0022The other spacecraft, the Mars Descent Vehicle, or MDV for short, is supposed to bring the crew to the surface of Mars, preferably next to the ERV. Also, it would be used as the Hab for the 2 week stay on Mars, so it can\u0027t be too cramped inside\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So you essentially copied Mars Direct?\u0022 Said A senior engineer sitting near the other side of the table.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEveryone in the room mildly laughed and looked towards the engineer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking somewhat embarrassed and annoyed, he flipped to the next page and pointed to another diagram and started talking again\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022This is another concept I made, if you just laugh at the first one. I call it \u0022CosmoMars\u0022, and It also has an ERV, which serves the same purpose as in Mars 2X4. But, there is also a \u0022Mothership\u0022, or Mars Transit Vehicle (MTV) as I\u0027ll call it. It serves to carry the crew from Earth to Mars and back, It is assembled in Low Earth Orbit, does a Trans Mars Injection, and once at Mars it does a Mars Orbital Insertion burn. The crew then get into the MDV, which I explained before, and land on Mars next to the ERV, which landed there 2 years earlier. After they\u0027re done on the Martian surface, the crew board the ERV, lift off into Martian Orbit, rendezvous, and dock with the MTV. They them board the MTV, ditch the ERV, or well, Mars Ascent Vehicle as we should call it in this scenario, and then do a Tran Earth Injection burn. Then, after a 9 month wait from Mars, the MTV does an Earth Orbital Insertion burn, and finally, either a modified automated Soyuz or a Buran picks up the crew and returns them home\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEveryone in the room looked at the paper, and a few said \u0022Hmmm..... good idea...\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a smile of confidence, Aleski turned the page again and pointed to yet another diagram, while of course, explaining it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022This concept is what I call \u0022Mars 09\u0022, It has 3 vehicles, the MDV, the Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV), And the Earth Transit Vehicle (ETV). The ETV\u0027s is supposed to bring the crew from Martian Orbit to Low Earth Orbit, I thought I might explain that because I just introduced a new vehicle. Anyway, the MAV lands on Mars first, then the crew come in the MDV, and then they get into the MAV and lift off to Mars Orbit after they\u0027ve done. In the MAV, they then dock to the ETV, transfer to it, and ditch the MAV. The ETV then does a Trans Earth Injection, and once it arives at Earth, it does an Earth Orbital Insertion burn, and then the crew are picked up by another spacecraft amd return to Earth\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the people in the room looked at and read Aleski\u0027s paper, though a few people were not paying attention, as if they were waiting for something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So, any questions?\u0022 Aleski said while panning the room for any raised hands or anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022For Mars 09, couldn\u0027t the spacecraft that lands on Earth be part of the ETV, instead of having a seperate vehicle be launched?\u0022 Asked a female voice from the near end of the table.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well. yes I do suppose so. It could be an enlarged Soyuz descent module, and it wouldn\u0027t be hard to design. Good point\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Any more questions? No? So, now let\u0027s vote on which one we think is the best.

And the US\u0027s space station, Space Station Freedom, had been put into a \u0022Shutdown\u0022 mode, still orbiting but all unnecessary systems shutdown, and to be reactivated when the US could send crew to it, since the shutdown of the Space Shuttle Program in 2011.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I know Ted, but how do we even remotely compete?\u0022 Said David Mitch, an anthropomorphic Terrier, the head of NASA Deep Space Operations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Do you have any ideas on what we could do?

Our best launch vehicle, the Delta IV Heavy, can get 29 tons into LEO, and the Soviet\u0027s Energia can get 100 tons to LEO\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So... what are our options?

First: Use old hardware from the 60s? Even though it has been proven to work, the technology is ancient, and why would we waste time and money modernising it? Second: The companies that made the parts for the Saturn\u0027s have went bankrupt decades ago, so . how would we build it?
