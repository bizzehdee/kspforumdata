They\u0027ve already been built, so they won\u0027t cost very much at all to get up and running again. The L-V2 is a liquid-fueled motor, which means that it burns a liquid fuel and an oxidizer, so unlike a solid fuel rocket, it can be turned off and on. It is also somewhat more efficient. Slightly. It also overheats more readily than other rocket engines.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMax Thrust: 105\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMin Thrust: 105\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Non Throttelable)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIsp: 295s (ASL), 315s (Vac)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWeight: 1 tonne\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECost: 280 Funds\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike the LV-T15, the L-V2 rocket motor is rather cheap, though the L-V2 takes this to an extreme. It\u0027s low cost is made up for by a poor thrust to weight ratio, a poor efficiency, and a tendency to overheat. They were the first and only liquid fuel engines for quite a while, and Wernher\u0027s workshop of voluntold kerbal workers produced as many of these as they could, so there\u0027s no shortage of them. They\u0027re practically free, and thus will be insanely useful for space programs suffering a major finance problem. Bonus points if you use 30 of them to power the first stage of a Mun rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-07T12:52:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe main problem with creating worse off engines below the LV series is how to balance them compared to Boosters.

Before liquid fuel engines, Solid Boosters were fueled by horrible-efficiency gunpowder. During the cold war, modern solid fuels were developed as storable propellant for missiles. So make a new low tech SRB to be amazingly cheap and gunpowder-fueled, and move the RT-10 up a bit as well. And remember the main thing: The liquid engines can be turned off and on.
