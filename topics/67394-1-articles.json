Notepad takes a very long time to read and write large files (and yeah a mb is large for notepad!). I have an 8mb p_file and I can make tea while waiting for notepad to save. In really large files just adding a newline can take a while in notepad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- use an editor that supports line folding. This will make chopping out sections of the file really easy as you can collapse whole sections to a single line which you can then copy to grab the entire section, rather than trying to manually find the correct end to a particular section. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use VIM (free and you can get it for windows/mac/linux) as it loads/saves really large files in a snap and does line folding very easily. notepad\u002B also does line folding as does the default editor on macs (I think). I also use gedit in linux, but I prefer VIM\u0027s line folding because it easily deals with the non-standard format that Squad uses (I really wish they\u0027d used regular XML!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut Vim is a little crazy if your not used to it, its commands are nearly all command line activated, which as a coder I love, but I can see that might upset some folk! You just put your cursor on the { at the start of a section and then type \u0022zfa}\u0022 and it will find the matching end } and collapse the section into one line which you can then just copy. (\u0022zo\u0022 to expand a collapsed section.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt really is all about having an editor that does line folding. Each VESSEL, even small ones, can span many many lines and its easy to loose track if you are manually scrolling to find the end of a particular one. With line folding you can just crunch a whole vessel into a single line and then copy it, easy!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps some!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-01T13:51:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NecroBones\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NecroBones\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat came from multiple people who did vids last week.
