That\u0027s not a \u003Cem\u003Eton\u003C/em\u003E of data, but it\u0027s enough that the mod listing query takes way too long to run. This is because it clusters all the different plugins it detects into mod names. (For example, Kethane.dll and KethaneToolbar.dll are both considered \u0022Kethane\u0022.) The clustering query works fine for a few hundred reports, but it wasn\u0027t built to scale. At this point, none of the queries are particularly scalable. So, I need to spend some time working out which statistics will be computed and then build more efficient queries for all of them. This will involve a lot of precomputation. For example, if I wanted to query how many times people have launched KSP in the last month, I might have a precomputed stat for each day, sum up those days, and then add in the remaining reports since the last 24-hour checkpoint. This is certainly computationally faster, but it reduces flexibility, and that slows development. I\u0027m still experimenting with different queries, so the site isn\u0027t progressing much at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027d like to help, you could always help with the site.

(The crash stat is also potentially flawed, but that\u0027s not certain yet.) While the server is struggling a little with inefficient queries, it seems to be handling the network traffic just fine, so I have no concerns about increasing coverage. I don\u0027t expect to see stability issues before ModStats hits 100K users.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
