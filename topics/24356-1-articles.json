And so, since all the matter attracts due to gravity, this cloud started to collapse into it\u0027s center (where the net gravity is strongest).. And so... Just like when you release the lid (is that the right English word?) in your bathtub, and the water starts spinning in one direction (direction is irrelevant and depends on circumstances), due to inter-molecular collisions, that is the same reason why that collapsing dust starts also spinning.. And in the same way the pizza guy makes the thin disc of dough by spinning it on the finger (lets imagine all pizzamakers do that), in this way the dust cloud forms a disc, In the mean time the dust compresses in the center so much that it is capable of sustaining fission (star), and the disc, due to \u0022clearing up\u0022 of it\u0027s neighboring boulders become rocky planets. As for gas giants, these are gas clouds that didn\u0027t have enough mass to sustain fission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn reality, none of the planets have the same inclination, and that is mostly due to this \u0022clearing up\u0022, or collisions with objects, that ultimately make planets. Scientist today think that moon was formed when a huge asteroid collided with Earth. That collision might\u0027ve also changed inclination slightly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that is exactly why the galaxy is a disc too just on a bigger scale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for bad English, but in short, that\u0027s it\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS. And by \u0022equatorial\u0022 you probably mean in-line with Earth\u0027s orbit around sun. It\u0027s not aligned with equator, neither is equator with the Earth\u0027s orbit around sound. Earth has 23 degrees axis tilt. The extreme case might be Uranus, whose axis tilt is 97 degrees, almost normal to the orbit towards the sun.. This is most probably also due to collisions and early formation\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd how do we know all this actually happened??
