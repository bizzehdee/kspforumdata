I\u0027m not particularly good at this format since I have never really done it before, so I hope I don\u0027t ramble too much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe points I will cover in more detail if you choose to watch the video include the following:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nSquad\u0027s update history and why the part reskins haven\u0027t been a good use of their time considering mods do the same and in the case of Restock, a better job (which IS subjective!)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOverview of what the DLC aims to add\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nExplanation of the planet surface features and why I don\u0027t like the implementation of the DLC the way it has been done.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI did forget to cover a few points / not go into enough detail about the points in the video, so I will do here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirstly I want to stress that\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Ei like what Squad is doing\u003C/strong\u003E, but their execution is what I have a problem with. In short, I don\u0027t think the DLC is worth the price from what we\u0027ve been told about it. Obviously, this is subject to what you as a consumer want to actually pay for the DLC, which is why I explain it a bit better in the video.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Infernal Robotics-esque features are awesome. I like them. I like the thought of them, the implementation to some extent, and the idea behind them and their uses. However, the actual mod \u0022Infernal Robotics\u0022 already does exactly this, and although there haven\u0027t really been any other screenshots except hinges, I imagine I.R. does more than what Squad intends to add. Each to their own in terms of how detailed you would expect to see something like I.R. be implemented.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy main gripe is the planetary surfaces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe stock planets are awful in my opinion. I do have very strong feelings about them because I myself am a planet modder, but I will try not to include my work here because it\u0027s not a good idea to include myself when the subject is criticism of someone else\u0027s work. What the DLC intends to add are \u0022terrain scatters\u0022 - essentially the proper name for what Squad is calling rocks, trees, cacti, crystals, meteorites, etc. These can all be added to the game with a\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Emod\u003C/strong\u003E, for free, and planet mods such as Galileo\u0027s Planet Pack already do this. Stock Visual Terrain, although as far as I\u0027m aware doesn\u0027t add these scatters, improves the planets\u0027 terrain textures instead. This is all easily achievable for free and without much effort. My main critique in this video is that\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Ethe entire terrain scatters are part of this DLC.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0The planets are bare and boring and barren and appear unfinished. This is why I suggested making them part of the stock game rather than locking them behind a DLC. The stock planets aren\u0027t even finished, never mind the DLC!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith that said, I mentioned that\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Ethe mechanics that are going to be added to the terrain scatters should stay in the DLC\u003C/strong\u003E, but the models for them should be in the main game. Basically \u0022You can see them and crash into them, but you can get the DLC and interact with them\u0022. I genuinely believe the stock planets, especially their surfaces, need the same attention Squad seems to be putting into their part revamps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, that will sound contradictory and in a way it is - saying Squad should stop the part revamps because a mod can do it, then saying they should do the same for the planets? Yes, in a way. Except the parts didn\u0027t need the revamp so much. The planets, however, are a key part of the exploration aspect of the game and there\u0027s nothing worse than exploring nothing at all. Since Squad has already gone ahead and redone the parts, that\u0027s why I\u0027m saying the planets need the attention too - but\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Ethey\u0027re in such a bad state, making the improvements to them a DLC is a joke.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EConclusion:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like what Squad\u0027s doing, but their execution of it is bad. There was little need for this DLC since 95% of it is done through mods anyway -\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Ethe only real addition we haven\u0027t seen before is the gameplay surrounding the rocks they\u0027re planning to add to the planets.\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EWhich will be pressing a button and seeing our science rise, give or take a couple of parts to achieve this. Do I think it\u0027s worth the price? No.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I don\u0027t like it, I won\u0027t buy it - that\u0027s the motto people chant for these kinds of threads, and that\u0027s it really. I won\u0027t buy it, because it isn\u0027t worth buying imho. It comes down to you whether to support the developers by buying it or not, but since 95% of it can be done through mods, i\u0027ll stick to my mods, thank you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EUltimate TL:DR:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003ESquad is re-inventing the wheel by adding things mods already add.

And each of those \u0022add-ons\u0022 requires anywhere from $5 to $14.99 to be able to use them. Some I buy, some I do not buy. There are several computer games out there, such as \u003Cem\u003ECities: Skylines\u003C/em\u003E, which has added new features to the game about once a year. Those \u0022new features\u0022 also run about $15.00 a pop.

In my box of stuff in the bottom of my closet, I have about 25 games on CD-Rom which weren\u0027t updated. They were pretty awesome games in their day, but once I purchased the software and installed it, there were no patches, no new content, nothing. Even now, in my Steam library, there are a handful of games which have also died - no new DLC, no new features, no software updates to make it \u0022Windows\u0022 compatible. On some of those games, I spent hundreds of hours playing them. Now, they do nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d much rather see this game create new DLCs to be able to continue development. We do a lot of wishing for things in version 2.0, but we rarely think of what it will take to get there. And if it takes another four years of DLC that I have to spend $15.00 on to do that, then I will do my part to help get the game to that point. I am sure Squad would love to be able to throw us some bones every once in a while. They\u0027ve done that in the past. But for the continuity of the game, it cannot be expected that Squad will do nothing beyond the initial sale of the game to raise revenue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes he or anyone else have the right to play this game without buying the new DLC?

There has been another DLC which added some new empires and a completely new gaming tree to the core and that expansion was $29.99. Although I would love to see volcanoes, plate tectonics, and the weather added to the stock game, the game studio decided to add it as DLC. The game\u0027s producer, Firaxis, has decided to put it behind a \u0022paywall\u0022 as the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221. Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it. 2.

I am willing to pay for this and any other DLC they do for a straightforward reason. In early 2012, I came across the demo of KSP and fell in love with it. It was crude, and it was far from what even the stock game offered at the time. But it was a new concept which I saw the many unlimited possibilities. I bought it in Steam when it was on sale for $5.00 as a greenlight (early release) sale. A few weeks later, I bought the KSP store version thinking there would be additional parts, that version was .22.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, on Steam, I currently have 2,387 hours on KSP. The store version, I do play (it is on version 3.0), and I probably have at least another 1,000 hours there. Oh, then I also have a lightly modded version which has 75 hours as I try to develop my planet mod. So, based on that, I have around 3,500 hours of gameplay of KSP. If I take what I paid for the game, which is about $25.56 for both copies plus local sales tax. I purchased Making History (the first expansion pack), and it adds another $15.00 to the cost of the game: $41.46\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBased on simple math (amount paid/dollars spent), that comes out to \u003Cstrong\u003E$0.0118 for each minute of gameplay\u003C/strong\u003E. And typically, I play for about two hours at a time, bring the amount of money spent per game session to about $1.42. That\u0027s not a bad investment for something purely fun. And the more I play the game, the lower the amount per game session becomes as the number of hours I spend playing the game increases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gameslinx","CreatedById":144828,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-07T18:01:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223595083\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022184310\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221557251453\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002289014\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022adsii1970\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 minutes ago, adsii1970 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game\u0027s producer, Firaxis, has decided to put it behind a \u0022paywall\u0022 as the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.

You can teach to a common set of steps, without needing to be like \u0022oh, also get this mod, and here\u0027s how to install mods.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Adding multi-core support or optimizations doesn\u0027t sell. New shinies sell. Optimizations aren\u0027t tangible, robotics are. Don\u0027t get me wrong, I want better multi-core support and more optimizations as well. Also, this should be a standard, base-game update. Trying to sell multi-core support separately will not go over well with most people. What should happen is that optimizations are made along with, or in support of, whatever new DLC is added. Of course, subject to what\u0027s actually possible in the engine. Use the DLC to provide funding and support for backend core work. :-D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Regarding the new terrain scatters, Space Engineers did something similar recently with their DLC. They allow everyone to see the new blocks, but not use or place them. I would equate that option with what you suggest. Many people disagreed with that, and considered it more \u0022in-game advertisement.\u0022 \u0022Oh look, something new I can see, but can\u0027t do anything with, I\u0027d rather not see it at all.\u0022 Now they did mitigate that post-DLC release by letting everyone also use them, just not place them. IMO this is a decision Squad won\u0027t win either way. Add scatters, or don\u0027t add scatters, people will be upset. Personally though, I agree here with you, I wouldn\u0027t mind them being present, as it makes the world more consistent for players. However if they still don\u0027t add them, I won\u0027t be upset.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) You didn\u0027t mention cost, but others have: I got the game super early, so I don\u0027t have to pay for it. However, if I did, I feel this expansion is much more worth the cost than Making History, which I still haven\u0027t played to this day. If I had to buy it, I probably wouldn\u0027t have gotten MH.

They\u0027re gorgeous! I\u0027ll also preface by saying what we have now is little more than a teaser from squad so we have very little information on how deployed science and surface feature interaction will work and how it will be different from currently available mods. That said I do think \u0027interacting with rocks\u0027 is worth unpacking a bit.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe current blandness of the planetary surfaces isn\u0027t just an aesthetic problem, its first and foremost a\u00A0gameplay problem. When you first land on a new world there\u0027s essentially no reason to land in any particular place, and even after that there\u0027s no reason to land anywhere so long as you haven\u0027t already mined out the science from\u00A0that biome. That means there\u0027s very little incentive within the game to do things like scout landing locations, learn to land precisely, bring and explore with rovers, or build long-term bases. Because of this the base game is essentially about\u00A0flags-and-footprints missions. Science gathering is really just a matter of putting your experiments on an action group and clicking around for a few seconds before going home. The two exceptions to this are\u00A0the mining and prospecting system (which is actually quite good, but only really matters when you\u0027re deep into the game) and the current anomalies, which are so sparse and so time-consuming to scout they might as well not exist.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nLike I said, we don\u0027t yet know how the new surface features and experiments will work exactly, but the promise they hold is to vary not just the appearance of the landscape but the gameplay value in going to specific places. They\u0027re not just another thing you can click, they create a topography of incentives that drive players to scout, explore the surface, and set up shop in places that hold more value, which in turn drives players to create much more inventive mission profiles and vessels to accomplish them. If you add all that to stock robotics we\u0027re talking about a pretty significant extension to gameplay, and one thats well worth 15$ to me and a lot of other players.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-05-07T20:30:47Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2019 08:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Klapaucius","CreatedById":181256,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-07T20:56:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/144828-gameslinx/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022144828\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/144828-gameslinx/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Gameslinx\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst of all, I love your planet packs.

If I am taken out of context, sometimes it is because I was not clear in the first place.\u00A0 This is the ONLY forum online I spend any time on other than Adobe tech support.\u00A0 I even quit Facebook six months ago.\u00A0 Why? Because it is heavily moderated and I get to chat about fun things without it degenerating into fruitless and nasty political discussions or flame wars.\u00A0 If I had a children, I would happily allow them on here because I know this is a polite and supportive space.
