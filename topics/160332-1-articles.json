orbit menu, so some purists might not want to do it that way. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aegolius13","CreatedById":165625,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-08T03:15:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried throwing together a quick ascender that can take an Mk 3 passenger cabin (and thus 14 Kerbals) to Eve orbit - see pic below. \u00A0It worked in testing but can probably be optimized further. \u00A0I might consider subbing out the Rhino (overkill in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E)\u00A0for a Skipper or\u00A0Vector with a 3.75m interstage fairing.\u00A0\u00A0 It\u0027s also very top-heavy; longer struts for the landing legs might help with that, or putting more fuel on the radial boosters. \u00A0I might also be tempted to swap out the top nose cone for a shock cone intake, for better heat tolerance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022aO2MqAK.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aO2MqAK.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as how to land something like this - yikes. \u00A0Not being able to attach parts to the bottom of Mammoths would complicate the procedure quite a bit. \u00A0It might work to a second pair of radially attached 3.75m tanks (without engines at the bottom), so that the whole thing is shaped like a plus-sign. \u00A0Use those tanks to feed your Mammoths\u00A0on the transfer to Eve, attach some inflatable heat shields to the bottom of those tanks for the descent, land with the the tanks attached\u00A0for a wider base, and then decouple them as soon as you take off on your ascent.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cpt Kerbalkrunch","CreatedById":175588,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-08T03:32:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223048560\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022160332\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221494200765\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129482\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Doctornotyep\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Doctornotyep said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have recently launched a rocket (The\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EHWI Oddity\u003C/em\u003E)\u00A0to Eve and stranded 14 Kerbals on the planet.
