In my so far short KSP career, I have not reached orbit more than once, and that did not end well. (It\u0027s a long story.) I had a good site where I found some great orbiting tutorials, but now the page seems to have been deleted for some reason, and I barely remember any of it.. So what I am asking? I would like for someone to give me a few steps (No. 1, make a rocket, etc.) in order to reach a basic orbit. This would be much appreciated, thank you! And I apologize for being a complete newbie. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-29T21:14:09Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2015 09:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CaptainApollo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dspan_000","CreatedById":144320,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T19:10:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell there are a few you need to follow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Building your rocket)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Solid rocket boosters are no longer as strong as they once were, so using them in lower stages is no longer as useful. But, all you should really need is a fair number of fuel cans on the bottom with a swivel engine (a decent atmospheric engine that can gimbal), a few cans up top with a terrier (a solid engine outside of the atmosphere), and a pod with a parachute.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MiniMatt","CreatedById":78749,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T20:05:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re going to get a lot of good advice in this thread, because this is a very good community. A lot of this advice will mention the videos produced by Scott Manley. This is very good advice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome hints:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember, orbit is not an altitude, but a speed. Your aim is not really to be at a certain height, but to be going \u003Cem\u003Ehorizontally \u003C/em\u003Ea certain speed. That speed, around Kerbin, is roughly 2,300 metres per second (maybe a bit more, can\u0027t remember off the top of my head). If you\u0027re going this speed in space (ie. above 70km, lets call it 75km for a safety margin) then you\u0027re in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor reasons related to the direction the planet spins (Kerbin, as well as Earth) you want that horizontal speed to be easterly - this is why NASA launches from Florida, out over the Atlantic, rather than from California out over the Pacific. So 90 degrees on your navball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lot of old (beta) advice will say \u002245 degrees at 10km\u0022. This remains reasonable, if not optimal advice - you want to start moving more horizontally once you\u0027re out the thickest bit of the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a rough starting point (and likely non-optimal, but hell, it\u0027s a start) is to aim to be pointed at 45 degrees east by the time you\u0027ve reached 10,000m altitude, and at 30 degrees east by the time you\u0027ve hit 30,000m altitude. At this point, \u003Cem\u003Eswitch to the map view\u003C/em\u003E and look at your \u0022apoapsis\u0022 height (the highest your flight is predicted to reach). Once your apoapsis reaches 75km stop all thrust and coast up to that peak. Just before you reach that peak, thrust at full horizontal (ie. very close to your \u0022prograde\u0022 - the direction you\u0027re now heading) till your periapsis (the low point in your orbit) is also listed at around 75km. When this is achieved you will notice your speed (above the navball) is listed as being around 2,300 metres per second. You\u0027re now orbiting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods remain very useful, and I\u0027d argue near essential for anything beyond getting into orbit. Kerbal Engineer Redux is perhaps the simplest and best known which will give you a delta-v readout and thrust to weight ratio of your craft. I\u0027d seriously encourage looking at these. 4,000 delta-v in your craft gives more than enough to reach Kerbin orbit in version 1.0.x, including a very healthy safety margin. A thrust to weight ratio of between 1.5 and 2.0 is just fine (weighted toward the 1.5 end).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nfpinto","CreatedById":143049,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T20:07:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Elook for Scott Manley at youtube\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehe has a series of tutorials.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Invader Jim","CreatedById":142312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T20:07:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne mistake I have made for a long time is creating a top stage that is too big.
