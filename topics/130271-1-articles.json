It is\u00A0a resourcing / crafting / trading / pew \u0027em up game and looks like it is being built with multiplayer in mind though I have only tried single player so far.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGameplay is, like KSP, engaging for mechanical types. You\u00A0mine asteroids/moons/planetismals in orbit to trade the ores, make fuel\u00A0and also build your ship out of the same ores. The structure of the ship and thruster placement etc all matter for\u00A0the flight physics as does mass distribution including cargo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts very early days, so is cheap, thought some might enjoy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://celestialcommand.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://celestialcommand.com/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt occurred to me this\u00A0game owes a lot to KSP and probably wouldnt even exist if KSP had not made it possible for gamers to engage with orbits and, in that sense, Squad would probably be justified in considering it\u00A0a\u00A0sincere\u00A0form of flattery! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGameplay screeny to give some\u00A0flavour.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/XldxJrZ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/XldxJrZ\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-19T16:29:33Z\u0022 title=\u002201/19/2016 04:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by boolybooly\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
