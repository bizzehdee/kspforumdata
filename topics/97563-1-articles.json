There is only a single small light on the water tower at the KSC launch pad (tier 3 version) that is aimed at your rocket and that seems to be very lacking to my way of thinking. I would love to see a bunch more powerful lights that are available when a vehicle is on the pad ready for launch at night. Obviously this could be scaled up with the upgrade tiers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome inspiration:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://c1.staticflickr.com/7/6030/5932822110_a409588114.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00225932822110_a409588114.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-23T20:30:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat would be a nice touch for polishing the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne trick you can try is attaching lights to launch clamps.
