Nearly identical to the previous Sulphur Shuttle, this one included legs. And a couple extra lights. And ladders. (Can\u0027t forget the ladders.) The launch, as always, was controlled by kOS script and went perfectly according to plan. The second stage of the LV-06A Cadence launch vehicle even had a few hundred extra delta-V, used to propel the Sulphur 2 on its way to The M\u00FCn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBetween the time the S-2 launched and the Boron 5 arrived in its polar munar orbit, the OSI interns had identified at least three interesting looking places for Macfred and crew to land on the M\u00FCn. One of them even featured a possible (highly-likely) structure of unknown origin. Something an even earlier satellite had claimed to see. A Thing on the M\u00FCn.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd in orbit, low, low orbit, one new Thing had also been discovered, this time by the crew of the Memory themselves. This new object was in far too low of an orbit to have been spotted from Kerbin, nearly 10km, but based on observations of its passes below the crew was confident it was another station. Instead of wasting fuel to get to it now they would instead rendezvous with it once leaving the surface. A Thing around the M\u00FCn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\nOn the remote Island of the M\u00FCn some many years ago, a lone kerbal decided to build a tower that would reach beyond the heavens and up to this wayward messenger. Many mocked the kerbal, often pelting him with pebbles \u0022to add to the pile\u0022. For years and years this simple hermit attended to his work, toiling on under the scorching equatorial Sun. In time his tower of stone grew to rival even the greatest of mountains, stretching ever upward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\nAnd then, just as he was about to reach up and pluck the tiny pebble from the sky itself, the great powers took notice. The ground shook, his tower shifted, and the mountain of his hubris was pulled out from under him. He stumbled, slipped, and awoke dazed and confused hours later atop his rubble pile, now reaching no more than a few meters. The Tower of the M\u00FCn was forgotten, its island slipped into distant memory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\nYet the dream persevered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160324_ksp0249_s-2.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022586\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160324_ksp0249_s-2.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe S-2 completed its capture burn using the RT2 Flight Computer, entering into a 50km by 200km orbit, just enough to allow the Memory to catch up to it before completing its first orbit. The rendezvous was completed remotely by Gletrix, who was getting the hang of this remote operation thing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd so Macfred, Thomlock, Agake and Gletrix quickly climbed aboard the Sulphur 2 when it arrived. There was no equipment to transfer as it housed everything they could ever need. Every science experiment they could find was strapped to its side, which was to say not many. Funds were still tight at the space center, though The Boss had been dropping hints that they might have a sponsor lined up.

She was right, the base was rather large, and more then half of it appeared to be glass-covered canopy modules... probably more greenhouses like the smaller structure.

As were the connecting points between modules.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the front sat two trucks (or rovers), each with a small, one-kerbal cabin and seating up top for two.

An old airlock, not unlike many of those in use at the stations above them. No fancy electronics, just simple, obvious gauges to show when the air was safe and when it meant a quick death. He checked his suit gauge before removing his helmet anyway, just to be sure.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe airlock opened onto an empty cabin. An inner air lock where suits were hung and helmets stacked. At least he thought it was empty. He turned to sit his helmet on a shelf and was unlatching his space mittens when a sound behind him perked his ears. He turned just in time to watch a banana sail through the air and splat onto the ground in front of him.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt had emerged from the feeble fingers of an old, very old kerbal, who was now smiling at him from inside an EVA suit at the opposite side of the room. The elder kerbal started to charge at Macfred, managing only to stumble and fall backwards. He sat up gingerly and then removed his helmet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I knew you would come. My strength has left me.

It was ripe, not overly so, and larger than a banana should be. Fresh. \u0022This? M\u00FCnfruit?\u0022 The elderly kerbal nodded, his shockingly white hair catching the light of the room as he did so. Macfred sat the banana down and moved to examine his host. \u0022You took a bit of a spill there. Are you ok? How long have you been here?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Many decades.\u0022 He motioned towards Macfred\u0027s EVA suit. \u0022I see they still use the old model.
