Currently, the failures happen only on the active craft, the one you\u0027re flying. But not for other on-going flights. That is not logical, and it encourages player to spend as little time flying the craft as possible. I suggest that the failures would be calculated for all flown vessels. For example, when player is exiting a specific flight, calculate the odds of a failure for all and any parts present in that craft, and if dice rolls for a failure to happen, set an invisible alarm (time warp stop) when that failure is to happen, then display a message like \u0022Fuel leak on Eve Rover-1\u0022. Mechanics could be different from what I suggested (like, real-time failure calculation, but that may slow down general game performance), but you get my point - no craft should be safe from failures, both active and inactive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould this be implemented?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kyrt Malthorn","CreatedById":149101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T04:15:41Z","Content":"\nSeveral months back when I was brand new to KSP, I saw this mod and though, \u0022Oh, that\u0026#39;s awesome!
