Click on the VAB, start with a MK1 Command Pod - your ony choice in the demo anyway. If you intend to bring your Kerbal back put a Mk16 parachute on top of the pod and a TR-18A stack decoupler underneath it. Add an Advanced SAS System, FL-T800 fuel tank, FL-T400 and LV-T30 engine in order under the decoupler. This is the stage that will get your orbiter into space but it needs a bit more punch - \u0022moar\u0022 boosters as the saying goes in these forums. Put another decoupler below the engine and an RT-10 Solid Fuel Booster below that. Repeat this so you have, from the top, parachute, pod, decoupler, SAS, two fuel tanks, engine, decoupler, booster, decoupler, booster. Now click the launch button (top-right of the VAB screen, you might want to save first) and your rocket will be taken to the pad. KSP\u0027s physics engine takes a few seconds to kick in then you will see the ship and camera \u0027settle\u0027 a little. Press \u0027T\u0027 to engage the SAS unit, it\u0027ll keep you pointing in the right direction ^^. Throttle-up (left shift-key) to max then press the spacebar to engage your first stage - booster 1. You\u0027re off. Watch the fuel-guage at the bottom-left of the screen, ignore the \u0027overheat\u0027 warning and wait for booster 1 to burnout. When it has no fuel left press the spacebar again to jettison it and engage booster 2. When that one runs out too, spacebar to stage again and you\u0027ll have your main rocket firing. Continue straight up to 10km then press \u0027T\u0027 to disengage SAS. Now press \u0027D\u0027 (yaw-right) to pitch-over to 45-degrees as shown on the navball at the bottom of the screen. Press \u0027T\u0027 to re-engage SAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow we get to the map view and maneuver nodes you were asking about. Press \u0027M\u0027 to switch to map view (press it again when you want to go back) and you will see a blue \u0027current orbit\u0027 line on the globe of Kerbin, rising from the space centre and with a \u0027ship\u0027 marker indicating your current position. The line arcs up and back to the ground because you haven\u0027t made it to orbit yet. At the highest point (apoapsis) is a tag with the legend \u0027AP\u0027 (amazingly enough standing for \u0027apoapsis\u0027). Put your mouse over this and watch as your (predicted) maximum altitude increases. [Optional, but efficient: when your AP reaches about 50km disengage SAS again (T) and pitch-over further (D) to 20-degrees above the horizon]. When your apoapsis reaches 75km or more throttle-back to 0 (left ctrl-key, or just \u0027X\u0027) and the ship will continue to coast into space. Well done, that\u0027s step one but still sub-orbital. Right-click on your orbit line at the AP marker and click \u0027add manoeuvre\u0027 - this is what you wanted - drag the prograde symbol (blue circle, in the direction of travel) outwards and KSP will show you a brown, dotted \u0027planned\u0027 orbit line as well. Adjust your \u0027prograde burn\u0027 manoeuvre so that the periapsis marker (lowest point of the orbit, Pe in map view) is also around 75km - above 69km in any case. To the right of the navball KSP will now show the time until you have to execute this burn (hurry up, you won\u0027t have much time!) and how long it will take to carry it out. There will also be a new, dark blue, symbol on the navball indicating the direction you must face to carry-out the burn. Disengage SAS (T), align with the manoeuvre indicator (WASD), re-engage SAS (T). When you get to the node throttle-up (left shift-key) until your periapsis (Pe) is above 69km then kill the engine again (left ctrl-key/X). [Optional, but efficient: start your burn early so you\u0027re half-way through it when you reach the node. E.g.; if it will take 10s start at T:-5s (and finish at T:\u002B5s)]. Congratulations; you\u0027re in orbit and know how to use manoeuvre nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIF you buy the full game you can install mods. IF you (still) aren\u0027t interested in flying spacecraft install MechJeb, as already mentioned by others, and getting to orbit is as simple as turning on the autopilot, telling it what height you want to go to and pressing spacebar to launch. IF you (really?) aren\u0027t interested in building ships either you can download many good ones from the spacecraft exchange in these forums. These ships (.craft files) will also work in the demo version, if you prefer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-19T18:18:31Z\u0022 title=\u002203/19/2014 06:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Pecan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
