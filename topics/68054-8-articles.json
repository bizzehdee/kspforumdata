In the example you gave, I imagine it would most likely be a group of colonists or miners from mars are being preyed upon by pirates in the asteroid belt. Asteroids are excellent places to hide ships... Or weapons. Popular shipping channels will pass nearby sections of the asteroid belt; cleverly hidden missile launch sites and targeting relays could be used for initial ambush scenarios. Say the pirates have several bases serving as colonies in the belts? In that case maybe they don\u0027t want to completely destroy the opposing fleet, and wish to capture ships for spare parts, resources, etc. Then it no longer becomes a war of who can kill the other guy faster. The pirates will have to have weapons to disable the other ships, get close safely, and board them. Maybe the Martians are sick of being preyed upon, and want to put a stop to the pirate menace. That means locating the asteroid bases, and taking them out. To do that they need an intact navigational computer with all data, one that hasn\u0027t been wiped clean. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously just an example- perhaps the pirates are actually freedom fighters, rebelling against a more powerful regime and seeking shelter among established mining colonies. It\u0027s whatever you want... But to justify the types of combat you want, each side needs a reason to be fighting like that. Certain technologies we don\u0027t currently possess will be available by this point as well. Scientists estimate it will only be another 30 years until we achieve a sustained fusion reaction; call it another 10 before we figure out how to utilize it as a interplanetary drive. It\u0027s currently estimated that this will allow us to get to mars in about a month. The US army is developing an electromagnetic rail gun similar to those seen in Halo. This is in the works currently and test firing can be seen on YouTube. Imagine one on a much larger scale, mounted to the front of a space ship... Thorium is also being researched. It\u0027s a nuclear fuel source that cannot melt down and is much more common than uranium. Scientists say there is enough thorium in the US alone to meet our countries current power needs for 10,000 years. The best part is that this isn\u0027t science-fiction. India leads the global research on thorium. It is already powering one of their reactors and India is developing a hard water variation of a thorium-specialized reactor. They say that by 2050, thorium will meet 1/3 of their power needs. And this is India, not the wealthiest nation out there. Anyways, I wish you luck.

These possibilities are limited once Country Y has at least a few FTL missiles spread around the perimeter of the combat area, which only leaves the small but protective grasp of a planet\u0027s atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, since this is an interplanetary war, by this time Country X has effectively lost the war, being so crippled in detection to not even know how how much more FTL \u0027power\u0027 Country Y has.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
