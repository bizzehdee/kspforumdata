We have kerbal spaceplane program,. kerbal submarine program and so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0060d like to expand on that concept with some extra thoughts. These would apply to career or science career.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had a vision where you could start off in a field with a few buildings, one being the early VAB or SPH, I think the SPH would fit better. You have a small amount of parts, none of which can get you off the ground but which will allow you to explore your surroundings. There are enough parts to build a basic rover and a static fuel mining operation. You would sell fuel to get funds and explore to get science. There would also be basic exploration contracts and milestones. This could be land speed records, maybe biome milestones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would open up basic flight where you could break more records, set more milestones, get more science and complete some more basic contracts which would open up advanced flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand so on giving the player a great sense of achievement once they actually got into space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently it is hardly an achievement at all to get all the height milestones, that would change.

Currently it feels very much like the bones of a game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere would have to be very large parts at the start that the payer has no hope of getting into the air but which could be placed on the ground to harvest and fuel storage parts which would make no sense to put into space (maybe very large dry mass) I\u0060d like to see stock refuelling of reusable craft be something built into the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEssentially the player would have to actually build up a space program from the ground, developing a way to get fuel, flight, then faster and higher planes until one can just about get out of the atmosphere at which point tech for orbit would be available and the game would proceed roughly along similar lines to what we have now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you got into space there would be a few kerbals with \u0022the right stuff\u0022 who had flown plenty of experimental planes.
