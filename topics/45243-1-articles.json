You know, that would actually be a pretty good idea to do. They are very popular as mod parts and cluster staging is at an all time high popularity given it\u0027s raw efficiency and power over larger single engines. I mean, you got SpaceX with a 9-nozzle cluster engine on the Falcon 9 (wait a minute, is that how the Falcon 9 got it\u0027s name?) and you got me with this onion staged cluster engine monstrosity:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img707/9620/ebut.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ebut.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: before people ask, to keep part count down, I use welded parts found in Mobius rocket works.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
