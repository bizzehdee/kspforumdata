While this kind of idea, with slowed metabolic rates have been suggested before, I believe this is the first time it\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s being done some serious science on the topic intended for space application. With this, building a small donut-shaped protected centrifuge with space for 15-20 astronauts, and a couple of inflatable hab units for when they arrive at the red planet, sounds plausible. While a base with that many astronauts would probably need a decent amount of supplies, such things can be launched in advance on very slow trajectories anyway. And having a relatively large crew like that would significantly lower while at mars, since there can be multiple specialists on key topics. For instance, two doctors instead of just one increases the likelyhood that an incident won\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t rob the expedition of one of them. Another possibilitiy here, is the possible significantly lower prise per person to ship to faraway places.Another thing, if they can manage to work this out, and make it available in a modulised form, it might be an option if for some reason, supplies run low, and it\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s months until the next possibility for resuply is at hand.

So what if induced hibernation won\u0027t make it into spaceflight within 20 years, chances are that it would prove a valuable tool for other areas of society, and quite possibly help to get more funding into space-related research in the future. Investing into space-related hibernation for humans now may very well be returned a hundred-fold in 20 years into other more direct projects. Expanding the base of knowledge, finding options and possibilities early on is worth much more than adding half a percent to a couple of propulsion developement projects.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-05T21:47:45Z\u0022 title=\u002209/05/2013 09:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Thaniel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-06T10:15:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy thank you Thaniel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack on topic, and for those of you who didn\u0027t take the time to read the article (I think I see at least 3 people who are arguing over stuff the article exclusively mentioned), Hibernation does not equal coma. Coma is 100% unresponsive. The hind of hypothermic hibernation they plan to induce is much less dead.

There is research being done to see if they can go 1-2 months and what it will do. Based on data from the 10 day patient, if I recall the article correctly, it said that muscle loss was noticeably less than it would have been if in a coma. This of course was an earth based test and does not account for exacerbation of the issue by mirogravity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m1xte","CreatedById":53528,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-06T10:43:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Diche Bach\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Diche Bach\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPeople who don\u0027t move for weeks and months suffer various forms of harm (including muscle atrophy).
