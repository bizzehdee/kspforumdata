Went to dock and my rcs wasnt working. Got rcs fuel, thruster blocks etc. Have docked 100 times before and never had this problem however I noticed that my ship was hot and the thruster blocks were glowing red. Could this be the reason why they wont work? I had activated RCS by pressing R and the light on the navball came on.
