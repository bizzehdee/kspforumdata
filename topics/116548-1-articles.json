Went to dock and my rcs wasnt working. Got rcs fuel, thruster blocks etc. Have docked 100 times before and never had this problem however I noticed that my ship was hot and the thruster blocks were glowing red. Could this be the reason why they wont work? I had activated RCS by pressing R and the light on the navball came on. Thankyou in advance for any help.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-23T05:39:22Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2015 05:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by maceemiller**"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T07:50:13Z","Content":"I\u0027m afraid picture will explain (a lot) more than what you describe here in text."},{"CreatedByName":"imaspacestation","CreatedById":145609,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T17:46:49Z","Content":"I have never heard of the small RCS engines overheating from their own use, but perhaps you have (or had earlier) another source of heat pointing at the RCS blocks?

I use Real Fuels and while I right click to fill all my tanks for some reason I didnt do this with my monopropellant tank!
