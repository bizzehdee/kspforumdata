It\u0027s your vertical velocity that you need to control, not the horizontal. Excess horizontal is only a problem if you run out of runway or paddock before your ground-brakes finish doing their thing (and you can help them along with spoilers, RCS, Vernors and, in extreme cases, Sepratrons).

Long slowdown reentries (shallow/soft reentries) are going to take half Kerbin\u0027s orbit. You run into the same problem you get with people who fly a jet fighter simulator for the first time. They get impatient and get too aggressive with routine operations like landing and come in hotter than the collector tower for a solar thermal power plant at three-o-clock on an Arizona summer afternoon. And then they expect the thing to behave nicely when they ask it to suddenly perform like an F-15E at Red Flag? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse the FAR settings for equivalent airspeed and find your stall speed and critical AoA. Learn to fly your design inside its envelope. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is to utilize Knots Equivalent Air Speed. (EAS) It\u0027s a measurement that gives you the \u0027equivalent\u0027 speed relationship to the pressure it would receive on the vehicle\u0027s flight surfaces at those speeds at sea level. A typical vehicle that has cargo capability and spaceworthiness is probably going to have a safe flight range between 120 knots and 390 knots. With 120 being \u0027too slow, you gonna stall if you haven\u0027t already\u0027, and 390\u002B being \u0027too fast, something\u0027s gonna rip off\u0027. A light single engine prop like you\u0027d see at a small country airport will get off the ground at around 55 knots and fly no faster than 130 knots. High supersonics and flying bricks probably will have the lower limit around 170 to 200 knots for stable flight and gliding. Only combat fightercraft, built for high Gs and heavy wing loading in turns are really meant to do any form of maneuvering above 400 KEAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso remember, 10 and 20 degrees are actually pretty steep dives in the realm of aircraft and you\u0027ll maintain insane amounts of speed at these angles. A typical landing descent for an aircraft to an airport is a 3 degree glide slope. In flight in KSP, a descent looks deceptively shallow in the external camera views. I\u0027d suggest navball hud and setting it so you have horizontal lines every ten degrees. (See previously linked video.) Also install the PAPI (Precision Approach Path Indicator) mod so you have a visual indication of your glide slope position. (I think it defaults to 6 degrees, so you might have to tweak its config.) There\u0027s an HSI mod floating around too that gives you aircraft ILS markers for approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(As a parting shot: Typical flight for an SR-71 airframe: Takeoff 170 KEAS; Low Level Flight with safe turning 250 to 300 KEAS; At Altitude Supersonic Cruise with long, slow [5 minutes \u002B] high mach turns, 300 to 365 KEAS; Landing ~200 KEAS)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
