Adjusting the angle is no problem but timing has alwase been the most difficult for me is KSP. For the mun I imagine it is at 3 on a large clock and aim for about 12-1. If possible would someone be able screenshot there map view of this injection?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadownailshot","CreatedById":32828,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-26T14:51:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI cant give you a screenshot, but if minmus is at 3 as well, you want to hit 12 dead on. That\\\u0027s what I do, works like a charm every time.
