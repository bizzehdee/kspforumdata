On the one hand, it spares you from having to explain every aspect of the world to your readers. On the other hand, it limits you to the general tone and rules of that world. When you take the Kerbals out of their normal setting (and in this case place them in a heavy sci-fi, combat focused environment) you lose all of the advantages of borrowing the world for your story, and wind up keeping most of the baggage. Kerbal Future is not a bad read, but I think it would be much better if you dropped the Kerbals entirely and used something of your own making instead.

Using characters of your own making is one way of getting your story to stand out a bit from the crowd. Second, those other stories have taken a lot of liberties with these characters, and your readers will arrive at \u003Cem\u003Eyour\u003C/em\u003E story with their own preconceptions. The problem is, each reader will have a different \u0022default\u0022 view of the characters. Some may naturally \u0022read\u0022 Jeb as a steely eyed missile Kerb, others as a shrewd businessman or even as a feckless, disaster prone screw up. Using the Big Three means spending a lot of time reinforcing your own version of the characters, and that\u0027s a lot of extra work that can be avoided by just using original characters right from the beginning. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, for the hedging!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is entirely possible that Bill, Bob and Jeb are not going to be major characters in your story. They don\u0027t appear in your latest chapter, and it does kind of feel like maybe we\u0027re pulling away from them. And I think that\u0027s fine. We start with vanilla KSP (which will mean different things to different readers, but in this case that doesn\u0027t matter), one of Bill\u0027s experiments literally gets away from him, and it goes on to have a life, and a story, of its own. And if the Big Three appear right at the beginning and again at the end to sort of anchor the whole thing, I think that would work out nicely. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I can\u0027t tell you how you should write this.
