After reinstalling the mods i had deleted, i booted up the x64 bit version of KSP on steam and halfway through it loading, like with the 1.3 version, it crashed! I have no idea why it did, since i sadly have no idea what the crash logs mean (as in i don\u0027t know what any of the computer mumbo-jumbo means in the crash logs), So i\u0027m asking for help with the crashes and the crash log so i can fix the problem\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/sh/dm4qxkfe0055n2c/AACYwFZcdTlN4_ZpRSmLO1h5a?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/dm4qxkfe0055n2c/AACYwFZcdTlN4_ZpRSmLO1h5a?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease help, please.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-29T08:25:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s probably crashing because you already updated some of your mods (at least Module Manager). You generally need the versions that were made for 1.2.2 if you want to use 1.2.2 and the versions that were made for 1.3 if you want to use 1.3. They are not backwards compatible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
