We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve \n\npartnered with the B612 Foundation to bring you this mod which will give you \n\nfour new parts, a new experiment, and a unique contract.\n\nThe Sentinel Infrared Telescope mimics the real world [**Sentinel mission**](http://sentinelmission.org/) being \n\nplanned by the B612 Foundation, which plans to map 90% of the larger \n\nasteroids threatening Earth\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s orbit sometime between 2018 and 2024. Due to \n\nsun glare it is difficult for telescopes on Earth to observe objects passing on \n\nthe planet\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s day side. Deploying a telescope into a solar orbit near Venus and \n\nfacing it away from the Sun, back towards Earth\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s orbit, would cover that blind \n\nspot.\n\nYour mission will be to recreate this mission profile in Kerbal Space Program, \n\ndeploying a telescope around Eve\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s orbit. When deployed with an antenna and a \n\npower source between Eve and Kerbin, aligned to face away from the Sun, and \n\nactivated, the telescope will begin to map the orbit of the outer planet in a 200\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 \n\nvision cone for passing asteroids.\n\nOther than the telescope itself, you will have three new parts to make your \n\nunmanned missions more enjoyable:\n\n- The HECS-2 Probe Core comes with integrated batteries and SAS, to make   \nbuilding a compact Sentinel probe much easier.\n- The OX-STAT-XL Photovoltaic Panels are a much larger version of the stock   \nsolar panels, for larger probes.\n- The HG-55 High Gain Antenna can transmit larger amounts of data than any   \nof the existing antennae in the game.\n\nThis pack also includes a long-term contract to map asteroids around Kerbin as \n\nwell as other planets that match various specifications. It differs from other \n\ncontracts in that it encourages the use of existing infrastructure. It does not \n\nrequire a new vessel for each contract, and each scan is faster with more \n\ntelescopes deployed.\n\nGet it now at [**Curse**](http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/232196-asteroid-day)!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-30T17:16:56Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2015 05:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KasperVld**"}]}
