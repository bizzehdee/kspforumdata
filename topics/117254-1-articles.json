One of its parts is the short Mk2 cargo bay. This cargo bay is ruining the whole thing because it suddenly, for no reason, gets very hot and causes the parts in it and/or attached to its ends, which can\u0027t take that much heat, to explode. I\u0027m seeking a workaround to this problem. I\u0027ve got Claw\u0027s Stock Bug Fixes but can\u0027t remember if it has one for this issue. If it does, it\u0027s not working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem unfolds as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Launch the rocket. It goes up normally and smoothly, with little if any flames appearing during ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. At MEKO (usually about 40km), F11 shows the entire ship the dark red, can\u0027t-get-any-cooler color. The air is getting thinner, there are neither flames nor mach effects showing, and the engines aren\u0027t running, so the rocket should in fact be cooling off as it coasts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Suddenly, at about 60-65km, the F11 colors show the cargo bay, and ONLY the cargo bay, ramp up to an incandescent yellow color in about 1/2 a second. This causes parts in or adjacent to the cargo bay to explode. Once a part has exploded, the cargo bay itself then instantly drops back down the cold red color. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe above is what happens at Kerbin. I also HyperEdited the ship to Duna, landed it there, and had the same problem during takeoff. Somewhere between MEKO and the top of the atmosphere, the cargo bay superheats and explodes its contents and/or neighbors. And at Duna, the it got neither flames nor mach effects going up or down and was always cold red in the F11 view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never had this problem with SSTOs. The only difference I can see between this lander and an SSTO, as far as the cargo bay is concerned, is that on the lander the door of the cargo bay is crossed by a long telescoping ladder. The ladder is attached to the part above the cargo bay and no part of the ladder comes in contact with the bay or its doors, but it\u0027s there. The reason for the ladder is not only so Kerbals can reach the ground but also, if I open the bay, run the experiments, then lower the ladder, the Kerbal can grab the science data from the experiments in the bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Side note: Kerbal jetpacks are now insufficient for flying on Duna so your Duna landers must have ladders. Which is a bummer because how are we going to get up on top of the Face now?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, is there a way work around this problem?

The weird thing is, the Kraken-heat here demands a sacrifice. Once it destroys a part, it goes away. So IMHO it\u0027s better for something minor inside the bay to explode rather than one of the main structural parts outside the bay on either end.

There was no clipping in the bay. The bay originally contained the following items:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Surface attached to the front bulkhead (rear surface of probe core): 2 each USI small radial supply and mulch packs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Stacked on the rear internal node: A 1.25m reaction wheel, a Science Jr., and a Goo\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this arrangement, the probe core exploded during launch between MEKO and the top of the atmosphere, knocking the cockpit off the ship. Sic transit Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I made the following changes (again, no clipping):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Replaced the Mk2 probe core with a 2.5m probe core on the far side of the adaptor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Replaced the 1.25m reaction wheel with a 2.5m unit on the far side of the adaptor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Had the internal stack just be the Science Jr. with the Goo on top, and radially attached the USI packs to the Science Jr.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this configuration, it survived liftoff from Kerbin but on liftoff from Duna, the Science Jr. exploded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe weird thing is, I\u0027ve built horizontally launched SSTOs with bays arranged just like this and haven\u0027t had any overheating problems. Another strange thing is that this happens when the ship isn\u0027t warping, or running engines. It\u0027s just coasting without any flames showing, and F11 shows everything cold red. Then for no reason at all, the cargo bay suddenly gets very hot very fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Claw\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Claw\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMy bug fixes don\u0027t include this one.
