This happened when I updated both NH and Kopernicus at the same time. The change in velocities made me think that maybe the ships had been loaded from the persistent file and inherited the speed that they would have at that distance from the Sun (IE default config of Kerbol system), before Kopernicus might have rebuilt the files for the planets they had initially been orbiting (in an alternate system).\n\nI have a test save with probes orbiting bodies as well as in the same orbit as those bodies (IE orbiting Mun and also in the same orbit as Mun). The craft names are the orbital information, PE/AP/Velocity, so I can easily see if they have been changed at all. In a test install of KSP with just NH\u002BKopernicus I have not been able to break these orbits on purpose. I can cleanly update From NH 1.6.1 to 1.6.3 and/or Kopernicus 0.2.4 to 0.3.1 with any version in between and everything stays as it should. I even tried rolling back a version or two and it did not change my orbits.\n\nI can see why this issue still persists. My next test is to try updating older versions of NH\u002BKopernicus to newer versions on a Wednesday while standing on one foot and loading KSP onto my rightside monitor- it becomes difficult to account for all the variables.\n\n@Sigma88: I do not have any other planet or rescale packs."},{"CreatedByName":"Sigma88","CreatedById":113260,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T13:25:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E @Sigma88: I do not have any other planet or rescale packs.\n\nok, I\u0027ll try to reproduce the issue this evening with just hyperedit, NH and kopernicus then"},{"CreatedByName":"Nori","CreatedById":41334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T13:28:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I wanted to check out this bug too, the thing I\u0027d like to know is, have anyone seen the bug with only NH installed?\n\u003E (no other planet packs, or rescale packs like kerbol2x)\n\nI have a lot of mods, but only NH uses Kopernicus.
