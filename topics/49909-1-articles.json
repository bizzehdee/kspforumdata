I think another tab in the research center with a list of all the collected data might be a good way to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also noticed that you can get all sorts of information from the tracking station that you would not know before experimentation, like atmospheric stats (using the little \u0022i\u0022 button once a planet is selected). I think it would be cool if those things had question marks on them in the tracking station until you collected the data. This would act as another mechanism to see what new data you need to gather. Perhaps the information screens could come up bigger with a picture, the description, and all the stats (with the unknown ones missing until data collected).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, thats it. I think this would be a cool addition to polish (thats polish like shine, not polish like nationality) the experience, especially for newer players who may not fully understand what options they even have available to them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
