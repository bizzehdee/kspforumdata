Ive been trying to build a Duna lander and return ship, however im struggling with weight.\n\nIm using stock parts and have a DeltaV map showing me the fuel needed to achieve each stage. I can build the lander and the stages to get to Duna and back to Kerbin but i cant seem to get the launch stage dv enough without building a huge stage which doesnt take off or simply crashes.\n\nMy question is should I build half of the ship, launch it to orbit then launch the second part and dock them, then go to Duna or should I persevere? Ive watched videos on how to do this but these used mods which im not.\n\nThankyou in advance ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Teilnehmer","CreatedById":143330,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T07:59:23Z","Content":"I haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t done comprehensive calculations, but some evaluations using [Meithan\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s graphs](http://meithan.x10.mx/KSP/engines/) show that you want to go two-stage only if you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re heavy enough.\n\n[table=width: 500, class: grid]\n\n[tr]\n\n [td]Payload mass, t[/td]\n\n [td]2-stage rocket mass, t[/td]\n\n [td]1-stage rocket mass, t[/td]\n\n[/tr]\n\n[tr]\n\n [td]1[/td]\n\n [td]~2.7[/td]\n\n [td]~2.7[/td]\n\n[/tr]\n\n[tr]\n\n [td]4[/td]\n\n [td]~10[/td]\n\n [td]~11[/td]\n\n[/tr]\n\n[tr]\n\n [td]16[/td]\n\n [td]~34[/td]\n\n [td]~39[/td]\n\n[/tr]\n\n[/table]\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-11T08:32:37Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2015 08:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Teilnehmer**"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T09:16:05Z","Content":"This is my latest Duna ship, which isn\u0027t much bigger than the one I use for going to Mun.\n\n![dun10201.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/dun10201.jpg)\n\nIt uses a modded capsule on the lander, but it shouldn\u0027t work any different with the standard 2-man capsule.\n\nMore pics from the complete mission can be seen [here.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123408-Duna-in-1-0-2)"},{"CreatedByName":"DBowman","CreatedById":122106,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T09:22:15Z","Content":"You plan to do it \u0027Apollo style\u0027?

Which is what makes KSP so fun. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nIt\u0027s not super hard to do a single-launch mission that can go to Duna and back; if you time your launch window right, the ejection from LKO -\u003E Duna is not all that much bigger than the ejection from LKO -\u003E Mun. It\u0027s true that you\u0027ll need more lander power to get back off the surface of Duna and head home... but on the other hand, you can aerobrake \u002B parachute down to the surface, which you can\u0027t do on the Mun. It\u0027s not quite a wash, you\u0027ll still need a heftier dV for Duna than for the Mun, but it\u0027s not insanely higher.\n\nThe docking approach is, as you say, fun. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) By all means, go for that if it works for you!\n\nThere\u0027s a third option which is a compromise between single-launch and build-in-orbit: orbital refueling. In this approach, you build what is essentially a single-launch-to-Duna ship, *but it only has enough dV to get to LKO*.\n\nBasically, your initial booster only has to get it onto a suborbital trajectory; when you drop the booster, you use your interplanetary-transfer-and-Duna-lander piece to finish the work of getting itself to LKO. If you design it just right, what you end up with is a ship in LKO that has all the *hardware* for going to Duna and back, but it\u0027s completely empty of *fuel* because it used it all up in getting to LKO. Then you dock a tanker to it, fill it up, and send it on its way.\n\nNice things about this approach:\n\n- It keeps your launchpad weight down because you don\u0027t need to cram so much dV onto the craft. Depending on how you design it, it may be that the only thing you need to discard on ascent is some big SRBs.\n\n- You still get the fun of docking, because you need to refuel the craft in LKO.\n\n- Fuel tankers are a re-usable resource, if you build up your infrastructure appropriately (which is a fun project in itself).\n\n- Fun at design time; \u0022how can I optimize this design so that I have just enough fuel to hit LKO, but still be well-designed for the Duna round trip\u0022.\n\nAnyway, it\u0027s another option to consider."}]}
