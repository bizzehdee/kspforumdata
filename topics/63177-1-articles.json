I am a bit of a new streamer but have been playing KSP for a long time now. I prefer to operate clean debris free re-usable space programs. Currently Bearospace Industries is using TAC Lifesupport, Biomass, Kethane ,as well as numerous other mods. The Wayfarer Interplanetary Reconnaissance Program operates out of Horizon Station, a self sustaining biosphere in geostationary orbit in phase with KSC for easy rendezvous from ground. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe program is currently in the middle of it\u0027s WF-1 shake down run to solar orbit and back to the Mun to test the low-g command module. Then it\u0027s off to Horizon Station to prepare for the upcoming WF-2 Duna Fly by mission. If any of this interest you then by all means come view my stream! I try to stream often so if it is down feel free to try again later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.twitch.tv/untamedzer0/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.twitch.tv/untamedzer0/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s30.postimg.org/lsr0dpb8h/OBS_2014_02_13_21_16_12_491.png\u0022 alt=\u0022OBS_2014_02_13_21_16_12_491.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
