I also have 2 B9PS serious warnings, but i dont think they are related since ive had them for longer than the crashes are appearing, and just ignored them. i first suspected it was an issue of too many mods, so i removed a few (i know the 240 i have installed now are still quite much, but i have succesfully run installs with 300\u002B mods since i have quite a beefy machine, so it\u0027d really surprise me if its that), but it still keeps happening.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLogs:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FWEGS5N6zY2blcs5KutUP50foZUr74zi?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FWEGS5N6zY2blcs5KutUP50foZUr74zi?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for any help in advance \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
