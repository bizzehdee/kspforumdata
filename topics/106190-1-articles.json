Also, notice that the fins are below the center of mass which helps with stability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake a look at what happens when the rocket is moving through the air:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022PZXzUIz.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PZXzUIz.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you can see, the air is coming straight on. Air flow induces some drag at the nose, and some drag on the fins. Now, what happens when you try to tip this rocket over? Take a look:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Qt336Pd.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Qt336Pd.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the rocket tries to rotate around its center of mass the fins expose more surface area to the air-flow. This increases the drag on the fins, which is stronger than the drag on the nose. The result is the tail-drag pulls the tail back in line. The rocket is stable and will point its nose into the wind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPart 2:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EAn Unstable Rocket\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, consider the following rocket:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Uaf4EPI.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Uaf4EPI.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNotice that the drag is mostly on the nose. So long as the air-flow is in line with the center of mass, this isn\u0027t an issue. However, if you tip the rocket over, even just a little you end up in this situation:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022yMWuP7p.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yMWuP7p.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is more drag on top of the center of mass than below it! Tip over far enough and the torque from this nose-heavy drag flips your rocket around the center of mass because the drag near the nose has more leverage than the drag near the tail. You lose control, pull out your hair, and swear that KSP is the worst game ever!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it\u0027s really just natural, real-world forces at work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPart 3:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ECoping With These Forces\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe best solution is to mount tail-fins on your rocket so the drag near the bottom is greater than the drag near the nose. Remember, as the rocket tries to turn sideways, the tail-fins actually end up producing more drag because of the exposed surface area. One issue with this is it\u0027s harder to steer your rocket where you want it to go, until you get fins with control surfaces built in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other solution is to make sure that your nose is pointed \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Emostly\u003C/span\u003E into the wind at all times. Any little bit of tilt induces a little nose-heavy drag; without any control input the rocket wants to flip. But the torque from the nose-heavy drag is small enough for the engine gimbal and/or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to overcome so long as you don\u0027t tip too far, e.g. less than 5-degrees from your flight path.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPart 4:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ESpeed Kills!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne really important consideration for dealing with air-flow is, the faster you go, the more air-flow -\u0026gt; the more drag -\u0026gt; and the more torque trying to affect your rocket!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you use tail-fins this is helpful, to a point, but it does make it harder to steer the rocket for an efficient ascent profile. Without tail-fins the rocket becomes more unstable the faster it goes as the torque on the nose from any minor level of tipping increases. Once you\u0027re clear of the atmosphere, or at least high enough where it doesn\u0027t have much impact (about 35km) you won\u0027t have to worry about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUntil you reach 35km, though, it\u0027s best to keep your rocket at reasonable speeds. Remember speed = air-flow = drag = torque. Result: Less Speed; Less Torque. I recommend you keep your rocket below 500m/s until you reach 35km. I usually fly mine at about 450m/s or so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EAdemdum\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPart 5:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EShifting Center of Mass\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs your rocket ascends it expends propellant. Since propellant is used from the top of the rocket first, the center of mass will gradually shift downwards, closer to the tail. This means that any torque on the nose from induced drag will have more leverage as the rocket ascends. This explains why, sometimes, the rocket seems to be under control one moment and more flippy the next, even though your deflection from the air-flow remains the same (say, between 5 and 10 degrees). Add the shifting center of mass to increasing speeds, and you have a rocket that is becoming more and more touchy by the moment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this tutorial helps!

a spaceplane expert, but at least part of the problem is that any aerodynamic surfaces ahead of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E of the craft reduce\u00A0the stability of the craft, requiring more command authority if the craft is not pointed directly prograde. \u00A0Now, the closer to prograde you are, the weaker this is, so if you can do a true gravity turn (aiming prograde for everything except the pitch maneuver), then you\u0027ll probably be much more likely to be able to launch this craft without the huge tail fins. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you find yourself having to push the nose over closer to the horizon, then you might be able to manage this by doing a more aggressive pitch maneuver or doing it at a lower speed/altitude. \u00A0Lowering your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is another alternative that might help. \u00A0This gives gravity more

I do like this thread, I have to question why all the drawings only work if prograde is straight up and the rocket has an angle of inclination. \u00A0Your rocket can flip out quite well while following the prograde vector (and thus have drag straight backwards, while gravity is some other direction (effectively straight down)).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeiss

\u003Cem\u003Edoesn\u0027t matter in any way\u003C/em\u003E to stability once the ship is off the launch pad.\u00A0 What does matter is thrust vector, lift and drag and their balance relative to the center of mass.\u00A0 If you\u0027re even a fraction of a degree off prograde (so the airflow is coming from a tiny angle off the body\u0027s longitudinal axis), the nose will produce lift and drag that tend to upset the rocket -- and unless there\u0027s a restoring force, either from greater fin lift (after accounting for lever arm from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E) or from another source of torque (vectored thrust, reaction wheels, or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E), your rocket will tumble.\u00A0 If the stack flexes enough to see, this will be much worse, because it will also oscillate and may resonate with the speed at which the motors can gimbal, which can even cause a rocket to break up in flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027ve flown model rockets and paid attention to their stability requirements, this won\u0027t be a mystery to you.\u00A0 Those are virtually all stabilized by lifting fins, though a few are stabilized by drag from a conical shroud or even just by having the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E far enough forward that the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E of the body is behind it (for a plain cylinder, it\u0027s generally about 1/3 back from the nose, until angle of attack exceeds roughly 30 degrees, then it\u0027s about halfway).\u00A0 In KSP, we also have gimballed engines (i.e. vectored thrust), as well as reaction wheels and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, so we can make rockets that are stable in flight (at least during boost phase, for gimballing) without fins.\u00A0 NASA doesn\u0027t use fins, nor does Space-X, because they add mass and drag, hence costing fuel, but their stability control is a bit better than ours.\u00A0 They manage to do everything with gimballing during boost, but in KSP many rockets seem to require \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E to keep them headed the right direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
