I don\u0027t have a lot of time because some things came up, so I just did a basic test for Mars\u0027 mass. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mNfy24D.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere is the result.\u003C/a\u003E I don\u0027t know the mass of Mars off the top of my head, but I assume this is what NathanKell says it is*. One thing I wanted to check (and will check once I get more time) is getting data about Earth. I remember reading on the RSS github that KSP requires the home planet to have Kerbin as an internal name for anything to work. So I\u0027m wondering if, when specifically calling values for Earth, you would need to refer to it as Kerbin or if it would use Earth, as it\u0027s seen in the GUI. I was planning on testing this too really quick-like, but I got ahead of my self and quit out of the game after taking that screenshot, and when the game takes 7-10 minutes to boot because of my potato laptop...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*After a very quick google, it looks like the value Kerbulator popped out is 2 powers of ten higher than Wikipedia\u0027s, but it\u0027s 8 powers of ten higher than Duna\u0027s, so I assume the number discrepancy is probably between RSS and Wikipedia, and Kerbulator isn\u0027t messing anything up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WolfgangAxel","CreatedById":106747,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T20:56:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProbably my final update on the RSS stuff- using Earth gives results, and Kerbin gives an error. The only thing that causes problems is the sun- you have to use Kerbol to get numbers from it, but if you\u0027ve got that rename coded in, that\u0027s not surprising.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps somehow!
