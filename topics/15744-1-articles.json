In order to make up for that, this challenge is my next goal...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the Orbital \u0026amp; Planetary Construction mod, construct a space dock of any design, launch it into a 400 km orbit and use it to launch a replica of the ISS with the \u0027SpaceBuilt\u0027 part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPreferably, you should deliver every part that you use for the ISS, but if you\\\u0027re just interested in putting the ISS into orbit, you can deliver \u0027SpareParts\u0027 instead. For the ISS, I used the ExPI mod, but you can use any mods for station parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor an added challenge, try delivering the parts with a semi-reusable space plane!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
