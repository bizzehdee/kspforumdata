The radius of the cone at any given point is proportional to the amount of structural material needed to support all the weight above that point. A cone works for the model shape (even though idealized structures have a slope that gradually decreases towards the base) because real rockets are built to designed safety margins- and the statistical error of deviations in construction becomes smaller and smaller in absolute terms the thicker the thicker the walls/ larger the structure. Plus, real rocketry materials are so strong the change in slope is relatively small over the height of the idealized model to begin with. It would be different if you were building out of something like soap or soggy cardboard. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt should quickly be noted that the upper third of the cone only contains only a tiny proportion of the total structural material, whereas the lower third contains far more material than the two upper two thirds combined. The degree of taper of the cone is proportional to the strength-to-weight ratio of the material. However, the effect of increasing wall thickness on fuel tank cost with any reasonable-sized rocket is relatively trivial- especially since the cost-per-mm does not increase linearly (thinner walls are relatively much more expensive to construct per kilogram of material than thicker walls, due to manufacturing costs.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlayers using larger-diameter fuel tanks for the upper stages of a rocket also cannot be taken for a given- perhaps a player is launching a large, EMPTY fuel depot, for instance- which will only be filled in zero-G. And the strength the rocket needs to be built to increases with its TWR. Plus, on top of all this, real rockets make use of advanced composite materials and structures like honeycomb-walls that have strengths that are different from that of the underlying material (Metamaterials, basically), so it\u0027s probably not worth trying to work through all the possible complexities. \u003Cstrong\u003EAll in all, I think it\u0027s best to ignore the effect of increasing wall thickness with part diameter on rocket cost.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would be \u003Cstrong\u003Emore than happy\u003C/strong\u003E to help you figure out/implement the proper equations to apply for price and mass-scaling for each of the different shapes available in Procedural Parts (PM me if you\u0027re interested in my help).

As NK said, I\u0027ve already started working on it, and while I quite like your ideas on how it ought to be done, a core part of this mod is to keep it as close to stock as possible, which unfortunately means slightly less consistency, but gives the mod a more balanced feel with the game.
