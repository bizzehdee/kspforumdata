It\u0027s a satellite lofter. What I like about it is that it can be flown pretty much by a checklist, as each stage of the rocket corresponds to a stage of what you need to do to make it orbit.

Decide at what altitude you wish to orbit (It will do 100km very nicely, as I demonstrate in the pictures) and calculate the velocity you will need. Maintain your velocity as necessary for your orbit, and, as needed, pitch to straight up or straight down and burn to adjust vertical velocity until you have a stable orbit. During this time you should be able to leave roll and yaw alone (or make very minor adjustments) and use pitch and throttle to settle into an orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/peCNQh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022peCNQh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbit achieved: separate satellite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/etgHVh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022etgHVh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/01Ni7h.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002201Ni7h.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeorbitting strategy is up to you, I recommend retroburning to enter a hohmann transfer orbit to at or just under 35km. If you do this when the launch facility is directly below you, but on the far side of the planet, you should have enough fuel left to maneuver into a landing back at the pad, though I have yet to get closer than having it on the horizon.
