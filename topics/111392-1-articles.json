I recently thought I\u0027d put together a simple rocket to go to Mun; no separate CSM/LEM or rendezvous and docking here. Just a basic lander with enough dV to land on Mun and return to Kerbin, on top of a two stage rocket for getting to LKO and a munar insertion stage. Boy oh boy. On launch of the first iteration of my design I thought someone had snuck in to the VAB and replaced all the rocket parts with imitations made of rubber! This thing would have given a bendy bus a run for its money in a \u0027how close to your tail can you get your nose\u0027 competition.\n\nAfter a few tweaks and design alterations, I now have a rocket that fulfils the original design brief, and pretty much behaves itself in flight, though I have still had to use rather more struts than I would have liked. But that first flight is indelibly printed in my memory, and all Kudos to Jeb and the rest of the crew for not hitting the abort button when prudence dictated that\u0027s exactly what they should have done."},{"CreatedByName":"TrooperCooper","CreatedById":110599,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T16:39:05Z","Content":"Yeah I dislike that game mechanic as well.

Admittedly, I did resolve the problem eventually, but I think it would be nice if a mod like KJR was standard, as I am now aware that if I build a rocket that I\u0027d like to share because it flies perfectly, the first person to download it that doesn\u0027t have KJR installed could be in for a nightmare ride."},{"CreatedByName":"marza","CreatedById":11730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T20:27:03Z","Content":"What was the TWR of your rocket at launch?\n\nI don\u0027t have KJR installed and have seen my share of spaghetti rockets. I\u0027ve found that if struts are not effective, another thing to consider would be to adjust engine gimbal (as mentioned above) or to simply slow down. Every spaghetti rocket I\u0027ve had was due to a heavy payload/configuration that has a large amount of drag at the top of the rocket and a powerful first stage with a TWR of 2.5 or more. When the rocket in question has a mass of a few hundred tonnes, the forces acting on it are mind boggling huge. Keeping your TWR at no more than 2 during launch will get most, if not all, stock spaghetti rockets out of the atmosphere."},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T21:22:22Z","Content":"Speed isn\u0027t the major problem.

I\u0027ll demonstrate it with a tall 2.5 m rocket.\n\n![tall_rocket_1.jpeg](http://jltsiren.kapsi.fi/ksp/1.0/tall_rocket_1.jpeg)\n\nThe rocket goes supersonic at a low altitude, but it doesn\u0027t wobble too much at that point. The problems start later in the ascent, when the center of mass rises above the decoupler. As long as the center of mass was within the same relatively rigid region of the rocket as the engines, everything went fine. Bad things happen, when the engines try to rotate the rocket around a point they aren\u0027t rigidly attached to.\n\nLet\u0027s make a small change to the rocket and add a probe core to the lower stage.\n\n![tall_rocket_2.jpeg](http://jltsiren.kapsi.fi/ksp/1.0/tall_rocket_2.jpeg)\n\nNow the rocket starts bending as soon as I start the gravity turn. It seems that having many joints close to each other is a bad idea, if the lower part is pushing the upper part too hard. We can solve this by reducing the number of joints, the TWR, or the mass above the joints.\n\nLet\u0027s fix the rocket.\n\n![tall_rocket_3.jpeg](http://jltsiren.kapsi.fi/ksp/1.0/tall_rocket_3.jpeg)\n\nNow it goes to space just fine."},{"CreatedByName":"Bev7787","CreatedById":136501,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T23:22:31Z","Content":"I\u0027m building a Saturn V.

So your root part is the command pod up top for instance. Imagine holding a penicil at the tip and trying to control it. Now imagine holding the same pencil at the center and now control it. Much easier and more stable. No splitting of the ship and im not sure what you mean by manual page. With the root part gadget or whatever its called tool in the VAB. After your finished construction flip on the CoM indicator to see where its at. ( will most likely be in the first stage fuel tank so thats the one you want rooted ) Hit the root part button, click on a part next to the part you wish to be the new root then select the part. Now your craft is rooted from the center out.\n\nIm not sure of the technicalities and forgive me if that explanation is a bit foggy. But it works really well. Combine that with KJR and its perfect.
