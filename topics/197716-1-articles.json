So you shouldnt need to be forcing it, unless you are on a pretty old version of KSP, or on a different OS than Windoze?\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd yes, it should be safe to switch mid-save. As to performance, I ALWAYS had better performance forcing Dx11, than running Dx9... but again, if you are on a newer version of KSP, I dont think you\u0027ll see any change, since KSP now natively runs Dx11 anyways...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe way to tell, IIRC, is it says right at the top of the KSP.log, which version of Dx is being run for that instance of the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-10-27T17:36:25Z\u0022 title=\u002210/27/2020 05:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 27, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Stone Blue\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
