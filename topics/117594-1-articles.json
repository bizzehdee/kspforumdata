Engine specifications, max payload, vehicle mass, and burn times are equal to released information. Fuel mass and fuel mix ratio are close to estimations on the web. It can get the max payload of 13,000 kgs to 125 km orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Falcon Heavy has some serious issues with FAR. the Falcon 9 has an approximate initial TWR of 1.2. The Falcon Heavy based directly on concept drawings has a TWR of 1.7. It quickly gets to 300 m/s and promptly explodes due to atmospheric stresses. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFalcon Heavy V2 came as a result of the Far problem. I added more fuel till the initial TWR was 1.2. This allowed me to get the max payload of 53,000 kgs to 125 km orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the question is: Is there some way to keep the size of the Falcon Heavy Boosters closer to the concept?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, version 3 was a logical progression of the technology. With 6 boosters instead of the heavies 2 boosters. I was able to get 130 kgs to 125km orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eIFNTJ7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022eIFNTJ7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T12:06:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStraight from SpaceX\u0027s website at \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.spacex.com/falcon-heavy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.spacex.com/falcon-heavy\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Shortly after liftoff the center core engines are throttled down.
