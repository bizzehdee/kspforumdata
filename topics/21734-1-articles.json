He helped design the Nike Zeus missile so in his honor i decided to build\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E a jet(ironically not having to with him at all except for the fact he was a rocket scientist). I probably should of made a rocket but i\u0027m allot better at making jets than i am at making rockets. Its easy to fly can go up to around 130 m/s. No mods all vanilla. It is a little hard to land. It is very fuel efficient. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft File Coming Soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-10-09T01:35:52Z\u0022 title=\u002210/09/2012 01:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 9, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by valkireace\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CkGordon","CreatedById":51332,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-08T23:14:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks cool. I tried to make a jet once and failed. I couldn\u0027t figure out how to get the flappy things to stick to the edge of the wing instead of ontop. Ya... flappy things... deal with it.
