And in fact, SpaceX tested first stage return with their last launch in late September. The first stage separated from the second stage and payload, then re-lighted to push it back toward the launch site, then re-lighted again to slow its descent before splashing down in the ocean. That attempt didn\u0027t work perfectly because the rocket was spinning too quickly after the second re-light and it splashed down hard, but SpaceX thinks it has all the pieces now to successfully return the first stage to a landing pad by the end of 2014. This will allow SpaceX to save both time and money, since they hope to be able to refuel and relaunch a used first stage within 2 weeks, and the construction of the first stage represents about 75% of the total cost of rocket construction.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Meithan","CreatedById":76123,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T16:44:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bobhendly\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bobhendly\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat was such a freaky view, it almost looked like a 3D Animation!
