I wonder, is there a mod that tells you there\u0027s an asteroid heading towards Kerbin, and you need to deflect it, or else you get a huge fine, or get some buildings in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E destroyed?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry if this was asked before...

As far as I know, there is no such mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-13T12:05:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, the number of random asteroids with a periapsis below Kerbin\u0027s surface is higher than you think. I get them all the time - it\u0027s like one in 20 or so, if I were to blindly guesstimate. One time I even saw two at once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you wanted such a mod to be sensibly playable, you\u0027d first have to edit the way that asteroids are spawned near Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
