I was going to introduce a proper hydraulic piston with this update, but due to normal parts having unlimited torque there is little use for it. \n\nAnother problem with hydraulic piston is that in order to position it precisely for different loads (if you model it physically) you need to fine tune its PID controller, and I doubt any of you would want to do it for each set of different pistons for each different craft, so I let this idea rest for a while. \n\nI can at some point add the suspension spring and damping parameters to translating parts as optional parameters, all the necessary code is already in IR 2.0 codebase, just disabled for now, because it is not properly tested."},{"CreatedByName":"Darael","CreatedById":162614,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-24T16:50:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 minute ago, Ziw said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Is it [toolbar] updated to 1.1?
