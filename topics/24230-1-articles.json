Here\u0027s some stuff I made, you tell me what you think I do... Actually, here, let\u0027s play a game. I\u0027ll list a bunch of craft I have, as they are/were named, and you try to identify what a few of them are, are they rovers? Satellites? Launch vehicles? Stations? Planes? AIRSHIPS?

During engineer phase I come out with some of those names, but I always add a general description in brackets on the side. Something like (interplanetary Explorer) or (munar Lander) fit perfectly to me to catch the utility of some old and forgot design. Also my habit is to rename the vehicles on the pad, maybe giving a name like \u0022Juno X-1\u0022 to the first test flight, and adding a mere numerical in progressive order, apart from flyby missions that are named like \u0022argo Eve 1\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
