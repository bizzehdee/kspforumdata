Open the .craft file and edit the line \u0027type\u0027 from SPH to VAB. Save it and you are done.

All the symmetries in the VAB are radial, whereas the only symmetry in the SPH is bilateral. So for example, in the SPH you can put wheels symmetrically on the underside in a way that\\\u0027s right/left symmetrical but not up/down symmetrical (no wheels on top), then transfer it to the VAB and build a vertical rocket under it. It\\\u0027s not a new trick, but a very handy one to share. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vespasianus","CreatedById":26881,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-01T11:14:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWho cares about symmetry? xD\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
