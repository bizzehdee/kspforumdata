It made me look at the real world Lunar Roving Vehicle. 1 piece, unfold and you are ready to go. Do you think there would be any way to do something similar to this ?\n\u003E \n\nWith the stock wheels, absolutely impossible for quite a few reasons.\n\n-IF- (and that is a big if at this point in time) we can get a custom wheel solution (or Unity fixes the wheels on their end... highly unlikely), then sure, would be doable.  I would love to have a small/compact/deployable rover (pref. that doesn\u0027t need \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to assemble).\n\nInitial geometry on the next few engines that I\u0027ll be (re)doing -- SuperDraco (the tiny thing, center left), LMAE (top right), LMDE (bottom right).  As these are all pressure-fed engines, there won\u0027t be too much more to them than a bell, some fuel lines, and some gimbal actuators on the LMDE (neither SD nor LMAE have gimbal).\n\nHard to believe that the tiny little SuperDraco puts out nearly twice the thrust of the LMDE, at a fraction of the dry mass; but that is technological advances for you.  Of course, I could have the size of it completely wrong... the only specification I could find was for it stated that it had a 20cm nozzle.  I could also have the thrust wrong (73kn), as it was unspecified if that was for a single engine or for a pair of engines/complete engine pod.  \n\n![AN1vMgO.png](http://i.imgur.com/AN1vMgO.png)\n\nAlso found a decently detailed (and free) lunar-lander model that I may work on adapting/using as a basis to create my own model from (wouldn\u0027t use that model as-is, but use it as a basis to create my own... often the available models are constructed terrible for game use)... so who knows, might also have an LEM at some point.\n\nThis weekends\u0027 release will include the new LR-81-8048 \u0026 8096 engine models (no textures) and deprecate the existing LR-81(no number) placeholder.  The placeholder will still be in-game for a few weeks, but will be unavailable in the editor (existing craft must be converted to use the new engines before the old one is removed entirely)."},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-08T18:25:24Z","Content":"Note though, that the Super Draco is designed for sea level operation, and on top of that is very under-expanded to allow for deep throttling.

So even without technological advances, you\u0027re looking at a lot less nozzle mass.\n\u003E \n\nGood points you bring up.  I also just noted that the SuperDraco has far lower \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E than the Lunar engines (SD = ~240, LE = \u003E 300), which certainly supports the \u0027optimized for atmosphere use\u0027.  Has a fairly high mass-flow for such a tiny engine as well.  Double checked my thrust numbers, and they do seem to line up with what should be specified for a single engine.  For the mass, I mostly just approximated it for a ~115 V-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E as I couldn\u0027t really find any data on that either.\n\nMostly I would intend it as a replacement for the deprecated/removed LC sets of engines; tiny engine with high enough thrust to be used for landing.  Sad that its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E is so poor... but there has to be tradeoffs somewhere for the rest of its stellar stats.  A vacuum-optimized version could likely be created, increasing thrust slightly and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E substantially, but it would lower the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E and would still end up with a fairly large nozzle/bell on it removing much of its \u0027size advantage\u0027."}]}
