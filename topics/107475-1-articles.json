Use the satellite to determine a high concentration of ore.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have scanned the moon or planet and transfered the data back to Kerbin (you\u0027ll get 10 science) you\u0027ll be able to overlay ore concentration onto the moon or planet you scanned.

You can adjust your M700 Survey Scanner to hone in on a good mining operation location.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Cutoff\u002B to raise the minimum ore concentration in order for the overlay to display.

On the surface, concentrations will vary by a few percentage points. In order to find the most ideal location for a mining base, I suggest using a rover with a surface scanner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll want somewhere fairly flat, trying to land a giant mining base on slopes is going to be tricky. The slopes will also block direct sunlight, so if you\u0027re in the inner solar system you want as much sunshine as possible. (This patch also made it so any moon/planet past Dres has really bad solar power generation)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll want something close to the equator. It\u0027ll be easier to land/take off from and it\u0027ll have longer days than if you setup on the poles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can setup your rover to also double as a fuel tanker. Setup the rover so it has a docking bay that can couple with your mining base. If you then design and build ships that can dock with your rover you can export the ore or fuel from the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAttached is a picture of my fuel rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/531766271400674445/6B182D0A0D8033108E57F68815811DFBA8497585/\u0022 alt=\u00226B182D0A0D8033108E57F68815811DFBA8497585\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ESetting up a Mining Base\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027ve picked out a specific location for a mining base it\u0027s time to set it up!

If you want your drills and ISRU to run continuously you\u0027ll need to supply it with a lot of power. Solar generation is great, but when it is night time on the planet or moon you\u0027re on, you\u0027ll need batteries or fuel cells to keep it going.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThink about setting up a mining base that is coupled with a fuel rover. You can use the fuel rover to dock with landing vessels to refuel them, or to use a reusable vessel to transport the fuel to an orbital station.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMake sure to have storage for all the types of fuel you\u0027ll want to produce. The ISRU can make MonoProp, Liquid and Oxidizer. If you don\u0027t have a tank for MonoProp, for instance, you won\u0027t be able to produce it.
