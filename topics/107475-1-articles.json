I wrote a step by step mining guide for Steam and I figured I\u0027d share it here. If you have any questions, additions or feedback please let me know here or on the steam guide and I\u0027ll update and edit as needed.\n\n[http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=437378871](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=437378871)\n\n**Unlocking the Research**\n\nBefore we start an asteroid or extraterrestrial mining operation it is important to unlock the key parts and understand what they do. There are several parts that are utilized for Mining.\n\n**Surface Scanning Module**\n\n![B75309B135B232C135D8AFBDA9D1E91107D4F292](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/531766271400547934/B75309B135B232C135D8AFBDA9D1E91107D4F292/)\n\nThe Surface Scanning Module is a critical part in surveying a planet or moon. You will use this part to find the exact ore concentrations on the ground.\n\n**M700 Survey Scanner**\n\n![EC59116AE9378636BC8D0A4A411A426D26A98F8B](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/531766271400551826/EC59116AE9378636BC8D0A4A411A426D26A98F8B/)\n\nThe M700 Survey Scanner is a critical part in setting up a mining satellite. You will use this part to survey a planet or moon in order to find general ore concentrations.\n\n**ISRU Converter**\n\n![B6635F1F3D38710172383C3CA01E36B3D92CE7BF](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/531766271400570104/B6635F1F3D38710172383C3CA01E36B3D92CE7BF/)\n\nThe ISRU Converter is a critical part in setting up a refinery. You will use this part to convert ore into fuel.\n\n**\u0027Drill-O-Matic\u0027 Mining Excavator**\n\n![8D4F8676C3B607AA42195F08E0DC7D8387115091](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/531766271400570273/8D4F8676C3B607AA42195F08E0DC7D8387115091/)\n\nThe \u0027Drill-O-Matic\u0027 Mining Excavator is a critical part in setting up a mining operation. Obviously you will use this part to mine ore.\n\n**Small Holding Tank**\n\n![96FCEC0BEA6A1326F6C735B839D3C3B13F3F77F4](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/531766271400569552/96FCEC0BEA6A1326F6C735B839D3C3B13F3F77F4/)The Small Holding Tank is a part in setting up a mining operation. Obviously you will use this part to store ore.\n\n**Large Holding Tank**\n\n![5F9C4CB2F30579E318D34A037E9CE6D0B8A1F21E](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/531766271400569741/5F9C4CB2F30579E318D34A037E9CE6D0B8A1F21E/)\n\nThe Large Holding Tank is a part in setting up a mining operation. Obviously you will use this part to store ore.\n\n**M4435 Narrow-Band Scanner**\n\n![261AB750E704978E4DA5C57D1EB8697403904034](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/531766271400569938/261AB750E704978E4DA5C57D1EB8697403904034/)\n\nThe M4435 Narrow-Band Scanner is an optional part in surveying a planet or moon. This part will allow you to see a narrow swath of land with higher detail than the Survey Scanner.\n\n**Scanning for Ore Concentrations**\n\n**Step 1. Setup an ore concentration scanning satellite.**\n\nThe satellite will need;\n\n- M700 Survey Scanner\n- Any Antenna\n- A Control Module (Probably probe, but you could do it manned)\n- Power Generation\\*\n- Power Storage\\*\n- Xenon Fuel and Engines\\*\\*\n- Small Inline Reaction Wheel\\*\\*\n- M4435 Narrow-Band Scanner\\*\\*\n\n\\*You can get away with having just either power generation or a lot of power stored in batteries. When you first use the M700 Survey Scanner it will transfer the scans back to Kerbin which takes a lot of power.\n\n\\*\\*These are nice things to have on a scanning satellite, but by no means required.\n\n![259A0738BAAFE120BC44954F27237B4978FD0236](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/531766271400608308/259A0738BAAFE120BC44954F27237B4978FD0236/)\n\n**Step 2. Launch the scanning satellite into POLAR orbit around the moon/planet you intend to mine.**\n\nA polar orbit of 25000m\\* to 1,500,000m\\* is required to use the M700 scanner.\n\nThe a POLAR orbit is required in order to properly scan the moon or planet you intend to mine. Usually in KSP we setup equatorial orbits, so I am stressing that the orbit needs to be polar for a very specific reason. If you accidentally setup an equatorial orbit it will take a lot of \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv to fix.\n\n\\*These may vary on very small or very large objects like Jool or Minmus, but generally speaking a 50,000 to 100,000 orbit will do just fine.\n\n![B4116AC1803DC98CC374EA1A5B24D71730028733](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/531766271400627272/B4116AC1803DC98CC374EA1A5B24D71730028733/)\n\n**Step 3. Use the satellite to determine a high concentration of ore.**\n\nOnce you have scanned the moon or planet and transfered the data back to Kerbin (you\u0027ll get 10 science) you\u0027ll be able to overlay ore concentration onto the moon or planet you scanned. You can setup the overlay from the satellite or from the Tracking Station.\n\n**Step3a - From the satellite**\n\nFrom the satellite right click the M700 Survey Scanner and select \u0027Toggle Overlay\u0027. When you enter the map mode you\u0027ll see the moon/planet you scanned with an ore concentration overlay now. You can adjust your M700 Survey Scanner to hone in on a good mining operation location.\n\nUse Cutoff\u002B to raise the minimum ore concentration in order for the overlay to display. Basically you want to keep raising this percentage until there\u0027s no overlay left, then use Cutoff- just once and all of the terrain highlighted will be the highest concentration locations.\n\n**Step3b. - From the tracking station**\n\nFirst, focus on the body you just scanned. On the right panel of your screen where the Info and Orbit icons are there will be a new icon for Resources. Click the button and then select Resources -\u003E Ore. The setup here on out is the same as it was on the satellite, use cutoff\u002B to find the highest concentration possible.\n\n![D77AEC024CDF07FDBDDF8972056E7ECB3C750C64](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/531766271400654469/D77AEC024CDF07FDBDDF8972056E7ECB3C750C64/)\n\n**Surface Scan with a Rover (Optional)** \n\nThis part is a little optional, you can setup a base from the M700 Survey Scan, but that scan only tells you generally what concentrations of resources will be in an area. On the surface, concentrations will vary by a few percentage points. In order to find the most ideal location for a mining base, I suggest using a rover with a surface scanner.\n\nYou\u0027ll want somewhere fairly flat, trying to land a giant mining base on slopes is going to be tricky. The slopes will also block direct sunlight, so if you\u0027re in the inner solar system you want as much sunshine as possible. (This patch also made it so any moon/planet past Dres has really bad solar power generation)\n\nYou\u0027ll want something close to the equator. It\u0027ll be easier to land/take off from and it\u0027ll have longer days than if you setup on the poles.\n\nYou can setup your rover to also double as a fuel tanker. Setup the rover so it has a docking bay that can couple with your mining base. If you then design and build ships that can dock with your rover you can export the ore or fuel from the surface.\n\nAttached is a picture of my fuel rover.\n\n![6B182D0A0D8033108E57F68815811DFBA8497585](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/531766271400674445/6B182D0A0D8033108E57F68815811DFBA8497585/)\n\n**Setting up a Mining Base**\n\nOnce you\u0027ve picked out a specific location for a mining base it\u0027s time to set it up! This guide assumes you know how to land, orbit, etc and I don\u0027t want to tell you exactly what to design and setup, but here is some tips and ideas.\n\n- Make sure your drills are attached to a HIGH mass object like a giant fuel tank. Drills will produce heat and when they\u0027re attached to high mass objects, the high mass objects help to absorb a lot of that heat efficiently.\n- Attach solar panels or wings to the high mass object / fuel tank your drills are attached to. They\u0027ll act as passive radiators, dissipating heat away from your drills.\n- Setup your mining drill so that it has a pilotable command module for an engineer. Engineers also help to manage and dissipate heat from the drills.\n- Set up your mining base so it can be docked with in some way, otherwise all the ore and fuel you\u0027re producing will likely go to waste.\n- Bring a lot of batteries or fuel cells. If you want your drills and ISRU to run continuously you\u0027ll need to supply it with a lot of power. Solar generation is great, but when it is night time on the planet or moon you\u0027re on, you\u0027ll need batteries or fuel cells to keep it going.\n- Think about setting up a mining base that is coupled with a fuel rover. You can use the fuel rover to dock with landing vessels to refuel them, or to use a reusable vessel to transport the fuel to an orbital station.\n- Make sure to have storage for all the types of fuel you\u0027ll want to produce. The ISRU can make MonoProp, Liquid and Oxidizer. If you don\u0027t have a tank for MonoProp, for instance, you won\u0027t be able to produce it. With that in mind also make sure your fuel rover has storage for all types too.\n\nHere\u0027s a little screenshot of the first Mining Base I setup if that helps you.\n\n![5AA3D1409A69F17451D1BBF0080D5A4AD70A72A8](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/531766271400702479/5AA3D1409A69F17451D1BBF0080D5A4AD70A72A8/)\n\n**Mining an Asteroid**\n\nEvery asteroid will have a certain mass and ore concentration. Mining an asteroid is very much like mining a planet or moon. You\u0027ll need drills, ISRU, heat management and power management. Keep in mind a few VERY important things.\n\n- Asteroid mass is limited. This means you can deplete an asteroid of ore.\n- Asteroids come with their own ore concentrations, meaning a 95% Class A asteroid can have more ore than a 5% Class C asteroid.\n- Turn off your drills when your ore tanks are full. The drills will keep depleting the asteroid even if you have nowhere to put the ore.\n- \n\nHere\u0027s a screenshot of a Class A 95% concentration asteroid I landed at KSP.\n\n![E6BC100916674C8F0BDAD9B9AF61ADE336A6AA9E](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/531766271400708883/E6BC100916674C8F0BDAD9B9AF61ADE336A6AA9E/)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T23:15:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 11:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rhadamant**"},{"CreatedByName":"KatzOhki","CreatedById":73492,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T20:06:07Z","Content":"Thumbs up on Steam.

The Large ISRU will convert 1500 ore to 1350LF/1650ox.  The small ISRU weighs 1.25t, the large weighs 4.25t.  So **the large ISRU has a 10x efficiency advantage, vs a 3.4x mass disadvantage.**\n\nIf you sit on the surface to fill your tanks and carry little to no ore with you, the main difference will be the amount of time spent in time-warp.  For many people this will be no disadvantage at all, while the compact size creates many advantages.  A small ISRU, small drill, radiator, and small radial ore tank can even shoehorn into a single-length Mk2 cargo bay.\n\nThen, here\u0027s some info comparing the small and large drills.  I did a quick test with a 4-star engineer on a 8.37% patch of ore (my launchpad), both drills at 500K with abundant power and cooling.  Large drill pulls 0.1318 ore/sec, small drill pulls 0.0264 ore/sec.  If the engineer EVAs (so zero engineer bonus), the large drill pulls 0.006274, small drill pulls 0.001255 ore/sec.  In both conditions **the large drill pulls 5.0 times as much ore per second as the small drill** **, and weighs 5.0 times as much**.  Note that the tool tips don\u0027t mention the output difference, just that both have a maximum output of 1.0 ore per second.  \n\nThe big disadvantage however, is that the small drill won\u0027t work whatsoever with ore concentration less than 2.5%.  The M700 survey won\u0027t show you this number - only the narrow-band or surface scanners.  I\u0027ve found the narrow-band scanner pretty tricky to use in flight to choose a landing spot.  And the surface scanner is no good at all until you\u0027re on the surface, and perhaps stranded out of fuel for another hop to a richer spot. \n\nI suspect some people have slapped a small ISRU and small drills on a ship, landed on marginal ore deposits, perhaps with a low level engineer or none at all, perhaps with inadequate cooling, and been frustrated at the length of time needed to make any fuel.  The small drill produces 1/5th as much ore per second, the small ISRU turns it to 1/10th as much fuel, yet that 1/50th fuel fraction often needs to obtain 33 EC/sec from 2 Fuel Cell Arrays, vs the large/large combo\u0027s 45EC/sec requiring 3.  The fuel cells may eat up the fuel entirely.\n\nThe small ISRU gear can fit into a very small package, but it will require a lot more care and forethought in ship design and usage than the large gear.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-05T09:00:09Z\u0022 title=\u002212/05/2015 09:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by fourfa**"},{"CreatedByName":"rhadamant","CreatedById":119663,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-10T05:20:03Z","Content":"Yeah I really ought to dig into 1.0.5 and update this.

This means if you land close enough to a pole the sun will never set and your base can use solar panels and run full time without the need to carry batteries or worry about drills stopping overnight.
