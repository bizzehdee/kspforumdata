Now, I decided to actually design what they would look like!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI knew KSP\u0027s art style was cartoonish, with the models sort of smoothed, so a\u00A0human would be as well. They would either be a replacement for kerbals in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E or another species to choose from (Interspecies cooperation?) that would have a different set of abilities and drawbacks. At least, that\u0027s what I\u0027m thinking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom a Kerbal\u0027s perspective, humans are horribly tall and lanky contraptions with less cool-looking but more practical suits, with a boring\u00A0but brilliant logical mindset. In my headcanon they are actually the ones who made most of the game\u0027s anomalies and then moved on for unknown reasons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you guys like it?
