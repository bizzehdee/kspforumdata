I know the site says it\u0027s coming to PC, PS4, and XBox One, but they haven\u0027t even updated it to include PS5 and Series S/X. This game is coming out mid to late \u002722 now, not early \u002720.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome of the terrain tech they\u0027ve been showing off is pretty expensive. Not a huge factor for PS5, but I\u0027ve recently worked on standing up something similar and we have been testing it on PS4. Which ran alright, I guess. But it was starting to eat into frame rate and this was on a custom in-house engine at a AAA studio, so it was actually pretty well optimized to do this work. KSP2 is supposed to run this with Unity. Even with as much shifted over to compute as possible, CPU is going to struggle a lot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen we should talk about the core game. Yeah, they\u0027re optimizing it. But they are also adding new features. Continuous collisions are new. Time warp will have to support a lot more physics if we\u0027re going interstellar. Colonies. None of it\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ehas\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0to get particularly expensive, but this is a small team making a big game. Not everything\u0027s getting optimized out of the box.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think PS4 being a target is realistic. PS4/XB1 are either getting dropped or back-ported with a lot of features cut. At which point, the development platform for KSP2 is going to be PS5. That\u0027s going to be the benchmark for \u0022good enough\u0022 performance in a lot of QA. Which means, maybe they can optimized it a lot better, but there is high risk they don\u0027t, and PS5 CPU will represent a realistic minimum spec.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s not a guarantee, and it\u0027s entirely possible the min spec will end up lower, but if you want to forecast and buy something now that will be nearly guaranteed to run KSP2 well, that\u0027s your target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224013904\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022204162\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221627992573\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022212780\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kapitalizing Every Word\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, Kapitalizing Every Word said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWill it be THAT high?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo as I explain above, it\u0027s not a guarantee. It might end up a lot lower, but PS5 will very likely be their benchmark, which means that optimizing the game for lower spec CPU is not going to be\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enearly\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0as high of a priority.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd it\u0027s not\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0wild on the CPU side. Prices on 3rd gen Ryzen and 10th gen iCore have come down significantly. Either of the CPUs I\u0027ve listed is ~$300 in US right now and sales are frequent. Which is still expensive for a CPU, but it might not even end up the most expensive part of your build. The GPU you want to pair with this will start in $300 - $400 range and goes up from there. If you want to play other modern games, probably\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eway\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is an interesting opportunity to consider on-board graphics, though. AMD\u0027s APU design is actually quite beefy, and if you can find a way to purchase something like Ryzen 7 4700GE, that can almost certainly cut the mustard on graphics for KSP2. It\u0027s a lot weaker than PS5 GPU and is Vega 8 based, rather than RDNA2, but graphics are way easier to make tunable, and I\u0027m fairly confident that Intercept will try to target lower tier GPUs. Now, the catch is that Ryzen APUs are an OEM part, meaning you are only supposed to be able to get them with pre-builds. There are some on the market that are reasonably priced, though, if that\u0027s what you\u0027re going for. Alternatively, I know people have been able to buy CPUs and boards meant for OEM at wholesale prices from less reputable sources. It\u0027s a risk, but if you\u0027re familiar with these markets, it might be a great option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI almost want to recommend the Intel\u0027s i10700K for the same reason, but I\u0027m not nearly as confident that the onboard graphics there will do the job. It\u0027s also going to be inadequate in a lot of other games, so it\u0027s a very shaky proposition. I still like it as a gaming CPU, but running it without a dedicated graphics card is very meh.\u00A0A 12th gen iCore CPU with integrated might actually be perfectly fine for playing KSP2, if rumors are to be trusted, but then we\u0027re back to the problem of trying to buy the latest and greatest, in this case, something that hasn\u0027t even been quite released yet. So you probably won\u0027t be able to save anything overall with this setup, sadly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yeah, it might go way down from this target. I just don\u0027t think even anybody at Intercept knows at this point where it\u0027s going to land, so if you buy a CPU now and you go well bellow these specs, you\u0027re taking on a significant risk that you\u0027ll have to upgrade for KSP2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"J.Random","CreatedById":63332,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-05T11:35:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224014097\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022204162\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221628020131\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257710\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 8/3/2021 at 10:48 PM, K^2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI honestly don\u0027t know if it\u0027s relevant anymore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt depends on whether memory supply issues are going to be fixed or not in time for release.

On one hand, yeah, PS4 could still be quite dominant - and, I mean, even 20% of the market isn\u0027t something you want to just drop, and that\u0027s optimistic for gen 9 -\u00A0but it\u0027s also something that would have been forecasted from about a year back, and I don\u0027t think anybody expected launch of gen 9 to be\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0rocky, despite problems. So it\u0027s likely that either PS5 or XBSX is the main target platform - the one most of the development is being done daily. This means that getting everything to run smoothly on PS4 is still going to be a last-minute hassle (it really shouldn\u0027t be, but that\u0027s how these things go) and if the game still runs poorly on PS4 a few months from release, it might get delayed or canceled. Publishers right now are terrified of pulling another Cyberpunk. So they might just take that loss rather than risk it. Especially, if there will be additional costs and/or delays associated with getting the game onto PS4.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be clear, a lot of this logic also goes for XBox, so PS4/XB1 are a packaged deal here. XBSS is an interesting special case, but it\u0027s only slightly underclocked compared to SX and GPU shouldn\u0027t be the bottleneck. This means your best choice for target platform is still PS5, because if your game runs well on Windows PC and on PS5, it\u0027s almost a guarantee that it does well on XBSX. You get CPU coverage from PS5 and API/shader coverage from Windows, so there really shouldn\u0027t be any surprises other than some mislabeled UI. But some of this is hindsight. It\u0027s entirely possible that XBSX is the main target for console development\u00A0in the studio.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, and you might ask, \u0022Why doesn\u0027t everyone just run every platform?\u0022 That\u0027s actually a lot of overhead. You need one platform to be the go-to for the studio so that it always has a build in good shape. If you have to do this for every platform, that\u0027s a lot of effort wasted on fixing issues that aren\u0027t actually going to impact the shipped game. One approach I\u0027ve seen that works well on larger projects is if you have multiple studios, they work on different platforms. But for something of Intercept\u0027s size, the most sensible thing is to pick one of the consoles and use it as primary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-05T21:45:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224013725\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022204162\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221627945727\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022212780\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kapitalizing Every Word\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 8/2/2021 at 4:08 PM, Kapitalizing Every Word said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo currently I have a VERY bad pc (a6 7480 CPU RX 550 2GB GPU and 8GB DDR3 RAM) and I know for sure it will not be able to run KSP2.
