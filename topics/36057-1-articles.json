At first it was going alright, but after I got the fourth section nearby, I started having FPS problems. I still managed to dock it and then launched a fuel ship up to allow the station to load a decent amount of fuel to to other ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the ship got a few hundred meters away from the station, my entire game went down to about one frame every 5 seconds, RCS jets looked huge and covered almost half the screen when fired, and the ship was basically uncontrollable. I already moved the physics down to one calculation every second last time I had this issue, and the other settings didn\u0027t affect my FPS at all no matter what they were set at\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s images of the overall station, and the fuel ship attached to a previous much smaller station\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42951400/screenshot5%20(2).png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot5%20(2).png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42951400/screenshot3%20(2).png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot3%20(2).png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ships aren\u0027t that big and the overall part count is about 290 for the station and like 25 for the fuel ship, so I don\u0027t understand why the game is having such a hard time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy graphics card is a 460GTX1gb\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProcessor is a Phenom II 6 core 1100T 3.3GHz\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGame gets pretty boring when you can\u0027t make anything bigger than a few sections combined and I\u0027ve seen people on youtube make much bigger stations:huh:\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"_Aramchek_","CreatedById":12588,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-05T23:32:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOverclock your cpu, your 1100t should go to close to 4ghz, maybe a little more maybe a little less.
