So I just tested the unofficial version of scatterer for 1.9 and works just as the original did on previous versions. Great!!! That being said, I\u0027m experiencing some weird visual behaviors I also had from previous versions. I know this was previously discussed, but I wasn\u0027t able to find the specific comment talking about this.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E The \u0022bug\u0022 I\u0027m experiencing is that some of the planets look kind of transparent! Searching through this topic I found a photo from blackrack from 2015 that seems to also show this same visual glitch! Here\u0027s the quoted image\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Some of you may be able to see some halos inside the planet. This are from the center of the planet and are visible all the time once scatterer is running. I\u0027ve seen this too on Jool and Eve I think.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Here\u0027s a video I just made showing this effect on Duna. It\u0027s not that easy to see, but you may find the same halos inside Duna always showing. Any ideas on how to fix this?\n\u003E \n\nThese are issues with the precomputed atmosphere scattering files. I have no fix for it, apart from trying to generate an atmosphere multiple times and \u0022getting lucky\u0022 with values that don\u0027t cause this.\n\nI however consider it mild enough that I have to say it\u0027s pretty low on my priority list.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-03-31T11:50:33Z\u0022 title=\u002203/31/2020 11:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 31, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by blackrack**"},{"CreatedByName":"R-T-B","CreatedById":200868,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-31T12:56:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, blackrack said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E These are issues with the precomputed atmosphere scattering files.
