What do these different things do, and if both are set to different values, which one determines if a kerbal is dead? If I\u00A0set the splatSpeed lower than the crash tolerance, does that leave an unpoofed \u0027corpse\u0027, or will they still poof?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceman.Spiff","CreatedById":209133,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-20T13:06:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScience time!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
