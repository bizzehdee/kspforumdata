My greatest achievment so far is to land on Eve with pod and parachute. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile doing orbital changes in the Eve mission I got a perhaps crazy idea. I had a burn comming up at ascending node to align with Eve\u0027s orbit and just briefly noticed that reaching the burn point in real time would take approx 50 days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thought of doing a mission in realtime is blowing my mind. It would mean launching from Kerbin and then waiting ~5 minutes until I reach AP to burn into orbit. I can make pasta while waiting. It would mean waiting ~5 hours for mun encounter. It would mean waiting perhaps a month to do a correction burn while orbiting the sun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDepending on the mission one could look at completing it in say 6 months, perhaps even a year for some missions. Blog and all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving a windows computer up and running for such length and not rebooting it is a mission in itself I guess.
