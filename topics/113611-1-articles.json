Where it used to be a valuable product that could make a company money, people have gotten used to getting an OS for free. Apple does it, Google does it, the Linuxes do it. However, due to the competing ecosystems, Windows is still of importance to Microsoft. They market share of Windows Phone is really rather small, so they have to make most of the x86 branch to compensate. If they lose that, the war is lost.\n\nSometimes it makes sense to have a strong product without making money off of it, though they will likely try to make the most of it.
