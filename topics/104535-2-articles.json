Essentially the patch breaks the telescopic parts - they will extend, but when they extend, they shift upward/sideways as well as outward, ones at the base don\u0027t extend fully, etc. I don\u0027t understand it either, since I also couldn\u0027t figure out how those parts could conceivably be different than the others... all I was doing was changing the exact same variables as for the other parts, didn\u0027t change the SCALETYPE or anything else. I also couldn\u0027t figure out why some legacy parts (like gantries) broke in a vaguely similar way when doing this...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s possible it was just some error/typo when I was making the MM config too, I just left it out because it was still broken.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, the @rescaleFactor *= 4 definitely wrecks stuff, but until TS and IR play together nicely for upscaling, it\u0027s at least one way of having larger IR parts without duplicating everything (a method I\u0027ve also tried) and therefore cluttering your part list. Is there a way to do this without breaking things? Duplication was the only thing I could think of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Added the telescopic parts back to the patch. New behavior I haven\u0027t seen - now they explode when you extend them.

If you just press it for a moment and extend them a tiny bit, the craft will begin rotating (constantly) counterclockwise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you extend them farther, they explode. Beats me... Totally guessing, but could there be an issue with these parts specifically and the new nodes sizes I apply? Works OK for the other parts, but they aren\u0027t usually in robotic-on-robotic-part chains.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT AGAIN: Aha! That\u0027s got something to do with it - when I place other IR parts (rescaled) end to end - one robotic part on another, oriented correctly - they also cause weird forces in the ship and explode if moved too far. Huh. So much for the patch as is. =( I seem to remember this phenomenon with the stacked telescopic parts being less pronounced when in an original iteration I tried using stack nodes of size 2... not sure about that though.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-22T21:42:33Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2015 09:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AccidentalDisassembly\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ziw","CreatedById":135292,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T22:08:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022V8jester\u0022 data-cite=\u0022V8jester\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGreat work guys, I love the fact that when assigning parts to an action group you no longer need to toggle a direction on and then off again.
