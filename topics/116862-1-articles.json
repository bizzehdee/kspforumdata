Inspired by Rune\u0027s White Dart space plane, I\u0027ve included in the download files several different pre-made payload bay options. Some carry ground attack missiles in various configurations. Some carry bombs, and there\u0027s even one with air to air missiles (on the assumption you want to try your hand in dark multiplayer or against AI opponents fighting off multiple attacking fighters or supporting one group against the other with missiles fired from the edges of the battle). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith 8 .50 caliber turrets spaced around it, the B7 can defend itself against fighters or even shoot down missiles! It has 8 Countermeasure pods, just to make sure you don\u0027t run out at a bad moment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy the .50 cal turrets? Well - they sit flush to the frame, unlike the other guns available in BD armory, and I figured that aesthetically they made more sense for a supersonic bomber. On the B7, in their \u0022folded\u0022 position, the guns are all pointing to the rear with the back of the turret facing the airstream. But they have full 360 motion. At almost every angle, you\u0027ll have at least 4 turrets able to train on a target. And straight forward you can get all 8 on target if you aim right! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn guard mode they are DEADLY accurate versus fighters and can even shoot down incoming missiles.

The Antares uses OPT engines that are - quite frankly - almost ridiculously over-powered. But the basic airframe is more than capable of high speed with just the stock \u0022Whiplash\u0022 turbojets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3RtngvR.png\u0022 alt=\u00223RtngvR.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s capable of getting from the runway up to 10,000 meters and Mach 2 in about 30-40 seconds. The trick is holding BACK on the throttle at the right time to avoid overheating and exploding engines! I\u0027d consider \u0022safe\u0022 cruising speed and altitude to be Mach 2.5 at around 15,000 meters. And the Valkyrie is capable of BRIEF sprints at well over Mach 3 between 16,000 and 20,000 meters. WATCH THOSE TEMPERATURE GAUGES though if you do that!

It\u0027s easy to set up volley fire with the action groups. In fact I recommend it in some cases. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough not required, I HIGHLY recommend TAC Fuel balancer and set up the fuel tankage feeds back to front to maintain the COG forward of the lift when the fuel gets low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPayload Options: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Payload bay is capable of holding the following that I\u0027ve tested and saved as sub-assemblies included in the package: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 3 Cruise missiles\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 6 Maverick Missiles\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A mix of 12 Hellfire and 4 Mavericks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 5 AMRAAM missiles\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 3 Cluster Bombs and 6 Mk 82 Bombs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 12 Mk 82 Bombs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 12 Mk 82 Snakeeye Low Altitude Bombs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA note on designing your own payloads: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the things that kept destroying my test Valkyries - particularly at high drop speeds over Mach 1 - is the fact that you need to set your drop time on the missiles to MAXIMUM and your Ejection speed on the launch rails high. You basically need to KICK those missiles down and away from the payload bay and clear of the aircraft so they have enough clearance before they ignite their rocket engines! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso - try to give the missiles clearance space from the back of the bay. As well as clear drop angles that don\u0027t get entangled with other missiles/bombs! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t tell you how many times I\u0027ve watched a missile pin itself against the forward wall of the bay before exploding and shredding the plane... oy... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:0.0:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA very full bomb bay - \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ghHZ4x1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ghHZ4x1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dXcZhlO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dXcZhlO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jD9jhFu.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jD9jhFu.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lHPMmcB.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lHPMmcB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA word on naming and history:\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough the B7 Valkyrie resembles an SR 71 Blackbird, I decided for several reasons to name it as an homage to a fantastic piece of Aviation history and technological know-how - that unfortunately wound up obsolete in terms of mission profile before it ever had a chance to see production. That plane was the XB-70 Valkyrie and it was a transonic bomber with speed rivalling that of the Blackbird but capable of delivering several nuclear bombs! It was an amazing plane, but ICBMs and stealth technology basically ensured it would never enter production. That and an unfortunate crash of one of the prototypes caused by an F-104 getting too close in formation and colliding with and shearing off the vertical stabilizers ensured the end of the program. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UVtuk2b.png\u0022 alt=\u0022UVtuk2b.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for my particular choice - well - that row of 6 engines, it\u0027s Mach 3.3 top speed and capability as a bomber pretty much were reason enough, I\u0027d say. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell - here\u0027s the bomber for you to test.
