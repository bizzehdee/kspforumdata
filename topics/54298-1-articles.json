I made this rule for myself to use 1 parachute for every 1.7 ton (on Kerbin) that has to come down (so a 3 ton contraption takes 2 chutes, etc.). I\u0027m not sure if this is totally efficient, but it works for me. When the whole thing lands, I keep a close eye on the touchdown speed that I never let exceed 7.5 m/s (It\u0027s a rough landing, but nothing breaks). If it is way lower than that (and I need some more space on my rocket) I ditch a chute and see how that goes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-25T11:56:33Z\u0022 title=\u002211/25/2013 11:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Galileo Kerbonaut\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrJacobean","CreatedById":94409,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T11:58:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s either you are physics warping (which makes the engine unstable for big ships) or your ship is too heavy for your ship.
