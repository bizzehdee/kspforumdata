When the player has returned to 1x speed the player gets transferred back to the server with his \u0022warp ID\u0022, and can continue playing. Obviously the player wouldn\u0027t be allowed to warp if there was another player in a certain range of him/her, this distance could be specified by the server administrator. Also, it would be a good thing to have a \u0022cooldown\u0022 for warps, for instance after having warped a player couldn\u0027t warp for another 2 minutes or something like that. While warping other players on the server wouldn\u0027t be able to see the player, and if there were a list of players being displayed, there could be a status indicator: *warping*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t been able to find any problems with this so far, but I am sure there are many.
