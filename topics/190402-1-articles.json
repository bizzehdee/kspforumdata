Multiple times over, I launched something towards the Mun, performed the burn for an encounter - and as soon as I engage time warp, I\u0027m suddenly several thousand kilometers short of an encounter. Then yesterday, I was launching six craft to Minmus in rapid succession. One of them landed on the surface but the surface texture was visibly shaking everywhere. Another craft was a few minutes away from the Minmus \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E when I noticed that when time warp isn\u0027t engaged, the encounter was moving\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eaway\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0from the craft and the Kerbin apoapse was slowly dropping as if I was doing a weak retrograde thrust, but the moment I engaged time warp it stopped. I disengaged time warp and I once again began passively decelerating for no reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs KSP\u0027s on-the-rails trajectory calculations having trouble from having a large number of concurrent missions running at the same time or something?

For concurrent flights, in addition to the three ground probes and three relays sent to Minmus, I was at the same time having two space stations, one at Kerbin, one at the Mun, plus three relays and seven or so ground probes at the Mun, plus one probe en route to Eve.
