Then rover serves no purpose as there are no contract related to them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause you cannot do manned mission in the beginning, the fastest way to accumulate science only lies in tests which is a chore and grindy.

So in the early game, it\u0027s kind of like a catch 22 with RemoteTech or SCANsat. You need manned mission to set up the comsat network, then SCANSat.
