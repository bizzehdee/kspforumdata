I have had no problems up until today. I just got back from the Mun and received about 480 Science points. I now have a total of 658.4. I spent all but 18, go into the hangar, and I am missing the parts. If I exit the hangar, I have all of my science points back. Not only that but I do not get science points from completing contracts. I do, however, received funds for completing them. Also, I do not get the \u0022experimental\u0022 equipment when I accept a contract that requires me to test something I do not have. I will get the contract, but not the part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have done a complete uninstall and reinstall into a new folder and I still have the same problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo mods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei7-4770K\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAsus Sabertooth z87 Motherboard\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E16GB G.Skill RAM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E500GB Samsung 840 EVO SSD\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2x AMD R9 280x GPUs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETubesock\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-03T23:27:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll I can think of from what you\u0027ve said is it may be a permissions issue. Which folder is KSP in? If it\u0027s in something like Program Files, you can run into an issue where the game won\u0027t be able to save properly, which has lead to science points not updating in the past. Moving KSP to something like C:\\Games will avoid the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore information on permissions can be found in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92228\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis sticky thread\u003C/a\u003E under \u0027windows\u0027.
