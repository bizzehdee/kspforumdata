All this does is effectively shrink a graph and hide the minute differences in polls with lots of options and a poll with 20 options barely sees an option go above 5% despite taking on a large majority of the votes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the latter were implemented it would make reading poll results more easy and intuitive to comprehend. I know the forum is still actively updated and I hope this can be considered\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-11T18:19:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to kerbal network.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
