Only thing that bothers me though is, pod racers as they appear in star wars seem to be ground vehicles, while they are maneuverable when airborne, they certainly cannot fly.

We still have the 50m archway that seems the most suitable for a low level pod race course. If I made another would you want it hard (very hard in the mountains) or close to KSC on the flatter or dark green ground?
