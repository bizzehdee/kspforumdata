What I mean is I using same time system, so all month names are same. This is done for few reasons. First and main is to not confuse you all and myself, second is I couldn\\\u0027t imagine whole new names which would eventually come to whole new system, so even if I do that it would interfear with 1st reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut all dates in my story are totally human random!

It was just a huge blob of hot gases and rock that colided togather and formed an irregural shape that was growing by absorbing more and more dust, gas and rock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can ask: \u0027but where all that rock, dust and gas came from!?\u0027 and I will answer you it all came from our star! All unused material that star didn\\\u0027t take while it was forming it left orbiting itself. It colided and was growing till it was that big that it own gravity started to pull even more towards itself! And so our planet, our Kerbal was born! By that time it was huge ball of magma and hot gases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn time it cool down and our planet started to make it way to what it is now!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027But where did water came from?!\u0027 you may ask, and I will answer that as well! Our most acceptable theory is meteors and comets!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe belive that they came from deep space and brought us water in huge ice comets! It fell from sky and colided into our hot planet and water immediately evaporated and also was cooling our planet!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now lets look back and summary what happend there:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1st - Our star, our mother was born.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2nd - Shortly after that we born too!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3rd - Water made its way from deep space and find it place here which made our planet to cool and also helped established atmoshere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was Gregor Kerman from NKSC and I will wait you after short comercial!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Comercial]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMun and Minmus\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome back!

It was big surprise for CSKC and in few years it was smashed. Control after all those lands were given to KC. Later KC, WUC and GKK formed Peacfull Kerbal Treaty (PKT) in which all contries that signed that Treaty can\\\u0027t attack or do anything offecive to other countries for next 100 years.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWee!

Michel Kerman. Now we will talk how GW helped us to develop technolgy that we even now using to travel to starts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter GW ended in 1968 society was exhausted nobody thought that we could stand on our legs again in ~50 years so thats why WUC, GKK and KC signed PKT as well know as PaKT (\u003Cstrong\u003EP\u003C/strong\u003Ee\u003Cstrong\u003Ea\u003C/strong\u003Ecfull \u003Cstrong\u003EK\u003C/strong\u003Eerbal \u003Cstrong\u003ET\u003C/strong\u003Ereaty). But after resarching so much data of enemy that he left after war WUC discovered they secret weaponds that was proected to bomb cities without planes. It was radio guided rockets! WUC started to develope this and tested in Koby desert were they understood that this rockets are perfect for war!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing they didn\\\u0027t understood was that they can use for peacfull thigs as well, thats were GKK comes. Info somehow (we think that was GKK spies, but nothing really know about it) leaked to GKK and they tried to get that technology as well. After long political war finally GKK had that blueprints of rockets. One scientist Doc. Kebelt Kerman thougt something other about this rockets he didn\\\u0027t thought it was weaponds he thought that was transport.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately by the 1971 society somehow stand up on it\\\u0027s legs and goverment have enough money for that crazy project Doc. Kebelt had. In June 1972 first man controled rocket flew up in the air, but rocket was overweighted and fell from skies. Mr. Jech \u0027Jokey\u0027 Kerman didn\\\u0027t survied and it was great loss for Doc. Kebelt as Jech was his best friend. After his friend demise Doc left project \u0027Omega\u0027 and never returned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProject was closed after that and never was resumed. But in 1975 a year after KGUCGT (Kerbal Global Union of all Coutries and Goverments Treaty) was signed by all countries and world was united new program was started.
