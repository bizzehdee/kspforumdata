What I purpose is organizing the different Agencies into various long term Contracts. These would be large goals (made up of numerous smaller contracts) that would follow a particular path. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOutline:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPerhaps Kerbal Motion\u0027s Goal is to Colonize Duna. (This would include satellites, space stations, land bases, resource collecting...)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThis Goal would have a massive payout (in comparison to current contracts), as it\u0027s not intended to be completed easily or in a single mission. Though there would be a time limit just like a normal contract.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe majority of the contracts from this Agency would be in a direct relationship to the Agency\u0027s goal. No more random contracts mixed between random agencies.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ETaking on multiple Agency Goals would be fine. However, failing would mean no more Goal related business with this Agency. Example of failing might be too many Kerbal deaths, not finishing the goal within the time limit or other factors that the Agency may not appreciate. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EReputation would have a larger role. Some Agency Goals being simpler in nature make for good early/mid game goals (Colonizing the Mun perhaps, or exploring Kerbin). Achieving these early/mid game goals would boost your reputation and thus open the door to new and bigger Agency\u0027s becoming available.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOther Thoughts\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would create a sense of different Agencies competing against each other and bidding for your attention (or avoiding you depending on your rep). Obviously Colonizing Duna is a pretty cliche example, but with the dozen or so Agency\u0027s we currently have, there could be some really interesting Agency Goals. Not to mention, this creates a very long game if you choose to achieve every Agency Goal. It just seems weird to me that all the Agency\u0027s currently have no method or goal in mind. It\u0027s just a mixture of repetitive contracts between randomly selected Agency\u0027s. This would see to end that. Thanks-\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
