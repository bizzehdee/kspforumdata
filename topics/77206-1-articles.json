Hadn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t I reached the ship before my RCS fuel ran out, Bob would surely have been dead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis experience has taught me, to first test the ladders of every spaceship on Kerbin launchpad ... and to include extensive exterior lighting for every ship (so that it is still visible for Kerbals on the nightside of a planet/moon)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat about using the EVA suit lights?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theend3r","CreatedById":97560,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-11T23:53:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf we count rovers then about 60km and 60km back on Mun, which was a horrifying experience even though the rover was build very soundly (two sets of wheels in case it flipped, which it did, a lot).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
