Most stations I\u0027ve seen start with a module that has a multi-point connector hub with docking ports. But you pretty much need at least one docking port to build onto the existing part.

You don\u0027t really need fairings at all. It seems as though your aerodynamics get worse because your payload is wobbling inside the fairing; it\u0027s better (but uglier) to not use fairings and to keep the payload stable with lots of struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) If even the lowest throttle setting will fully counter the force of gravity, your thrust-to-weight ratio would appear to be too high. Add more weight to your craft, or make use of less powerful/fewer engines. Ideally, you want it to be possible to have a throttle level where you will precisely counter gravity, keeping your vertical speed equal, but in practice you\u0027ll usually have to toggle between slightly increasing speed and slightly decreasing speed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) They don\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E anything, so it\u0027s mostly up to your imagination. But most people like to include habitation modules, communications sections, administrative areas, and laboratories. Reserve fuel tanks are also popular. For roleplaying purposes, you wouldn\u0027t actually bring kerbals to the base until it\u0027s reasonably finished.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"painking","CreatedById":69085,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-16T18:35:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo clarify more on #1, I ask because I had assumed that it meant ejection burn.
