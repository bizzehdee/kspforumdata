ILS tech is based on old school analog signals that requires large, power hungry antennas and frequent recalibration. GBAS and GLS tech are firmly in the digital age with their associated advantages of signal consistancy and power efficiency.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhether an autopilot can be \u0022smoother\u0022 is debatable - they work through the same control surfaces as a human pilot - and fly-by-wire can actuate certain combinations of control movements to achieve things that are not available to a operator using traditional controls - gust alliveation being a example of this - where alierons on both sides are driven up to unload the wings to reduce gust loading. I can tell you through personal experience that the autoland functions in the current gen airliners can land as smoothly as any human given the right conditions. My current airplane\u0027s crosswind limit for autoland is the same as its crosswind limit under manual flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat automation excels at, however, is consistancy. Where you state \u0022a computer\u00A0will always land, more or less, the same way\u0022 - this is the very advantage of an automated system. The reason they can feel \u0022rough\u0022 is because the software is designed to land the airplane in a defined touchdown zone. A human pilot might decide on the day to let the airplane float a bit to achieve a smooth touchdown, whereas the autoland will drive it down to keep it within tolerances.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem arises when human pilots do this and land long, they miss a high speed turn-off or two, resulting in longer runway occupancy times, increasing seperation, and causing the occasional go-around for aircraft following behind.

Regardless of the reason it is entirely on Boeing to comply with the law because they were not given permission to use the old spec before they built the plane.

I have a hard time believing they can\u0027t make these repairs without damaging something but, if that is the case, perhaps the need to manufacture all new wiring. Sure, that is costly but they should have paid more attention to the safety regulations before they built the MAX. The auto industry has to put up with the NHTSA changing rules then eating the cost of fixing hundreds of thousands of cars. Boeing should have to eat this cost too.

Cert rules get deviations a lot. Not just to save money, but because this is engineering. There are trade-offs involved. One of the most important trades is that it is risky to change a known, proven, safe design to something else, even if that something else potentially has benefits.

The question is whether they should exercise that right. If it is OK that thousands of older airplanes are flying with the exact same wires, why is it not OK that these newer airplanes keep flying with them? Yes, there is a rule and it came into effect on a certain date, and the Max design was applied for after that date so the rule applies to it. But physics is still physics, and if the wires work in NGs they should work in the Max. If they don\u0027t work in the Max then they shouldn\u0027t work in the NGs.
