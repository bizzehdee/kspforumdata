I was thinking it would be smart to have some kind of space station where that fuel can be transferred before returning to Kerbin (obviously I\u0027ll need to keep enough to get from the station to Kerbin). Where would be the smartest place to put that station if the intention is to supply ships headed outside of Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence? Minmus, right? Or Kerbin?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m guessing many of you already did this. I know that you can set fuel tanks to be empty in the VAB. Does anyone have any other advice? I will be sure to include all three dock sizes and include RCS tanks. Should it have Xenon gas as well? What about premium unleaded?
