I already tried the \u0022state =\u0022 line under the PARAM line, but all that did was change the tracking of the contract, it still didn\u0027t register completion. I haven\u0027t had issues with any other contract so far, I suspect this issue has to do with the mod I have installed that gives me the true altitude above the ground, and not ASL, but I didn\u0027t have any issues with any other low altitude mun surveys, but right now, I just want to know which line to change in the save file.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
