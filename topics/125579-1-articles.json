Stacking of SRBs has been done before with STAR motors (but always with smaller STAR motors on top or a larger one, to my knowledge), and done with CASTOR motors, which are larger than SR-120s. They may need modifications to allow for this, however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI couldn\u0027t find stats for Falcon 9 V1.1 Full Thrust Heavy Expendable, but it might mean that the extra SR-120 may not be required, saving on development costs.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis system could also be used for other deep space missions, such as a Uranus Orbiter (assuming a Jupiter flyby), but will it really be worth it to develop the stacked motor assembly for a few missions?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENOTE: THE IMAGE ABOVE ONLY IS SHOWN ON THE DESKTOP SITE!!!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-16T05:35:54Z\u0022 title=\u002211/16/2015 05:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by fredinno\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fredinno","CreatedById":143381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T03:21:16Z","Content":"\nGuys, please reply.
