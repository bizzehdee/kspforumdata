I\u0027m using TT-38K radial decouplers to attach LFO tanks and rocket engines around a central core stage (which contains liquid fuel and turbojet engines). The turbojets in the center stage are pulling fuel from the LFO tanks even though there\u0027s a radial decoupler in between and no fuel duct! Maybe I somehow screwed things up by adding mods or something...? The only way I can think of to fix this would be TweakableEverything.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T21:21:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETurboramjets now pull fuel from every unlocked source of fuel, whether it\u0027s in the same stage, or not.
