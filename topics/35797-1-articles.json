This automatically removes your horizontal movement making tipping over on a FLAT surface less likely. There is one small catch to this method. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you use to much thrust to completely cancel your downward motion, and instead go upwards. You now have a new retrograde direction, and one not conducive to landing. But as long as you keep heading downwards slowly, it works quite nicely.
