I dont think you need timewarp so much, especially once you start doing more than one mission at once. You just make your burn and then switch to another ongoing mission, and manage that one. And so on. time passes by as you manage different missions at once, and you eventually will spend the time needed for the long missions, giving you a realistic feel of persistence and time lapse.
