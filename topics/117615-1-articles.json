Just coming up,with rules,is hard enough, but, wow, this is hard. Just thought i should say that i now understand what you guys go through on a daily basis and to thank you for your hard work keeping this forum a pleasant place to be."},{"CreatedByName":"Cydonian Monk","CreatedById":69224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T15:42:14Z","Content":"Every time I unlock Drama and Poetry in Civilization V and the narrator starts into the Hitchcock quote, I\u0027m reminded of my time as a mod on a MUSH. \u0022What is drama but life with the dull bits cut out.\u0022 There are so few dull bits on RP forums (and the like) that it eventually overwhelms you, and the entirety of it becomes dull. Too much Drama. \n\nI agree with Sampa. Thanks mucho, mods."}]}
