The vessel launches fine, but on my first flight the Kraken hit after pausing and unpausing in atmosphere (also a bug, but not the one this report is about).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen reverting to launch I got a warning message that I don\u0027t have control of the vessel since it is lacking a resource for my control pod. The vessel still had Valentina in it and had electric charge, so I have no clue what that was about. Still, when launching the vessel I was indeed not able to steer the craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReverting to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and re-launching fixed the issue, but it was reproducible, e.g. if I reverted the vessel to launch the problem occurred every time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-28T10:52:40Z\u0022 title=\u002202/28/2023 10:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 28, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by MarcAbaddon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
