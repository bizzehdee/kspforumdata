This is Dvarvaro, one of the team members on that project. We do a search of our game on Google every couple days, to keep abreast of new articles and discussions that appear, and we noticed this thread on the KSP forums.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will see how well I can address your ideas and concerns here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe screens and the cinematic you see are done within Unity, which I have used to test assets for the current life of the project. That fact should probably be more prominent in the future Kickstarter. I don\u0027t agree that this makes them fake however, as the models and textures are the same as we will use later, with a slightly better shader palette. We are waiting to launch the Kickstarter after our first consumer demo is out, so that our players can get a full and direct preview of the experience the engine will provide. Because we are developing the engine from scratch, we feel that step is necessary to give others the confidence that the project is substantial, rather than merely concepts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the question of influences, Tekkit and Feed The Beast are accurate connections. Other titles which have influenced development in some way are Terraria, KSP, and the Star Trek universe.

I appreciate that name lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree about stylistic consistency. I think one of the challenges with that is that the game is sometimes experienced on different scales. For instance, all of the textures and particles are rendered at a scale of 32 pixels per half meter. So while the rocket modules and the smelter for instance have the same texture resolution, there is quite a bit more of the rocket module to be textured, so many more pixels. At one point I experimented with having different texture resolutions for different parts, based on what scale you usually experience each at- the rockets, for example, I textured at 1/4 the resolution. When you were observing them at the global scale in moderately zoomed third person, the rockets then looked as though they were the same texture depth. But then the issue came when I walked around the modules at the assembly center- they looked vastly lower resolution, and gave the impression of being a smaller object that was just scaled up, and was now very low texture res and very low triangle count- hence why I have the rocket parts where I have them now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne compromise may be to have different resolutions for the rocket parts when they are viewed from the character\u0027s perspective in an assembly center, and when they are in flight (high for 1st person, low for third person).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilarly with the particles. In order to be consistent, I gave the particles the same texture resolution as the rest of the world; this creates the same contrast again when you see something tiny like the flames, or something big like the alpha smoke or rocket thrusters. People might be satisfied with particles not being tied to the same texture resolution, however, and maybe taking on a slightly more \u0022cartoonish\u0022 character, with higher resolution.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
