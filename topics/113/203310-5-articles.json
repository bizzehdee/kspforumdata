Spacecraft and probes with electric propulsion need to split the ejection burn. Not NTR craft.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe point I\u0027m making here is that the LV-N is just an engine like any other, but it has so many asterisks attached to it\u0027s usage that it goes from \u0022hey use this it\u0027s 5% better\u0022 to \u0022Don\u0027t bother chasing after that 5% when it has that many caveats\u0022.

Airline operators don\u0027t switch what they\u0027re flying until they get a quote for \u0022performance boost vs previous iteration\u0022 of 15% or more (I don\u0027t know the precise numbers, but it\u0027s around that number). And neither do I.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027m trying to say is that the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E engines are fine. What\u0027s not fine is that the LV-N is... not \u0022gooder\u0022 enough. It was nerfed so it \u0022doesn\u0027t completely replace\u0022 the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E vacuum engines, when they could have pulled on OTHER balance levers to accomplish that, such as engine size, form factor, maybe adding a MINIMUM thrust for it (so you have a range of like 100% to 25%, and below 25% it just entirely shuts down), etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s already long and skinny which makes it hard to use as a lander engine, the shroud on it is a royal pain in the butt to deal with since it sticks to the ENGINE not the DECOUPLER (so much so that even if it\u0027s in-line and only using one, I turn it off just in case it decides to separate weirdly and take off a solar panel or something).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe vacuum \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E engines are just plain old \u0022good enough to get anywhere\u0022 and the LV-N sits off in the corner gathering dust. I don\u0027t want that. I want all the engines to have a niche, but currently the LV-N doesn\u0027t really have a niche so much as it has a \u0022Hey, we can do that too, but we\u0027re heavier, low thrust, produce crazy amounts of waste heat, but hey we\u0027re \u0027efficient\u0027 I guess?\u0022. and that\u0027s just not a convincing argument.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can only hope that this 2.5m NTR isn\u0027t \u0022LV-N, but scaled up\u0022, because that doesn\u0027t solve the issues with the LV-N.
