I would also like to be able to still build independently working stations/bases without needing maintenance flights. So a mod should provide me with methods to build bases that can produce each resource needed on the spot.\n\nThanks"},{"CreatedByName":"Sarayakat","CreatedById":116487,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T17:30:13Z","Content":"Get TAC life support and the Munseeker mod.

Even now some rockets I can\u0027t get off the ground, and then others get into space but can\u0027t go anywhere. Having all these extra required parts just forces me back to the drawing board.
