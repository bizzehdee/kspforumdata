So the engines optimized for vacuum, well, their Isp falls off very fast. Sea-level-optimized engines with low area ratios (LV-T30) and with high chamber pressure (Mammoth) fall off slower. The aerospike has an altitude-compensating nozzle; it performs nearly-optimally (but not quite optimally) in all regimes, and so has the slowest falloff to near-zero thrust/Isp."}]}
