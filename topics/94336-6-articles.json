Rep was already sent earlier because I knew you\u0027d find a way to fix the issue. You can\u0027t have as many mods as you do without some passion for what you\u0027re doing, and that includes fixing minor issues.

I\u0027m just curious because should anything happen in the future I\u0027ll know which one to go to.

Since I use \u0022Half-Res\u0022, I\u0027ll also test using smaller resolutions just to make sure all\u0027s good (that is if you haven\u0027t already). Another thing is we even got a bonus in that the Grey/Red and Black/White stripe versions look even better than they did before, plus a new color!

I\u0027m actually not as worried about quarter resolution and lower, since that\u0027s going always look a lot worse anyway, and I can only make the margins in the textures so large before it wastes a lot of space or things run into each other. I expect some parts in my various mods to have some noticeable seams at the lower detail settings, since the texture resolution drop will cause things to get blurred into one another here and there. At half and full res, most things should hold up though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut dude, thank you so much for your message.
