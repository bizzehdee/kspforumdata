Bugs that you might miss, the community just loves to try to discover them. It shows that something is wrong. It can also allow for concepts to kind of be introducted and removed depending on different things.\n\nOverall, the community can help you track down bugs.\n\n(if \u0022Experimental\u0022 versions are currently being released, then lock the thread because it would be irrelavent by that point)"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T02:09:27Z","Content":"They tried once, and it was a disaster.
