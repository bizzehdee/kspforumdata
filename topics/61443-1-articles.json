Even with my GravMax Tylo lander on the rear, it has over 6.8km/s of delta V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img13/8320/67nb.png\u0022 alt=\u002267nb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, this is of course hyperedited to orbit purely for some testing purposes. The hitchhiker and docking port pieces seem to be weak and are causing a lot of wiggle as the majority of the torque is at the front near the CoM, AKA pile of fuel. In this configuration, it has 7 orange jumbo tanks for fuel, plus a little more in the docking assembly Fuel flow still needs testing to ensure that works correctly. It\u0027s powered by 12 stock nuclear engines. The housing module at the rear boasts capacity for 12 kerbals, though I plan on taking no more than 6 (yes, I did consider using one of Porkjet\u0027s habitats). The ship is easily reconfigurable. Even the bridge doubles as an RCS powered runabout and has a special bay in the rear for when the craft is aerobraking (because the giant heat shield is just good roleplay \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E; and yes, it\u0027s welded so my part count is tolerable) as seen in this image, which is of a slightly older version. You may notice the use of stock solar panels as opposed to the badass ones in NFP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img824/5325/mrlk.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mrlk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first one constructed is to be named the Nebulon. It will carry a small RCS tug for reorganizing the craft if necessary as well as two SSTOs for atmospheric planets (except the black hole, AKA Eve) and two kethane refueling landers. While it\u0027s possible to refuel from Kerbin, as well as pack all the fuel you\u0027d need (insanely difficult; please show me a successful mission doing this, I know of none), my mission will be kethane powered. That said, the requirements on the ketholanders are pretty high as they must be able to take off from the surface (fully fueled), unload raw kethane to be converted on board the Nebulon, and then go back down and land without refuelling off the Nebulong (or else this would take forever). On top of that, they need to be able to land on lot\u0027s of planets, from Ike to Eeloo to Moho to Minmus. They will be one of the more challenging aspects of this mission, not to mention the tedium of the dozen or so flights to fully fuel the behemoth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor one of the hard legs, I have developed this Tylo lander, the GravMax.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img689/9071/65z4.png\u0022 alt=\u002265z4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe upper stage has asparagus drop tanks while the lower stage has onion drop tanks with 48-7S engines on the bottom for better TWR while landing. It has just under 7.5km/s delta V, is pure chemical (so no irradiating potential surface samples), and has a consistent TWR over 1.5. The upper stage features the flattest 2.5m tank and 4 48-7S engines. These give it the delta V to land and take off pretty much anywhere. Now, it does not have parachutes to do atmospheric landings, as those are unusually heavy and shave almost 600 dV off, which is unacceptable. The SSTOs will be relegated to atmospheric landings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EMission Profile:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the mission profile is this. First, the Nebulon will run out to Jool. The GravMax Tylo lander upper stage has the TWR and dV to land on every non atmospheric body including the ever-tricky Vall. We\u0027ll top off with the ketholanders at Pol and then head back inward to Duna. The spaceplanes can handle an unpowered Duna descent and should be able to take back off on rockets alone. The Nebulon will be in a high orbit of 125-150km after aerobrake for that. After a successful Duna landing, the GravMax will be dispatched to Ike. With just over 2km/s dV in the upper stage, it should have no trouble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFollowing that, I\u0027m still debating where to go next. Eve was a target, but I am unsure if I want to tackle a challenge that hard this early in the tour. Unlike the GravMax, which has practical use after the Tylo landing, the Eve lander will likely be a one-time-use craft. Either way, time will tell on that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m open to suggestions. The second post will be reserved for the segment of this on the construction of the Nebulon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-29T01:15:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EPart 2: Assembly\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile many aspects of the actual utility section of the craft remain undetermined, the primary propulsion stage is a certainty. The drive stage was launched today into a 250km assembly orbit. Powered by twelve nuclear engines and fueled by a minimum of seven orange jumbo tanks, this thing will have immense delta V capacity. Preliminay maths indicate upwards of 6500m/s even with full payload including a Tylo certified GravMax lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img199/2113/k4tw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022k4tw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launcher was a 4 booster parallel staged launch vehicle with clustered engines. Each booster delivered 1490kN of thrust while the center stack powered out 2520kN, placing the drive stage in orbit with an RCS fueled Monotug. The tug will allow quick and sloppy docking of the fuel modules, simply to get the up there, and for more precise docking to be carried out later, in between tank arrivals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow is an included album of the next part, the heat shield. This will protect the craft during aerobraking maneuvers. After that, the fuel tank launches will commence.
