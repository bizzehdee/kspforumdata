The engineer report in the VAB/SPH is a good place to provide that information. dV and what it represents could also be KSPedia article as suggested. You can argue that it is not necessary to have a dV readout during flight, so you have a more traditional flight once you know the capabilities of your rocket, but it should be in the editors. I just think that along with orbital mechanics, dV should be one of those things that players naturally understand over time and not having that in stock limits that capability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have read far too many Reddit or imgur album comments about people who \u0022can\u0027t even get to orbit\u0022 or \u0022can\u0027t go to the moon\u0022 who might achieve those goals if the game helps them to learn about TWR, fuel, and the dV required to reach those goals.

So you can\u0027t make a easy level first in KSP, period, and without that , the typical \u0022 let\u0027s give them the bad stuff first, and the good one later\u0022 game design strategy devolves in a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Einverted\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0dificulty curve, with the hardest stuff being on the beginning and the game getting easier as you start getting the good stuff, that I assume is not the intended behaviour for most people \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn fact, if you peruse this same sub forum , you\u0027ll see a lot of complaints about people playing career ( or the new demo ) expressing their bafflement/anger about how hard the first steps of the game are or how utterly hard the new demo is compared with the previous ones ( or even stock ) because the SQUAD devs tried to create a learning curve by the method you\u0027re defending ( locking good parts, limting the size and weight of rockets, locking out action groups, mistaking a rover test facility with a landing strip for planes, making decouplers more expensive than ICBM capable rockets, locking out manouver nodes\u00A0) on top of a natural dificulty curve that is tilted in reverse of normal expectations , inadvertedly leading to making the game\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eeven more\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0dificult at the beginning than it naturally was, and this without considering that you at first are suposedely less experienced than later \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E ...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy point, in resume, is that the method you\u0027re describing to create a learning curve is a bad fit for KSP as it is now, a sandbox space exploration game where the hardest step is naturally to get to orbit aka the first thing you need to do in game. If KSP was some kind of episodic maps with a lot of Space centers scattered around the planetary system and you started in Gilly and that you progressed around the centers by order of dificulty of launching from them, yeah, bad Space center facilities and a small assortement of not as good parts would probably fit well and trial and error would peobably not be frustrating.

KSP is a rocket flight SIM, with the same type of learning curve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSim games have a completely different learning curve than other types of games, because \u003Cem\u003Ejust getting started is the hardest part\u003C/em\u003E, and things get progressively easier as you learn how to play.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou modify the difficulty curve by not flooding the player with too much, too fast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the same way you learn how to take off and land in a Cessna 172 before you even think of flying a Boeing 747, you give the player just the basic tools, and let them learn how to do the basic things. That\u0027s why you don\u0027t burden the new player with a ton of information they can\u0027t use yet. In fact, the takeoff, and landing is the hardest part of the entire flight, in exactly the same way learning how to orbit Kerbin is the hardest part of playing KSP.

Learning how to fly a plane is an entirely different process than learning something else, like driving a car. When you learn to drive a car, you start out by going slowly, usually in an empty parking lot or some such place. You then progress to higher speeds, more winding roads, and eventually arrive at the interstate highway.

My point about the dificulty curve was not on the dificulty curve in itself, but that locking features out at the begining of the game added dificulty to a already dificult situation in this game particular design choice ( while it is a perfectly valid way of scaling dificulty in other games, though ). I do understand your point about piloting ( actually a good one ), but it is not really aplicable in here because KSP has nothing like a flight instructor \u00A0helping you along the way in those hard moments where you\u0027re learning to go to orbit ( I suggested that years ago. Devs aparently thought tutorials were enough for that\u00A0), a thing that in RL smooths the learning of piloting a plane a lot compared with dropping a completely untrained person in the pilot seat alone \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour other point is about perceived dificulty and information overload.

It is perfectly aceptable in game design to toss stuff that you find that the player might need to but that is not immediatle needed or maybe intimidating in a second UI or under a advanced Tab. KSP already does that with a good bunch of the aero and thermal variables ( both via F11/12 or the Alf-F12 menus ...or even that tiny side menu on flight mode that gives you the wet mass among other things ), so I\u00A0don\u0027t really see how a dV number can be any worse than the lift vector on one part or it\u0027s thermal emmisivity...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n@HebaruSan\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst , let me point out that launch windows are more sugestions that hard physical contraints. They are just the best times dV wise for a Hohmann transfer ( so they might not be even the best option dV wise in general ) and they actually might not the best times to launch if your mission profile includes a return\u00A0from target ).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, note that going to the Mun also has launch windows and that you can also give 15 Km/s to a noob and he can also fail the Mun as well ;). In fact the more likely scenario for a noob player without any guidance from the forums is to miss the Mun even if with enough dV ...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird, from the point of view of a noob the game gives you exactly as many clues about when to launch to the Mun as when to launch a interplanetary flight. You can eyeball it because you either made the math ( like I, Scott Manley and others did back in the days the Mun was added to the game ) or heard about the \u0022Burn when the Mun rises above the horizon\u0022 rule of thumb either in the forums or on some RL Apollo missions related source. Note also that the stock game gives you enough intel to plan any transfer window you need interplanetary or not as long as you have acess to manouver nodes , \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/124338-how-to-fly-to-another-planets-effective-without-mechjeb/\u0026amp;page=2#comment-2260416\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Eas I describe here\u003C/a\u003E ( I agree it is cumbersome, unituitive and definitely not noob( or anyone )-friendly, but it was not me that designed the game \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u00A0).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat leaves point #4, the fact that interplanetary\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Efeels\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0harder than Kerbin mini-system stuff, while actually it isn\u0027t like that necessarily in anything besides number of oportunities to get stuff right per hour of game ( something that also depends of the top warp speed , so again UI issues ).

That might be desirable at times, but in general when you have something like that happening it is because either the gameplay or UI are lacking and IMHO in this case it is mostly the case that the UI does nothing to dispel the outside of game based idea that just because a trip is longer , it must be harder ( not even in RL that is true, but oh well ) and in fact in some areas the game reinforces that view ( the contract reward structure, for a example ).This is yet other area where IMHO the game UI is lacking ...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the point of Mun with LV-30 and 45 and low level KSC vs Eeloo or Moho with unlocked everything \u00A0... my point was that a good rule of thumb regarding game design is that the highest perceivable short term goal dificulty should be somewhat constant during a game ( to avoid bottlenecks ) and that like the highest dificulty goal you can perceive in game in terms of doing a actual trip is going to Moho or Eeloo , the highest dificulty goal a noob player can see in it\u0027s short term list is going to the Mun ( the game literally opens with either kerbals in Kerbin orbit with the Mun rising in their\u00A0backs or with a Kerbal in the ( fake \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u00A0) Mun with a crashed ship, your first launch with occur at Munrise as seen from KSC, the contract structure puts it as the obvious target after going to orbit ... any normal person would assume that going to the Mun is on the short term menu list \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u00A0).
