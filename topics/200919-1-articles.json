I remember that the same people that claimed to capture the audio that you linked also created several more like one that supposedly captured a cosmonaut accidentally veering into deep space. Now it is highly improbable that you can accidentally veer off into deep space, first of all is that the Vostok spacecraft of the time only had enough fuel to de-orbit and that\u0027s it, second lets say they had some other more powerful spacecraft that would have enough delta v to exit LEO you cannot \u0022accidentally\u0022 fire your engine for long enough to\u00A0 push you into deep space if you did have an accidental thruster firing it would only be enough to scare you a little bit. Also in the recordings the \u0022cosmonauts\u0022 don\u0027t even follow standard soviet radio terminology. And even more evidence is that in a few of the recordings some of the dialogue has no meaning in Russian (think something like florp or droy that has no meaning) this does not make sense as the USSR\u0027s space program only hired fluent Russian speakers.
