You need to put a decoupler between your engine and the fairing. The fairing base does NOT act as a decoupler and will block the engine when you activate it, making it so you are unable to get thrust from that stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2) It looks like the fairing piece is bugged out somehow. You should have something that looks like this upon attaching the piece:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nhgmCpY.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nhgmCpY.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo on your rocket try removing the fairing piece completely and start from scratch with a new part. When what you have looks like the above you should notice that now you MUST build the fairing around the payload, and until the fairing is closed that is all the game will allow you to do. In order to do this simply move your mouse and you should see the fairing trying to match what you are indicating. Once the fairing is above the payload you should be able to create a point which will signal to the fairing base that this is the last \u0022piece\u0022 of the fairing and will close when you create it. I created an album if you need help: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/PqOgv#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFairings - How To\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have done the above you will be able to grab new parts to attach to the bottom of the rocket. Was that enough or are you still having problems?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T05:55:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re not using a stock fairing part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lohan2008","CreatedById":80945,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T06:30:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eprotective shell worked.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
