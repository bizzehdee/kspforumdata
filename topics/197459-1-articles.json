So I built the base, and regardless of whether I take it out to the launch pad or the runway (to check to make sure I\u0027ve met all of the requirements of the contract), the program won\u0027t recognize that there are motorized wheels on the base. The beast even starts rolling around. I\u0027ve tried all three versions of the motorized wheels. There\u0027s batteries and solar panels galore to provide power.\u00A0\u00A0What am I missing???\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
