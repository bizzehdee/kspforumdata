A basic jet engine plane can\u0027t get that high, as far as I can tell. I have to use rockets to get above 12-13km.\n\nI think these missions were balanced based on the old aerodynamics and engines where reaching 20km was easy, and they should be rebalanced around the new systems. Change the ~18kk thresholds to ~10km."}]}
