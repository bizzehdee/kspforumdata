In the end, I got it as tall as the VAB, and it weighed in at a whopping 304.4 tons. After letting it settle on the pad for a minute, I launched this behemoth and got it into a rather eccentric orbit with a PeK of 90KM and ApK of over 1MM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also made a light version by stripping off the bottom most two stages. This not quit so tall rocket weighs in at 206.1 tons, and it can make it into LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"scratch","CreatedById":228,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-14T09:22:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs tall?
