But anyway, to another offtopic tangent. (Is there any topic here at all yet?) I wrote a story in to sort of work on my ability to have characters say stuff, and/or to even have unique characters, so I wrote this. Here it is. I hope you like it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah looked out his cockpit on either side, scanning the sea below him for his squadron\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s target. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CLooks like we missed \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153em boys.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 He said into his radio. Then he spotted something. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWait a minute, scratch that. Looks like we may have found them!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 He said excitedly. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CSurface targets, bearing 45 degrees northeast at about 30 knots! All planes, for up on me!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 He put his plane into a turn to port, coming around towards the fleet of enemy ships. The squadron of dive-bombers formed up behind his plane and headed towards their target. They climbed to 10,000 feet. As they approached, Jeb made sure everything was ready. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CSound off squad.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 He said. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CBurbles reporting ready for action!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CHaldo Reporting in!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CErwell Ready!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CBarman Reporting Read!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201COkay then,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Jeb said, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CLet\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s give\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2em Hell boys!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Shouting back to his gunner, he said, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CPut on War Ops. Make it loud. This is a Romeo Foxtrot; Shall we dance?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Bob started up the tape player, and the sound of Wagner\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s flight of the Valkyries blasted out of the speakers in his plane. He put his plane into a steep dive and deployed the dive flaps. The enemy fleet, alerted by the music coming from the sky, saw the five planes diving towards them and opened up. Flak burst all around Jeb as his plane shot down through the clouds. His radio crackled to life, and he heard Erwell\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s voice frantically shout \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CMayday! Mayday! I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m hit!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 as his plane fell in a trail of smoke and flames. Jeb ignored it, staying on target, waiting for the bombsight to line up. It did, and he shouted, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CNow!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 as he released the bomb and pulled up. The bomb detached from the plane, and angled downwards, its arming pin spinning off in the air. It smashed into the decking of the enemy carrier with a \u003Cem\u003ECrash! \u003C/em\u003Ebefore exploding. As Jeb leveled off and looked back, he saw the damage his bomb had done, and the damage of the others. Radioing in, he reported the location of the enemy fleet to his carrier, and headed back with the rest of his squadron.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. My great grandfather flew a divebomber much like those in this story in WWII. He was shot down at the battle of the Coral Sea after having led the attacks that sank one japanese carrier and damaged another. He was on the carrier Lexington, which was sunk their. He was awarded the Posthumous Navy Cross and had a naval airfield, Ault Field, named after him, as well as the destroyer USS Ault. I guess this is kind of a tribute to him.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sanic","CreatedById":149920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-15T19:45:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy grandfather served two weeks before being discharged because the war ended \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThePULSAR","CreatedById":150820,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T10:29:41Z","Content":"\nDon\u0026#39;t use KAX,Use Firespitter\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Generalstarwars333","CreatedById":151938,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T03:42:25Z","Content":"\nI\u0026#39;ve tried to use firespitter in the past (1.0.4).

KAX has had no problems like that, except for a sudden annoying lack of noise from the propellers, as well as a loss of animations. The jumpjets work, and all the parts produce thrust the same.
