That translates to a ~6Mm apoapsis for your relay satellite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELess to worry about farthest point as only dish range would matter, and remotetech part list wiki already tells you the capability of each antenna. It\u0027s also easy to calculate yourself - add Kerbin radius to Duna apoapsis gives less than 36Gm, which is just within 88-88 range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that the calculation is simple because Kerbin eccentricity is 0. If you compare two ellipses, then a similar estimate would be less precise and probably better off using another estimate method.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T16:15:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, the simple answer is that the 88-88 is good for anything out to Duna. Can even reach from Kerbin to Dres, but only if the planets line up right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo until you go past Duna, the 88-88 will take care of all your needs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
