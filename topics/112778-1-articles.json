Also distance at farthest point would be great too!\n\nI use remotetech with the setting to increase range with multiple antennas so I want to make sure I have the range I need before I set out!"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T18:29:06Z","Content":"Check the [wiki](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Main_Page) for details on Kerbin and Duna. All the info you need is right there. Some basic arithmetic and you\u0027ll have your answer."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T20:06:42Z","Content":"To be pessimistic you just subtract Kerbin radius from Duna periapsis - and because of Duna\u0027s low inclination, this lower bound is actually quite precise - that\u0027s about 6Gm. 88-88 gives dish range 0.06 degree. That translates to a ~6Mm apoapsis for your relay satellite.\n\nLess to worry about farthest point as only dish range would matter, and remotetech part list wiki already tells you the capability of each antenna. It\u0027s also easy to calculate yourself - add Kerbin radius to Duna apoapsis gives less than 36Gm, which is just within 88-88 range.\n\nNote that the calculation is simple because Kerbin eccentricity is 0. If you compare two ellipses, then a similar estimate would be less precise and probably better off using another estimate method."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T16:15:35Z","Content":"Yeah, the simple answer is that the 88-88 is good for anything out to Duna. Can even reach from Kerbin to Dres, but only if the planets line up right.\n\nSo until you go past Duna, the 88-88 will take care of all your needs."}]}
