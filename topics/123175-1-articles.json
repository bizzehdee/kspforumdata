I told him that was called a rocket. He told me he wanted a plane. SO, after homework, I put a ramjet on the Aeris 3A and took it for a spin with valentina in the cockpit. (jeb was in orbit on the kerbal X, stranded there until I decide to maybe get him down or possibly de-orbit him if his ship has an engine and some fuel...) Here\u0027s what happened...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EValentin climbed into the cockpit of the new plane. She had orders to test its capabilities, and to preferably get it back without using the time traveler device. She turned on the SAS, throttled up all the way, and engaged the engine. It built up to a roar, and the plane started to accelerate down the runway. At about 90 m/s and 1/4 the way down the runway, she pitched up, and lifted off. She then continued to pitch up, and accelerated straight up. To her surprise, the plane continued to accelerate, almost to mach 1. Nosing over, she was pushed into her seat momentarily, and to her surprise saw that the plane was actually losing speed as it went into a dive. Pulling up, she leveled out and continued past mach 1. She rolled 90 degrees to the right and pulled back on the stick, pulling lots of G\u0027s as she turned back towards the ksc. She dived, buzzed the VAB, and then pulled up. As she continued into the grasslands, she did a bit of a barrel roll, followed by an aileron roll, followed by a sort or spiral barrel roll, followed by another barrel roll. Then, she pulled up and around in a reverse Immelman, making sure to pull all of the G\u0027s. All of them. She pulled each and everyone of the G\u0027s. Then, as she approached the VAB, she cut off the engine, and angled over towards the runway. She lined herself up eventually, and touched down at roughly 60 m/s. She turned on the brakes, and, seeing that she wasn\u0027t decelerating enough, started to deploy the flaps. She finally rolled to a stop about 30 meters from the end of the runway, and radioed back to the control tower that they could take her back in. A fine flight indeed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.: This was my first landing. Also, this is kind of cruddy, but I was seized by the urge to write about my experience last night, so yeah. stuffs. squirrels. millions of them really.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-18T15:17:18Z\u0022 title=\u002210/18/2015 03:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Generalstarwars333\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
