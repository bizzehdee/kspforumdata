The issue seems to be the sloped I-bars underneath the wheels, but there only seems to be a problem when the wheels themselves are mounted on a structural panel. When the wheels are mounted on another I-bar (as in the picture below), no problem at all. Why this would be, I have no idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5I7DFMc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00225I7DFMc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, It became a service buggy I\u0027m pretty pleased with. Case closed, unless somebody wants to hunt down the reasons for the I-bar/structural panel behaviour.
