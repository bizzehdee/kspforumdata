Just give it enough intake to stay lit up to 23 km or so. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If you can get it past about 360 m/sec then it will be capable of exceeding 1 km/sec and possibly as much as 1600 m/sec depending on how it\u0027s built.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So get it up to 18km and get all the speed out of air- breathing mode you can while you drift up over 20km. Then engage closed cycle and proceed like any other rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E SSTO spaceplanes are a little more difficult than they used to be, but not all that much.
