The ascent used a launch vehicle consisting of the EFT and LRBs you have seen previously, and played out very much like a Space Shuttle launch. The shuttle circularised at 80 Km. Re-entry was achieved at a constant pitch of 10 degrees (though a higher pitch would probably be more realistic). The landing worked first time, touching down on the dotted line at 192mph and braking well before the end of the runway. No parts malfunctioned or broke, and no debris were left in orbit. Sorry, I have no screenshots - I was concentrating too much. KCA worked well throughout the flight, balancing the engine thrusts at all stages of the launch, and orienting the shuttle in orbit using RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"irishmanerrant","CreatedById":57566,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T18:32:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThree Cheers!

As such any dV I come up with (which would require me to go and add KER or MJ to the installation) would likely be quite different from the final value, which is what you\u0027re really interested in. An LRB currently does not come with an engine of its own - for the time being I am using stock Mainsail engines, which are a bit too powerful and thirsty. Similarly, an SSME is currently equivalent in ISP and power to an LV -T45, and an OMS engine is equivalent to an LV-909. This is very likely to change significantly. The current configurations are just to get everything in the right ballpark (in some cases a very large ballpark) whilst features are added so that they can be tested. Once we reach the feature-complete stage I will focus entirely on balancing all the stats, including the dV. The final system will very likely be reliant on Modular Fuel System for H2/O2 in the main tank supplying the SSMEs, and LF/O in the orbiter supplying the OMSEs. The engine stats will be changed to reflect their fuel input. I will also be basing the fuel amounts on volumes within the parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, here\u0027s a few screenshots for you all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/DOY5p\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

So I will first figure out the volumes of fuel that can be stored in the shuttle, then derive everything else from there, including the required engine thrusts, ISP curves, practical range (which may be interplanetary, Kerbin SOI, or less), etc. I would really like to use Modular Fuel System, since it would force the correct use of the EFT, SSMEs and OMSEs, as well as make the fuel capacity of the EFT realistic (an LF/O EFT would be much smaller than the current one). It would also make for some interesting gameplay regarding any refuelling trips. If you are worrying about any effects MFS would have on other parts, it can easily be restricted to work on only select parts. Also, compatibility with, for example, Kethane, should be straightforward via a combination of Module Manager and the recent improvements Majiir has made to Kethane\u0027s extensibility.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mekan1k","CreatedById":48750,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T21:45:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk.

Luckily the cameras are customisable, so I moved them up to points on the forward windows in front of each Kerbal, and oriented them and changed the FOV to fit in their heads at this close range. You may notice the slight jaunty angle to it. Normal Kerbal cams fit in the most of the rest of the body as well as the head, but there is no clean way to do that in the confines of this cockpit. The camera positions for the rear two Kerbals should be easier to set up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gojira","CreatedById":10884,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T23:02:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWould there be a way to change the cfgs myself to avoid the use of modular fuel?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sapphire","CreatedById":67918,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T23:05:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gojira\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Gojira\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWould there be a way to change the cfgs myself to avoid the use of modular fuel?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to know this too.
