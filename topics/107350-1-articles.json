Part of the issue seems to be Squad has taken a lot of players spoiled to a certain method of play outside of their comfort zone. Something I actually don\u0027t see as an issue, except for the plethora of complaints that have spawned because of it. Every time Squad has changed the rules to a significant bit, the game always feels fresh to me, with new challenges. By your thinking you would prefer it go back to the old way, just with more new parts to play with. That isn\u0027t going to happen, at least the former bit. It\u0027s a brave new world in KSP, and you can either make the effort to discard everything you have learned so as to take on the new, or you can try something else. Sitting their complaining about you not liking your new version that got served to you is doing nothing but annoying everyone else at the table.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI read through a lot of forum posts after 1.0.2 came out, claiming there were a lot of problems with it. Then I booted up KSP and gave it a whirl with a few rockets, and found none of those issues present. I didn\u0027t even have to retry a launch to do something different. Heck, I even took the Kerbal X up, and I found myself actually pulling off a more efficient launch to the point I think a Munar landing and return is now possible with that crazy craft (where before you had to try real hard to manage only a Munar landing)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, there are some glitches and bugs that could be addressed.
