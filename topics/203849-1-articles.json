I had grabbed a large first stage that was also debris that needed to be in control of for a mission. Since I can\u0027t ever seem to get \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E controls to actually do there job in relations to the\u00A0 major axis of movement, I just grabbed it as it is and it was moving around a bit too much. So I unlocked the Big Grabber pivot and moved around until it mostly parallel. Then I sent out my engineer to to attach a strut. I read, from the wiki I believe, about attaching it to the older part first, which I did. Then target my next piece of junk and made a slight adjustment in orbit for a closer approach. The approach was on the other side and I then hit fast forward while in the map view. It almost instantly popped me back to the ship view to see a puff of smoke and one more Kerbal killed in the line of duty by a kraken.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I said I read about this bug, but the sage advice didn\u0027t seem to help.

Fortunately this is a construction tug so I have a bunch of spare parts. But even after rearranging the blocks with my engineer \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E blocks are junk at maintaining an attitude and need perfect alignment with the center of gravity amongst numerous other variables to avoid spinning. (Which I\u0027ve started utilize time warp to stop, a quick \u0026gt;\u0026amp;\u0026lt;) My next attempt will be with AGU on a stick (another major major bug is the lack of lateral reinforcement) so not sure if a second grab can be done using a large hydraulic piston.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd my final fumble will be slap a HEC controller on the first stage and transfer some fuel and let it fly itself to my space station.
