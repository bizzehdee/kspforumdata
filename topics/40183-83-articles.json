I reviewed the thread in the Add-On Development subforum. I see that additional contracts, such as MCE, must create contracts in a compiled .DLL file. One poster mentioned it would have been preferred if contracts could have been defined in a text file. If only Squad had looked at MCE vers 1.0 to see how you\u0027re SUPPOSED to accomplish this task.

As a developer for over 40 years and having written at least 500,000 lines of code in a variety of languages (assembler, C, C\u002B\u002B, C#, and many others), I found the stupidity of his statement to be beyond comprehension. C\u002B\u002B, and C# are daunting for even for programmers who are unfamiliar with object-oriented methodologies and algorithms. To suggest that a neophyte, or even non-programmer, just slap together a C# program is asinine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, C# requires purchasing of MS Visual Studio, which is a lot to lay out just to make missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(/rant)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving ranted above, is there way for you to \u0022recreate\u0022 your MCE 1.0 contract structure and semi-integrate it into the PoS that is KSP\u0027s Contract system?
