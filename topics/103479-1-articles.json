You are most likely experiencing a specific situation that for one reason or another, mechjeb wasn\u0027t designed to handle. Mechjeb is like a screwdriver set with multiple driver bits. The autopilot is trying to figure out which bit to use on a screw it hasn\u0027t seen before. You are going to have to figure out which bit works best for special case situations. That is just a quick and dirty answer based on the info you have given. You are going to have to supply much more info to properly diagnose the situation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T23:12:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat Otis said.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tg626","CreatedById":112361,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T02:49:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell I was going to make a video showing the behavior but I couldn\u0027t resist tinkering before I did and if course it flew fine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt boils down to how mj behaves with a craft that lacks pitch authority. It does the same thing with planes as well. But I guess in the end what it is really showing is a design flaw. In the craft that is.
