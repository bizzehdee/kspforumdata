You are most likely experiencing a specific situation that for one reason or another, mechjeb wasn\u0027t designed to handle. Mechjeb is like a screwdriver set with multiple driver bits. The autopilot is trying to figure out which bit to use on a screw it hasn\u0027t seen before. You are going to have to figure out which bit works best for special case situations. That is just a quick and dirty answer based on the info you have given. You are going to have to supply much more info to properly diagnose the situation."},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T23:12:07Z","Content":"What Otis said."},{"CreatedByName":"tg626","CreatedById":112361,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T02:49:21Z","Content":"Well I was going to make a video showing the behavior but I couldn\u0027t resist tinkering before I did and if course it flew fine. \n\nIt boils down to how mj behaves with a craft that lacks pitch authority. It does the same thing with planes as well. But I guess in the end what it is really showing is a design flaw. In the craft that is. I still wonder tho what in the logic makes it give up and start over when it can\u0027t attain the desired pitch/ flight path."},{"CreatedByName":"moogoob","CreatedById":118251,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T17:19:23Z","Content":"That\u0027s odd - MJ\u0027s always allowed me to toggle RCS manually. Ascent, landings, whatever. What autopilot module are you trying to use? Maybe there\u0027s an advanced option somewhere you clicked? (for example, one optional thing MJ does is use any rearward-facing RCS nozzles as engines if you either have no engines or have run out of fuel)"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T04:59:53Z","Content":"Well, it might be easier to upload the craft file, post the link, and provide a few steps on how to reproduce the error. A short explanation of the intended goal, like reach orbit or orbit the mun or whatever, so that we can try to reproduce. Recording video, editing, and uploading is time consuming, I know. Uploading a craft file takes about 1 second."},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T11:01:23Z","Content":"I would like to point to a recent post in the MJ thread that show exactly how I like bug to be reported \u003E\u003E\u003E[here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/12384-PART-0-90-Anatid-Robotics-MuMech-MechJeb-Autopilot-v2-4-2?p=1822258\u0026viewfull=1#post1822258)\u003C\u003C\u003C\n\nI was able to find the origin of the bug ans fix it in less than 15 minutes.
