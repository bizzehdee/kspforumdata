Some times, when I\u0027ve completeed a flight and landed or if I switch back to the space port The game goes back in time to the launch. Every thing reverts. So like this last time. I sent out a probe to reestablish contact with another using an Omni antenna. To do this I actually had to go back and forth to a couple of other vessels to line up the right antennas. All was good. I actually went on to finish a mission that was approaching Minmus. It landed safely and all was well till I hit the recover space craft green button and the whole game reverted to the launch of the rescue probe. I\u0027ve had it happen on less complicated missions. Just launching a satellite. I get it just where I want. Hit escape and return to space center. Not revert flight. And it takes me back to launch as if the flight never happened. And I did not hit revert flight to launch. I\u0027ve been watching this. Saving the game does not help. It doesn\u0027t happen all the time or I\u0027d still be on my first flight but it\u0027s happening enough that it\u0027s getting annoying. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEver seen this?
