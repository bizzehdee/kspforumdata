Some times, when I\u0027ve completeed a flight and landed or if I switch back to the space port The game goes back in time to the launch. Every thing reverts. So like this last time. I sent out a probe to reestablish contact with another using an Omni antenna. To do this I actually had to go back and forth to a couple of other vessels to line up the right antennas. All was good. I actually went on to finish a mission that was approaching Minmus. It landed safely and all was well till I hit the recover space craft green button and the whole game reverted to the launch of the rescue probe. I\u0027ve had it happen on less complicated missions. Just launching a satellite. I get it just where I want. Hit escape and return to space center. Not revert flight. And it takes me back to launch as if the flight never happened. And I did not hit revert flight to launch. I\u0027ve been watching this. Saving the game does not help. It doesn\u0027t happen all the time or I\u0027d still be on my first flight but it\u0027s happening enough that it\u0027s getting annoying. \n\nEver seen this? Any clue what I might be doing to cause this and any way to avoid this?\n\nLee"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T05:27:53Z","Content":"The Golden Question: Are you using any mods?"},{"CreatedByName":"RiggerLee","CreatedById":110780,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T05:37:58Z","Content":"I\u0027m running quite a few mods. They seem to play well with each other on the whole. I\u0027m not suffering game crashes unless you count this reverting to launch. Its not happening at any other time then when I hit recover or return to space center. I would think that that would be part of the core game. I suppose there could be a weird synergy happening here but I wouldn\u0027t expect it. Of course I\u0027m rather naive. \n\nLee"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T05:46:52Z","Content":"This is one such issue I\u0027ve never heard of. It\u0027s possible that the autosave feature is set to NaN. Try going into your files and seeing if that\u0027s true. If not, you could just quicksave at the end of each mission and move the states to the persistent file, but can\u0027t say for sure. This is certainly unusual."},{"CreatedByName":"RiggerLee","CreatedById":110780,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T06:00:16Z","Content":"Took me a minute to make the list and I had to rescue dinner from the oven.\n\nToolbar\n\nAutoasparagus\n\nCacteye2\n\nChatterer\n\nCommunity resource pack\n\nContracts window\n\nDavon supply mod\n\nDeadly reentry\n\nDmagic orbital science\n\nEnhanced nav ball\n\nFAR\n\nFMRS\n\nHexcans\n\nJfjohnny5\n\nKamik423\n\nKas\n\nKerbalengineer\n\nKsp avc\n\nMission controller ec\n\nNano cube\n\nNasa mission\n\nNear future solar\n\nNehemiah inc\n\nOblivion aerospace\n\nQuick mute\n\nRealchute\n\nRemotetech\n\nRLA electricengines\n\nRla stockalike\n\nRomfarer lazor docking cam\n\nSafechute\n\nScansat\n\nSquad\n\nStation science\n\nThunder aerospace\n\nTrigger tech\n\nUs curse 0.9\n\nXander tek\n\nLee"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T18:11:55Z","Content":"Sorry to hear your having this issue. It\u0027s weird, on of the few things I have not heard of before Oo\n\nWhile I am afraid I cannot help you I\u0027m reasonably sure that anyone capable of helping you will need your output.log from when this happens. Try reproducing it and then get the log file, upload it somewhere and then link it here.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Originally posted by Claw:\n\u003E \n\u003E When KSP crashes it will general a folder with files with details surrounding the crash. Usually a window will pop up ingame asking you to send this information to the developers, along with the name of the folder. You can find this folder in the KSP install directory.\n\u003E \n\u003E If KSP **doesn\u0027t** crash, start KSP and cause the problem. Quit KSP and find the output\\_log.txt (**not** the KSP.log) at the location below:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - Windows: KSP\\_win\\KSP\\_Data\\output\\_log.txt -OR- KSP\\_win64\\KSP\\_x64\\_DATA\\output\\_log.txt (depending on which used)  \n\u003E  - In case you installed KSP into a Windows protected directory (C:\\Users, C:\\Program Files or C:\\Windows\\ and their subfolders) the output log file may be stored in the folder called C:\\Users\\[username]\\Appdata, this folder is usually hidden so you should enable the view hidden folders option ([more information](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/35464-Cant-find-your-save-files-Read-this)). Note that for the demo you should find the output\\_log.txt file located in the KSP\\_Data folder.  \n\u003E  - Steam users should right click KSP in Steam, click on Properties, then in the Properties box, click Local Files, then Browse Local Files.\n\u003E - Mac OSX: Open Console, on the left side of the window there is a menu that says \u0027files\u0027. Scroll down the list and find the Unity drop down, under Unity there will be Player.log Aka Files\u003E~/Library/Logs\u003EUnity\u003EPlayer.log\n\u003E - Linux: The log is written to /home/user/.config/unity3d/Squad/Kerbal Space Program/Player.log\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E You can upload these files to any file sharing site (such as [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com/), [Mediafire](http:///) or [File2web](http://file2web.com/)). These sites will give you a link you can include in your posts to share your files.\n\u003E \n\u003E The output and crash logs are useful because they help us understand exactly what you were doing when the issue happened by providing a \u0022play-by-play reenactment\u0022 (in text form) of your KSP session. Anything out of the ordinary will often show up in the log files, and it gives us a good idea of where to start looking for solutions.\n\u003E \n\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"RiggerLee","CreatedById":110780,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T04:43:02Z","Content":"Ok.

I\u0027m not mod savvy myself, but I am log digging savvy out of professional necessity and I think this line in your output log may have something to tell you.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E #### FMRS: add to recover file: warning = FMRS Info: = You have switched scenes, while controlling a dropped vessel.@Next time, please use the \u0027Jump back to Main Mission\u0027 button, before switching scenes.\n\nQuick look at what FMRS is it definitely looks like a mod that could cause you to suddenly and uncontrollably jump back in time. Considering it says that it is meant to controlledly jump you back and forth in time."}]}
