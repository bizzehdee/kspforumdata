This applies for all intercepts, except on places with an atmosphere because if you\u0027re aerobraking it doesn\u0027t really matter if you come in too fast.

To avoid these problems, I aim to encounter Gilly when it\u0027s way out near its Eve Ap, so both it and my ship are moving very slowly. Also, I aim for the shallowest crossing angle between its path and mine. These 2 things make my ship arrive with very little relative velocity compared to Gilly, so capturing there is a breeze.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make this happen, I do the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Aerocapture at Eve into a huge elliptical orbit with an Ap about equal to the MINOR axis of Gilly\u0027s ovate orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Coast out to this Ap and circularize there. My orbit thus overlaps Gilly\u0027s, sticking outside its at the Eve end and cutting inside its about in the middle. As shown here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3755/10679724373_88b2f34d61.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210679724373_88b2f34d61.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Match planes with Gilly. Hugely important because Gilly\u0027s SOI is so small that you\u0027ll never hit it if you\u0027re having to do vertical as well as horizontal node fiddling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Now it\u0027s a questions of fiddling with a maneuver node to get an intercept out near Gilly\u0027s Ap. This can be a bit time-consuming because getting your intercept depends on the phasing you have with Gilly after you establish your orbit, which is a matter of luck. I always start this process with the node on Gilly\u0027s Pe side of Eve as shown in the pic above. That way, as I pull on the prograde gizmo and my orbit expands, it crosses most of Gilly\u0027s path out toward the Ap end. You\u0027ll probably get several encounters at different places as you fiddle with this. With any luck, one of them will be out near Gilly\u0027s Ap and at a pretty shallow angle, like that shown above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. If you don\u0027t get a good encounter this way, you need to change your phasing with Gilly. Do a small burn at where the node\u0027s shown in the pic to make your own orbit a bit egg-shaped with its major axis more or less parallel to that of Gilly\u0027s. Go around this orbit and when you return to the Eve end, put a node there again and repeat step 4.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T14:36:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne point You want to orbit in high Eve orbit, if your Eve intercept is good it will not be economical to aerobrake around Eve as you use more fuel lifting your orbit enough for an Gilly intercept than you earn aerobraking.
