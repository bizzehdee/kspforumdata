However, having too many vectoring engines can be a problem, especially with mechjeb. modded vectoring engines with too much range are also a problem too (novapunch).

It seems that when they are used with SAS, they cause control problems. I believe this is due to a bug in the game causing them to produce a small amount of asymetic thrust (AKA, the infini-glide bug.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it is truly thrust vectoring, make sure you are not using the stock aerospike or the LVT-30. Neither of these engines have thrust vectoring.

I made an ultra-simple craft to show that, so it contains a FL-T800 fuel tank, an LV-T45 engine a guidance unit and some batteries. You can see it on the first picture. I enabled the engine, added minimal trust and toggled the gimbal. On the second picture notice the roll, yaw and pitch controlls are off-set (lower left corner).
