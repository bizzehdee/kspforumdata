This is not only active, but it is running with 80%-100% of my CPU and 1.4-1.6 GB of my RAM. I wait for a few minutes, about the same time it would normally take KSP to load up, and then... Intro Music! However, no window loads, and the menu does not load. Instead I merely get the intro music followed by the menu music on loop, with that process still there, and still at high memory usage. I thought this was normal, so I waited 15 minutes... 52 minutes, and counting now. That menu music continues to play as I type this.
