I have also looked at the .cfg files to see if font size was changeable, but have not been unable to find the code. These leads me to believe the font size in right click menus and pop-up boxes is hard coded in the game. As 4k gaming is now becoming more popular this desperately needs to be changed. The font size should scale with the screen resolution size, or have an independent slider in the options to allow people to adjust it. This is not only a good idea for those with 4k compliant hardware, but will also help people who are visually impaired. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have read some of the workarounds people have suggested, and i have tried them all. Here are findings for these \u0027workarounds\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Lower resolution to 1080p : This isn\u0027t a work around. This is a downgrade. It DOES NOT alter the problem, which is text size in 4k resolutions. Yes it makes the text readable, but it doesn\u0027t allow 4k gaming, and also, on a 65\u0022 screen, it makes the game look awful. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Use the in-game UI scaler : Again this doesn\u0027t work. This affects only the in-flight HUD not the menu or pop-up descriptions. Also, it doesn\u0027t actually help with the HUD. The issue seems to be that the UI does not scale with resolution, but is again coded to a pixel count. Using the standard HUD size, it is so small the staging and toolbar buttons are almost invisible, and when scaled up to max it still takes up less screen area than standard HUD size at 1080p resolutions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESolutions :\u003C/strong\u003E Have the HUD, text and menus of the game coded to fill a % of the screen, not a pixel count. Then have a UI scaler which affects ALL aspects of the GUI, increase or decrease that %. Even just an option to set the global font size would help and make the game playable in 4k.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel it is a great shame that this has been overlooked, as in 4k this game is beyond beautiful. When just flying a craft the game becomes breathtakingly gorgeous. However, right now i have the option to have a beautiful game with almost no functionality, or a functional game that looks bad. I\u0027m having to make do with the later, but i really want both.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-02T16:54:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs you\u0027ve presented it, this is a development suggestion rather than a support topic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I\u0027d like to see it resolved in 1.0 but I don\u0027t see it as a showstopper issue.

But now, dynamic super resolution / \u0022downscaling\u0022 is a thing with both AMD and Nvidia\u0027s latest cards, and will be standard from here on out.

One year down the road, a good 20% of the playerbase might be on 4K or a similar 150-200 DPI screen, and another 20% are not but would like to use dynamic super resolution. And all of them will have severe issues with UI readability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWho knows, if this requires an UI rewrite, and Unity 5 requires significant porting effort, it might be a good idea to combine these two, whenever Unity 5 rolls around.
