The range change only applies when talking back to Kerbin -- ranges to other relays are calculated exactly the same. Also, Kerbin\u0027s radius is really quite small in relation to my stock antenna ranges; only the monopole gets an even quasi-meaningful boost, it\u0027s 2% of the medium dish and 0.00075% of the long-range dish. I\u0027m not planning to rebalance my antennas. But, if you have antennas that are intended to have a really short range and are intended primarily for use on Kerbin -- maybe for aircraft or something? -- then it might be worth reducing their range by 600,000 m.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-06T23:27:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022toadicus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022toadicus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eeddiew\u003C/strong\u003E, yes they would! By default, AntennaRange will not require line of sight, so a single communications satellite in low Munar orbit with an antenna big enough to talk back to Kerbin will provide a consistent connection for your rovers. At the Space Center, though, you can open up the AntennaRange config options (the icon is a little green satellite) and enable line of sight requirements, along with a handful of other options. I strongly recommend the line of sight option; it makes things much more realistic and at least a bit more fun. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAwesome, thanks for the quick answer!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnnoyingly I have just realised that I have \u0022whip-only\u0022 probes en-route to Jool and Eeloo (which I have never been to before), so I will have to hold off on using AR for a little while - but I shall definitely build all future probes with an appropriate antenna.

I have a rover design, and its designed to stay out in the field, and I don\u0027t recover it. It has a kerbal on it in a command chair, with an antenna on the rover. The issue is sometimes, not always, if I leave the rover to go back to KSC, then come back to it, the rover is frozen, as if it was an unmanned probe out of connection. The reason I suspect this mod, is because if I get another kerbal out to the rover, and with KAS pull the antenna off, and remount it, the rover comes back on line. I\u0027m not sure though, as there\u0027s no error log, and nothing shows in the debug menu as far as I can see.

It always seemed stupid to me that the higher-tier stock antennas were literally useless, and RemoteTech with its directional antennas, signal processors that don\u0027t work with most mods and signal delay is just too hardcore. AR is right in the sweet spot, where it adds some immersive realism and additional difficulty without being annoying, and the difficulty options make it great for both new and experienced players. But there\u0027s just one thing I\u0027d really like to see added: a way to see connections between your ships and KSC in the map view and/or tracking station, it would be really helpful when using the line-of-sight option.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
