Everywhere, they\u0027re happy. What do I do? Is there some mod that lets you change whether a Kerbal is happy or not, or a stock way to do it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey don\u0027t have to be scared or sad, just neutral. Also, for your information, these Kerbals are in chairs. If I put them inside the ship, they\u0027re neutral, but when then in chairs, they\u0027re having the time of their life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I just decided to make the Kerbals stand for the scene. It worked out OK. The best way to make them frown are to have things explode near by them. Most Kerbals like to be neutral. If you want Kerbals to smile, simply hack gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-30T22:06:29Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2014 10:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Andrew Hansen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-30T03:42:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmmm, I\u0027d be interested in hearing from folks who already do this sort of thing. You might ask Felbourn as he makes cinematographic stuff, often quite complex.

Most of the videos are him explaining his rocket designs and modding, but the cinematographic stuff (which he never seems to explain) is the last few minutes of most of the videos. But IIRC he\u0027s on vacation for another week or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the meantime, you might experiment. Use Kerbals with different mixes of stupidity and bravery. Provide some off-screen stress-creating things like rockets firing, things exploding, or put the entire set in orbit and have it reentering as you\u0027re filming on the inside. The Kerbals with the lower bravery scores tend to frown/scream a lot when such things are going on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andrew Hansen","CreatedById":82311,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-30T12:56:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks Geschosskkpof for your answer. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApparently, having less stupidity will result in Kerbals being more scared, according to the wiki.
