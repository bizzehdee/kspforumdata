It would be worth it to do some short cut on this, because otherwise they are too limited to be of any real potential. Maybe they just calculate a new orbit when you switch back to them without worry about the details.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dewin","CreatedById":96372,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-19T18:38:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHonestly, having run into this problem myself even with some LV-N powered craft, I think that there needs to be some sort of way to handle extremely long burns better myself. Something\u0027s wrong if I have to go back and add engines to a craft simply because I don\u0027t want to wait 5 real minutes for a burn (at 4x physwarp)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe adding higher levels of physwarp that are only enabled outside of atmosphere is an option.

And as long as the projected positions never fell within an atmosphere, or too close to other bodies, and didn\u0027t change SOI, there shouldn\u0027t be any problems. So you could do this shortcut, and it would either ask you how long you wanted it to run, or tell you it couldn\u0027t for some reason, like an atmosphere or projected SOI change. Then, it would either jump to do the new time, or it could fast forward to that new time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-19T23:37:04Z\u0022 title=\u002207/19/2014 11:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Strikerklm96\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
