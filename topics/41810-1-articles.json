However, I wanted to pass along the idea and see if it seemed to have any promise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe discussion about the metallic hydrogen prompted me to revisit the 1981 \u0022Sci Fi Western\u0022 film\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outland_(film)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOutland\u003C/a\u003E. I had remembered them mining from Jupiter, but this was incorrect. It depicts a Federal Marshall operating on a \u0022ConAm\u0022 mining facility on Io. And BTW, the whole film is available on Youtube too. I had remembered it being cheesy, low-budget and crappy. However, having watched the first 20 minutes, I think my memory was too harsh. Really not such a bad film.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I noticed on the wiki page for it, that there is this list at the bottom, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_featuring_space_stations\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EList of films featuring space stations \u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have seen some but not all of these films. So I don\u0027t know if all of them would be doable or not. Certainly a lot of them might require parts mods, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there ya go! Recreate any or all of the space stations shown in that list!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe list includes 41 stations (though some seem to be repeated?). I\u0027m guessing that some of them might just not be feasible, so lets say \u0022maximum\u0022 points is 60. Submissions should be posted in a thread with enough screen caps of the KSP created station and the film space station to allow judging of how well the KSP creation recreates the film version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESubmissions will be scored on a 3 point scale: 3 Superlative; 2 Excellent; 1 Good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst participant to attain 60 points will be considered \u0022leader\u0022 to win. If no other participant has achieved at least 61 points within say 76 hours of the lead candidates submission, then the lead candidate by default becomes the winner of the challenge. If someone does pass the leader before 76 hours elapses then they in turn become the \u0022leader\u0022 and the counter resets to 76 hours. This repeats until either someone has won.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERepeated submissions of the same space station are permissible if score is below 3 on any given submission and it will be rejudged, however, points are not cumulative. If you resubmit, your points from the previous submission are reset to zero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI probably won\u0027t active on this site long enough to act as judge and maybe it would be better to have a more \u0027democratic\u0027 system of judging.

At the front a modular girder and the bottom end of the tail connector are clipped in forward of the middle hitchhiker container, a flat medium-to-small adapter is clipped backwards in the big-to-medium adapter for aesthetics, and two little battery packs were clipped to look like three batteries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launcher\u0027s a bit of a hack. The booster stacks were clobbering the central mainsail when they were jettisoned.

It wasn\u0027t efficient because of too low TWR (\u0026lt;1 at points in the flight), but it worked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow to make the transfer capsule and the Great Glass Elevator itself!

The Elevator doesn\u0027t need to be SSTO - Wonka says it uses skyhooks, so I\u0027ll build a \u0022skyhook\u0022 booster! I do, however, want it to be capable of deorbiting the transfer capsule, and I\u0027ll cram a Kerbal in there if I can.
