But this mod seems abandoned and the particles only emitted from the bottom of the engines. There is also no pre cooling effect of this mod, it\u0027s just cosmetic. I\u0027d like to see a mod that has some parts, both radially and center stacked, that has exhaust effects and also provides delay of heating of parts it\u0027s attached to/in the vicinity of. Could be very useful in designs that overheat too quickly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a pic example of what I\u0027m talking about for reference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.spaceflightnow.com/delta/d304/040420gallery/01.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002201.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-23T19:08:51Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2015 07:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mcbmaestro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hydrazine_Soup","CreatedById":91100,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T09:15:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027d look awesome paried with Real Fuels to simulate propellants boiling off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
