It would have to be designed slightly differently than Danny\u0027s so that it would have a system of propulsion that lines up with the center of mass, but it would work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tygroux","CreatedById":75717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T13:07:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETheorically, yes, for any size of debris. The only variable is the fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main problem comes from staying in front of the debris as it moves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor this, i once tried a tugship with KAS cables.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot mass relay, just tug with cable in the back to attach the debris.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was a VERY bad idea... If you happen to be slower than your debris (and imperfection and imbalance means it WILL happen) (or faster if you go \u0022pushing\u0022, mechanicaly or with a Mass Relay), you risk rapid unplanned disassembly, or fast non-controlled docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo... I say try it. Put few KAS (at least 3. Well, try less if you want, but prepare for fun.) on a mass relay, set up stuffs, and have fun. =D\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
