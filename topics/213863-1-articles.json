The camera feed keeps disconnecting and the microphone feed behaves similarly. The encoding version (software/hardware) doesn\u0027t make a difference. This only happens while I\u0027m in the KSP window (as in my mouse is active on it, if i have it open but interacting with my browser on my other screen, OBS works fine). This doesn\u0027t happen with any other game or program. In-game settings don\u0027t have any impact either, tried different quality settings, fullscreen, borderless and even windowed. I would love to stream the game but currently can\u0027t.

My rig uses a 3080 TI, Ryzen 5 5600\u00A0 and 32 GB of RAM. The game runs alright, GPU utilisation is between 65 and 90 %, the CPU never goes above 20%. When I stream it with OBS studio, as soon as I switch to KSP2, my camera stutters heavily and the game capture also starts to drop frames. OBS stats say I am losing frames due to rendering lag. Switching between encoding on the CPU or the GPU doesn\u2019t matter. Unplugging my webcam (an Elgato Face Cam) fixes the issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI managed to somehow fix this temporarily by playing around with the game\u2019s graphics settings and OBS, but I have no idea what fixed it. In any case, the problem came back. The way the game doesn\u2019t adhere to the graphics settings I change without a restart and this sometimes fixing this and other issues makes me think this is a bug with the game.
