After their landing, an Falcon Heavy launch brings several excavator robots to the lunar surface, which proceed to melt down an patch of lunar regolith to place the habitat, followed by an second launch to bring an empty LCV to lunar orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first habitat arrives with the second SLS launch that year, carrying an Dry Workshop habitat derived from the SLS H2 upper stage tank.

Therefore, I don\u0027t think that a kick-off date for a lunar landing architecture in 2016 is possible, but if it was, don\u0027t count on having an operation lander before 2026 at best.

Ideally, there would be several generations of unmanned expeditions, first for prospection, second as ISRU prototypes, and third to prepare for manned activity.

You seem to think that hardware can be designed and built in months. This might have been true during Apollo, but industry, economy, quality assurance, and project management is different nowadays. Major engineering projects are planned over decades and always exceed budgets and schedules. I can\u0027t think of a single modern aircraft project that hasn\u0027t taken over a decade from start to delivery, and those use more conventional technology and have a lot more people working on them. I simply don\u0027t believe that even if we kicked-off a return to the Moon today, with a huge budget increase and strong political support, we could aim for a manned landing before 2030 at best. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, I don\u0027t see what the incentive for private industry is, other than to receive a paycheck from NASA, which is how NASA has always operated anyway.

Resources that are working on one project only become available when that project ends. You can\u0027t develop SLS, Orion, a manned lander, a cargo lander, prospection probes, ISRU technology and a manned base all in parallel. There is only enough money and headcount to do one thing at a time. For the moment, resources are already stretched between SLS and Orion. When those are done, NASA will be able to concentrate on what comes next. My fear is that SLS has nothing to do during the decade it takes to design what comes next, and I\u0027m not the only one who shares that concern:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2014/02/asap-claim-nasa-employing-indecision-roadmap-flexibility/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2014/02/asap-claim-nasa-employing-indecision-roadmap-flexibility/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-12T11:20:33Z\u0022 title=\u002203/12/2014 11:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
