I love having a massive rover hauling ore or fuel around, but the way the wheels work now mean that as soon as you build ANY speed you lose all steering. It is my understanding that they\u0027re supposed to work like the wheels of a tank, i.e. one side slows down to turn the vehicle etc. Could someone please just give the wheels the ability to turn?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceLaunchSystem","CreatedById":125698,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T10:36:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo my knowledge, this would be \u003Cem\u003Eextremely\u003C/em\u003E difficult - if not impossible. Unless someone is willing to make a similar model, you\u0027d have to contact Squad, have them e-mail you the .dae or .blend file, and add the turning animation. Doesn\u0027t seem hard, but you\u0027d have to do quite a bit of convincing to get Squad to send you their model.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Windspren","CreatedById":134441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T03:20:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe model is already in the game though....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.
