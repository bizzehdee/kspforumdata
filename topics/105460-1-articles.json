Thats another one of those top secret nobody knows controls."},{"CreatedByName":"Hobbes Novakoff","CreatedById":129018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T05:09:06Z","Content":"There\u0027s no key assignment because it\u0027s a mouse movement, just like there\u0027s no key assignment for zooming in and out. And it\u0027s not bound to a key because you can only control 3 axes with a keyboard (WASDQE) before things start getting hard to reach."},{"CreatedByName":"JumpsterG","CreatedById":63396,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T16:55:38Z","Content":"I think the key to the system they use now is that kerbals automatically stop all rotation whenever they can and maintain an \u0022UP\u0022 direction, which does keep things from getting overly confusing.\n\nI don\u0027t have too hard a time with the current system (tap the thrusters, don\u0027t put the pedal down!), but I think a simple improvement would be to enable the same RCS control mode that ships have: IJKLHN keys for translation in and WASDQE keys for rotation.\n\nAllowing us to switch between the default mode and full craft controls would be good, I think."},{"CreatedByName":"antbin","CreatedById":22389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T17:52:58Z","Content":"Unfortunately Squad missed the chance to make their controls more consistent in 1.0.

I found that to be the most irritating thing in my first 1.0 session. No mater how hard I tried the climbing prompt would appear for a split second and then nothing. I need to be able to climb the distance of a science jr onto a pod. I cant do it."}]}
