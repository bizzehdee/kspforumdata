You can end flights also with this to clear up some Kerbin space. An opportunity for this though, just if you want to have some fun, is that you can make some sort of missile with an A.S.A.S system, not quite sure if that would work with debris, and maybe launch it into stuff 8)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit* Thought I mentioned this in the first part, guess not, but you can actually control the debris, well, I haven\\\u0027t fully tested everything, but I did extend and retract a landing strut a few times, its basically your controlling the debris is what I meant.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phoenix Aerospace","CreatedById":26120,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-18T02:45:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb.
