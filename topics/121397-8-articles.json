I have one base on Duna that is just find with a Saddle bolted to the ground and another that would explode if I bolted a Saddle to the ground.

Thanks for the report. :)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nLooks like a lot has changed with the new OSE Workshop. For one, it doesn\u0026#39;t look like I can switch between RocketParts and MaterialKits anymore. :( It also looks like you need ExoticMinerals and RareMetals for some parts as well. This will take me some time to sort out.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-24T20:21:18Z\u0022 title=\u002211/24/2015 08:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Angel-125\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Denko666","CreatedById":135673,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T22:57:23Z","Content":"\nok, at least its not my install :) \u003Cbr\u003E\nlots of good luck with the fix!\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T00:34:09Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Denko666\u0027]ok, at least its not my install :) \u003Cbr\u003E\nlots of good luck with the fix![/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks. :) All in all, it\u0026#39;s going pretty well.

It works similarly to a command seat; just drop it on the ground (be careful, some terrain is explosive), right-click to board it, then rotate upright. Alternately, bolt it to the side of a craft, board, and decouple. The wing can be used on any planet with an atmosphere thanks to its monopropellant-powered jet engines. Just don\u0026#39;t expect terrific range, unless you switch to liquid fuel and fly in an oxygenated atmosphere like Kerbin or Laythe. JetWing is inspired by JetMan Yves Rossy and the defunct KerbolQuest winged jetpack. The JetWing and its accessories work best with Kerbal Inventory System and either GoodSpeed Fuel Pump or TAC Fuel Balancer.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn addition to the Jetwing, this release also introduces the M1A2 Grizzly, a larger wheel than the Mountain Goat that has a wider wheelbase and better traction. This all comes at the expense of not being able to enter and exit Mk3 cargo bays, however.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFinally, there were some big changes to OSE Workshop and the Community Resource Pack recently, and Pathfinder has been updated to reflect the changes. You might find prospecting a lucrative business if you bring stuff home...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNOTE: Due to changes in OSE Workshop, you can no longer switch between MaterialKits and RocketParts. However, the Ironworks still has converters that switch between RocketParts and MaterialKits. Additionally, OSE Workshop\u0026#39;s changes now require ExoticMinerals and RareMetals for some parts, so plan accordingly.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNew Parts\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Added the M1A2 Grizzly.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Added the JetWing. \u003Cbr\u003E\n- Added the JetWing Drop Tank. Works great with Good Speed Fuel Pump or TAC Fuel Balancer.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Added the JetWing Parachute. Like the Outback, it can be attached to the JetWing.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Added the JetWing Cargo Pallet. Mount these to the wing\u0026#39;s hardpoints and you can surface-attach small items.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nJetWing Flight controls\u003Cbr\u003E\nInsert: Toggle VTOL mode\u003Cbr\u003E\nPageUp: Increase vertical speed\u003Cbr\u003E\nPageDown: Decrease vertical speed\u003Cbr\u003E\nDelete: Reset vertical speed to zero\u003Cbr\u003E\nGear: Toggle kickstand\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOutback\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Moved the Outback from Pathfinder to the Buffalo mod.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nStorage Templates\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Added ExoticMinerals template.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Added RareMetals template.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBlacksmith\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Removed ability to switch between RocketParts and MaterialKits.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Updated production requirements to latest OSE Workshop standards.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nClockworks\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Removed ability to switch between RocketParts and MaterialKits.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Updated production requirements to latest OSE Workshop standards.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Added converter to sift Dirt into ExoticMinerals and RareMetals.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nPathfinder Geology Lab\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Added converter to sift Dirt into ExoticMinerals and RareMetals.
