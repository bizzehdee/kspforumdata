When trying to use Maneuver nodes, The orbit lines always show crashing into the planet of Kerbin. This is incorrect as I can use the engines to raise my altitude in a vacuum by doing the maneuver without the node.\u00A0 I am using ion engines to get to Jool and am already in orbit around Kerbin. and am fully out of atmo. Without being able to see my trajectory with nodes I have no idea how to get to Jool. What is going on and how do you fix?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JebJr","CreatedById":227013,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-22T03:06:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem seems to be that the maneuver calculation is done by assuming 100% of Delta-V will be in a single direction, ignoring the fact that \u0022prograde\u0022 means something different at all but one point during the burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just noticed that with my first Xenon engine satellite -- attempting to raise a low orbit, combined with the very long burn time, means the calculator thinks I\u0027m going\u00A0retrograde by the time I\u0027m half way around the orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
