I do have mods installed. The issue is that when I try to take a space plane to orbit it just falls apart when at about 20,000 meters. The ship I have tried is a space plane with hybrid jet engines. The plane is has struts and works fine in low atmo but once the jets don\u0027t have enough air and switch over to the rocket mode the plane rips apart.\u00A0 Standard rocket Rockets work fine. I have tried with no mod as well. Same issue.\u00A0 What is going on?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
