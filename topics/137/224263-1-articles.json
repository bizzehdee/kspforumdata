Move the part with the first end attached to it, and it takes that with it. strut will point wherever it points and hit whatever it hits. That can get weird too, but consistently and predictably weird, which is easier to work with than unpredictable and obscured.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022sticky\u0022\u00A0lets you shift parts around, while keeping the ends where you want them. Fix the current visibility issues and this isn\u0027t a bad way to go. until you change anything related to symmetry, then its back to hunting down orphaned strut ends stuck to your ship like pimples... or weeds. I know I could ignore them. but I wont.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022pointy\u0022 lets you grab a subassembly with struts sticking off of it, put it anywhere in any quantity, and it\u0027ll attach those to whatever they hit when you slap on 12 of them, or want to change symmetry, or move a module to another part of the ship, or reload a craft, (sorry, \u0022workspace.\u0022 (a topic for a different rant,)) and have struts work in any way whatsoever, or this is getting far too rant-like and you get the point, but I\u0027m gonna continue, anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ncurrent \u0022solution\u0022 lets you think you strutted something, maybe it worked, lose everything 5 times, reset all of them individually, move something, lose them all again, ship rejects all the confines you\u0027ve placed in its freedom and\u00A0 flings itself into all directions at once, revert crashes the game, ship loads from an hour ago without any struts. Repeat everything at least once, then give up. Ship finally starts working fine, right when you decide to load it in order to rebuild for a different mission (doesn\u0027t last long.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould I learn to code just to mod this game, and only to fix struts?

I\u0027ve dabbled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy point is: I want this game to be better, even if the things they have improved on are great. I joined this ksp2 party late, but I\u0027ve been playing KSP1 since the spaceplane hangar was new. Was still playing it here and there, (or binging on it for weeks at a time,) until I got ksp2 a few weeks ago. Honeymoon with the new game is over, and I\u0027m about to go back to the kraken I know and love. I know I\u0027m late to that party too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cocoscacao","CreatedById":225696,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-03-27T23:12:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224375535\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224263\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221711510145\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022166194\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BimmyBot\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 hours ago, BimmyBot said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould I learn to code\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224375535\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224263\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221711510145\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022166194\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BimmyBot\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 hours ago, BimmyBot said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wouldn\u0027t even call myself an amateur\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sensing a paradox here...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP is written in C#.
