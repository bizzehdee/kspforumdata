That was very nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI took your example, and made something similar. (Call it a reciprocal gift.) It gets to Mun and back with just 19 tanks. It\\\u0027s very quick off the launch pad and in the ascent, so it helps to keep the speed below terminal velocity. If all goes well, the drop tanks go in Booster Bay, the first three engines dissolve in the atmosphere during circularization, and the second three engines hit the Mun during descent. The final engine is the only gimballed one, and has a single fuel tank for landing and return. We returned to Kerbin with almost half a tank in reserve, which is nice if you want to control the landing site. Or if you want to add weird things like lander legs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
