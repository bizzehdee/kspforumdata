Similarly, MechJeb can estimate delta-v and TWR for ships with simple staging, but more complicated designs usually just confuse it.

As was stated earlyer on in this thread the view that KSP has a fly by the seat of your pants nature and that a Delta V indicator would take away from this is an opinion shared by a large portion of the community and the devlopers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESaying that reentry heat won\u0027t be added into the game untill final release is just illogical as far as I can see. To implement it in a way similar to the Deadly Reentry mod out there would be a major change to game mechanics and final release would just be too late for it to be implemented. While I havent heard any official word on the matter of reentry heat I do believe that it is a fair deduction and would also impact on the \u0022wacky\u0022 nature of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith regards to the last part about mods to points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Mods allow the player to customize the game past what the devlopers think the game should be, not everybody plays with the same mods, so it begs the question what mods should be added into the game. If like Crazyewok you say that people can just turn off those features then at what point does Squad stop adding optional suggested features and work on the core game, because the argument of \u0022If you don\u0027t like it, don\u0027t play with it\u0022 can be applied to any and all features one would suggest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. As with Minecraft I strongly believe that the 1.0 release of KSP will not deam the end of the development cycle and that the devlopers will continue to devloper KSP in one way or enouther untill we are long dead.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheOrqwithVagrant","CreatedById":39208,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-09T00:47:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022macegee\u0022 data-cite=\u0022macegee\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Also, here\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s an inconsistency - there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s an actual delta-v indicator for maneuvers, and lots of detailed info about the planets.

Lack of reentry heat. As a Tsialkovsky\u0027s rocket equation, it\u0027s quite important part of rocketry. Unfortunately, I think devs won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t ever implement it, at least not in a base game. And even if they would, as it was said, it would be done with something like \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cradiators\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 that diffuse heat, so they won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Climit possible designs to take any shapes player might want\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. Apparently, there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s no such thing as inflatable heat shields and dynamic part creation (procedural parts, like fairings and heat shields).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, reentry heat makes returning stuff back to Kerbin even more rewarding. As a bonus, it creates more ways to die and explode, which is kinda a theme for KSP. And risks of losing Kerbals vs probe gives you even more choice here. But I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll talk about probes a bit later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgree that reentry heat should be in, though I could have sworn last I heard a dev say anything on the matter, the word was that it was coming at some point, but not high on the priority list.

Tech tree as a mean to introduce parts to the new players (being a tutorial). This is just plain silly. Tech tree is not a tutorial, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a tech tree for a career mode. Tutorial (Training) is a separate thing in the main menu.

Harv actually SAID that it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s suppose to introduce parts to the new players, being a tutorial.

One thing that I actually haven\u0027t seen mentioned in the many alternative tech-tree threads is the impact on part cost and budgets for balancing. There will be a major difference in how the whole tree has to work, once all parts from a node are not automatically available when the node is unlocked.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022macegee\u0022 data-cite=\u0022macegee\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cem\u003E4. Manned flights give too much advantages over the use of unmanned probes, while there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s little reason not to use kerbals. Also, lack of probe-sized experiments and few scientific equipment. Again, I get that it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s still WIP, but the concept that devs, according to their own words, would use here is that probes would be just cheaper to use than kerbals. But why should they give that much science? You can get so much of it by doing EVA reports from polar orbit by flying over different biomes. You still can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t scoop soil samples with unmanned modules. Or even take photographs and million of other readings. Astronauts in space are mostly there for servicing (mostly to control and repair). Electronics do most of the stuff. Here\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s more. Kerbals don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t need to eat or breathe. But probes need to eat, electricity.

Personally, I enjoy the challenge of designing by ships by myself. I appreciate that some players don\u0027t want to do this as it is quite time consuming or because they prefer flying crafts to building them. The problem is that I think KSP, as well as being a game, is a learning tool. I like the way that you need to learn and discover more about astrophysics to become better at the game, and I think that some of that would be lost if it gave you all the vital statistics in the stock game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Can\u0027t really comment. I haven\u0027t played with any mods so I haven\u0027t seen the benefits of re-entry heat to the game. I think it could work, but I can\u0027 honestly say I think it\u0027s vital.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Probes should be best for exploring and retrieving data, without argument. Manned craft should have their own benefits *cough* mining *cough*, but they don\u0027t at the moment. I don\u0027t agree with reducing the effectiveness of probes to account for this (this assumes probes can be one-way missions and Kerbals are expected to return - a point that the OP didn\u0027t bring up, and isn\u0027t demanded by the game, but is still worth mentioning).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. I can see why the developers don\u0027t want to make too many promises. They are doing a good job as it is, so I\u0027m happy to let them continue as they want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Firstly, people are playing a game with seemingly endless potential and opportunity for innovation, and every single one of them has a slightly different view of how the final game should look. The stock game cannot satiate all of them, and so mods are used to provide the developments on the gameplay experience that certain people want. If the devs don\u0027t want to implement an idea, but there are a reasonable portion of the players that want it, then a mod will most likely be made for it. If they do like an idea, then it may end up in 1.0.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
