I\u0027m in science mode and only have the first two techs unlocked, so my items are limited. This setup flies fine until I eject the solid fuel stage (runs out around 4000m) - at that stage it starts spinning out of control. I\u0027ve also tried it with two solid fuel stages and a decoupler, as soon as the first is ejected control is lost.

Additionally, two fins is not enough for full directional stability - you need at least three, using symmetry to place them as a ring.
