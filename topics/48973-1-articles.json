I think its more the fact that they dont realize that there gamers that exist that prefer this game. A lot of people have this mindset that gamers are all into guns and violence, thanks in part to the dino-media. Thanks to the ilk of CBS, NBC, ABC, and other alphabet soup \u0022news\u0022 stations, people get the impression that any video game is just another shoot-em type of thing. What they fail to realize is that are actually intelligent people out there that would prefer to create rather than destroy. Thats what I\u0027ve loved about KSP ever since I\u0027ve gotten the game. The amount of things people come with, even using the stock parts, boggles the mind. Tack on the mods, and you get some pretty cool stuff. Some of that cool stuff happens to be the mods themselves. The learning about orbital mechanics is just a side bonus \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
