After another minute, the atmosphere will have become thin enough that TWR2 can no longer keep up with terminal velocity. At that point, you still need about 4000m/s at an Eve-TWR of 1 or better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can possibly test your vessel on Kerbin, if the design allows you to put on launch clamps and keep them locked while you run through the first few stages. Use Mechjeb to limit the acceleration to 34m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2. Release the clamps after about 140 seconds, start a gravity turn right from the ground, and keep going at 34m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 for 70 seconds. Now check you delta-V map. If you have 4000m/s left, your vessel will do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn Kerbin, one can get away with a relatively low TWR on the last leg of the ascent: TWR 0.3 is possible, 0.7 is painless. Eve is a much deeper gravity well, you want TWR\u0026gt;=1 all the way to the top. Less is doable, but can be quite difficult -- and frankly, the Rockomax 48-7s is your friend.
