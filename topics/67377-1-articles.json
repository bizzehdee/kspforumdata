If you remember my ultimate helo challenge, even I had a rough time getting to KSC2 with a helo and that was with 2 turbofans pushing. Even the other competitors were pinched for fuel. If you open this up to all props then only one has the power \u0026amp; efficiency to really make it (unless you stack gobs of little props) and that\u0027s the Lancaster engine. In which case, you\u0027re a VTOL. If you have to send a jet to refuel then what\u0027s the point? You might as well load your cargo onto a jet in the first place. Or at least a SVTOL.

And is this a VTOL or a STOL? Never mind, I just spotted the landing gear. I would say no unless you swapped the winglets for fenestrons if you\u0027re claiming that they\u0027re there for control authority - those particular ones do have a lot of lift.
