On the tech tree, if randomly generated planets were ever added, what about a section where you could upgrade the tracking station/new building to find the new planets, so people couldn\u0027t find them from the start, or maybe a tech line that allows the building of orbited telescopes!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. i was curious about whether there would be a penalty for the loss of kerbals? Like a money penalty? Perhaps this is why kerbals are before probes in the tech tree\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dooz","CreatedById":74263,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-14T10:18:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIdea 1 is already planned\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LFC908","CreatedById":82800,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-14T10:21:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice!
