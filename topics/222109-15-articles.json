I too felt that the absence of actual readouts of temperature, pressure etc. made the experience of doing science\u00A0 less rewarding somehow, and also that the apparent paucity of mission options and alternative paths forward to unlock the tech tree are\u00A0 pretty restrictive. But I also can\u0027t believe that\u0027s all there will be to it. This is just the foundation of the building. After all, we have whole new tiers of parts that don\u0027t exist yet that will need to be unlocked somehow. And I actually like the idea of using a series of\u00A0 Easter egg hunts as a means of getting to some goal in terms of new alien techs and interstellar capability, which is where it looks like they might be going to me. I actually lobbied for that idea long ago in the KSP1 forum, because so many of the science missions in that game seemed totally pointless to me. I get that this might hamper the replayability of the primary campaign as such, at least if they don\u0027t implement some alternate paths to unlocking the essential capabilities,\u00A0 but with so much new content and so many whole new modes of play on the horizon, I have to believe there will be new campaigns that become available once the whole initial tech tree has been unlocked, and more still after that in the form of new star systems as DLC. Anyway, I think what we have now is still basically just a stub.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SolarAdmiral","CreatedById":107350,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-03-02T06:26:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224369707\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022222109\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221709326721\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022227275\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fizzlebop Smith\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, Fizzlebop Smith said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you are missing the biggest complain from so many people..\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a finite set of mission parameters that have a linear but non logical progression.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was only responding to calls to completely rework science, using something other than science points style currency, specifically doing something or going somewhere to unlock specific techs or parts.

A requirement to fly to x height and x speed with x engine would either be so ridiculously easy that it requires 0 thought or ridiculously hard to the point there is only one way to do it or most players won\u0027t be able to. Let me explain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the only requirement is x height and x speed, there is no requirement for the plane to also be an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003Essto\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, there is no requirement for it to carry a payload, no requirement for it to be a certain size or fly a certain distance. The engines have power sized to also be carrying a lot of payload. So the best plane to do that mission with is so easy to build you could throw it together in 30 seconds. Air intake, cockpit, fuel tank, engine. Add wings and gear. Because there\u0027s no requirement for payload and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003Essto\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E capability or even safely landing, you can build a plane that is entirely fuel and engines. A plane that is just a cockpit, fuel tank, and engine will be able to fly higher and faster than any other plane using that particular engine. So if the x height and x speed requirements are reasonably low enough that a plane carrying an actual payload or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003Essto\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E rocket fuel can reach them, this tiny engine and fuel only plane will easily blow passed them.

If they are easy enough to be accomplished by a craft in addition to doing something else, they will be trivially easy for a craft purpose built to do them. If the requirements are hard enough to be the least bit challenging to a craft purpose built to do them, they\u0027d be impossible to do with any sort of general purpose craft in addition to being useful in other ways. And it would pretty much come down to building the bare minimum just to get the requirements out of the way.

If the challenges pose even the slightest difficulty to the long time players it becomes impossible for the first time ones. Even somewhere in the middle, and the challenge becomes something hard enough for the new time players they might just give up, or look up walk-throughs showing them exactly how to get passed it so they can get by onto the rest of the game, while it still poses no challenge to the long time players and becomes pointless busy work to get passed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only thing you need to know to accomplish any mission like that, is to build a plane that is only an engine and one tank of fuel.

But I think runs a major risk of those super special parts either being so much better than the regular ones that consensus quickly becomes \u0027you have to go unlock these as soon as possible\u0027. Or so little improvement that everyone ignores them.

Stellaris has parts researched only by killing specific space creatures. They vary from underpowered and so common you get them without even thinking about it. To the point you start to just ignore them or take them as granted. To super rare and very powerful. But so rare you seldom get the chance to actually get them in a game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut stellaris has a massive advantage over KSP for implimenting this in an interesting way, in that you\u0027re competing with the other empires, to expand your boarders to catch these creatures or getting to them and killing them first. There\u0027s a challenge there in competition, racing against the opponents.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP, as long as it\u0027s still single player, offers no challenge like that.

IMO, it should be right there next to the \u0022Launch a rocket\u0022 mission at the beginning of the game, or at least as soon as you\u0027ve unlocked enough aviation-related nodes to build one. As it stands now, I\u0027m already being offered some of the most difficult challenges in the whole game wrt rocketry with only about half of the tech tree unlocked and no access to any space plane-capable jet engines yet.\u00A0 Ditto probe cores, although it seems like while planes have been left out in the cold entirely, probes are just inside the room but have to stand in the corner quietly until\u00A0 (infrequently) called on. Again,\u00A0 I think there should be some kind of probe-specific mission available just as soon as you unlock the capability to make them.\u00A0 You could even think of these three branches of exploration -- aviation, robotic, and crewed, as three separate victory paths ala Civ, each of which you can freely choose to pursue to the extent you see fit. Thus, if you have separate tech trees for those three things, as we sort of do now, you can also add separate mission trees for those three things, each of which ultimately leads to the same place through a different series of steps.

I too felt that the absence of actual readouts of temperature, pressure etc. made the experience of doing science\u00A0 less rewarding somehow, and also that the apparent paucity of mission options and alternative paths forward to unlock the tech tree are\u00A0 pretty restrictive. But I also can\u0027t believe that\u0027s all there will be to it. This is just the foundation of the building. After all, we have whole new tiers of parts that don\u0027t exist yet that will need to be unlocked somehow.

I actually lobbied for that idea long ago in the KSP1 forum, because so many of the science missions in that game seemed totally pointless to me. I get that this might hamper the replayability of the primary campaign as such, at least if they don\u0027t implement some alternate paths to unlocking the essential capabilities,\u00A0 but with so much new content and so many whole new modes of play on the horizon, I have to believe there will be new campaigns that become available once the whole initial tech tree has been unlocked, and more still after that in the form of new star systems as DLC.
