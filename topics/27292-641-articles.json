Bout ready to land 16 in the Twin Craters (Couldn\u0027t be bothered trying to land them in more analogous locations) and then I\u0027ll do 17 and 18. From there its on to Skylab where I\u0027ll start developing some supporting infrastructure around Duna and Eve (namely sattelites and possibly some Viking analogues). After that its Spacelab and the Voyager program. Then I\u0027ll probably do Artemis (but center it on Minmus rather than a return to the Mun) alongside the Freedom space station. After that will probably be manned missions to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s some selected pictures from 15:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/k0Ir5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
