I\u0027ve been following KSP since its young days. I\u0027ve never been particularly good at anything, but I\u0027ve logged quite a few hours and had my fair share of those special moments that KSP is chock-full of. I\u0027ve managed to dock in Kerbin orbit, and I just completed my first Mun landing (though it was rough). Now that I\u0027ve got a firm grasp of the basics, I want to pursue more ambitious goals. What better place to start than the forums? So hello, greetings, salutations, and I\u0027m glad to be joining this great community. Good luck on all of your endeavors!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T23:45:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
