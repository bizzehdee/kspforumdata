I assume that we\u0027re to use the ARM stock part for the core engines for now?\n\nIndeed. The ARM engine block in RO works well enough as a placeholder, although the amount of thrust is a tad low, so you have to fight gravity just a little bit more. It seems like it uses the 104% thrust level, when the RS-25 on the SLS will actually run at 109%.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-25T20:43:53Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2015 08:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by maccollo**"},{"CreatedByName":"maccollo","CreatedById":72759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T22:24:33Z","Content":"Still having a hard time getting to grips with the config system.

Both HGR and Tantares already use that scale. However, I\u0027d actually like the core stage to be 5m, since that lies much closer to the 64 % scale that is usually used.

The Orion at 64 % scale would be 3.2 meters, which places it closer to 3.75m than to 2.5m. I think that 2.5 meters is too small - it would get really cramped up over time. The SLS at 64 % scale would be 5.37 meters, so 5 meters isn\u0027t too much of a stretch there. Of course, this will result in a really large rocket for KSP purposes, so it might be smart to make the SLS tank be filled with \u0022CryoFuel\u0022 or something like that, which has a lower density than LiquidFuel, thus simulating the actual hydrogen fuel used in the SLS."},{"CreatedByName":"VenomousRequiem","CreatedById":137373,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T15:16:14Z","Content":"Oh, honestly I didn\u0027t know that.
