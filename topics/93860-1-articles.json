RAPIERs are nice on small planes because it means you don\u0027t need 2 kinds of engines. When you have loads of them that benefit disappears, so it\u0027s better to use turbojets (which will make it easier to get off the ground! more thrust!) for atmospheric flight and dedicated rockets for when you\u0027re ready to go to orbit. You can also get out of the atmosphere using only the turbos.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
