Specifically, distances over 999.9 km should now display 999.9km correctly. The nav gauge now displays at all times when selected, not just when a waypoint is active. When there is no active waypoint, the bearing pointer is locked at 90 degrees, distance and time both read 0, and an \u0022OFF\u0022 flag is displayed on the left side of the face. Let me know if that location is too bothersome. The bearing pointer may move a little smoother than before.
