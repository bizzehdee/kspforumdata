Basically, what I want is to burn from Munar orbit so that when I enter Kernin\\\u0027s SOI, my Periapsis reenters Kerbin or at least put\\\u0027s me in something like a 200km orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve tried firing from above the Mun\\\u0027s prograde point (there must be a term in orbital physics for that) or at the point where Kerbin rises over the horizon or straight to Kerbin. I\\\u0027ve tried burning into high or low Munar orbits. Most of the time I end up in something like a 2Mx8M orbit, which requires a costly burn to lower the periapsis for reentry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere must be a better way!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-28T07:39:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt should look something like in this video:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzEEcNnBxqM#ws\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKSP tutorial: Mission to the Mun and Back\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Duck","CreatedById":1156,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-28T08:01:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou want to burn directly opposite the Mun\\\u0027s velocity. The correct way to think about the situation is that by being on the Mun you are in orbit around Kerbin, and you need to perform a deorbit burn like you would from any other orbit. The Mun\\\u0027s orbital velocity is around 550 m/s so you might think you should burn till you reach about that speed relative to the Mun, but in fact the Mun will slow you down some, so you need to start out faster. I usually burn till I reach 850 m/s directed opposite the Mun\\\u0027s orbital velocity. The correct speed may vary depending what altitude munar orbit you start from; I usually skip entering munar orbit and start the TKI burn directly from the munar surface.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Trekkin","CreatedById":23636,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-01T01:16:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The_Duck\u0022 data-cite=\u0022The_Duck\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI usually skip entering munar orbit and start the TKI burn directly from the munar surface.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do this as well, and make up for the increased fuel cost by deorbiting Kerbin via aerobraking. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-01T01:56:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Trekkin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Trekkin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do this as well, and make up for the increased fuel cost by deorbiting Kerbin via aerobraking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\\\u0027t need to aerobrake.
