This can be very concerning in that if I\u0027m not paying complete attention and don\u0027t react quickly enough, Jeb could die.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYesterday I stumbled upon the video below and one thing that caught my attention is that they stated that there are 3 wires running the entire length of the rocket, and if 2 out of 3 wires are to lose power it will trigger the launch escape system. So this got me thinking about if it would be possible for somebody to write a plugin that detects if any connections in the main stack of the rocket have failed or broken and if so simply fire the abort action group, now I\u0027m not entirely sure how easy/hard this would be but I wouldn\u0027t think it would be too hard to do, it would just need to make sure that it could tell the difference between a decoupler/separator firing and an actual connection/part failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/AqeJzItldSQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"alpha tech","CreatedById":84978,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-08T23:38:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethis is totally true. plus there is/(or use to be) a cause on the stock Les u might be able to dig into that and also you need something to detect explosions so many meters from your craft and then if yes it will fire your Les because if you do it by staging then it could possibly fire when your perfectly fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fairy","CreatedById":152892,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T20:55:34Z","Content":"\n\u0022back in the day\u0022 I used to use kOS and TAC Self-Destruct to activate the LES or initiate a self-destruct sequence if the rocket went off-course.
