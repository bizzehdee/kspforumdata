My initial thought were like yours that it was off to the side of the panel. When I used the fit to screen\u00A0button it didn\u2019t center around the visible nodes. It centered around what I assume was an invisible true nodes\u00A0and the visible nodes. I was playing with the true nodes\u00A0at the top of the panel witch matched how it centered.\u00A0Totally borked my race Mission.
