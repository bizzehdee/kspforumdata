As we all probably know the real ones work different and there have been rather complex suggestions in the past but what about this one? I think such an option would make a lot of sense since you know you can\u0027t throttle SRBs together with your liquid fuel engines. The sliders could be set up by default for the thrust they have right now but you could optionally tweak them. This would give more control over them and you could increase their thrust so they actually deliver what they do in reality: the majority of the thrust! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yofGFXi.png\u0022 alt=\u0022yofGFXi.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not so familiar with modding btw. so I can\u0027t really suggest a method on how to implement this. However the system could be similar to jet engines for example. These lose thrust due to air pressure or something and the SRBs thrust could change by fuel amount instead. Feel free to share your opinion.
