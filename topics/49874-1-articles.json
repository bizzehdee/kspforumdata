When Jeb lands and collects soil samples, returns to orbit, and docks with the command module, does he carry that stuff over to the command module? I\u0027d like to try to physically return as much as possible, not so much spam transmissions back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously the goo and other modules I\u0027ll find another way to return, such as a science package with docking port, but I\u0027m wondering about things like the EVA report and soil samples that don\u0027t physically appear, but get \u0022stored\u0022 in whatever pod he climbs in. I\u0027d just like to know what I\u0027m up against so I can tell if I have to make my Munar Lander weighed down with parachutes and other stuff for surviving the return to Kerbin instead of abandoning it as dead mass in Munar orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-21T14:43:22Z\u0022 title=\u002210/21/2013 02:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by UH60guy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T14:28:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs soon as the Kerbal holding the surface sample climbs into a pod, the surface sample is stored inside that pod. You need to recover that exact pod to get the points.

I wonder if a mod, such as the crew manifest, could be made to handle sample and report transfer. If not, it might be a good suggestion to make to Squad. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thinking behind that is if someone wants to do a grand tour with mothership, they\u0027d have to return every single lander to Kerbin to get those soil samples returned, or transmit and lose data. Not that there\u0027s anything wrong with transmitting, but I\u0027m really enjoying the challenge of trying to return samples.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would think that it would be reasonable to transfer soil samples and crew between docking ports (like they did from the LM to CM in Apollo), so I don\u0027t believe this would be game-breaking or unbalancing. Alternatively, maybe a ship component to store all these rocks that actually gets heavier with each sample taken (implemented like fuel transfer).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T14:48:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022UH60guy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022UH60guy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eor transmit and lose data\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich doesn\u0027t diminish the total amount of science you get from doing an experiment.
