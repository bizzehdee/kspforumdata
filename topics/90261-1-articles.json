I say they appear to act differently but in reality they function exactly the same. Intake air consists of the maximum pool available (how much the craft is capable of holding), and how much air you actually have for that frame (which is generated as a function of air density, speed, intake area, and probably a few other things). As an intake generates air, it can only ever store that air in its own pool.
