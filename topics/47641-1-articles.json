As in, very strangely. While we\u0027re on the subject, maybe you all could answer a few more questions?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the real world, heat moves by convection, conduction, and radiation. Convection requires a surrounding atmosphere so isn\u0027t a factor in space. What you all have described above is a somewhat wonky way of doing conduction. Am I to understand, then that radiation isn\u0027t a factor at all? Geez, that\u0027s usually the primary means of fire spread in real life. For instance, a major house fire will melt the vinyl siding right off another house 100 feet away and possibly even set it on fire without any sparks flying between the 2. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut we all build rockets like the in the OP\u0027s pic, with the fire from radial engines burning just a few feet away from central fuel tanks. It\u0027s always worried me that the radiant heat from these fires would overheat the central tanks but it\u0027s never happened. Does the tank heat up at all from this? I usually put radial engines out on long I-beams to minimize such heating but now I\u0027m wondering if this matters at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOTOH, though, rocket fire does affect nearby parts, as seen on the F3 list when Sepratrons remove side tanks. Why does this happen in this situation and not the above? Or is this the result of direct flame impingement and not radiant heat?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-07T17:25:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERocket exhaust only damages parts that it impacts directly, there is no real radiation modeled.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-07T19:58:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suppose that\u0027s a good thing \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
