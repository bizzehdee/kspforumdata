For the old version, see \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/67269-The-New-Arrow-and-Longbow!\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Rm47Gx9.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022Rm47Gx9.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGallery is \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/L0L4V\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E until someone shows me how to embed them properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe major differences here are the Mk1 cockpit replaced with the much sexier looking Mk2, nearly all the intakes, and the third docking port replaced with the Mk2 inline port, facing downwards. Other than that, it was mostly just little fiddly adjustments, such as re-snapping all the parts back together, since for some reason older version craft imported into the current version are spaced further apart. The best part is that there\u0027s almost no clipping in this iteration, apart from a pair of tail fins inside the main body. I\u0027ve also managed to balance the RCS thrusters close to perfectly, so docking should be a little easier and less wasteful of mono-propellant. The aerodynamics are still a touch unstable, in that if you pitch too hard it WILL flip out, but as long as your stick-work isn\u0027t too aggressive it flies nicely, even landing gently with the engines off. I advise having only 1 pilot, as then it can also be used as a rescue craft for Kerbals trapped in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, updating the Arrow means updating the Longbow too. This was a lot harder, since most of the structure was wing sections, so it was all slightly off. After a long rebuild, it ended up slightly wider than before, but with the third docking port moved to the underside it much improves stability when the two craft are combined. A nice bonus is that the black wing section borders make it look much neater. I also increased the engines back to 4 per side, in an attempt to bump up it\u0027s TWR. Sadly, it\u0027s still horrible, but until we get some more high-tech stock engines, that\u0027s the best it can do. The rear facing docking ports are intended for refuelling craft, but can be used to drag along anything you want to dock to it. The launcher is also Kessler Syndrome free \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eSz8oSX.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022eSz8oSX.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, gallery \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/VkZTZ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E, including a shot of the launcher included with the craft file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Longbow also comes with a handy escape vehicle, powered by 6 ion engines and (hopefully) enough fuel to get you home from anywhere.
