I passed with it through the atmosphere once already. PE of 50km, its heat bar filled halfway. The wrangler survived without damages on the occlused side, lost a gigantor to overheating on the hot side. But the overall apoapsis change was pitiful, and judging by the asteroid\u0027s heat bar, lowering the periapsis further will burn it up. Thus my idea: airbrakes. Three emptied Kickbacks each with 20 airbrakes, attached in three spots around the asteroid, directed roughly towards the tug (to leave it on the occluded side)."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T00:31:35Z","Content":"Imagining what it will take to aerobrake a **3000t** stuff down a hundred of m/s to the heat safe zone, I guess this amount of airbrakes isn\u0027t going to change the picture too much."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T00:36:20Z","Content":"Do it!
