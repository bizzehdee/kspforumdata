For example how do I see the distance from my craft to another craft, or from Kerbin to another celestial body? Is there some way I can tell my position relative to the celestial body that I\u0027m orbiting (coordinates maybe?), that I can use to see if I have any spacing between satellites? Keep in my I always use Mechjeb2, as I have no idea how the devs imagined playing a space simulator like this won\u0027t any flight data.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Smidge204","CreatedById":89677,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T13:07:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo get the distance between two crafts, control one and set the other as the target.
