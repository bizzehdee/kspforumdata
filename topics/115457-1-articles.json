I said, \u0022Hmmm, I got pleanty of fuel, let\u0027s do a two-in-one\u0022, and I managed to get two science runs from both of them. The worst part was at the end of that exciting low pass I did a burn to bring my orbit down into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, but I ran out with a pariaps of 64km, not enough to do anything up at 45 thousand km. I went though a pass to see what that would do (hint: not much), but ingenuity struck e again when I got the kerbals out on EVA and pushed the craft down to 40km and tht was enough after a few passes to bring me back to Kerbin safe without bursting up!"},{"CreatedByName":"InterCity","CreatedById":98462,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T06:10:47Z","Content":"This:\n\n![3PVgYWv.png](http://i.imgur.com/3PVgYWv.png)\n\nAfter a spaceplane re-entry with FAR went spectacularly wrong, I managed to save the entire crew - and get close enough to KSC in the process.
