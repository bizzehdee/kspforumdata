Two weeks in and I have not even attempted to leave LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMostly I am developing assets in a practice universe. I want to run a capsule based program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the things I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d like to do is recovery. For example, I know that Kerbals can EVA and swim after splash down. So, a seaplane can recover pilots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, I plan on a helicopter or some sort of VTOL craft using the winches from the Kerbal Attachment System to recover the capsules. No question that this is the most difficult part for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m not an aerospace engineer that much is clear. But it didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t seem like it would be all that hard to build a helicopter. Well, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll tell you, it is not easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m wondering if KSP may not be chopper friendly in the same way that shuttles aren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr perhaps there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a better mod to try than Firespitter for this purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest issue is with CoL acting strangely. When I first put the main rotor on directly over the CoM, the CoL was sort of in the ground and off to the side. I couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t figure out how to affect it other than by putting fins on. This raised it up and I could see the whole ball above ground, but the direction of the arrow was not straight up. It was angled a couple of degrees to the right. No matter if I moved the fins along the fuselage to a new position, that angle was not affected. It was also not affected by rotating the part in any manner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, there is a noted lack of helicopters on the boards that I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve seen. One that looked good is a bit old and I could not get it to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what do you guys think? Should I scrap the chopper idea and just go rocket powered VTOL of some kind? Seems like that, in turn, might need a mothership or naval ship to get it close first.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-29T21:35:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2013 09:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Scrogdog\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T18:52:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter flying a helicopter built with Firespitter, I realized that capsule recovery was going to be a royal pain if I tried that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy current plan, which I haven\u0027t actually tried, is to use Hooligan airship parts and KAS winch parts to do recovery. It won\u0027t move as fast as a helicopter, but it still moves faster than a rover, and if you use solar panels and electric props, your pickup range is limited only by your patience. Biggest problem is you\u0027ll need to use the fixed solar panels or RTGs, as the animated solar panels won\u0027t survive even slow airspeeds.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scrogdog","CreatedById":66879,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T19:09:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice idea!

Here\u0027s a few tips:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Don\u0027t use anything that generates lift or much drag apart from the rotors. They just make the craft behave strangely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Perfectly align CoM with CoT, the centre of your fuel tanks (the TAC fuel balancer should help if you use multiple fuel tanks) and the winch. This prevents CoM from shifting with fuel use or lifting cargo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The chopper should be able to lift off with about 1/3 throttle. If it needs more, it\u0027s underpowered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- MechJeb\u0027s SMART A.S.S. is helpful in preventing sudden loss of control.
