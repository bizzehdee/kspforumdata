By that denomination the KSC has a very thin runway for it\u0027s length, and is not nearly wide enough for that maneuver. The 747 makes a decent arguing point simply because it\u0027s so large. The 737 has a 60 \u0027safe\u0027 turning radius, the shortest space it can perform a full 180 in requires 120 feet of pavement. I think it\u0027s safe to say you\u0027d be cutting it. Based on the physics of wheels in KSP I think it\u0027s safer to say any attempt to do a turn on the runway at the KSC will result in tears and spamming of the revert button. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E Hence, taxiways.
