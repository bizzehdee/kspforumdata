There are absolute tons of deep and thoughtfull games on on consoles if you just take one look past the shootings games. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd how exactly would a failed port affect everyone here playing on pc? Its not even affecting squads bottom line (i\u0027d take a guess that the company developing the port is doing so for a cut of the sales, not for a set amount of money) i trust squad enough to have over site on the project and ensure its a decent port.
