KSP is coming to PS4, and that in my honest opinion is great news: it means more people get to enjoy Kerbal Space Program and discover how to rocket science. There are many great things to come to KSP both in the near future and further down the line, and it\u0027s sad to see people speculate or even state for fact otherwise when they have absolutely nothing to base this on; the same goes for the alleged \u0022dumbing down\u0022 of the game. As Max said, partnering up with another studio even provides certain advantages for the PC version, such as the quick port to Unity 5.\n\u003E Generalisations such as \u0022console plebs\u0022 and \u0022PC master race\u0022 really have no place in a level headed discussion. Any group of people is extremely diverse and setting a whole group aside as inferior is just silly and quite honestly degrading. They will not be condoned from here on out.\n\u003E \n\u003E And finally, please be more respectful towards Squad.
