I have a tendency to mess around often with my craft designs, usually with hilariously bad results. But sometimes, I get stuff to work, and then I slap a name on it and post it here for people to heavily criticize enjoy.\n\nSo yeah. First up is a miniature atmospheric plane made with 0.15 stock parts that I affectionately call \u0027Ady.\u0027 It takes some sliiiiight inspiration from one of my favorite fictional aircraft of all time, though it\\\u0027s vastly simplified.\n\n\u003E ![EWMGI.png](http://i.imgur.com/EWMGI.png)\n\u003E And here it is at bay. The high mounted airbreathing engines are really only stable/suitable at low altitudes, but they sip fuel gently and give the craft a solid range overall. The wings are simple enough that a little flex helps keep its stability in most situations. One of my favorite planes for just cruising around like a goofball.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![X6yLA.png](http://imgur.com/X6yLA.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Launching it is just a matter of keeping it steady with the SAS at max throttle until near the end of the runway before pitching up. Keeping it in the air is fairly simple afterwards: apart from a real nasty roll recovery from nose-down, the aircraft\\\u0027s stable enough for daily acrobatic and non-acrobatic needs. Here\\\u0027s a photo of me performing a checkup on one of my cargoliners that didn\\\u0027t quite make it back to base with enough fuel to land on terra firma. Billy\\\u0027s fine, don\\\u0027t worry.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![DU70i.png](http://i.imgur.com/DU70i.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E It also does a really nice Pugachev\\\u0027s Cobra. Dandred agrees.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nNext up, I\\\u0027m going to try properly rebuilding my twin-boom spacefarer from 0.13. Times were tougher, then.\n\n\u003E ![hoskI.png](http://i.imgur.com/hoskI.png)\n\u003E Building this thing was horrendously difficult with the old system. It still flew, at least. Here\\\u0027s to hoping the new version looks like an actual plane."},{"CreatedByName":"sss","CreatedById":24050,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-26T07:45:49Z","Content":"Nice!
