You might think \u0027what the hell, every game starts with designing a booster this isnt special\u0027 and you\u0027d be right. Sort of. In Realism overhaul we have to take into account different fuel mixes, tank types, engine burn time and failure ratings and more. This makes rocket design take a long time and be actually tricky. I aim to design a multi-applicable first and maybe second stage which will ideally last for a whole lot of missions/episodes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIntrigued?
