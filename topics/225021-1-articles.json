I understand if this discussion isn\u2019t productive and there\u2019s no ill will if the thread is removed. The developers working on KSP 2 deserve nothing but our thanks, respect, and admiration for the years of effort they put into a franchise we love. I haven\u2019t been active here in about 4 years, so I may be a bit out of touch with current community attitudes lol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat being said, does anyone else here feel like they saw the current turn of events coming? I remember when T2 first purchased Squad and the rights to KSP\u2019s IP. I remember the community pushback, all of the deleted argument threads, the EULA fiasco, all of the things that most people outside of the forums never really saw. No one was excited for T2. No one thought the franchise would develop in a direction consistent with the established community lore around it. Personally, I never had high hopes for KSP\u2019s development. It\u2019s simply not the type of game Take 2 usually makes a lot of money on. There\u2019s not a whole lot of live-service monetization potential in a sandbox game, and there\u2019s hardly any story potential. It just doesn\u2019t seem like their ballpark. And especially without any of the original team on board, I felt as if it was a matter of time before we started getting some very depressing announcements. There were even threads when the game was announced denouncing those with high hopes for the project. I just feel disappointedly validated with the recent news from T2 \u0026amp; PD.

Even EA and some lags didn\u0027t really bother me at this point. But the negativity \u003Cem\u003Ebefore\u003C/em\u003E the game was even launched was very surprising to me to say the least.

I have Strong bias to this. When self described developer entered the Steam forums I got to think they are rather trolls or on the less bright side if they aren\u0027t working in a whole other area anyway.

When some developers here were actual criticizing with refined arguments, \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E got me worried.

I remember the community pushback, all of the deleted argument threads, the EULA fiasco, all of the things that most people outside of the forums never really saw. No one was excited for T2. No one thought the franchise would develop in a direction consistent with the established community lore around it. Personally, I never had high hopes for KSP\u2019s development. It\u2019s simply not the type of game Take 2 usually makes a lot of money on. There\u2019s not a whole lot of live-service monetization potential in a sandbox game, and there\u2019s hardly any story potential. It just doesn\u2019t seem like their ballpark. And especially without any of the original team on board, I felt as if it was a matter of time before we started getting some very depressing announcements. There were even threads when the game was announced denouncing those with high hopes for the project. I just feel disappointedly validated with the recent news from T2 \u0026amp; PD.
