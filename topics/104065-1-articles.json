You can open the debug log (Press ALT\u002BF2)and watch for errors. That might help you figure out which problem you have for sure.\n\n1) Check the permissions on the VAB directory. Make sure the directories are not set to \u0022read only.\u0022 (Most likely.)\n\n2) You have a corrupt .craft file in the VAB directory. If you have a corrupt craft file, you\u0027ll have to delete it. Often, corrupt craft files are much smaller than the other files (on the order of 1kb).\n\nThe VAB directory will be located in /KSP\\_Install/saves/your\\_save\\_name/ships/VAB\n\nWelcome to the forums! ;D\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"}]}
