After adding my part to GameData, KSP does not load ANY parts!","CreatedByName":"-ctn-","CreatedById":130898,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T16:56:31Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"-ctn-","CreatedById":130898,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T16:56:31Z","Content":"Hey everyone! I tried searching and couldn\u0027t find anything to help me.\n\nI\u0027m trying to add a part to my KSP install, putting it in GameData ect just like I always have. The difference is this part is way more complex in the CFG file than any of the others I\u0027ve done. It\u0027s SUPPOSED to have built in RCS, two engines, and SAS/electricity. \n\nSo I start up KSP and at first, my part showed up like normal but it didn\u0027t function. I found in the CFG file, I was missing a bracket early on, which is why it was basically a giant paperweight.\n\nSo I fix the CFG file and reload KSP, and ALL of the parts are now gone. I don\u0027t get any error messages... Just open up the VAB and... nothing. No parts. At all.\n\nSo I removed my mod and tried again - all the parts are still missing. So I remove ALL the mods I have installed - still nothing.\n\nI install a totally separate KSP game, works fine. Put in ONLY my mod to test it again - and ALL the parts are now missing.\n\nI took out my part, and KSP works like usual.\n\nDoes anybody have a clue what this is? How did I break KSP so badly?!\n\nSnippet from the KSPLog:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [LOG 12:44:45.672] GameDatabase: Assets loaded in 73.821s[LOG 12:44:45.762] PartLoader: Loading part database\n\u003E [LOG 12:44:45.766] PartLoader: Compiling Part \u0027CTN/Parts/phoenix/part/phoenix\u0027\n\u003E \n\u003E [LOG 12:44:45.864] EffectList: Created 11 effect types\n\u003E \n\u003E [EXC 12:44:46.011] ArgumentException: The requested value \u0027MonoPropellant\u0027 was not found.\n\u003E \n\u003E  System.Enum.Parse (System.Type enumType, System.String value, Boolean ignoreCase)\n\u003E \n\u003E  System.Enum.Parse (System.Type enumType, System.String value)\n\u003E \n\u003E  ModuleEngines.OnLoad (.ConfigNode node)\n\u003E \n\u003E  PartModule.Load (.ConfigNode node)\n\u003E \n\u003E  Part.AddModule (.ConfigNode node)\n\u003E \n\u003E  PartLoader.ParsePart (.UrlConfig urlConfig, .ConfigNode node)\n\u003E \n\u003E  PartLoader\u002B.MoveNext ()\n\u003E \n\u003E  UnityEngine.MonoBehaviour:StartCoroutine(IEnumerator)\n\u003E \n\u003E  :MoveNext()\n\u003E \n\u003E  UnityEngine.MonoBehaviour:StartCoroutine(IEnumerator)\n\u003E \n\u003E  PartLoader:StartLoad()\n\u003E \n\u003E  :MoveNext()\n\u003E \n\u003E [EXC 12:44:46.046] NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object\n\u003E \n\u003E  PartLoader.GetDatabaseConfig (.Part p)\n\u003E \n\u003E  PartLoader.GetDatabaseConfig (.Part p, System.String nodeName)\n\u003E \n\u003E  DragCubeSystem.LoadDragCubes (.Part p)\n\u003E \n\u003E  Part\u002B.MoveNext ()\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-13T17:02:28Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2015 05:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by -ctn-**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kartoffelkuchen","CreatedById":108501,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T18:14:33Z","Content":"Yes, I ran into that issue too when I started off with modding, haha! ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) Pretty annoying thing. ![:sealed:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif) It would be good to see your part.cfg, because that\u0027s the error source."},{"CreatedByName":"-ctn-","CreatedById":130898,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T01:53:41Z","Content":"Thank you, I did solve it.
