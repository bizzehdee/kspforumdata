It also means that things can get changed and fixed very quickly. I thought it might be interesting to start a thread where people can contribute what they think the most pressing concerns are currently, as well as what features they think should be implemented first. Let\u0027s have everyone post with their top one or two choices, and I\u0027ll create a poll once I have enough suggestions.
