It\u0027s not the first time (by far) that we do not have a PartTool ready for the release day. And while I loved having some time to get ready with early access and pre release it just means that users will have to learn that we too have lives and mods don\u0027t get upgraded by magic.\n\nAs for this specific upgrade it  took me less than 60min for the lot, except for SmokeScreen where it will require a bit more work and that was to be expected with the particle system change.\n\nAnd I\u0027m sure a few people laughed when they saw your dream team.

Certainly there\u0027s been a few things that I would have liked to be different but for the most part, Squad has been very accommodating in opening up to us. But I think it also depends on how they\u0027re approached. A lot of people on these forums have a very antagonistic approach Re: Squad/KSP and that can\u0027t make for a very good working relationship when you\u0027re trying to get things changed/added/included.\n\nPeople are free to say what they want I guess and free to form their opinions or take their balls and go home and they\u0027ll always remember this day as the day that KSP died for them, but for me it\u0027s just Wednesday and I guess it\u0027s time to start updating.

And how does it handle multiple transforms with the same name? (needed by many plugins, but impossible to do in Blender)  \n\n(I abhor having to use the Unity editor for anything, and every chance I can get to *not* be forced to use it is a big win in my eyes)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 21 hours ago, Temeter said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Oh really, it\u0027s that bad? That sucks\n\u003E \n\nYes and no.  I\u0027m fairly certain that I could recompile my existing plugins vs. the new KSP codebase fairly quickly, but that is not what I\u0027m displeased about (it is *what* they are doing, and more specifically *how* they have implemented it.\n\nI think mostly the statement that I was trying to make is that they have dropped the community driven aspects of their updates and releases.  No chance to report bugs, no chance to get things changed if modding functions were broken.  I used to be able to actually *talk* to the devs\n\nThe other part of my statement is regarding their additions to stock code for the mesh/texture switch.  Rather than designing a system that could be used by others and in a decently complex manner, they\u0027ve added all of the part-variant stuff *directly to the* Part class.  Rather than design a modular system that modders could use and expand upon, they\u0027ve designed a proprietary system that will only be usable for very limited purposes.  I haven\u0027t even checked to see if it interferes with my existing code/methods.  Ohh, and they decided to bake it into the entire Part system, including the editor icons.  So how can I use the stock part variant system for my modular parts?  Oh, wait, I can\u0027t....  I can\u0027t use their UI, I can\u0027t use their icon-based previews...  More and more they are relegating mods to \u0027second class\u0027 status.  (You know what kind of crazy stuff I could do if I could manipulate the Part class?.... no?  neither do I... *mods can\u0027t add stuff to the Part class, or even provide derived classes;* 100% certain I could solve my dynamic run-time part-module switching problems if I could override the Part class and/or had more hooks into it/could override methods*)*.\n\nSomeone obviously put quite a bit of thought and effort into the system.  It looks good *for their limited purposes*.  I was just hoping ~~being delusional~~ that they would have made a system that could be used by others, and for more than just very simple model changes.\n\nAnyhow, there will be at least one more SSTU release to make it usable for KSP 1.4\u002B.  Still not sure exactly what all will be in it, and regardless it is going to be at least a few weeks out.  I won\u0027t even be able to start looking at it for at least another week, plus however long it takes to actually do the update/finish the reworked code.  And before I can even start back in on SSTU, I need to update and push out versions of TU, KSPWheel, KF, and a few other small mods/utilities first (which will likely happen sometime after 1.4.1).\n\n(had meant to post a reply yesterday, but the forums were broken for me for a large portion of the day)"},{"CreatedByName":"drhay53","CreatedById":150399,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-08T17:45:58Z","Content":"Just want to say that for me, KSP ***is*** mods.

With that said, I would say SSTU deserve to be in the released section. Its quality is on par or surpass released mods. SSTU deserve to be known, because its not a mod, its many mods, its a total conversion.  \n\nI would say that while you stopping development would make me sad, the current version is more than adequate. So, if you get it to 1.4(1) and then do nothing but maintenance until you fell like doing more I would be more that happy.
