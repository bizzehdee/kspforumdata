It is not meant to be efficient, and is larger and has more delta-V than is strictly necessary for such a flight. Instead, the Moon Visitor is meant to be reliable, easy to fly, and to have enough of an error margin built-in that a new pilot can make some mistakes and still get there and back. If you do not yet know how to fly to the moons, I have made an \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81320-An-illustrated-moon-mission-walkthrough-for-new-pilots-%28with-link-to-example-ship%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eillustrated walkthrough guide\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E, which can be flown with this ship design. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch the ship and leave the throttle at 100%, as the ship is balanced to stay near optimal ascent speed as it rises through the atmosphere. The solid boosters will soon exhaust themselves, and you should eject them. The launch stage will continue to burn until you have nearly reached orbit, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gGalJhN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022gGalJhN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eat which time you should eject it and ignite the transit stage to finalize Kerbin orbit. The transit stage will bring the ship to orbit around either moon, and do most of the pre-landing braking for you before it runs out of fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PY2ZEqN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022PY2ZEqN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen eject the transit stage and bring the lander stage down to the surface.

You may or may not need to discard the moon landing stage along the way, but either way, the Mk59 does give you the option. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EQfmG1W.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EQfmG1W.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you should happen to run entirely out of fuel before achieving a re-entry trajectory, the final flight core stage can use any remaining RCS fuel as emergency propulsion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut once you have chosen (or desperately managed) a landing trajectory, eject the flight core and allow the capsule to splashdown with its parachutes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nTBGIN6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nTBGIN6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAdditional features: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mk59i illuminates itself on the launchpad, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sft71hu.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sft71hu.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand once it has landed on the moon of your choice. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Rh9xlB5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Rh9xlB5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough intended as a sandbox trainer, the ship does carry scientific instruments, and can transmit their results from the surface of the moons if flown in the later stages of a career campaign. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NEujcvM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NEujcvM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mk59i also comes with an emergency abort system.
