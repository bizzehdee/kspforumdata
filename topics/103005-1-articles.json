Barman says goodbye to the shuttle and closes her eyes accepting her fate, The crew watch the station vaporize followed by the earth before going back inside their cryopods for another long slumber.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETen billion years later: The sun and solar system are gone except for the Mighty gas giants who survived the end, The crew wake up and look out the window to see that the cycle has repeated itself and from the ashes a new solar system has formed with a new Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you guys like my idea for a movie plot, If anyone here is a good poet i would like it if you could post a poem based on this storyline below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe soundtrack for such a movie would be an extended version of this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/ay3EwNGM5yw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease comment i want to know you guys\u0027s opinions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-31T01:06:18Z\u0022 title=\u002203/31/2015 01:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by daniel l.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"daniel l.","CreatedById":57763,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T01:37:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe someone could get a director to make this \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E (I\u0027m serious)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FishInferno","CreatedById":106219,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T19:08:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis would be a great movie:).
