If you then consider that the game has not always been $23.00 I\u0027d take off maybe $2,200,000, then taking into consideration that KSP is on Steam now so Steam would definitely get a percentage of the profit from copies sold on Steam, let\u0027s say 30%, so minus another $800,000. That puts the profit for Squad at $6,000,000, sounds about right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Disclaimer: This is complete guesswork with no confirmed validity in any way whatsoever.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Richy teh space man","CreatedById":12511,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T13:05:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to hazard a guess at 700,000 people who\u0027ve bought the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JaySmoka","CreatedById":60988,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T15:15:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI guess around 100K.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AHO","CreatedById":49070,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T15:46:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m guessing around 200,000\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brabbit1987","CreatedById":65801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T16:49:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou know this is actually a very hard estimate to make.
