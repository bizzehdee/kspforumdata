(With aerobraking) Really, it should be able to haul pretty much anything. It has a decent TWR, but it is still less than 1 on kerbin\u0027s surface, along with an RTG, a large reaction wheel set and to put this thing into perspective: It has the DV and TWR to lift 36 tonnes from the surface to orbit around Duna. With only 3 NTR\u0027s. If we are going into the whole, no crashing NTRs or using them in atmo because of the whole \u0022OMG, Nuclear!? What if it blows up!\u0022 thing*, it is completely and utterly reuseable.

The Nuclear fuel in the engine is there to heat it up (To increase efficiency, as heating the fuel up basically increases it\u0027s exhaust velocity, AKA specific impulse.), and is heavily shielded so there\u0027s no radiation or fissile material coming out of the back, unless you have anOpen Cycle Engine. Open Cycle Engines are incredibly efficient, to the point of making a Hydrolox fueled craft of significant mass with the capability to go to mars (Say, Copernicus), able to go to Jupiter and Saturn, and possibly the ice giants, Uranus and Neptune. The downside is, when you use them you are irradiating everything behind you and losing your fuel, as some of the nuclear fuel is ejected out of the back along with the Hydrolox. IIRC, they had an estimated Vacuum ISP of ~3000s. The best NTR or NERVA that I can remember had an ISP of ~950s. The general public don\u0027t know or understand this though, so they just freak out at the word \u0022Nuclear\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-09T15:43:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMono, I pulled the persistence for screenshot purposes and finished your sig badge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5542/12411234403_55f7ba4416_o.png\u0022 alt=\u002212411234403_55f7ba4416_o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou sir have earned this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-09T17:51:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Captain Sierra\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Captain Sierra\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMono, I pulled the persistence for screenshot purposes and finished your sig badge.\u003Cp\u003E~pic snip\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou sir have earned this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, it looks great!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-09T21:52:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to send out a Kethane probe to Minmus and a deep space probe because I\u0027ve got nothing better to do \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Just finished. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/hycitoxjfdw82ag/persistent.sfs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s the Persistent\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-10T04:17:31Z\u0022 title=\u002202/10/2014 04:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Avera9eJoe\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-11T05:09:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow what?, It seems that everybody here are not motivate enough...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deathsoul097","CreatedById":77396,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-11T05:12:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo. We are waiting on the next PL to present his project.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Weegee","CreatedById":72084,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-11T05:28:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECool your jets, I\u0027ll have it soon. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027ll be ready to submit tomorrow, and I\u0027ll have everyone sign up ahead of the mission starting so hopefully there\u0027s less confusion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-11T05:36:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERemember to state the deadline for each process/member.
