This produces the least amount of strain through the wheels; vertical speed is the killer on flat terrain, not horizontal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother problem is wheel/wing positioning; when your gear touch down, they will impose both a large vertical force and a rearwards drag. This will tend to torque the front down. With large craft, this torque, if not minimized, is actually capable of snapping a craft in half. It can be minimized through a large (and, ideally, distributed wing, so that there isn\u0027t differential strain along the length of the craft), which will act to keep the weight off the wheels at touchdown speeds, and through keeping the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, and rear gear alignment all close to each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing additional rear gear can also help mitigate things, both by increasing the spring resistance so that the strain is imposed more gradually instead of bottoming out the suspension (which tends to jam the landing gear up into the fuselage and causes all sorts of other issues) and by reducing differential lateral strain. More wings is a better option for the first and balancing the cantilever on a pair of the gear carefully a better option for the second, but sometimes they aren\u0027t possible. You need to be careful to not use gear that\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E large, though, or you can get one that has no give at all, which has the same undesired effect of translating the shock of landing directly to the mounting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFlaps can work to give you additional low-speed lift and slow you down faster. They can make a very useful difference in your landing approach, since they\u0027re much more effective than the same mass in main wing in providing lift (with consequent advantages in other flight phases). They can however bleed airspeed in a hurry, so it takes some practice to get the timing down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAvoid overstrutting. You want to anyway, because they\u0027re awful aerodynamically, but some floppiness in the craft actually helps absorb differential strains. Over-rigidifying causes brittle failures and can progagate stresses in weird ways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor your craft specifically, \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/163081-barsandcat/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022163081\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/163081-barsandcat/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@barsandcat\u003C/a\u003E, the solution\u0027s actually really simple: Move your center rear landing gear forward, so that it\u0027s in-line with the two wing-pod mounted ones. That way all your rear gear will touch down at the same time (and give you a nice wide wheelbase for lateral stability). That gives you the ability to runway land. I did some further tweaking and swapped out the XL gear for the Ls and moved all three rear gear forward, which gives it some rough-field capability as well as making it slightly lighter, making it rotate for takeoff easier, and making it more stable in the air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nCraft file here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/pjo2065xtcus9l2/KSP%20Refueler%208W10N%20VF.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/pjo2065xtcus9l2/KSP Refueler 8W10N VF.craft?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-24T22:57:51Z\u0022 title=\u002211/24/2016 10:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 24, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by foamyesque\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"barsandcat","CreatedById":163081,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-25T05:49:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for help!
