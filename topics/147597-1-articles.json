I\u0027m thinking about something more self-serve, freeing up time for docents to move around and open up a display for additional users.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EA dream (without much knowledge about KSP add-ons or functionality...yet):\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nCreate a kiosk app that lets people choose a few options in a visual menu system (not in KSP yet). Wing configuration, body type, rocket length, stage options, etc.,. Will it make it to orbit??? The kiosk app creates a script and launches KSP with options. Kerbal people nod at each other and the rocket launches. Fail or success?? You will see, then have the option to try again. Bonus: share with your friends via the touch screen kiosk (post-flight kiosk feature). No keyboard. No mouse. No KSP menus unrelated to kiosk goals. Just touch and go and repeat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes this seem remotely possible? I see an extensive API and add-on capabilities. This looks like a great start! Worst case, I see recording several options and playing videos based on selections. This does get complex to handle with more options though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t need specifics, but good clues will help me get started.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for taking a look!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-14T01:58:29Z\u0022 title=\u002209/14/2016 01:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by cls\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eedited title\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
