For some reason, the game completely freezes as soon as I hit 69 km. The sound will still be playing but the screen is frozen and the game doesn\u0027t respond at all (have to shut it down with task manager).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done some tests, and it seems like this only happens in career mode. If I fly the exact same rocket in sandbox or science mode, everything works fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did a search, but the only thing I could find similar to what I\u0027m experiencing was a couple messages in the KScale2 thread. I\u0027m not using that mod, but I am using Kerbol 3.7, which is another similar Kopernicus mod, but I don\u0027t really understand how either would only break in career.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas? I\u0027m so baffled!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"yorshee","CreatedById":135011,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T11:26:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe fact it only happens in career mode makes me think there\u0027s something wrong with the game when you complete the \u0027Escape the atmosphere\u0027 contract.
