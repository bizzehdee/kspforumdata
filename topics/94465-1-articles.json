But serioulsy, as silly as this suggestion might initially seem to be, KSP could have a few female Kerbals in there. Of the pilots, engineers, scientists, and administrators I\u0027ve encountered all 100% are male. In this day and age a few women in there would be a appropriate, and certainly a few female Kerbal \u0022role model\u0022 or two for the young women out there playing the game couldn\u0027t hurt. I love this game, but I actually got a little uncomfortable seeing the \u0022male dominated space industry stereotype\u0022 reinforced needlessly. And yes, I\u0027m a man.
