I used the Mk1-2 pod .cfg as a baseline, as my pod is close to the same size (2.5m on bottom, 1.5m on top, but a little shorter than the mk1-2 pod) but was double size so I had to set the scale and rescale factor both to 0.5. I\u0027m still playing with making the top and bottom attachment nodes be in the correct places. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut my question is - where the part is a command pod, when I try to EVA a Kerbal it gives an error about not having a hatch. I wasn\u0027t surprised at this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have any idea how I add a hatch to a part? Do I do this in unity? (page 4 of the tutorial I linked above?) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo I do something special in the .cfg file for the part? Is it something on the 3dmodel itself?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rabidninjawombat","CreatedById":108889,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T16:29:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey Tjsnh, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStart here: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/94638\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/94638\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnder Unity/Configs There is a section on setting up Airlocks (hatches).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tjsnh","CreatedById":108021,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T18:50:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYikes.
