How can this be fair to your consumers and fans?\u003Cbr\u003E\nDo you know what else is not fair? The fact that the game is still on the Playstation Store page for sale as if everything is normal when it is not in fact, people are buying a game that does not work, that does not deliver the expected result for a product of the standard to be sold by one of the Largest companies in video games.\u003Cbr\u003E\nRecall from earlier times, Batman Arkham Knight was a highly anticipated game by all, his company responsible (Rocksteady) received harsh criticism about the performance on the PCs by the game being dead, what did the company do? They took their product out of the stores and returned the money from all those who ordered and focused on fixing the problem, contacting other companies for support, and in the end, the game is in perfect shape.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut back to Kerbal, why is the game being sold if it does not work as it should? They may think, \u0022We need funds to pay for the repair costs,\u0022 okay, but then you mean you know you\u0027re kidding people to get these funds? The answer to this question is seen in the acts of the company.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen I check company Twitter, I come across several wonderful posts about content on the PC, including a photo of one of the employees proudly showing their beautiful team playing Kerbal, should not they be working on a fix instead of playing? Should not they warn you about the state of the game on consoles instead of showing how wonderful it is? Where are the producers often warning us about the current state of the game?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI bought Kerbal on the Playstation Store next to its launch, until today I could not play it properly because my game always crashes and always hangs, I can not ask for a refund because the law in my country where it allows this gives me the right to ask in up to 7 Days only, and such problems happened later. I emailed the game support for a refund, and guess what?
