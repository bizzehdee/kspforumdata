It\\\u0027s available through the patcher system, so if you run the game, it should let you know that there is an update available.\n\nNote that this patch is meant for the 0.15.0 version, so make sure you have that version installed before trying to patch. You can get it as a[full download from the KSP Store](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/kspstore/index.php?c=18\u0026p=22). \n\nYou won\\\u0027t be able to update to 0.15.1 if you\\\u0027re on a version earlier than 0.15.0. Please make sure you\\\u0027re using the latest version, otherwise the patcher is almost certain to fail.\n\nThis patch addresses a couple of bugs and tweaks a few details. Here\\\u0027s the changelog:\n\n**Bug Fixes and Tweaks:**\n\n**\\* Fixed a couple of issues with the parts action UI popups and their code bindings.**\n\n**\\* Tweaked the time warp altitude limits. It is now possible to warp fast at low orbits around Minmus and the Mun.**\n\n**\\* Tweaked the rotating reference frame thresholds when nearing planets, to reduce terrain mesh jitter.**\n\n**\\* Fixed the \\\u0027Serpinski Terrain\\\u0027 issue, where the terrain mesh would break up when approaching a planet after travelling very far.**\n\n**\\* Fixed an issue with the patched conic solver failing on some escape trajectories.**\n\n**\\* Fixed the normal maps on several parts.**\n\n**\\* It is now possible to set the persistent debris budget to zero, to disable saving debris completely.**\n\nEDIT:\n\nWe\\\u0027ve released a 15.2 hotfix revision today. It just fixes an issue with a physics setting, which could cause phantom forces and spontaneous disassembly when launching. \n\nIf you\\\u0027re not patched already to 15.1, the patcher should take you directly to 15.2. Should be a quick update, as it\\\u0027s just a very minor tweak.\n\nHappy Launchings!\n\nCheers"},{"CreatedByName":"Alehkhs","CreatedById":373,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-31T23:58:58Z","Content":"And now the wait for 0.16 details... ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketScienceKSP","CreatedById":26553,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T00:00:15Z","Content":"Did you fix this one?\n\n[http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=13005.0](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=13005.0)"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T00:03:19Z","Content":"That issue and all others related to travelling fast (aka, the Kraken) should hopefully be resolved relatively soon.\n\n(Apologies for accidentally editing your post instead of quoting at first, [still getting used to these new buttons](http://i.imgur.com/If98i.png) :-X)\n\nEdit: Also, it would seem the linear RCS fix didn\\\u0027t get included... shame."},{"CreatedByName":"Akyho","CreatedById":1181,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T00:32:37Z","Content":"I think one of those fixs in Technobabble means....That the mun wont disappear and let me fly into its core.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E (Apologies for accidentally editing your post instead of quoting at first, [still getting used to these new buttons](http://i.imgur.com/If98i.png) :-X)\n\nFrom being a mod on some forums I assure you...you will never get used to it and still always edit peoples post\\\u0027s......HAVE FUN!"},{"CreatedByName":"NIN3","CreatedById":16605,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T01:16:36Z","Content":"Cant wait to download it!"},{"CreatedByName":"zantkiller","CreatedById":1519,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T02:41:52Z","Content":"Ok this is weird the patcher was on step 3/5 got to 100% downloading and the popped up with \u0027(not Responding)\u0027. \n\nI did fresh install of 0.15 and tried again but the same thing happened, but when I check the Readme it has v0.15.1 on it.
