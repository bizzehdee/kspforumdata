Is the nose going up, putting it into a backflip? Is the nose dropping? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may need to re-balance the spaceplane so that when you dump the jet engines, the center of mass doesn\u0027t move too far forward or backwards. If the nose is pitching up uncontrollably, move some mass forward by adding extra fuel tanks near the front, or by moving the wings forward. If the nose is dropping, move some mass backwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally, you want it to be slightly heavy in the rear so that it naturally pitches up. I assume you\u0027re using the advanced SAS as well? If so, either pull up with the SAS still engaged (this might take a while as you force it upwards), or disengage and re-engage the SAS quickly while tapping S.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Markus Reese","CreatedById":28539,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-04T23:00:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI found the most common cause for a flipover in space planes is either a fuel burn imbalance. This often due to extravagant fuel tank setups, or thrust imbalance. If you engines off the z axis centre of gravity and not enough arial control surface, the trust alone will cause your vehicle to begin to rotate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-05T03:56:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7134/7857479380_e712025d49_c.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00227857479380_e712025d49_c.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo lift from wings means no flipping.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Suzaku","CreatedById":40800,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-05T05:17:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds like your center of thrust is not lined up with your center of gravity. do you have any pictures of your craft?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-05T06:47:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDepending on your airspeed, there should be enough pressure at 10km to keep under control. I\u0027m guessing you keep the 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 pitch angle all the time? As you get higher, the rate of climb will decrease.
