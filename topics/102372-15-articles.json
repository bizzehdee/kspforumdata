But I also ran into problems with getting the investor to be recognized as part of the crew.  Dropped in here and saw the development DLL, so I saved and exited KSP - put the DLL in place and restarted the game.  It would now recognize the investor as crew, but I never got the waypoints and driving to the specified locations didn\u0027t work either.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So I went back to the Space Center and blammo -- the investor and my pilot both disappeared from my tour car ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif \u0022:(\u0022)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I ended up using Alt-F12 to complete the contract, but I wasn\u0027t offered any construction contracts.

However, while it said to look in mission control for the construction contract, I haven\u0027t seen it yet.
