The various opinions and theories about what might happen are very diverse, unless you consider it to be a simple yes or no question as it relates to what the state of things will be in this context 1 billion\u002B years from now. However, it makes for great forum reading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is easy for me to say that, in my opinion, our chances at long term survival are better if we collectively embrace science. I\u0027m an atheist, and although the demonization of science in history and the embracing of religious fundamentalism has proven to have very bad consequences (watch the Cosmos featuring Niel DeGrasse Tyson), I think that ultimately secularism may be the one way to achieve a better collective scientific world community. If we can just learn to not hate and kill one another based on religious differences, we can abandon spending all this money and time on war. If asking everyone to abandon religion doesn\u0027t work for now, then I\u0027d simply ask them to at least be secular.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease, stop turning global warming into a political football. It has nothing to do with some leftist agenda. Although I admire the work of Peter Kropotkin, and I wouldn\u0027t call myself \u0022socialist\u0022, it\u0027s not like every single part of socialism is evil. We have to continue to adapt with population growth, and that could mean certain reforms are necessary. It isn\u0027t 1776 anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really do think that critical thinking and embracing the scientific method is the first step toward long term survival of humanity.

Let me start by debunking Malthus, the person who came up with the equation that many use today to claim the world is overpopulated. Malthus never calculated into his equation a variable for technology. He did not see the use of GMOs, hydroponic farming techniques, the experimentation being done on edible lichens, plankton, and algae by American, Israeli, German and Swiss scientists, archologies, or synthetic meats. Hydroponic farming could essentially change farming landscape from its current horizontal model to a vertical one - think of a farm constructed like a parking garage with multiple levels. Archologies are self-sufficient structures which contain an entire community and because of its enclosed environment, could theoretically be constructed in any climate or on any body within the solar system.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a 134 page essay that you did not read. 19 chapters and what you\u0027re talking about is only in the vaguest of references to chapter 2 which is only 6 pages of which you also did not read.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMalthus explains that in a state of unbridled population checks, sustenance included, the human population will double every 25 years. Arguing the statistic is argumentium ad absurdium, change the figures however you wish the notion of population expansion has been shown multiple times in human history.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMalthus also explains that sustenance has finite bounds in regards to land and resources committed to it; the chapter touches upon these bounds only to explain where the simulation is at fault, but does not fully consider the bounds as per technological advancements. In other words, your \u0022debunking\u0022 was already debunked by Malthus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMalthus argues that the rate technological advancements in agriculture is unlikely to be done at an exponential rate and explains such a situation would eventually become untenable due to the lack of natural restrictions to population growth. Should we have, at a given time, enough food to satisfy the present population we would need the next day enough food to satisfy the FUTURE population in terms of babies and this would have to continue until the human race destroys itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESo, the \u0022argument\u0022 is really that we\u0027re always trying to catch up to adequately supply the present population.

The earth\u0027s climate is changing, ice sheets at both poles are raising the sea levels, more floods, powerful cyclones and heatwaves are happening, fresh glacial water in the Himalayas (the water that feeds a large portion of earth\u0027s population) is running out, millions are dying from air pollution, climate denialists are running for president, entire forests are turning into barren wastelands, ocean currents are collapsing, coral reefs are disappearing, invasive species and crop-killing pests are growing resistance to the human methods of controlling them, the trees that produce the oxygen we breathe are being chopped down for toilet paper, the oil, coal and natural gas that the entire transportation system, energy grid and industrial system runs off will cease to exist in 50 years, the global economy is still unstable, more nations than ever have nuclear weapons, formerly democratic nations are turning into fascist militarized police states, the war on terror is almost lost, almost every natural disaster type is growing more powerful by the decade, basic freedoms are being suppressed in so-called \u0027first world\u0027 countries, and for some reason we simultaneously have around the same number of obese people as starving people.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, say we managed to get through all that. Say we now have self-sufficient colonies and nations across the solar system. We\u0027re all good, right? NO. There are still countless events that could wipe out everybody easily. An ASI, or more advanced alien species would have no problem at all cleaning up the solar system for themselves. Even humans themselves could still wipe each other out with powerful enough war machines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still think it is possible, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven enough time, a runaway greenhouse could potentially lead to total extinction, but that\u0027s not what I\u0027m talking about. That\u0027s the long-term threat, but we\u0027re in deep trouble long before we have to deal with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The short-term threat of climate change is that it is a risk multiplier: it makes all of the existing problems worse. Famine, pestilence, war; the danger of all of these is enhanced by climate change, and they all feed into each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Food crops are both location and climate dependent. As the US rain band shifts north to the defrosting Canadian tundra, you can\u0027t just shift the crops with it; the recently-thawed mud needs time to develop into proper agricultural soil. Shifting climate also trashes pollination mechanisms for wild flora and drives extinction of endangered species. Changing watercourses exacerbate already-dangerous shortages of potable water. Expanding tropical zones bring tropical diseases with them; you can already track the march of Dengue fever etc. southwards along the north Queensland coast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E For the most obvious example: almost all of Bangladesh is within spitting distance of sea level. On current rates, the country is likely to be largely uninhabitable (without Dutch-style water management, which the Bangladeshis don\u0027t have the resources to implement) within a century. Bangladesh\u0027s neighbours (India, China, Pakistan etc.) are all nuclear armed and have a history of military conflict. How do you think they\u0027re going to react when 100 million Bangladeshi refugees land on their doorstep? What will India do if China attempt to divert all of the Bangladeshis to the south and vice-versa?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E That\u0027s just one example, but similar scenarios recur again and again across the world. Throughout history, most military conflict has ultimately been caused by competition over resources. Climate change, in the near future, is going to substantially damage the global food supply and the already-running-short supply of potable water. Desperate people do desperate things, and there\u0027s nothing like hunger and thirst to drive desperation. Historically, starvation leads to revolution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If you go talk to the academics who specialise in conflict studies, they\u0027ll tell you that we\u0027re already seeing the first climate-driven wars. So will the people in charge of medium-term planning for the militaries of the industrialised world. Marginal environments like northern Africa are the first to go, but it will spread beyond that with time. We live in an interconnected world; everything affects everything else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The situation we are seeing now is not \u0022the climate changing as it always has\u0022. Yes, climates change over geological timescales; the slow pace has historically given the biosphere time to adapt (and, in the rare cases of sudden change like Chicxulub, the slow pace afterwards has provided time to recover). What we\u0027re doing to the place is unprecedented in both its suddenness and its momentum. We\u0027re driving the change way too fast, and there is enough momentum built up (warmed oceans, melted permafrost, defrosted methane clathrates) that it\u0027s either too late to stop it or very close to that point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If you aren\u0027t frightened by climate change, you don\u0027t understand the situation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a guy that has done his research.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce humanity has overcome the current inertia, the first step will be to develop the resources of the inner solar system. The resources of the main Asteroid Belt are effectively inexhaustible. While the main belt is hard to get to from Earth, it is within easy reach of Mars, which has the resources needed to support a major industrial and technological civilisation. Anything the asteroid miners can\u0027t produce for themselves at their relatively small outposts can be imported from Mars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Later, the outer solar system will be settled to bring it\u0027s effectively inexhaustible reserves of helium3 fusion fuel into play. There are many ways to get sustainable energy on Earth, but since the energy needs of an advanced civilisation will be vastly greater than the present day, fusion will quickly become the cheapest game in town. The outer solar system will not only give us unlimited energy, it gives us the energy needed to propel starships.
