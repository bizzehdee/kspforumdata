However, I don\u0027t tend to use them. The \u003Cstrong\u003Ereason \u003C/strong\u003Ebeing that there is no game-play element that encourage you to \u003Cstrong\u003Eprevent \u003C/strong\u003Ethe specific failure, only resolve after it has failed. In other words, I\u0027d like there to be an element of \u003Cstrong\u003Epreparation,\u003C/strong\u003E to help reduce the chance of failure before it occurs. Which again is also a large focus in most real life missions, as there is usually no one to climb outside with a wrench. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/109901-1-0-2-TestFlight-v1-3-1-17-May-2015-Bring-Flight-Testing-to-KSP!\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETest Flight\u003C/a\u003E is of course purely based on this, as you do test flights to lower the chance of failure, but it\u0027s only one element of a larger process, if you compare it to real world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my thoughts are: If it\u0027s even possible, how about an add-on which unifies the \u0022preparation\u0022 elements from other add-ons with failure elements from failure add-ons?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, let\u0027s say you use \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92377-1-0-x-Kerbal-Construction-Time-1-1-7-%2805-15-15%29-Unrapid-Planned-Assembly?highlight=dang\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal Construction Time\u003C/a\u003E and reuse parts very often. Then that factor could affect the chances of having a failure with Dang It. Or perhaps you rushed the construction to intercept an astroid?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96031-0-90-Kerbal-Weather-Systems!-Alpha-0-5-3-WIP!-%28Jan-2%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal Weather Systems\u003C/a\u003E or \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107989-1-02-Kerbal-Wind-%28R8-27-05-2015%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal Wind\u003C/a\u003E add-on you could have increased chance of failure if you launched during bad weather. Which gives you incentive to wait with certain launches, giving an extra challenge in planning launch windows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther thoughts is to perhaps have a \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003Elaunch readiness\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022 factor combined with a \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003Elaunch countdown\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022 element to give an incentive to do a proper launch countdown. For example, there is a set of \u003Cstrong\u003Egreen/red light\u003C/strong\u003Es representing different sections and departments which needs to be ready for launch, and you can chose to launch even if one section has not reported \u0022go for launch\u0022, risking higher chance of failure. This could even include add-ons like \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83305-1-0-2-RemoteTech-v1-6-5-2015-05-18\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERemote Tech\u003C/a\u003E, if you chose to launch even if capcom reports red light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce gain, even the readiness function could also be affected by prior preparation elements, such as construction time and test flights. And perhaps even be affected by the \u003Cstrong\u003Estupidity \u003C/strong\u003Elevels of all your hired \u003Cstrong\u003Eengineers\u003C/strong\u003E, and the current level of your \u003Cstrong\u003EMission Control \u003C/strong\u003Ebuilding. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough it\u0027s probably a bit unrealistic to have such a unification, as it require someone to read through every involved add-on and learn its functionality, I at least hope it would give an incentive to the original authors for each respective add-on to leave some extra comments at certain places in the source which could potentially be used for such a unification. Then, perhaps in the future it will be more likely! : D\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tontow","CreatedById":64552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T07:33:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think having Dang it reduce part failures on a given part based on how many test contracts you have done for that part is a great idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T09:48:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kimiko\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kimiko\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe \u003Cstrong\u003Ereason \u003C/strong\u003Ebeing that there is no game-play element that encourage you to \u003Cstrong\u003Eprevent \u003C/strong\u003Ethe specific failure, only resolve after it has failed.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EIn Dang It! you can do maintenance and inspections to lower the change of failure. But I guess that\u0027s not what you are looking for.\u003Cp\u003EThis interoperability of mods is quite cool but at the same time quite challenging for the mod makers. It\u0027s not a problem to check if a certain mod is installed. The real thing is to adapt to different mod installations because not every player installs the same mods. What failure values does Dang It! need when only Kerbal Construction Time ist installed? What values are needed if I add add Weather? What values do I need if I now remove Kerbal Construction time. This balancing takes a huge amout of work!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example you mentioned 5 mods (I counted the two weather mods as one). If a mod maker want to change Dang It! to work with the other 4 ones he\u0027ll have to test and balance 15 different combinations (Dang It! stand alone, Dang It! \u002B Weather, Dang It! \u002B Weather \u002B RemoteTech, etc.). If you add another mod to that list the possible combinations raise to 27 etc. It\u0027s not feasible. Unfortunately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would see something like this too!
