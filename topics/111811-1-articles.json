However, I don\u0027t tend to use them. The **reason** being that there is no game-play element that encourage you to **prevent** the specific failure, only resolve after it has failed. In other words, I\u0027d like there to be an element of **preparation,** to help reduce the chance of failure before it occurs. Which again is also a large focus in most real life missions, as there is usually no one to climb outside with a wrench. [Test Flight](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/109901-1-0-2-TestFlight-v1-3-1-17-May-2015-Bring-Flight-Testing-to-KSP!) is of course purely based on this, as you do test flights to lower the chance of failure, but it\u0027s only one element of a larger process, if you compare it to real world.\n\nSo my thoughts are: If it\u0027s even possible, how about an add-on which unifies the \u0022preparation\u0022 elements from other add-ons with failure elements from failure add-ons?\n\nFor example, let\u0027s say you use [Kerbal Construction Time](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92377-1-0-x-Kerbal-Construction-Time-1-1-7-%2805-15-15%29-Unrapid-Planned-Assembly?highlight=dang) and reuse parts very often. Then that factor could affect the chances of having a failure with Dang It. Or perhaps you rushed the construction to intercept an astroid?\n\nWith the [Kerbal Weather Systems](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96031-0-90-Kerbal-Weather-Systems!-Alpha-0-5-3-WIP!-%28Jan-2%29) or [Kerbal Wind](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107989-1-02-Kerbal-Wind-%28R8-27-05-2015%29) add-on you could have increased chance of failure if you launched during bad weather. Which gives you incentive to wait with certain launches, giving an extra challenge in planning launch windows.\n\nOther thoughts is to perhaps have a \u0022**launch readiness**\u0022 factor combined with a \u0022**launch countdown**\u0022 element to give an incentive to do a proper launch countdown. For example, there is a set of **green/red light**s representing different sections and departments which needs to be ready for launch, and you can chose to launch even if one section has not reported \u0022go for launch\u0022, risking higher chance of failure. This could even include add-ons like [Remote Tech](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83305-1-0-2-RemoteTech-v1-6-5-2015-05-18), if you chose to launch even if capcom reports red light.\n\nOnce gain, even the readiness function could also be affected by prior preparation elements, such as construction time and test flights. And perhaps even be affected by the **stupidity** levels of all your hired **engineers**, and the current level of your **Mission Control** building. \n\nAlthough it\u0027s probably a bit unrealistic to have such a unification, as it require someone to read through every involved add-on and learn its functionality, I at least hope it would give an incentive to the original authors for each respective add-on to leave some extra comments at certain places in the source which could potentially be used for such a unification. Then, perhaps in the future it will be more likely! : D"},{"CreatedByName":"Tontow","CreatedById":64552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T07:33:18Z","Content":"I think having Dang it reduce part failures on a given part based on how many test contracts you have done for that part is a great idea."},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T09:48:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The **reason** being that there is no game-play element that encourage you to **prevent** the specific failure, only resolve after it has failed.\n\nIn Dang It! you can do maintenance and inspections to lower the change of failure. But I guess that\u0027s not what you are looking for.\nThis interoperability of mods is quite cool but at the same time quite challenging for the mod makers. It\u0027s not a problem to check if a certain mod is installed. The real thing is to adapt to different mod installations because not every player installs the same mods. What failure values does Dang It! need when only Kerbal Construction Time ist installed? What values are needed if I add add Weather? What values do I need if I now remove Kerbal Construction time. This balancing takes a huge amout of work!\n\nFor example you mentioned 5 mods (I counted the two weather mods as one). If a mod maker want to change Dang It! to work with the other 4 ones he\u0027ll have to test and balance 15 different combinations (Dang It! stand alone, Dang It! \u002B Weather, Dang It! \u002B Weather \u002B RemoteTech, etc.). If you add another mod to that list the possible combinations raise to 27 etc. It\u0027s not feasible. Unfortunately.\n\nI would see something like this too! But the amount of work is just ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)."},{"CreatedByName":"John Nowak","CreatedById":67890,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T20:32:27Z","Content":"One of the highlights of the Saturn V facility at Kennedy Space Center for me is the firing room display which walks through the launch of Apollo 8. Essentially, it\u0027s a great big checklist of things which need to take place, in sequence. That\u0027s basically what a countdown is. It\u0027s fascinating to watch them step through, but I\u0027m not sure how to turn it into part of a game.\n\n...Unless the game could actually perform a final checkout of your design, and give you the chance to ignore the warnings or revert to the VAB to correct them."}]}
