The more weight the vessel has the higher both numbers need to be set to. The numbers are arbitrary so you should play with them. If the space plane damps up and down during the takeoff roll you should put dampener and friction higher.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSmall unevenness in ground contact can cause more friction on one wheels causing the vessel to turn. That is why it is best to attach the main landing gear to the center stack of your vessel (space plane or rocket) and then use move:tool to drag them to the desired spot under the wing and use rotation with absolute mode to straighten them relative to the vessel. If this is the case you might have the gears attached to the parallel tanks or worse the wings. Notice how wings flex under aerodynamic stress? Can you imagine unevenness when rolling down the runway with 15Ton per wheel while the wing holds the landing gear?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBesides the above point I mentioned friction. It is best to have more friction on the back wheels and less on the front wheels. The difference doesn\u0027t have to be great, for instance a Friction setting of 0.9 on the rear with 0.7 on the front should work miracles. It is often better to have friction below 1.0 (unless your vessel is very heavy it should be more) so there is some drifting effect so that they don\u0027t anchor into the ground when rolling. That in and of itself can cause the veering even when this effect isn\u0027t noticeable at first glance.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUse autostruts by right clicking a part in the editor, activate \u0022advanced tweakables\u0022 in main menu general settings to allow autostruts. Use grandparent on all center stack fuel tanks, then grandparent on the parallel fuel tank directly attached to the center stack and the other parallel parts to heaviest or root part. It is possible the weight of the engine bays wiggle or sway micro metrically under engine thrust causing unexpected sway causing the space plane to turn unexpectedly.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUse \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, it is a very common mistake but you should never forget.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOnly put the front or main landing gear to steering enabled. Preferably the landing gear closest to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E for more natural steering (main landing gear in your case)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere\u0027s a radial and symmetry mode in the editor toggled through when using the X key. (The M or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E is the symmetry mode icon in the lower left corner. The radial symmetry mode when toggled to using X represents the 2, 3 4, 6, 8 numbers. It is possible you accidentally used the radial symmetry mode while being selected at 2 and you snapped it on slightly a-symmetrical varying by a degree so it isn\u0027t visible, please check this. Or you put the landing gear to the parallel tank which was radially attached while being snapped on symmetrically and you put rotation on the main gear which are now attached uneven.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPut landing gear closer together. I know putting them wide causes the space plane to be more stable but any leverage due to wiggling of part attachment between both gears will increase as the landing gears are put wider. FWIW, you should be able to put them closer and still be very stable.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhile it would seem strange for a rolling takeoff, I know that the heavy mass wants to move in front under acceleration. That is especially the case if the front is more draggy while being lighter (which it is since you use Mk2 parts) while the back is super heavy. I see you have 1 LV-N and 4 Rapiers. Your main landing gear is also further to the back. Maybe it\u0027s wise to redesign so the 5 engines are moved a little bit closer forward. In any case, for a rolling takeoff higher friction on the back wheels should also remedy this effect.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAre you swaying from the runway without control inputs? In case that you do have control inputs know that rear stabilizers that are put both to pitch and yaw counter effect each other which may cause the sway, automatically if \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E was turned on.
