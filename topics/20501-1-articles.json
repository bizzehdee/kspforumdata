I know that V.17 is here and everyone is having a blast and several epic interplanetary adventures. This is just a narrative I wrote down about my first experience with landing on the Mun. Also to note: Scott Manley\u0027s name was used without permission. I hope we doesn\u0027t mind my little nod to him for helping out with his videos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEnjoy!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese were exciting times in Kerbal history. After many successful launches with Jebediah Kerman and his brothers Bill and Bob, funding was approved for a bigger space program. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew parts were developed, including a one-man pod and a new, re-vamped, three-man pod. The Kerbal Space program was made official to the public. Jebediah was made the General Director of the KSP, together with Robbie Kerman as Director of Operations and Scott-Manley Kerman as Director of Design and Rocket Development.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first Hercules missions were \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LLURV\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eapproved\u003C/a\u003E, and after a few days of preparation, Commander Mering Kerman became the first kerbal to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YasWd\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eorbit\u003C/a\u003E Kerbin. Further missions were sanctioned, and tests were made to find kerbal\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s responses to long-duration missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey were all in preparation for the next step in Kerbal history: landing on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany thought it was undoable, and whilst the development of what is now known as the Bismarck missions was kept secret from the public, no one in the KSP denied the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CMun Objective\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, a rocket was ready. The development was arduous, but with the help of Scott-Manley Kerman, the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CEngineer\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2, the KSP was able to progress. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Bismarck 20 was to carry a three-man crew from Kerbin to the Mun, and perform the first landing. Chosen for the flight were the veterans and pioneers of space-flight: Captain-Commander Mering Kerman, the now-famous \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CFirst Kerbal in Space\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2, Commander Sidsen Kerman, who at that point had the title of \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CLongest-Traveling Kerbal\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 and Major Melson Kerman, who had helped pioneer the prograde and retrograde maneuvers. The crew would remain three days there, perform scientific experiments and come back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a miraculous foresight, Jeb Kerman ordered the crew to be fitted with extra nutrition and oxygen, in case the mission extended itself. This move would end being a decisive factor to what came after.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch went without a hitch. Fuel was calculated to last exactly the amount needed for the missions, including unseen maneuvers the kerbonauts would have to do. After reaching orbit around Kerbin, the kerbonauts aimed for the Mun and burned in a 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA prograde to reach the encounter point. The brave Kerbals then flew in a 10-hour trip, until finally catching the Mun\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s gravity and setting elliptical orbit around it. A flat land around a crater was found suitable for landing and the maneuvers started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Bismarck Mun Lander came down, landing with all four struts on the moon. However, there was an error. The Lander\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s surface speed had not been cut off, and it slid on the surface, toppling over. A collision beginning in the engine caused a spark, and the tank, still with the return fuel, exploded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommander Mering was able to eject the pod in time, propelling it towards the surface. It landed extremely violent. Communications were severed. The pod was cut off from Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack in the KSP, the command station had fallen into a dark silence. The sizzle of the screens did not bode well for anyone. Jeb and Bocce feared the worst. Jeb demanded communications check to continue for two more hours. The directors secretly met and discussed the next course of action.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuddenly, a slight gaggle came through the static. The gaggle became more apparent as the sizzle subsided. It was Commander Mering\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s voice, calling over the radio. The command center erupted. The three kerbonauts were alive; the pod didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have any sign of exterior damage. Sidsen, however, had been heavily injured in the crash. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the communications back up, Commander Mering was able to suit-up, and leave the capsule. He became the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CauJx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Efirst kerbal on the Mun\u003C/a\u003E, even though there was no time to rejoice as of yet. A quick check found that the capsule, although damaged, was, indeed, still intact. The crew\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s biggest problem was the capsule\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s diminishing energy cells, and Sidsen\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s injuries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen news of the accident broke to the public, all of Kerbin tuned in to hear what had happened. Crowds started gushing into the KSP perimeters from all four corners of Kerbin. Jeb and B.T. Kerman seemed the ones to blame for all of this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA plan was hatched to send a second three-man crew to the Mun, with the Bismarck 21, for support. In the rush, Commander Joested and his crew were boarded, and sent. A communication link between the B21 crew and the ones grounded on the Mun was set. On the way, jokes were exchanged to liven the mood. Mering made his famous joke, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CI knew you boys would rush here to enjoy the beautiful view with us!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the B21 crew landed on the Mun. Commander Joested left the Mun Lander and Mun walked for a while, getting the hang of the gravity. He commented back, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThe view is indeed beautiful, Mers, you can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t just have it for yourself!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe B21 Lander was too far from the stranded crew, so it was set that a launch would be made for a closer rendezvous. However, as they got closer and began the retrograde maneuvers, a control hitch went off. The B21 Lander tipped over, 200 meters from the surface. Commander Joested tried to regain control and turned on the engine. The Lander did not gain altitude, only speed. The Bismarck 21 crashed on the Mun\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s surface only 5 Km from the stranded crew. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tub8i\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EEveryone aboard perished\u003C/a\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMelson Kerman did an EVA and confirmed the tragedy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack in Kerbin, pressure had hit boiling point. Riots erupted near the KSP centre, injuring many guards and civilians. Jebediah Kerman withdrew into his study. B.T. Kerman was ordered by the media to make a statement regarding the incident. Kerbals wanted the tragedies to end. They wanted the KSP\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s head on a platter, cancelled and shelved. The Kerbin Kongress called for B.T. Kerman, wanting official explanations on the very next day. B.T. Kerman came with an appeal for bigger funding. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CKerbal loss of life has occurred, but there are still three Kerbonauts up there, with an every decreasing energy cell, food and oxygen. We cannot sit here and do nothing whilst they sit there and rot,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 B.T. cried. Funding was approved: something had to be done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stranded crew kept on doing their research. Commander Mering and Major Melson collected Mun samples for further testing. A communications link was set and scheduled for the crew to talk to their families daily. A famous talk show made an interview with Mering on the Mun and his wife on the studio. These actions helped relieve the tension somewhat. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Bismarck 22 was ready, but B.T. Kerman held the launch for two days. At the end of the second day, Jebediah Kerman came out of his study. He had in hands plans and a makeshift version of a mechanical on-board computer. The scientists set to adapt the computer, dubbed \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CMechanical Jeb\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 for a lack of a better name, onto the Bismarck rocket. Mechanical Jeb ended up sticking, and later on became the official name.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommander Gregson Kerman was chosen to go to the Mun, as he had a medical doctorate, so he could help the situation with Sidsen. Gregson assembled a crew and shot to the Mun. Landing was much easier with \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CMechJeb\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2, the Lander came only 20 Km from the stranded crew. Melson was charged to make the exchange with Gregson, in an EVA that lasted almost two hours. Gregson brought with him fresh supplies and many extra tanks of oxygen, plus an energy cell. All the Munar equipment in the compartments of the capsule were left outside to make way for the supplies and oxygen. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWell, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not like they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re going anywhere anyways,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 jokingly remarked Mering. Melson Kerman finally met with the B22 Lander. Once inside, they launched back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENews of one of the stranded crew coming back to Kerbin excited the population. It was finally proved possible to make a round-trip to the Mun and back. Melson was showered with praise on his arrival. The image of him leaving the B22 capsule safely in Kerbin brought back some of the hope lost throughout the ordeal. But there was still three Kerbonauts on the Mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plan was to launch an adapted Bismarck-type rocket with only one kerbonaut on it. A very hard ordeal, since controlling the rocket and Lander was developed for a three-man crew.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah and Scott-Manley Kerman worked day and night to adapt the Bismarck capsule. The strain was starting to show. Jeb and S.M. Kerman fought regularly throughout the process, resulting in Jebediah walking away from the site a few times. But both had a job to do, both knew the repercussions if they didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Bismarck 23 was built in record time, taking only a few days to finish. B.T. Kerman and Jebediah rounded up the Kerbonauts for selection. Melson, who was in holidays, came in that day. He said he would do the job. The directors didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know what to do. It seemed he was dead-set into going back to the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMelson was prepped for the new specifications and strapped into the new Bismarck rocket. Together with MechJeb, his flight went without a hitch. He was able to land merely 5 Km from the crash-site. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Lander only had room for two people. The KSP center ordered Mering and Sidsen to go. The KSP directors argued that they had had the most time there. Recent documents show that the Kerbal government wanted Mering back, because he had become a kerbal legend and needed to be protected for political purposes. However, Commander Mering refused to leave. He ordered Gregson to go instead. As captain of the vessel, he would be the last one to abandon it. Gregson complied, even if he feared reprimands from the KSP. The two kerbonauts\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 rendezvoused with the Lander after a 10 minute EVA, and left for Kerbin. Sidsen said, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Clook at this for the last time, kid. We will never see such an operation like this in our life.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe two men were met with parties back in Kerbin. People rejoiced with their return. In the KSP center, however, the scientists and engineers worked full-time to build another rocket and rescue Mering. In two days, it was ready. The center did not have many options of Kerbonauts. Rookie Lieutenant Patson Kerman was chosen for the flight, having had no real rocket flight experience. All bets were off. It was now or never.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch was televised live throughout the whole of Kerbin. Regular updates from the KSP center were being sent to the media. If not for the T.V. announcers being paid to talk, the whole of Kerbin would have been completely quiet. The next 8 hours were terrifying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, a radio check from the Bismarck 24 came. Patson had turned off his \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CMechJeb\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. The KSP center lit up with shouting. Was there something wrong? Had there been an error? \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CNo,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Patson radioed, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m going to do this the way Mering intended to.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Everyone was completely frantic. How could he dare do such a thing? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe retrograde maneuvers lasted 20 minutes. Solar radiation cut communications from the center to the Bismarck and it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s rookie pilot. Static from the screens filled the ears of the control room. Everyone was at the edge of their seats.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, communications came back up. The landing had been a success. Rookie Lieutenant Patson had been able to land 2 meters from the crash site. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MomIa\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECommander Mering disembarked his vessel.\u003C/a\u003E The damaged, stranded cocoon that had kept him alive for so much time, so far from home.

B.T. Kerman released a statement saying:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CIn all our lives, in all of history, there has never been so many acts of heroism and bravery as the crews of the Bismarck flights demonstrated. Let us weep for the crew in the Bismarck 21, and cheer for all the others who came back. Their physical and mental sacrifice has advanced the Kerbal people into a new era. Onto many more great accomplishments to come!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe End\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEpilogue:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMelson Kerman was promoted, and became Vice-director of Operations in the KSP, still going on space missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESidsen Kerman, after his promotion, retired from all practical missions in the KSP, eventually leaving it altogether.
