I see monopropellent canisters, but if you\u0027re not planning to dock, dump \u0027em. I would also dump the reaction wheel and switch out the lander can for an Mk1 Command Module. The mass difference is negligible, and worth it. You won\u0027t need as much for the return because you can easily free-return without a shield. As for the Terrier, I would probably have just switched to a 1.25m fuselage at that point. As I said, you won\u0027t need much for the return leg. And Thumpers with Delta Deluxe Winglets should get you off the ground and higher up where your Skipper can start to shine. All in all though, a total redesign isn\u0027t necessary. You can feel your way around and just make tweaks here and there and see the result.
