You can also complete these without installing mods\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the top left of the screen is a filters button that shows more parts. In there, you should be able to find the \u0022old\u0022 Swivel engine (which is the engine part that the tutorial refers to). When the engines got updated, the tutorials might have been forgotten, so they still reference the old engine parts (which remain in game for compatibility reasons)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be honest, you could skip the tutorials if you wanted to, it will only be slightly harder gameplay.
