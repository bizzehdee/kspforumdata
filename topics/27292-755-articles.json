Jeb\u0027s bunch came back from Minmus and successfully docked at Kerbinport; the ship was refueled, a new batch of tourists was loaded into his ship (renamed \u003Cem\u003EBockscar\u003C/em\u003E), and they\u0027re headed back that way now. Meanwhile, my plan to refuel the \u003Cem\u003EProject Peacock 7\u003C/em\u003E in orbit of Mun was successful; the new Munport 7 space station\u0027s transfer stage had enough fuel left over to refuel the Peacock successfully and a rescue of Granie commenced, which was successful - despite both the station and the \u003Cem\u003EPeacock\u003C/em\u003E originally orbiting the Mun in the opposite direction. Also wound up getting paid for putting the space station in orbit, so all is right with the world there. Bill\u0027s Project Peacock 7 craft has arrived at Minmus and plans are in the works to refuel his craft so that he can repair the Sojourner probe in orbit of Minmus and mining operations can begin, and at long last Bob has returned from Minmus, collecting 3500 science points on that final sci run to the green minty moon. Aerospikes, RAPIERs, Drone Cores and a few other parts I didn\u0027t really want - I\u0027m into the \u0022mopping up\u0022 part of the tech tree, finally - were unlocked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there was last night. It was a simple plan - send up a \u003Cem\u003ERaven\u003C/em\u003E spaceplane with two tourists for contract to Kerbin orbit, dock at the space station and bring down Val and two other tourists that were ready to go home. I should\u0027ve known there\u0027d be trouble after undocking when the craft\u0027s RCS thrusters didn\u0027t want to fire...but I went ahead with deorbit ops anyway. Quicksaved right before atmospheric interface. FAR bugged out on me sometime during the descent, which became apparent at 15k when the plane decided it didn\u0027t want to pull up. Craft broke up and I hit the quickload button...except, it wasn\u0027t the quickload button - it was the \u003Cstrong\u003Equicksave\u003C/strong\u003E button......\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDefinite facepalm moment there. I\u0027m just hoping the two tourists I picked up weren\u0027t from that contract I had to deliver six tourists to their assorted destinations - that one is/was an unmilked cash cow......plus I\u0027m bummed to have lost four tourists and a white suit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaxwellsDemon","CreatedById":147660,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-28T13:59:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESuccessfully soft-landed a rover on Duna!
