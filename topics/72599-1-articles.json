I asked if he had worked on that movie and yes, turns out he did set construction for the spacecraft interiors. He told me how they scavenged instrumentation from an old aircraft junkyard and showed me pictures of the set. (1:31 in the trailer.) So cool! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe showed me how the entire set was on a gimbal and could be tilted several degrees this way and that. Not quickly, just different positions for shooting. The only reason I can think they\u0027d do that is if they need angled gravity, maybe for weird g-effects while passing through wormholes or something. That\u0027s my prediction. Obviously the guy didn\u0027t know. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI asked how he liked working with Christopher Nolan, and he said he was fine, if a bit crazy.
