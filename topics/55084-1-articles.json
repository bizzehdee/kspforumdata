I\u0027m not saying that we need something to show how long a stage will last on a tank of fuel; I\u0027m suggesting something like \u0027LV-909 consumes X units of liquid fuel and Y units of Oxidizer per second at 100% thrust\u0027. That way, I could say (on my own):\u0022ok, the Skipper consumes X amount of fuel and Y amount of Oxidizer a second max, and the Jumbo 64 has X units of fuel and Y units of oxidizer, so this stage should last Z amount of seconds\u0027. It would also be nice if it showed the consumption rate at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-03T16:44:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETechnically Isp and thrust give this, though some calculations are required.
