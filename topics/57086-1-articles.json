In the real world you can run simulations, do wind tunnel or vacuum chamber tests and eliminate other variables. These things are not available in KSP - there is not even a rocky test track for rovers - so I feel it is only fair to substitute those in some way. They are always subsystem tests though, as elaborate dry runs are less trivial to emulate. When the real mission starts there is no going back or cheating or conveniently changing the environment though. If things go awry then, they go awry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 0.23 I will probably run two installs next to each other.
