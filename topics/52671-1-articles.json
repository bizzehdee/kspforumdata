My father, Bill Kerman, was a space pioneer; you know the early kerbals that went to space. My father taught me about the Kerbal Universe and Physics and the science of spaceflight. I was instantly fascinated with space and flight. When I was young, kerbals in school would call me a nerd and a geek, but I ignored it and just concentrated on doing well in school so I could be a kerbalnaut just like my dad. After I graduated, I went to Kerbal Space Institute to get a degree in aeronautical engineering. With my success, I got my degree and got a job at KASA as an engineer. Then one day, when I was working on a blueprint for a Duna rover, my boss came to me and asked me if I wanted to study a new jet propulsion engine in space. I told him yes immediately and he told me that I was going to have training for two days and the launch was in four days. That night, I told my father and he was extremely proud of me. He said, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CBob, you have developed into an intelligent kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn my first day of training, they first put me in a machine that would simulate the launch. It shook like crazy but once the shaking was over, I was experiencing zero gravity. I asked them,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 How do you do that!?.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 They said it was part of a new promotion for the company. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the second day of training, the day of the launch was finally here. I strapped myself with security belts in the passenger bay. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201C3, 2, 1, 0.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 The engine ignited. We were going to space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
