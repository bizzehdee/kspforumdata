The trouble is, I seem to be apallingly bad at designing a decent Munar Lander, and would be very grateful of some tips or even a simple parts list for a lander/return ship that\u0027s up to the job and meeting my requirements below. The best I have managed so far is to land a Mk1 capsule on the Mun - but it didn\u0027t have enough dV left to return to Kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENB: I also want my ships to be if not utterly plausible, then reasonably so. As in, I don\u0027t want to have engines and tanks clustered around a central core in a way that would be horribly unaerodynamic in real life. At this point, I don\u0027t mind if lander legs, RCS thruster blocks, solar panel packs and batteries are exposed. (I can work on getting things faired away once I have a design that can actually do the job!). At this point, I\u0027d also prefer to keep the lander/return ship mass as low as possible (I seem to be OK with designing launchers to handle up to about 12 tons, 15 at a pinch) whilst allowing a reasonable fuel margin, I don\u0027t mind whether the ship is 1 or 2 crew, and I want to avoid use of 3.75m components if possible, for now (am still getting the hang of 2.5m components).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is because ultimately, I want to do a game where I mimic the Mars Direct plan, and to do so as realistically as I can handle. But if I can\u0027t reliably get crew to the Mun and back, I certainly won\u0027t be able to handle a Duna landing and return! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in anticipation,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEsme\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: I have KSP Interstellar, KAS and KW Rocketry installed at the moment (as well as Mechjeb and some purely visual bits and bobs), so designs using parts from them as well as stock are fine by me.
