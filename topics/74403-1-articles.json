As far as I can tell, it gets triggered by any staging event, including liftoff. So I can\u0027t use it to trigger an action I want to occur after a particular staging event (say, deploy solar panels after dropping the 2nd rocket stage), because it\u0027ll happen too soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo people use the Stage action group?

I\u0027ll agree that it\u0027s rather redundant, since most things you want to occur during a stage, you just want to happen once after one particular stage, but I\u0027m sure someone has a use for it. I just can\u0027t think of many things you\u0027d want to happen during every stage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"the_bT","CreatedById":3876,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-07T15:58:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn non rapier SSTO spaceplanes I usually put the deactivate action of the rocket engines into stage. I put all engines in stage 0 so when I launch, the turbojets start, the rockets start as well but shut down immediately and the rest is controlled by action groups anyways. Other than that I don\u0027t use it much.
