If that\u0027s the case, the game deletes objects that are below 22km and aren\u0027t in physics range. Hence, if you try to switch away from a craft under these conditions, the game won\u0027t let you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhysics range is within 2.5km of the craft you are controlling.

You want to go back to the space center, click on the tracking station, then find the ship you want to control. Alternatively, use the bracket keys (like Aphobius said) if you are within 2.5 km. Or, if you\u0027re further, go to the map screen (pressing \u0022M\u0022), left-click on the ship you want to fly, and select \u0022switch to.\u0022 Sometimes the menu doesn\u0027t pop up because a planet or orbit line is in the way.
