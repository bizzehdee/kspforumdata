Radially attach nose cones to the decouplers. Then, add fuel tanks and engines below the nose cones. The outer stages will draw fuel from the core, across the decouplers (which are not crossfeed compatible). If you attach the fuel tanks to the radial decouplers, fuel will not flow across them (the correct behavior).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LABHOUSE","CreatedById":107761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T01:11:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is leftover from back when there were no fuel lines, decouplers provided fuel flow.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T01:14:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow does that explain the interaction with the nose cones?

You\u0027ll note that there\u0027s not a \u0022No Fuel Crossfeed\u0022 note in the info window. Anchored decouplers have a bit of an odd fuel flow rule (non standard) in that they will crossfeed except when the part mounted to them is a fuel tank. So normal fuel operations that we are used to won\u0027t cause a problem. But if you connect any other fuel crossfeed capable part to the decoupler (like a nose cone), fuel will flow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is something I will be including in my next Stock Bug Fix release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T11:17:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBy \u0022anchored,\u0022 do you mean the high clearance decouplers that I used in this craft?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T11:38:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnchored decouplers is any radial decoupler that leaves behind a small greeble on the craft when decoupled.
