Radially attach nose cones to the decouplers. Then, add fuel tanks and engines below the nose cones. The outer stages will draw fuel from the core, across the decouplers (which are not crossfeed compatible). If you attach the fuel tanks to the radial decouplers, fuel will not flow across them (the correct behavior)."},{"CreatedByName":"LABHOUSE","CreatedById":107761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T01:11:41Z","Content":"That is leftover from back when there were no fuel lines, decouplers provided fuel flow."},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T01:14:36Z","Content":"How does that explain the interaction with the nose cones?

You\u0027ll note that there\u0027s not a \u0022No Fuel Crossfeed\u0022 note in the info window. Anchored decouplers have a bit of an odd fuel flow rule (non standard) in that they will crossfeed except when the part mounted to them is a fuel tank. So normal fuel operations that we are used to won\u0027t cause a problem. But if you connect any other fuel crossfeed capable part to the decoupler (like a nose cone), fuel will flow.\n\nThis is something I will be including in my next Stock Bug Fix release.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T11:17:23Z","Content":"By \u0022anchored,\u0022 do you mean the high clearance decouplers that I used in this craft?"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T11:38:31Z","Content":"Anchored decouplers is any radial decoupler that leaves behind a small greeble on the craft when decoupled. In stock this is every radial decoupler except the structural pylon.\n\nIn the case Claw is talking about, attaching a fuel tank directly to a fuel tank will not crossfeed, but attaching a radially attachable crossfeed capable part, then stack attaching a tank to that part will crossfeed. The same works across radial decouplers if they have no crossfeed, which is what\u0027s happening here.\n\nIf you config edit the decouplers to not be crossfeed capable, this will stop."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T16:55:52Z","Content":"Yeah, what Novy said.
