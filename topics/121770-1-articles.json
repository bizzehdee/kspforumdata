Here\u0027s the deal, if you have very advanced optics and chromatigraphy and a bit of luck, for example a plume of steam rising up from a steam bath with life in it, and a satellite photographing a sunset that crosses this might detect these molecules. So for instance lets say you have a sand pit, at the bottom of the pit you have water, chemical energy from a gyser underneath, and biota. The water may not be visible, steam may be evident just above the surface, and molecules of life could be in the steam, but no visible water on the surface. Again, would we recognize the life, and could robots sufficiently characterize it if thay landed on saud sites. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, speculation, so be skeptical, this may just be NASA politics for the next mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-27T18:16:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tex_NL\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tex_NL\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENo seriously.
