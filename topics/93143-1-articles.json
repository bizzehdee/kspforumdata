The buildings upgrade at career start is a known issue with 64 bit. It has been investigated, and unfortunately it has proven very difficult to correct. At this point, the best fix is to switch to the 32 bit version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epurpletarget posted a possible workaround you might want to try:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELoad your saved game in the 32 bit version, and upgrade your buildings while in 32 bit. Then, you should be able to use the 64 bit version. Once you have upgraded in 32 bit, the 64 bit apparently works ok, at least regarding the building upgrade.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bigred","CreatedById":119304,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T18:47:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll give it a shot, thank you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bigred","CreatedById":119304,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T17:05:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDidn\u0027t work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
