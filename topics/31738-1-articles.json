Specifically, the argument is concerning whether or not modern climatological models have predictive power. To this end, MBobrik posted an \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/mar/27/climate-change-model-global-warming\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Earticle\u003C/a\u003E in the Guardian which supports said supposition, whereas I responded with a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wattsupwiththat.com/2013/06/01/a-frank-admission-about-the-state-of-climate-modeling-by-dr-gavin-schmidt/#more-87402\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Epost\u003C/a\u003E from the skeptic blog WattsUpWithThat which claims to refute said supposition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeaving aside the snarky tone of the argument we were having in the other thread, I wanted to go into slightly more detail regarding these claims. The article in the Guardian is reporting on a recent paper in Nature Geoscience by Dr. Myles Allen and collaborators regarding the supposed efficacy of a climate forecast made by his group in 1999, compared with the temperature data since. Alas, the paper itself is behind a paywall, so we will have to make do with the Guardian article reporting on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good deconstruction of Dr. Allen\u0027s claims of accurate predictions can be found \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wattsupwiththat.com/2013/03/31/global-warming-predictions-prove-accurate-guardian/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E (also from WUWT); the salient points are as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Dr. Allen\u0027s use of ten year averaging is no coincidence; rather, by fortuitous choice of his start and stop dates and by his decision to average the real temperature data on a ten year time scale, his apparent agreement is much better than his actual agreement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Dr. Allen\u0027s forecast fails to replicate the lack of warming observed over the last 15 years. Indeed, his forecast (which began in 1999, well within this \u0022no warming\u0022 period) predicts warming throughout. Thus, despite apparent agreement with the ten-year averaged global temperature for 2012, it completely fails to replicate the behavior of the climate over that duration (and thus cannot be considered successful).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Nonetheless, Dr. Allen\u0027s forecast is the \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E such forecast produced by the climate science community which even comes this close; all other forecasts predicted much higher levels of warming over the last 15 years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Salient to the discussion MBobrik and I were having, Dr. Allen\u0027s forecast consists of a \u0022climate model adjusted by historical observations.\u0022 Since all of the pure climate models predicted 21st century warming far in excess of that predicted by Dr. Allen, one surmises that his \u0022historical observations\u0022 served to adjust the predictions of his climate model downwards - thus belying MBobrik\u0027s claim that this particular model is, in itself, predictive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to these points, I want to further deconstruct this graphic presented by Dr. Allen and reproduced in the Guardian:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2013/3/27/1364398212810/-Climate-forecast-and-obs-001.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022-Climate-forecast-and-obs-001.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis graphic is a great illustration of how one can use pictures to obfuscate, rather than illustrate, the issue at hand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, let\u0027s looks at the difference between the red line (10-year averaged real temperature) versus the dashed black line (Dr. Allen\u0027s forecast). Note that Dr. Allen made his forecast in 1999. Find 1999 on the time axes, and trace upwards to where it means the temperature graph: what do you notice? 1999 is about the point of greatest disparity between Dr. Allen\u0027s forecast and the actual temperature - and yet that disparity coincides with the same year he made the forecast. (This disparity can be partially explained by his choice to use ten-year averaging, but even so it is still odd.) Next, look at the trend from that point onwards: the trend temperature data is near flat (were it not for the ten year averaging it would be completely flat or slightly negative), and yet his forecast continues on an upwards slope unabated. In the article, Dr. Allen is quoted as trying to explain this discrepancy as \u0022fluctuations around the trend\u0022 - despite that his fluctuations persist for the entire forecast period, and it is only the mismatch between the forecast and the observed data \u003Cem\u003Eat the time the forecast was made\u003C/em\u003E which allows the forecast to match the observed result in 2012.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, let\u0027s examine that gray swath which surrounds the temperature data. What is that swath supposed to mean? It looks like it\u0027s supposed to represent error bars, but error bars of what? It can\u0027t be the error bars of the forecast, since the forecast didn\u0027t exist in 1960. Nor can it be the error bars of the observed temperature, since the error bars grow smaller as you go back in time (and the uncertainty in global temperature grows larger). So, what is it? It\u0027s nonsense, input into the graphic by hand, to make the discrepancy between the behavior of the forecast and the observed data appear smaller. This is also why the graphic extends backwards to 1960 and forwards to 2040. Remember, the forecast itself concerns only the time period from 1999 until 2012 (an even smaller time period than shown in the inset) so by including all of those extraneous points, rather than zooming in on the region of interest, the discrepancy appears smaller.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, basically, the entire figure is designed to produce a misleading perception - a great example of \u0022lies, damned lies, and statistics.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yet, nevertheless, despite the issues I raised above, this forecast is the only one which comes close to replicating the behavior of the 21st century.

You use this model to make a prediction, only to find out five or ten years down the line that the prediction was wrong.

You identify a factor that had not been included in your previous model, and, by adding it in, demonstrate that you can now replicate your data set (including the new data) faithfully. \u0022Success!\u0022 You say.

I\u0027ll try to give you a rundown on what this means to try get you up to speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s start with the basics: go back to my \u0022100 random data points\u0022 example. As I said, I can create an infinite number of models which will replicate any set of 100 data points exactly using 100 parameters. How do I go about it? First, start by choosing a basis set - for our purposes, let\u0027s use the Fourier basis (so, the set of cosine functions of arbitrary frequency). From that set, I choose 100 members, arbitrarily. I construct my model as the sum of those 100 elements of my basis set, each multiplied by a constant. Those constants are my set of 100 parameters, and with some simple linear algebra I can chose them so that my model exactly replicates my 100 data points. The \u0022infinite number of models\u0022 comes from the fact that my choice of 100 basis elements was arbitrary: I can do this same process for any choice of 100 elements, each generating a unique model. Since my set of 100 data points gives rise to an infinite number if unique models (each with different predictions), then this process has no predictive power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is basically what the climate modellers do. They don\u0027t use cos functions as their basis - rather, they use things such as solar radiation, atmospheric concentrations of CO2, etc., and other data sets - but they are choosing basis sets nonetheless. Associated with each of these elements is a \u0022forcing\u0022 - a constant parameter, whose purpose is exactly the same as in my arbitrary model above. They don\u0027t construct quite so simple a model - rather, they use non-linear interactions between elements of their basis sets (each of those non-linearities giving rise to yet more parameters) - but nevertheless the construction proceeds along the same lines. So, then, the process of producing a model is the process of choosing the appropriate values for each forcing. The way they go about it is exactly what I described above: choosing each parameter such that their model replicates historical data. They even admit it themselves: search the literature for references to \u0022training data sets\u0022 for each model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, there are a couple of differences between what they do and the arbitrary process I describe above. To their credit, they have fewer parameters than data points, which means their models are somewhat constrained. Furthermore, it is likely that at least some of the basis sets they are using really do have a correlation with observed global temperatures (solar radiation certainly). That doesn\u0027t make the situation much better, though. Suppose I were to tell you that I knew of a process which could be described exactly by some finite but unknown number of cos functions. Suppose I then gave you 100, or 1000, or 100,000 data points from that process, and asked you to try to replicate it. Could you do so? The answer is of course not - the system is under-determined. In order to produce a faithful replication I would either have to tell you which basis functions the process was constructed from or I would have to give you a continuum of data points to describe the process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENevertheless, this is what the modellers are claiming to be able to do: they have some set of purported basis elements and some finite number of temperature readings and are saying that they can construct a faithful replication. It\u0027s an impossible problem, so it\u0027s no wonder their results are junk. Oh, sure, they give all sorts of explanations as to why their choices for the forcing parameters are justified, but in the end it comes down to tuning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, the various models don\u0027t even agree on what the various forcing parameters are supposed to be.
