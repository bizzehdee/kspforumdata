Let\u0027s see if I can change that this time around. The first step is to get this building in the latest version of KSP, so here we are: [Download link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EOHmCX82BohRQ4McdnkUGrtl78Cqe_Ih)\n\nNot much has changed here since ~2015, but it\u0027s still cool to explore the inside of the new parts. Back up your save, as things may explode. This is very buggy, and will silently crash often.\n\n![IVkvrti.png](https://i.imgur.com/IVkvrti.png)\n\nTo use the mod, after installing it and ModuleManager, enter IVA, and press the Y key to leave your seat. You can then move around using WASDQE/Shift/Ctrl. You may even be able to get into a different seat by looking at it and pressing Y. By default, the mouse controls are styled for zero-gravity movement. You can toggle to standard FPS mouse look by using the gravity button, but you need to be inside a solid part, otherwise you\u0027ll quickly travel through Kerbin. If you want to click the menus while in this mode, Alt\u002BY will release the mouse.\n\nThe part that\u0027s closest to working is the Hitchiker, followed by the science lab. You may need to disable collisions using the NoClip button to move into it if you\u0027ve left a different part. Be sure to re-enable collisions (disable NoClip) once you\u0027re inside, then you can try out gravity. Hatches (where set up) can be opened and closed by using the F key. If there is a hatch beyond the current one that you want to open or close, Alt\u002BF will reach through the current hatch to that one.\n\nLeaving IVA mode while not in a seat will slightly break everything: On returning to IVA, you\u0027ll be unbuckled from your seat and in free mode, but trapped above the seat. Look down and press Y to get back into the seat before leaving it again.\n\nNext steps: clean up the bugs and crashes, add colliders and controllable hatches to each part."},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-31T03:25:52Z","Content":"IT LIVES! ![banana_dance.gif](https://www.orbiter-forum.com/images/smilies/banana_dance.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"pizzaoverhead","CreatedById":26349,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-01T14:38:40Z","Content":"The cupola is fully contained in colliders, bringing the total number of parts it\u0027s safe to walk around inside without falling into the void to two.
