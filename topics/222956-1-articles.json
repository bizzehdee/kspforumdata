I don\u0027t think this is really an overly large rocket for KSP, it\u0027s just an interstellar vehicle I attached a landing module and some sats to to bring to another planet.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/JXpIwRS\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/JXpIwRS\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
