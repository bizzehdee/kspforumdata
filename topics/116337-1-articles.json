It flies fantastic, straight as arrow and it can glide extremely well. I designed it to send fuel to my space station in a 100 km orbit. It contains 163 parts. \n\nThe plane weighs 150.4 tons and 179.5 tons with the payload (29.1t). It uses 14 rapier engines. \n\nAccent profile: 0-10km point nose 15-20 degrees, keep prograde 5-10 degrees. 10km-25km keep prograde around 5 degrees and build speed. 25km\u002B Switch to rockets and build speed then point nose to 20-30 degrees. \n\nIt has just enough fuel to make it orbit and then land on the runway. \n\nNot necessary a problem but it takes forever to swing this thing around to the desired vector. It does have RCS but I would like it if it could change direction faster in space. If anyone wants to share any solutions feel free.\n\nAnyways here it is, let me know what you think. \n\n![Cargo%20SSTO_zpscvbhiy8i.png](http://i1281.photobucket.com/albums/a513/jbakes727/Cargo%20SSTO_zpscvbhiy8i.png)\n\n![Cargo%20SSTO%202_zpsxheoenre.png](http://i1281.photobucket.com/albums/a513/jbakes727/Cargo%20SSTO%202_zpsxheoenre.png)\n\n![Cargo%20SSTO%203_zpsulr7pzni.png](http://i1281.photobucket.com/albums/a513/jbakes727/Cargo%20SSTO%203_zpsulr7pzni.png)\n\n![Cargo%20SSTO%204_zpsdjtz8kin.png](http://i1281.photobucket.com/albums/a513/jbakes727/Cargo%20SSTO%204_zpsdjtz8kin.png)\n\n![Cargo%20SSTO%205_zpspo445ins.png](http://i1281.photobucket.com/albums/a513/jbakes727/Cargo%20SSTO%205_zpspo445ins.png)\n\n![Cargo%20SSTO%206_zpsyi6ehabx.png](http://i1281.photobucket.com/albums/a513/jbakes727/Cargo%20SSTO%206_zpsyi6ehabx.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Xyphos","CreatedById":139010,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T19:02:45Z","Content":"Nice ship, good job, but wrong forum.

I actually looked at a few cargo SSTO designs and then got ideas from those. Ya I did away with the crew as they kept dying in the previous designs and there wasn\u0027t really a need to have Kerbals.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nThought I might throw this out there but I missed the runway coming in and then did a beautiful loop and landed facing the other way ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-19T19:40:26Z\u0022 title=\u002207/19/2015 07:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jbakes**"}]}
