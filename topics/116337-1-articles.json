It flies fantastic, straight as arrow and it can glide extremely well. I designed it to send fuel to my space station in a 100 km orbit. It contains 163 parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plane weighs 150.4 tons and 179.5 tons with the payload (29.1t). It uses 14 rapier engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccent profile: 0-10km point nose 15-20 degrees, keep prograde 5-10 degrees. 10km-25km keep prograde around 5 degrees and build speed. 25km\u002B Switch to rockets and build speed then point nose to 20-30 degrees. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has just enough fuel to make it orbit and then land on the runway. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot necessary a problem but it takes forever to swing this thing around to the desired vector. It does have RCS but I would like it if it could change direction faster in space. If anyone wants to share any solutions feel free.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways here it is, let me know what you think. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1281.photobucket.com/albums/a513/jbakes727/Cargo%20SSTO_zpscvbhiy8i.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Cargo%20SSTO_zpscvbhiy8i.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1281.photobucket.com/albums/a513/jbakes727/Cargo%20SSTO%202_zpsxheoenre.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Cargo%20SSTO%202_zpsxheoenre.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1281.photobucket.com/albums/a513/jbakes727/Cargo%20SSTO%203_zpsulr7pzni.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Cargo%20SSTO%203_zpsulr7pzni.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1281.photobucket.com/albums/a513/jbakes727/Cargo%20SSTO%204_zpsdjtz8kin.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Cargo%20SSTO%204_zpsdjtz8kin.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1281.photobucket.com/albums/a513/jbakes727/Cargo%20SSTO%205_zpspo445ins.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Cargo%20SSTO%205_zpspo445ins.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1281.photobucket.com/albums/a513/jbakes727/Cargo%20SSTO%206_zpsyi6ehabx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Cargo%20SSTO%206_zpsyi6ehabx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xyphos","CreatedById":139010,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T19:02:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice ship, good job, but wrong forum. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/20-The-Spacecraft-Exchange\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThe Spacecraft Exchange\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T19:05:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jbakes\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jbakes\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...\u003Cp\u003ENot necessary a problem but it takes forever to swing this thing around to the desired vector.
