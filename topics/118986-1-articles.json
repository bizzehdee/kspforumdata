Demo rockets are quite tricky. Why? Because 1.) there are no upper stage engines; 2.) there are no engines with thrust vectoring; 3.) there are no control surfaces; and 4.) the one set of guide fins that is present is way oversized for starter rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut nevertheless, I made you a sample rocket. The key design philosophy for simple rockets is \u0022pointy, long, gradual shape; heavy bits at the front, draggy bits at the back\u0022. Exactly like an arrow is structured. We\u0027re going to skip the fins, though, because the only fins the demo has are way too big and make the rocket all but uncontrollable in the lower atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStart with a mk1 pod.
