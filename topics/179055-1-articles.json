Sometimes by many hundred degrees...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe overheat ceiling also is determined by the other parts like type of nosecone or if there is more then one end cap protecting the Mk 1 cockpit or any other heat intolerant part that is the first within the stack. Heat tends to bleed through so having multiple parts protecting a cockpit can help also. Usually nothing so drastic is required, but maybe people can use this. You can test by reading active part temperatures to see where there is heat bleeding using the Thermal UI interface within the debug menu. Heat bleeding would be a part behind another part (in the cross section of the front part \u0022nosecone\u0022) that still gets most of the heat effect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSometimes a critical temp of let\u0027s say 2.000K is achieved at a higher speed then in another case. Using a better thermal nosecone or other part there in between often means that part is able to stay cooler and less heat will bleed through. Sometimes placing the Mk 1 cockpit aft instead of fwt on the fuselage allows it to go a lot faster because the bow shock of the other parts at the front lessen the heat load on parts that are less heat resistant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMax temperature is also reached based on the orientation of a part against the plasma stream. I\u0027m not sure how it works in KSP at all or what\u0027s the story with Mk 1 but since the glass canopy is supposedly less heat resistant I would expect it melts under negative pitch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zosma Procyon","CreatedById":151656,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-23T16:37:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAren\u0027t Nervs a little heavy for an STO spaceplan?
