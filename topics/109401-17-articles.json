Might be mistaking, but weren\u0027t they present at some point in this mod?\n\n- VTOL nuclear thermal jet. While newly added LFO VTOL engine is godsend for airless bodies, mk2 hull just doesn\u0027t hold enough rocket fuel to be all that useful in non-oxygenated atmospheres, so VTOL NTJ might be a good idea.\n\n- MK2 lateral tricoupler. Sort of like 3 half-length mk2 fuel tanks in single housing. Yes, it is possible to radially attach 2 more tanks to central hull, but dedicated hull section would mean less joints to break, less problems with symmetry and fuel crossfeed, smaller part count AND, optionally, more natural-looking model, rather than 3 tanks glued together."},{"CreatedByName":"SuicidalInsanity","CreatedById":143878,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T02:03:51Z","Content":"One of the RCS chine pieces got accidentally removed in the 1.6.10 update; the 1.6.11 hotfix update fixes that.
