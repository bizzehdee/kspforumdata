Since 1.0 it seems that when you view the map, the curve showing your path is incorrect, when at low or zero lateral speeds. I have noticed this on a couple of short \u0022test this part\u0022 missions, I go straight up, stage, deploy parachutes. Despite coming straight down at or near zero lateral velocity, the curve shown in the map view shows me coming down into the water, though in reality I come down directly below where I am."},{"CreatedByName":"quietghost","CreatedById":117566,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T20:22:04Z","Content":"This is because the map view only uses your orbital velocity, however the planet is rotating underneath you. While your trajetory originally takes you into the water, the planet rotates the land (and KSC) back underneath you. You may have noticed that when you lift off vertically and don\u0027t turn, you often land to the west of KSC, because you lose angular velocity as your radial distance from the center of rotation increases. All the map data is correct, just based on a different set of data that is more useful when it comes to actual space travel."},{"CreatedByName":"thedoktorj","CreatedById":27356,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T04:09:39Z","Content":"I recall that previously I could get the curve to become a straight line. I remember this specifically because when I first started playing, I used to land on the Mun by reducing velocity to zero and then falling straight down, this does not work anymore, the curve goes from a curve facing one way, and flips directly into a curve facing the other way without the straight up and down line in between. Maybe it is as intended, but it has definitely changed."}]}
