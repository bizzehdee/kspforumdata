Rockets pump in their own fuel and oxidizer, so the absolute exhaust pressure is constant regardless of altitude. Jets operate at a constant compression ratio, so as the atmosphere gets thinner the absolute pressure should go down, while the pressure ratio is the same at all altitudes. I\u0027m pretty sure air breathing jets should have similar visual expansion as a result.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jason_25","CreatedById":55730,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-02T16:15:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am not quite sure what you are getting at.\u00A0 But by the last sentence it looks like you are agreeing with me that the exhaust stream should expand.\u00A0 It seems that the difference between jet turbines and rockets are not meaningful here as I have mentioned both are \u0022jets\u0022.\u00A0 Same as the jet from a gamma ray burst except with different particles and speeds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jason_25","CreatedById":55730,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-02T16:41:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI should clarify that when I say \u0022lower atmosphere\u0022 I mean lower pressure.\u00A0 In otherwords at high altitude.\u00A0 I do not mean low altitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
