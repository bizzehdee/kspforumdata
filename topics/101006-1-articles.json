Give us another five-hundred year dark age, and chances are will will recover and get back going again, reduce humanity to the bronze age, and chances are we will be able to recover before something truly bad happens. You have to remember that recorded history is barely the blink of an eye in the vast scale of time the Earth has lived through, a huge setback for civilization is really not that long in the grand scheme of things, and we can probably get back to where we were before, albeit differently.
