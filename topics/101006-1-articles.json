You are trying to achieve something that contradicts itself. Forward direction in time is due to increase in entropy. You can make entropy decrease in that direction, but then it will be reverse direction in time, and you still have entropy increasing in a forward direction. It\u0027s how our perception of time works.\n\nOn the dynamics level, time direction is irrelevant, but on dynamics level you don\u0027t care about coarse entropy, and fine grain entropy is conserved as I\u0027ve pointed out."},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T04:06:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E As far as known physics goes.

We have survived in this star system for a considerable period, and we probably are not going to have some cataclysm that destroys all mankind in the next thousand -- that is absurd. Smash earth with a couple large asteroids like the one that flew past a bit ago, even smash cities directly, and humanity will be virtually the same. Give us another five-hundred year dark age, and chances are will will recover and get back going again, reduce humanity to the bronze age, and chances are we will be able to recover before something truly bad happens. You have to remember that recorded history is barely the blink of an eye in the vast scale of time the Earth has lived through, a huge setback for civilization is really not that long in the grand scheme of things, and we can probably get back to where we were before, albeit differently. I hope we have interstellar travel (not necessarily FTL) before 3000, we probably could do it with modern technology, but I do not think that failing to do that will have any major consequences orrisks for humanity in itself.\n\nI agree about the fate of humanity, by the time the earth is uninhabitable for humans, if any of us are still around they will be in museums of truly ancient history, and research labs (dead the lot of them). Our posterity will not fit the bill for homo sapiens by a long shot. But they may still be our civilization, and its preservation is more what we should care about."},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T05:13:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E We still don\u0027t sufficiently have the \u0022big bang\u0022 figured out, which would make it rather difficult to even take a guess at any bizarre attempts to prevent the universe from collapsing again.\n\nIt is in no danger of collapsing. The expansion of the universe is accelerating. There is no guarantee that this will keep up, but it\u0027s pretty much certain that universe cannot shrink bellow current size. Whether it expands ad infinitum or reaches an equilibrium size is somewhat debatable. The later case would make the entropy question more relevant. But that\u0027s exactly where fine grain vs coarse entropy distinction becomes critical. Time will simply have to become a local phenomenon.\n\nIf the universe keeps expanding, it\u0027s a moot question.
