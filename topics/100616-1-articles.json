I call myself a pretty experienced player but i simply cant figure out what to do here.\n\nAchieving those speeds before 5800 meters seems impossible.\n\nI BACCs and RT10\u0027s currently give me the best thrust to weight ratio. But even strapping 4 RT10\u0027s on the back and flying in a 45\u0027 angle to maximise time before height doesn\u0027t work. I\u0027m near it, i achieve the speed at about 6500 meters.\n\nFlying in a lower angle is very difficult due to the bad maneouvability of boosters.\n\nAny thoughts or ideas?
