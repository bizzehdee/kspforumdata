I built pretty much everything I needed and tried to launch. The spacecraft is relatively big but I didn\u0027t see any lag so I believe it isn\u0027t my PC performance\u0027s fault. Anyway, I then noticed I forgot launch clamps and I needed to strengthen a mid-section. I went back to VAB and everything was OK. After adding these things I tried launching again - something strange happen. I saw the whole interface but everything else was black. I tried reverting to launch and I appeared at the LaunchPad. For some reason I went back to VAB and then tried exiting to space center. KSP asked me whether I want to save the craft. Obviously I pressed yes and then went back to VAB again. After trying to load the craft, all I got was a VERY early version of it. I tried using the \u0022auto-saved ship\u0022 thing and I got back my craft but the thing is that it was broken. All the stages (the bar on the right, not the physical stages) were gone and when I tried launching, KSP said \u0022Craft size unknown!\u0022\n\nMods which could\u0027ve affected something: Universal Storage, Karbonite, TAC life support, KIS, KAS.\n\nMy vessel doesn\u0027t contain other mods\n\nI did try restarting KSP.
