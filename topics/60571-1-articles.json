Before I didn\u0027t use any of the mods because of, what I thought, were possible compatibility issues, but with .22 and .23, I have dived into mods with hunger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main reason for this post is to recommend to the devs to take some of the mods and integrate them into the game. Mods include:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal attachment systems\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUbioZur Welding\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELazercam and docking lazercam\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Joint Reinforcement\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMagic Smoke Industries - Infernal Robotics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtraplanetary Launchpads\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese mods have, as far as I can tell, become staples for any KSP player. As such, I think KSP would become better if versions of these mods were incorporated into the main game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow many of you will note that I did not list mechjeb, this is not a mistake. There is a heated debate between those that use it and those that don\u0027t. I personally use mechjeb and I find it helpful with how I play, not everyone would agree. So I think mechjeb would be best served as a mod and not in the game itself. The mod I have suggested have become widely used and have become almost mandatory with every install of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKethane is another sticking point. The devs have already stated that there will be no resources in KSP. Okay then. I will not argue with the ones that have created and is working to make a game better. So I have not listed Kethane even though it is almost on every copy of KSP. I for one think that the modding system for KSP is fantastic and if the devs want Kethane to stay a mod, then a mod it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts? And I\u0027d like to hear from one or more of the devs on this. I read the posts on the front page but I\u0027d like to hear what the devs think of these mods as well. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-21T01:52:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Steelrose\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Steelrose\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EKerbal attachment systems\u003Cp\u003EUbioZur Welding\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELazercam and docking lazercam\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Joint Reinforcement\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMagic Smoke Industries - Infernal Robotics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtraplanetary Launchpads\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese mods have, as far as I can tell, become staples for any KSP player.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027re not staples for everybody.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Steelrose\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Steelrose\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe mod I have suggested have become widely used and have become almost mandatory with every install of KSP.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Steelrose\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Steelrose\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe devs have already stated that there will be no resources in KSP.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E[citation needed]\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Steelrose\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Steelrose\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThoughts?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERead this, amend your list.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf those, I don\u0027t think the following should be in the game:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELazercam and docking lazercam\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtraplanetary Launchpads\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-21T01:55:08Z\u0022 title=\u002201/21/2014 01:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by regex\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-21T02:00:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey \u003Cstrong\u003Epostponed\u003C/strong\u003E resources.

Why do mods need to be implemented into the main game? They work well enough already just by being mods. Plus the mod designers are not Squad, so their vision is different and they create updates at infrequent intervals far exceeding KSP updates (being a major project). Plus as illustrated above, opinions vary. If they implemented the following mods into the game it would have polarized effects, people either loving it or hating it. Mods are far more flexible and they work exceptionally well with KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnhanced Navball is one that I think you should check out (if you haven\u0027t already).
