Bit of a hassle getting the intersect, but i managed it. Now, after coming back safely(with 1400 delta-v before entering atmo), i got myself to 700 science!, Now, that is a lot for me, and i don\u0027t know what to spend it on. I\u0027ve went for science tech part to get new stuff there, but still haven\u0027t got the gravity measurement thingy. All of my available upgrades are between 90-550 science in cost(550 being the rocket engines, and 90 being propulsion). I haven\u0027t gone as deep to ssto tech as much as science, and not much either to electricity(got only the first\u00A0available solar panels). Now, what to go for next? is it the ultra-nuclear-radioactive-highlyoverheating\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:9px;\u0022\u003E\u003Csup\u003ETM\u00A0\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u00A0engine?

I definitely recommend getting more science experiments early on to make it that much easier to gain science. Also, it helps when you start doing biome hops by not having to go back later to get those newly unlocked experiments you didn\u0027t have when you visited that biome earlier. Again, it has a lot to do with preference. That early on I also definitely prioritize the fuel systems tech node that gives you the external fuel duct, and better/more powerful rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI also avoid the spaceplane tech nodes that are for planes; generally I don\u0027t bother with that until much later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-19T21:29:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgree with the \u0022personal preference\u0022 thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said... definitely science experiments (as \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/159324-koclobster/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022159324\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/159324-koclobster/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@KocLobster\u003C/a\u003E said, it avoids having to redo the same biomes too often, plus you always end up missing some and it becomes a chore to go back if you need just a few more points for that next must-have unlock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the 90s, definitely first barometer, then OX-STAT and OKTO, then a choice between fuel lines\u002BT800 tank or the whole \u0022control\u0022 package (RCS, torque wheel and the massively useful 1-Kerbal lander can) or the 2.5m engine package (Poodle and Skipper).

I\u0027d probably go Electrics (all those solar panels) then Specialized Construction (docking ports, particularly) or Precision Engineering (HECS probe core for convenience, and the two small octagonal struts which open up lots of construction possibilities) then Command Modules (the Mk1-2 command pod is very heavy, but oh-so-useful and tough - and its sheer weight makes rockets fly better on their way to orbit!).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut really at this stage it is very much a question of preferences.
