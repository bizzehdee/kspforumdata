I read about this click through problem in previous posts, but apparently it\u0027s not as bad for others. In my case I cannot place an item in the inventory, regardless of where the window is placed.\n\nI tried it with a clean install.

It\u0027ll do! :-)"},{"CreatedByName":"walaykin","CreatedById":149004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T13:45:50Z","Content":"Has anyone come across an issue where you inadvertently attach a part - in this case, a container mount - to a kerbal on EVA (in orbit). I just had this happen, and it was not recoverable - I could not grab, drop, detach or otherwise remove the mount from the kerbal (stuck to her feet!) and the game burned all their EVA propellant constantly rotating them while I desperately tried to get them back in the ship.\n\nGave up and reloaded in the end, but seems odd to be able to attach parts to a kerbal; I had a container mounted on my back when I did it, then dropped the container - maybe it was attached to the container first, then \u0022glued\u0022 to the kerbal once I dropped the container (from the menu)."},{"CreatedByName":"Svm420","CreatedById":136047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T18:01:20Z","Content":"Hello I am getting this error in my log upon trying to board my capsule.
