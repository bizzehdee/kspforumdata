(This apparently reduced structural loadings, and since the SRBs provided sufficient control authority, there was no reason to expose the Orbiter to additional stresses.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sillychris","CreatedById":103939,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T00:49:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI learned something today.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bigdad84","CreatedById":49379,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T02:17:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sillychris\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sillychris\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI learned something today.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou learn something everyday, believe it or not.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
