The shape is easy.. the texture. Not so much. Ive downloaded StretchySRBs ( though im not using procedural parts yet im waiting for the release. ) and Blackhearts textures.. even his extra fairings do not have the texture that resembles the SV. And Ive seen it.. many time before in other users screenshots. Just a checkered black on white fairing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then beyond all that.. whats it take to be able to make my own textures for procedural fairings? Photoshop? Or is there a .. cheaper way?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso.. a bit off topic, but I figure ill kill two birds with one stone.. decals. I saw a mod the other day, but I forget the name. It supposedly had decals/vinyls you could stick on your rocket.
