I was hoping someone could point me in the right direction to find some tutorials or assistance on coding some VAB tabs. I hope to add an extra tab next to parts/control groups section that also allows some mouse manipulation. I would also like to know if a tab could include a line of code that would let a user edit pixels like a simple paint program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried searching for it on my own with no luck.

I can\u0027t be more specific but if you look at the source of these mods you should get a good idea of what needs to be done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
