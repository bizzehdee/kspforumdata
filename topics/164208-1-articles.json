Now that I am trying to use in on 1.3, however, I cannot map the axes to work. I\u0027ve attempted to restart the game, with the joystick plugged, unplugged, and in both 32 and 64bit versions of KSP. The game will recognize the joystick\u00A0approximately 3/5 times, and when it does recognize it, it will remap every control to Joy.03, regardless of what I bind it to.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have confirmed that the Joystick functions, as it works in a variety of other games, including X-Plane 11\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-08T17:54:36Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2017 05:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by LordKael\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ericwi","CreatedById":152716,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-13T02:27:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you have any other joysticks/controllers, vJoy,\u00A0or any other joystick emulator?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Palaceviking","CreatedById":166883,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-12T14:08:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCalibrate in Windows first, had the same problem with mine.
