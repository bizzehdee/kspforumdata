I\u0027m posting here now, to formally ask how to properly install AVP (Astronomer\u0027s Visual Pack), as I have been attempting to do so on my own, and have been unable to. If it helps, I\u0027m currently using the CurseForge version of the pack, going through step by step, installing everything properly, and then deleting the instructional folders. However, when I do this, when I try to run KSP through the 64x runner (which it instructed me to do), It just shows me a black screen, with nothing actually happening. Could someone please tell me how to install it properly, or even just link me to somewhere that does? and help is appreciated.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/s\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: After two more separate installs, the black screen is now completely fixed. The only issue I am seemingly having now with the mod, is that the cloud layer over Kerbin is nonexistent. This is not a massive issue, however, I would still like it to be there. If I could get a little advice on what I\u0027m missing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I am now using the forum download instead of the CurseForge one, and that has helped massively.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-05-13T00:35:42Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2022 12:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Heiro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EOutdated Information\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
