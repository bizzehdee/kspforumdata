HarvesteR had said that those parts have a limited supply, so you can fail the test contract if you lose them without completing it; not sure if this is still the case, but if it is, it means any use of them that does *not* fulfill the contract you have them for must end in their recovery.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"guitarxe","CreatedById":115354,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T14:52:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA bit off-topic, but did I imagine things or are the experimental versions slightly worse than the researched ones?

Does this have any effect in-game?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main in-game effect is that any ship you build with experimental parts will get tagged as having experimental parts aboard, which you\u0027ll see in the list of saved ships in the VAB and at the Launchpad from the KSC screen. As long as the contract for the part hasn\u0027t been completed, you can still launch the ship. However, once you complete the contract, if you still haven\u0027t unlocked the part in the tech tree, the ship can no longer be launched. You can, however, open the ship in the VAB to remove the experimental part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
