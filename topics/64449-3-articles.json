To that end, the docking port is inline with the cockpit, avoiding confusing navball changes and allowing intuitive RCS control.

This setup, achieved by shutting down rocket engines on initial launch stage, allows for a single button (1) to toggle modes, shutting down air intakes (to reduce drag) and the single flameout-friendly jet engine at the same time as igniting rocket engines. A further press of this single button opens up air intakes, spools up the jet engine, and kills the rocket engines.

No \u0027advanced\u0027 building techniques either: no cubic struts. What you see is what you get! As such it does not fly on jets at extreme high altitudes, but the inclusion of RAPIER engines has greatly improved the performance of the original craft.

It is very, very easy to launch it to orbit. It is built so that beginners can see every single part, and have a better idea of how they fit together. Its non-clippy nature makes it a cinch to build, and its surprisingly powerful thrust system is quite effective at launching to orbit in record time. It has limited range - it can only reliably return from a 100km orbit. But it\u0027s a joy to fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, the Plover is the safest SSTO I have ever built. It not only has a working abort system \u003Cstrong\u003Ebut also\u003C/strong\u003E a full-body parachute system.

Some people will wish it had more DV, some will wish it had more crew capacity, or carried more science, or was easier to fly, or faster to reach orbit, or easier to dock, or easier to land. Because one design can\u0027t address all these without also making the craft heavier, more complex, more part hungry etc, any entrant, and the eventual \u0022winner\u0022 will still serve as a springboard, an inspiration for players to adapt and build from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I could live with the Aeries 4-a\u0027s single crew capacity, it\u0027s lack of science, and it\u0027s modest role appropriate DV, but wasn\u0027t keen on it\u0027s unbalanced docking or it\u0027s large physical size (I tend to build my space stations too cramped). I also felt the atmospheric flight handling could be improved a bit, action groups could be simpler, an abort system would be nice, and, \u003Cstrong\u003Ecrucially, it lacked a really cool little antenna which automatically extends on take-off\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I built \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71015-BSC-Aeris-4a-Yes-it-s-spaceplane-time%21?p=998941\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post998941\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ethe Mallard\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E to address all these issues as best I could (especially the antenna).

Finalists have been packed with genuinely worthy contenders - but that is not to say those that didn\u0027t reach the finals or win the competition weren\u0027t worthy; the standard in these challenges, across all entrants, is consistently extremely high and often the only thing separating candidates becomes quite personal preferences.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tarmenius\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tarmenius\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is the source of my own design dilemmas. The Aeris-4a has obvious flaws, but they\u0027re there on purpose: to inspire the player to tweak and experiment with the design while measuring whether the player has a handle on the standard ascent profile for SSTO spaceplanes. Given it\u0027s true purpose, the Aeris-4a is actually an excellent craft. So, I\u0027m faced with a choice: do I recreate the original craft\u0027s intent or make an easy-to-use craft that has few flaws, potentially gaining more votes?\u003Cp\u003EEither approach seems like a valid design choice, but one will result in a significantly different kind of craft from the other.
