It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s main role is long range interplanetary transport, either of fuel, supplies or personnel. or all 3 at once. But it can do more than that. Swapping out a few basic items changes its capabilities significantly to suit your taste.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t let the part count in the VAB fool you. Most of that is in the launch stack. Once the Zepheranthes is in orbit and operating on it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s main Nuclear engines, it is only 89 parts. So it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s relatively easy on the framerate in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bFSf1St.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bFSf1St.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yVHL7C4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022yVHL7C4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bbHgUvB.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bbHgUvB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, the launch stack itself is WAY over-powered for just getting it to orbit alone. With the right ascent angle it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s possible to get the Zepheranthes on it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s way directly into a planetary transfer almost on the launch rocket stack alone!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/crHPVWo.png\u0022 alt=\u0022crHPVWo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Zepheranthes stock configuration comes with 6 standard sized docking ports on the main body. It also has a 2.5 Meter Docking port at the aft end of the main control pod/lander typically mated to the one at the front end of the tanker/nuclear tug part of the craft. And one more at the aft end between the Nuclear Engines for docking with larger craft. It can dock with other craft using those ports to transport them along with it (recommend KAS/KIS and/or Quantum Struts to stabilize externally docked loads for transport. And make sure the load is balanced on both sides!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Shown here docked with two Viper II fighters for refueling and transport)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/D5fITDm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022D5fITDm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA swap of the centerline docking segment with a J type cargo section (OPT spaceplanes mod) will allow the Zepheranthes to carry 2.5 meter payloads internally. As noted earlier - the launch stack is over-powered for just the Zepheranthes alone, so it should be able to lift something fairly large up to orbit internally. Though for efficiency it might be better to bring a cargo like that up to dock with it on a separate launch. Feel free to experiment and tell me what works better. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a B9 crew segment for transporting Kerbals. But that could be traded for a stock hitchhiker segment or another tank for more fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe OPT J-type fuel tanks are hot-swappable in the VAB. The nuclear engines do not require oxidizer. But you could change to standard L/OX mix for use in providing fuel for other craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real party trick of the Zepheranthes though is the fact that the Command pod can undock and become an independent craft on it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s own. It has it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s own engines, RCS, power generation, reaction wheels etc. It has landing gear and parachutes, so it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s an effective lifeboat in case of a catastrophic emergency. Can land and return from low gravity worlds such as the Mun or Minmus. It can use it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s parachutes and engines to land on a world with atmosphere. But in the case of Laythe and Kerbin, it cannot reach space again on its own. It MIGHT be able to get into orbit from Duna. But I haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t tested it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, note that with it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s 2.5 docking port, the Command pod could dock with another craft that \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ecould\u003C/span\u003E get it down and back up from such worlds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Zepheranthes is actually effective at clearing out and de-orbiting debris and spent stages. The smaller craft is much easier to maneuver, and a good way of moving things around is to separate the command module and move it to grab something, then have it bring whatever it has grabbed and re-dock with the main section of the ship. It has more than enough RCS and enough torque (and engines) to move around larger craft than you\u0027d think at first glance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Here - the Command Pod grabs a spent stage that wasn\u0027t properly de-orbited. The larger portion of the Zepheranthes is in the background. The command pod was able to move this large section and re-dock with the main ship. And a quick burst of the main engines de-orbited this large piece of space junk and the Zeph was able to re-boost to stable orbit easily)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6OvBfNe.png\u0022 alt=\u00226OvBfNe.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve only barely begun to find uses for this very versatile ship. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m sure anyone who downloads it can modify it for more!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalx.com/logandwj/Zepheranthes\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDownload at Kerbal X\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
