Because with all three of these builds, the RAM and GPU make no difference in the performance - the bottleneck here, in terms of KSP gameplay, is the CPU. For about a $1500 budget, you could get a very balanced build capable of playing most games with regular quality at 1080p at about 40-60fps, depending on the game. That price is ex windows just so you know. So including windows, a budget of about $1700 - I\u0027m talking in AUD too, so you can convert that to whatever your currency is.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CDK","CreatedById":114733,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T05:59:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShould this be in Space Lounge?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bilfr3d","CreatedById":75448,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T06:48:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CDK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CDK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EShould this be in Space Lounge?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is in space lounge...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T14:13:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, for KSP the G2358.
