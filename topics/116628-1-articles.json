TBH the R9 280X is not an amazing choice of card considering the release of both the R9 300 series and NVIDIA\u0027s 900 Series (and the Titan X). You would get, not only more performance per watt of power, but a lower cost per frame for something like a GTX 760 or even 780. Because the 280X\u0027s run pretty hot. A 280 was hot. A 280X is like two of those cards. But in one card. That\u0027s the same size as the single card.

Because with all three of these builds, the RAM and GPU make no difference in the performance - the bottleneck here, in terms of KSP gameplay, is the CPU. For about a $1500 budget, you could get a very balanced build capable of playing most games with regular quality at 1080p at about 40-60fps, depending on the game. That price is ex windows just so you know. So including windows, a budget of about $1700 - I\u0027m talking in AUD too, so you can convert that to whatever your currency is."},{"CreatedByName":"CDK","CreatedById":114733,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T05:59:34Z","Content":"Should this be in Space Lounge?"},{"CreatedByName":"Bilfr3d","CreatedById":75448,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T06:48:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Should this be in Space Lounge?\n\nIt is in space lounge..."},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T14:13:50Z","Content":"Yeah, for KSP the G2358.
