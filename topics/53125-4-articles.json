You don\u0027t get additional points for more rovers tho, only 2 rovers are required for maximum points, one on Minmus and one on Mun. But it\u0027s cool to see 4 of them anyway. For accounting for the space junk, just go to the tracking station with the debris tab shown at the end of the mission. I\u0027ll be able to see all of the debris, only the stuff in orbit is accounted for. In the scores that will never change category, #11 would be failed if you stage fuel tanks or engines on your way to the planet and back that aren\u0027t attached to the mission critical part. So if you added extra fuel tanks and dropped those spent tanks that weren\u0027t part of the mission attachment, that point would be failed. For this first mission tho, it\u0027s pretty easy and that\u0027s to offset the subtracted points from the debris, so it adds a 25 point buffer to the -5 point for debris subtraction for you guys. Also, you need to add #13 Bring the Gang along for the ride \u002B10 since you have 3 Kerbals. For the landings, you get \u002B10 points per moon. 1 Kerbal is required so it doesn\u0027t get added. So if 3 kerbals land, you only get the bonus for the other 2 at \u002B5 each. So for Mun and Minmus you would get \u002B20 total and not \u002B30. But since you forgot Bring the Gang along for the ride, the points even out anyway and you end up with the same amount of points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBring the gang along for the ride only accounts for each additional Kerbal brought in addition to your starting 2. So if you have 3 kerbals, you get \u002B10, if you have 4 you get \u002B20. But, they all have to get back into orbit safely at the end of the mission. You could also get more points if you landed the extra kerbals at the KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll that being said, your math is off for your scoring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESubtotal for the mission is: 150 \u002B10 \u002B10 \u002B30 \u002B20 = 220\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E220 - 30 = 190\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E190 \u002B 25 \u002B 5 = 220\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo your total score is actually 220 and not 195\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou forgot to add the 25 points for #11\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission 01: Sirine\u0027s Current Score = 220\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-18T18:57:55Z\u0022 title=\u002211/18/2013 06:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by 700NitroXpress\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-18T21:31:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHopefully I can figure out what the issue is in my game.. it keeps hanging when I switch to my vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"700NitroXpress","CreatedById":90322,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-18T21:58:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hodo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hodo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHopefully I can figure out what the issue is in my game.. it keeps hanging when I switch to my vessel.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike lag or something else?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iLlama","CreatedById":82575,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-18T22:04:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHAHAHA eat your vegetables\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E:-D good one!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-18T22:20:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022700NitroXpress\u0022 data-cite=\u0022700NitroXpress\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELike lag or something else?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENope, just spinning circle of death.
