If you downloaded KSP from Steam, you could verify the game cache to be sure all files are good. Anyway, KSPedia files aren\u0027t mandatory, you may delete all the contents of KSPedia subfolder if you don\u0027t need to read KSPedia in game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo diagnose a specific file, you should turn verbose logging on in settings, then send the log. All the info required to diagnose this are in the KSP.log file (root KSP directory) that also conveniently shows timing for all loading operations allowing to know what causes delays too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ultimate Steve","CreatedById":161505,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-25T04:18:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMine doesn\u0027t freeze at that point, it just pauses. Because that item on the loading bar is, like, 100 actual items. You can open the debug menu and see if it is indeed frozen or just taking a long time. Easily 2/3 of my average load time is spent on bundle definitions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
