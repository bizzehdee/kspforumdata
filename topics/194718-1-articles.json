I think these mods give a \u0022realism lite\u0022 feel to KSP while stretching out the early stages of the game. I especially like how JNSQ and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E forces an emphasis on efficient rocket designed, which affects everything else in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far, I\u0027ve sent probes to Duna and Eve and am preparing to send Kerbals to Munar orbit.

I have 3 stations, the Next Generation Space Station, Mun Station 1, and the minmus science station, which I built using a reusable \u0022bus\u0022 that shuttles the modules to the station.
