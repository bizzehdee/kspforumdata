This feature is aiming at replicating how Apollo astronauts spent hours collecting rock samples and even drilling to get these samples; so here\u0027s my idea:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nKerbals on EVA can perform \u0027Ground Survey\u0027 and \u0027Drill Sample\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nGround Surveys then have the game pick a random point within 2.0km of the Kerbal, but not informing the player of that point. The game however gives a pulse indicating which direction to head and it\u0027s proximity (sonar style). When the player reaches the point, they get a \u0027rock sample\u0027 which garners high science (varying on planet/moon). This specific trait would gain an increased harvest science point % when used by a scientist. Alternatively when performed by engineers, they get better distance pulses, and pilots get better directional indicators.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nGround Surveys would be when a EVA\u0027d Kerbal attempts to drill a sample from the planet. This would yield different results when done by different classes; engineers would find the ore concentration in the area (dowser style), pilots would find the area information (name, latitude/longitude, etc), and scientists could earn more science. I have no idea what action this would take yet so it\u0027s up for discussion but I want it to be interactive like Ground Survey\u0027s and not just click and do like EVA Reports. My initial idea was for it to be a sliding action event, where you would hit a key (likely space by default) when the bar is over the indicated section, but I feel this isn\u0027t going to be widely approved hence why it\u0027s up for discussion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nLike I said, this was just an idea I\u0027ve had for a while with no idea what to do with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-06T00:27:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot a bad idea. Basically random points of interest around a vessel like it is with the rover contracts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I think what could be better would be the thing you suggest \u002B minigame widgets. Basically, you take a few samples (they are somehow numbered/labeled based on where they were taken from), drive/fly\u00A0back, take it to the lab and hit \u0022Analyze\u0022. Then a widget with 2D representations (just so it\u0027s simpler to implement)\u00A0of different instruments pops out and you got to do actual science. Heat the sample, take a look under the microscope and all that lab jazz. Depending on what you want to check for (ore, chemical elements and whatever else there is in regolith) you would do the actions in different orders.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll be honest, I\u0027m not a geologist and I don\u0027t know how geology works, but IMO actual experimenting would be fun. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CLBBE_NWUAAyQ9I.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EStarbound has it neatly implemented in a form of archeology minigames\u003C/a\u003E and I enjoy them\u00A0every time.
