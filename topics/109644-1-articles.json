Kerbal Stuff aims to be different. We fix the problems with the old and make the new work great. Most of all, Kerbal Stuff brings the Kerbal Space Program community back into the loop and puts the power in the modder\u0027s hands.\u0022\u003C/span\u003E[/h]These are the words that greet you on Kerbal Stuff if you go to the homepage and scroll below the mods. Now, this goes with a question; what were those bad modding sites? I\u0027ve only heard of the Spaceport, Kerbal Stuff, and Curse. Also, the only bad one in that sentence was Curse from my knowledge.

So, there\u0027s not necessarily any significant cost (or maybe even no cost if they already have in house counsel) to throw some entirely justified legal letters out against people possibly harming or taking unreasonable advantage of Squad \u0026amp; KSP\u0027s good names and intellectual property. Yes, it\u0027s important to evaluate the cost:benefit when deciding just how far to go down the legal road.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other side of it, however, is that you simply cannot afford not to protect a valuable trademark. The way the law works for trademarks is that if you don\u0027t defend them, you lose the rights. Copyright, on the other hand, doesn\u0027t need such an active protection, although knowingly ignoring an issue can potentially lead towards \u0022tacit acceptance\u0022 and weaken any future case. The 3rd apex of the intellectual property triangle, patents, well they are just an unholy mess.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T23:29:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey Murph, Squad obviously can\u0027t condone copyright license infringement which is why certain sites aren\u0027t allowed to be linked here, but Squad has no issues with fan sites like Kerbal Stuff which do a great job of respecting modders wishes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoesn\u0027t stop modders issuing their own DMCA takedown notices though if they wish, but their effectiveness can vary, sites that scraped modders work aren\u0027t likely to take much notice of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad does have a legal department that deals with infringement of the Kerbal IP, but Squad don\u0027t own modders work so can\u0027t really do much about it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T02:47:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHey Murph, Squad obviously can\u0027t condone copyright license infringement which is why certain sites aren\u0027t allowed to be linked here, but Squad has no issues with fan sites like Kerbal Stuff which do a great job of respecting modders wishes.\u003Cp\u003EDoesn\u0027t stop modders issuing their own DMCA takedown notices though if they wish, but their effectiveness can vary, sites that scraped modders work aren\u0027t likely to take much notice of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad does have a legal department that deals with infringement of the Kerbal IP, but Squad don\u0027t own modders work so can\u0027t really do much about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, I think you misunderstood me, or I\u0027ve misunderstood what was being implied by \u0022bad\u0022.
