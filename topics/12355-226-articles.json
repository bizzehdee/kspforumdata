The docking I had been doing was only playing around with small craft. I\u0027ve been updating all my mods all along and noticed the docking AP was changed and the GUI for it now included the lines \u0022safeDistance xxx\u0022, \u0022target Size\u0022, \u0022Distance Dock\u0022, and \u0022Distance Axe Dock\u0022.

When I was playing with them back in January I had no problem using the Docking AP to dock with them. I\u0027d select \u0022control from here\u0022 on my probe docking port, \u0022set target\u0022 on the station, engage the AP and head to the kitchen for a snack. By the time I\u0027d get back to my machine the probe would be docked. It was *verry* reliable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the Docking AP doesn\u0027t work with my stations at all. I\u0027d do the usual procedure and the RCS would come on full bore and if I was lucky my probe would shoot straight away from my station. On occasion it would crash straight into it. Distance Dock \u0026amp; Distance Axe Dock would increase and keep increasing until I was more than 200m away from the station. Then I\u0027d loose the targeting on the station docking port and the docking AP would disengage. Leave my probe sailing away at 15m/s\u002B.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI remember it use to work, so I started downloading and trying every version of MechJeb going back to January.

But out at Mun, my lander acts ugly when returning to a rendezvous with the crew ship. The lander reaches my 200 km orbit with no issue, and handles the phasing orbit (and plane matching) OK. The initial transfer burn down to the crew ship appears to work, but when the AP enters the velocity matching part of the maneuver, it undershoots the target. When trying to do the last (short) burns to bring the lander close to the target, it starts a repeated series of \u002BNML and -NML twists and turns, burning about 1 m/s each time. It never stops doing this, and steadily gets farther away from the target instead of closer. The lander never points toward the target, but always \u002BNML and -NML.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AntiMatter001","CreatedById":100129,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-28T22:10:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Euhm anyone getting this error? this happens when i board a mechjeb craft and the mechjeb unit \u0022pings/flys\u0022 off the craft...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E[ERR 21:43:50.330] MechJeb caught exception in core OnSave: System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object\u003Cbr\u003E  at MuMech.MechJebCore.OnSave (.ConfigNode sfsNode) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehelp? i don\u0027t use the dev builds just the normal build.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OrbitalDebris","CreatedById":101515,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-29T01:09:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should try one of the more recent dev builds, the release version of mechjeb has had a lot of bugfixes since it was released.
