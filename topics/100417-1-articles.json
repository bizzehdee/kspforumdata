In the end I cheated by attaching it to the top of a capsule and ejecting it. A solution I do not find acceptable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI kind of like the idea of limited capability in the first probe core but I think you should be able to complete a mission with it. And frankly I wasn\u0027t. I can see leaving out the gyro but the complete lack of an SAS is killing me. I propose a limited SAS. What if the SAS could not communicate with a the reaction wheels of the gyro? It gives you all the challenges and limitations of a nonstabilized satellite. But what if it could communicate with the control systems on the rocket. If the engine is gimbaled or if it has aerodynamic control on the fins it should be able to hold a stable course. Even the V-2 had both thrust and aerodynamic vanes for steerage under power and in atmosphere. You would have to have ether a gimbaled engine or steerable tail fins. So If your first stage engine is fixed, to give you the raw power for launch, it means that you need a steerable tail. Your second stage engine will need to be gimbaled or you will need a RCS on the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat if the Stayputnik came up in the tree before the reaction wheels? It would mean that you would have to learn to use these other systems, with RCS fuel limitations etc., before you could realy on magic reaction wheels for every thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it would make it a limited but useable part. And at the moment I don\u0027t consider it useable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELee\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T11:26:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s doable.
