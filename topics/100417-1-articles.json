In the end I cheated by attaching it to the top of a capsule and ejecting it. A solution I do not find acceptable. \n\nI kind of like the idea of limited capability in the first probe core but I think you should be able to complete a mission with it. And frankly I wasn\u0027t. I can see leaving out the gyro but the complete lack of an SAS is killing me. I propose a limited SAS. What if the SAS could not communicate with a the reaction wheels of the gyro? It gives you all the challenges and limitations of a nonstabilized satellite. But what if it could communicate with the control systems on the rocket. If the engine is gimbaled or if it has aerodynamic control on the fins it should be able to hold a stable course. Even the V-2 had both thrust and aerodynamic vanes for steerage under power and in atmosphere. You would have to have ether a gimbaled engine or steerable tail fins. So If your first stage engine is fixed, to give you the raw power for launch, it means that you need a steerable tail. Your second stage engine will need to be gimbaled or you will need a RCS on the rocket.\n\nWhat if the Stayputnik came up in the tree before the reaction wheels? It would mean that you would have to learn to use these other systems, with RCS fuel limitations etc., before you could realy on magic reaction wheels for every thing.\n\nI think it would make it a limited but useable part. And at the moment I don\u0027t consider it useable.\n\nLee"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T11:26:30Z","Content":"It\u0027s doable. I\u0027ve done it.

Did NASA cheat by taking Hubble up in the Space Shuttle?\n\nI think it\u0027s not just important but VITAL that there be a probe core with NO benefit except for ability to control. Hopefully it\u0027ll be both the lightest and cheapest core available once they balance all the parts.\n\nIt\u0027s not supposed to be easy. Perhaps not even possible. You\u0027re supposed to learn that the probe has major downfalls and research better ones or find a workaround.\n\nAnd in my experience, while I can\u0027t launch one to orbit once I\u0027ve gotten it there I CAN get a Stayputnik into any target orbit without SAS."},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T11:53:13Z","Content":"It isn\u0027t hard at all to get into orbit with no SAS. \n\nIf you really feel like the Stayputnik is too limited, you can add an SAS function by editing the part file, but then you\u0027ll really be cheating [but that also depends on how you look at it] \n\nGo into the part file, scroll to the bottom, and add this:\n\n    MODULE{\tname = ModuleSAS\tSASServiceLevel = 2}}"}]}
