The S.A.S. worked as a supplement to the A.S.A.S.. Now that the new version is out, what is the difference between the two? The IAS has an additional .2 mass on the IRW, while both use the same amount of electricity and produce the same amount of torque in all directions. I will be running some tests of my own to determine the differences, but I would like input from others, and what they have found.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bashkire","CreatedById":44151,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T14:46:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think (and please don\u0027t quote me on this just in case), the reaction wheel just adds torque to help turn the vessel, whereas the SAS module adds torque AND holds the vessel in the same position.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"daOyster","CreatedById":38617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T14:59:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you read the description, I believe the ASAS adds sas if there is none on board but is essentially the same as the inline reaction wheel in every way else.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pyromaniacal","CreatedById":57241,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T15:04:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just ran a series of test launches and discovered that there is effectively no difference.
