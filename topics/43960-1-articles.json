Basically, the COM works like an axis for any forces affecting the plane. I\u0027ll use a shot from a project of mine to describe what I mean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Fi3idC8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Fi3idC8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a small craft with a propeller at the front. You can see the COT is a tiny bit below the COM. If you pinned the ship at the COM and grabbed the COT to pull it forward, the vessel nose would rise a bit. This means that in flight the vessel would slowly point the nose up. The same goes for lift(in this case, the lift-generating part is a balloon, not a wing, so it also works while the vessel is stopped); the COL is a tiny bit to the front of the craft, so it also adds to the \u0022point up\u0022 tendency, as it\u0027ll lift the front part of the vehicle more than the back, until the COM is directly below it(it\u0027s a large simplification, but it works in this case). Basically the farther away is the line you would get by extending the COT/COL marker from the COM, the larger the \u0022rotating\u0022 forces will be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this craft, the differences are small enough that they can be countered by SAS, but if the COT was a lot lower, the ship would begin to rotate faster and faster all the time the propeller was turned on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this clears everything a bit.
