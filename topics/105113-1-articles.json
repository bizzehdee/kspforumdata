But the project, fell under, I never finished it and gave up, deleting the original files. But before that, I had tried back in the era of 0.17, obviously I gave up on that too. Making it about two and a half years since I originally came up with the idea. And since then, things have changed.\n\nIt was back in February of 2014, I hit that punch of inspiration again, and I wanted to finish ROTK out-right. In the next three months, I worked myself hard, recording about two and a half hours of video, about enough for an hour and a half movie. But again, I\u0027ve lost motivation. The project is still on my Hard Drive, just sitting there. Two and a half hours of perfectly good video shot back in 0.22, just, collecting dust. I\u0027ve slowly been working on it a bit since then, but I only have two of the twenty-six scenes edited, making progress slow, but I could so do it, I just don\u0027t have that passion I once had. But the sad thing is, I still do. ROTK is such a huge part of my life now, I\u0027ve spent three years thinking about a dream movie I could make, but I just can\u0027t drive myself to do it. I\u0027ve put heart and soul into the story, and at this point, I\u0027ve planned an entire trilogy\u0027s story out, I have story material for three movies, but I can\u0027t be motivated to fulfil my wishes.

Instead of scrapping the already created footage, is there some way you can reframe it into a flashback, or a dream sequence, or use it in some other way that having a different look to it would not break the movie? You could give it a black and white or washed out look and use it behind a voice-over, etc. to fit it in between newer footage.

Is it the amount of work that it will take.\n\nMaybe you could set aside some time to bash out a rough cut, and then refine later? Do a quick, dodgy edit, then come back to add and correct things later, if your editing program will allow it. Don\u0027t try and make it perfect, Almost nothing is perfect, and everything starts out pretty rubbish at first. A first edit should be made will little effort, - just enough so you\u0027ve actually got something you can work on. \n\n I also suggest making a trailer, if you haven\u0027t already, to gauge interest.

Most simply self-medicate to keep their energy up, but a bunch of us (who aren\u0027t insane) who have shot and edited huge projects use music (and sometimes a second pair of eyes and hands) to keep us motivated to see the project to the end.\n\u003E \n\u003E Allow me to expand on that a bit further...\n\u003E \n\u003E I suspect that the burnout you have is because you\u0027ve spent 90ish days setting up and getting your shots, know the footage inside and out, but have realized that there\u0027s a lot more work yet to be done. Now you\u0027re into the grind of post. Done right, post production is just as fun (sometimes funner) than shooting... but the problem is that you\u0027re messing with stuff you\u0027ve already seen and have already figured out how is going to be strung together, so the editing portion isn\u0027t as \u0022creative\u0022 as it could be to keep your interest going... and it is hard to stay motivated when the bulk of the workload is yet to come.\n\u003E \n\u003E Furthermore, once the burnout comes on there is a bit of depression - one of my directing instructors, in an obvious pun, used to call it \u0027**post**partum depression\u0027 because the baby\u0027s been made (the fun part), but now you have to raise it and teach it not to pee on the carpet or play in traffic (the lots of work part). From that daunting realization that the job is far from over stems our self-doubt and rationalizations to quit or restart the project (this pops up because directors/producers fear the finished project won\u0027t be worth the large effort put into post and start second-guessing their decisions); most of the productions I\u0027ve worked on have ended up in freezers because the director lost interest or the producer ran out of money... but the ones that were finished were projects where the creative force pushed through the rationalizations to quit and simply stayed focused on the end goal: tell a story they want to share.\n\u003E \n\u003E But that\u0027s easier said than done, right?\n\u003E \n\u003E Well, we non-insane sober types have developed a strategy to keep us motivated when staring at the huge EDL we need to generate: we step back and work on our soundtrack instead. The simple act of hunting down music and listening to it - seeing what scores works with the theme of various scenes, or working out the climax or the intro or the denouement - allows us to be productive, take a break from staring at scenes we know inside and out, and when we finally go back to editing we get to look at the footage from a new, creative angle because we\u0027re looking to edit to the music.\n\u003E \n\u003E Furthermore, editing to music allows us to break down large projects into small, bite sized chunks that don\u0027t require weeks of commitment to work on (let alone revealing pacing issues in the story itself, another big bonus). This lets us take breaks when we need to so we can stay motivated long enough to see the project to completion.\n\u003E \n\u003E After all, that\u0027s the whole point of starting a project, isn\u0027t it? To finish? ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E Anyways, it\u0027s long winded and rambling, but that\u0027s my take on filmmaker burnout. Hopefully this helps someone, somewhere.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nThat said, if the OP is simply soliciting opinions, then I\u0027ll say the same thing I say to anyone who is working on a project and is having second thoughts:\n\n***Finish your damned movie!
