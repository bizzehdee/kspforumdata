The most common install of Java the programming language includes a software development kit (SDK) that includes a lot of functionality to make the lives of programmers easier like GUI library functions and so on. It is no \u0022engine\u0022 though and it lacks a lot of functionality a game engine like Unreal, Unity or Frostbite provide. The choice of Java for Minecraft is also probably the biggest drawback and issue for minecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly writing a game engine from scratch is hard and a huge waste of time and development budget. Being under the delusion that you\u0027d have to write your own engine has killed many studios already.Studios that were usually way bigger and had way more money.

If KSP had chosen language X over Y or engine A over B chances are that you\u0027d notice no real difference. It might even crash the same amount.

It\u0027s a great language, but apps written in Java can crash like any other language.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Java does not fix memory leaks. Sure, it helps a lot with memory management via a garbage collector, but you can still get memory problems if you\u0027re not careful. You have to release \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E references to something before it will be garbage collected. Not to mention that letting the language perform its own memory management leads to problems with games - a lot of Java games stutter occasionally as the garbage collector pauses the entire VM to sweep the memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Java actually limits the amount of memory given to an application.

Be it power fluctuations (and are those really random?) or high energy particles from a solar flare interacting with things and causing stray currents.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* mind that you can implicitly release something by releasing the container it\u0027s in (as long as there\u0027s no reference to it elsewhere). As to GC gobbling up the entire CPU, that\u0027s almost always a problem with a poorly configured GC in combination with a bad programming error causing an excessive amount of object creation, resulting in full GC being scheduled faster than it can be executed. I\u0027ve been writing Java professionally since 1997 and only seen it once or twice in all that time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* yup. No need to consult a website though, the JVM has a help text and documentation that explains it quite well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* there might be commercial grade Java physics engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll that said, I don\u0027t consider Java the right choice for a game, especially something like KSP.
