It is a programming language. The most common install of Java the programming language includes a software development kit (SDK) that includes a lot of functionality to make the lives of programmers easier like GUI library functions and so on. It is no \u0022engine\u0022 though and it lacks a lot of functionality a game engine like Unreal, Unity or Frostbite provide. The choice of Java for Minecraft is also probably the biggest drawback and issue for minecraft.\n\nSecondly writing a game engine from scratch is hard and a huge waste of time and development budget. Being under the delusion that you\u0027d have to write your own engine has killed many studios already.Studios that were usually way bigger and had way more money. It usually leads to a buggy mess that lacks even the most basic functionality a commercial off the shelf engine like Unity or Unreal offers. The amount of time and effort is almost always better spent getting it to run in one of those engines and extending them if necessary. \n\nThirdly the choice of programming language matters less than you think. If KSP had chosen language X over Y or engine A over B chances are that you\u0027d notice no real difference. It might even crash the same amount. What matters is that you chose a programming environment that offers you everything you need to develop a game. Decent tool support (debugging, editing and compiling code, helper tools to debug memory usage, static code analysis etc.), helpful documentation and add-on libraries and the ability to extend and modify existing code and systems (important for modding)\n\nMost of the current issues KSP faces have nothing to do with Unity or the C# programming language. The stem from design choices the dev team made in the beginning that turned out to be not entirely suitable to the way KSP has evolved (a fact Squad can\u0027t be blamed for because no one else would have known that right from the start). Also from the fact that Squad favors new features over cleaning up code and fixing long-standing issues. Which is understandable but means that bugs pile up over time and reinforce themselves.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nWhen the switch to Unity 5 and 64 bit is complete the biggest explanation for KSP\u0027s issues (game crashes due to the game process hitting the 3.5 GB memory barrier) will be gone.
