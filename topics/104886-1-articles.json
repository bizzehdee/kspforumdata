Anyways, I\u0027ve been derping around in Sandbox mode and creating some of the more obscure German wonder weapons with the help of the B9 Aerospace pack.\n\nFirst off, what I consider my biggest success: the Horten Ho.XVIII/B.2. Mouthful, ain\u0027t it?\n\n![ggqsgc.png](http://a.pomf.se/ggqsgc.png)\n\nThis was one of the designs tossed around late in World War 2 to cross the impenetrable Atlantic ocean and bomb America. As you can tell by the Mach readings and the fuel levels, it actually would do that very well. I have to say, this is the one that exceeded my expectations the most. It\u0027s by far the best-mannered airplane I\u0027ve ever made. \n\nI will admit, though, I kind of went off-specification on this one. The number of vertical stabilizers is twice what it should be thanks to part clipping issues. But, hey, I found a reference pic that has that layout:\n\n![arado_e_555_by_tr4br-d3i98ti.jpg](http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/157/b/0/arado_e_555_by_tr4br-d3i98ti.jpg)\n\nNext, my other big success: the EMW A-10. No, it\u0027s not the ass-kicking Avenger-packing ground pounder we all know and love. Instead, it\u0027s an obscure design from von Braun\u0027s sketchbooks, featuring two stages and designed, again, to cross the Atlantic and strike America. Oddly, it featured a human pilot in what was essentially a suicide rocket. High-speed bailouts before the advent of ejection seats were kind of a dicey deal, and at the velocities this puppy would be traveling at... \\*laughs\\*\n\n![dahnae.JPG](http://a.pomf.se/dahnae.JPG)\n\nThis one\u0027s another easy steer. Heck, it went halfway around Kerbin (more than meeting the design requirements) with a ham-fisted pilot like me at the controls. And, thanks to a detachable cockpit, the pilot survived.It\u0027s also probably my most accurate remake, as the only thing missing is the camo paint:\n\n![kn_2007_7_6_0_59_56.jpg](http://www.fantasyplanet.cz/gfx/pictures_clanky/kn_2007_7_6_0_59_56.jpg)\n\nSadly, that\u0027s about all that went right out of the batch. My V-1 was so bad I won\u0027t even show it, but there is one final project I consider to be somewhat interesting: the Sanger interpodal bomber.\n\nThis Amerikabomber was designed to skip across the atmosphere like a rock across the lake and deliver three incendiary bombs straight into the heart of Brooklyn. And did it in my recreation? Nnnnnno. Not at all, I\u0027m afraid. It couldn\u0027t even make it to the old airfield without flipping over.\n\nStill, here\u0027s a pic:\n\n![lhgwhn.png](http://a.pomf.se/lhgwhn.png)\n\nNote the RCS tanks and nozzles, which were not a feature of the original design. \n\n![silbervogel2-302512-dc9609175b2c,630,0,0,0.jpg](http://m.gadzetomania.pl/silbervogel2-302512-dc9609175b2c,630,0,0,0.jpg)\n\nAnyways, that\u0027s it for my first post to this subforum.
