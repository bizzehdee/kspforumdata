Take a normal SSTO spaceplane, preferably a decent-sized one built around an LV-N or equivalent, and add a couple ion engines; they don\u0027t add much to the mass, and give you more than enough delta-V to do the long interplanetary burn without affecting the rest of your performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve shown this before, but here\u0027s my older spaceplane, the \u003Cstrong\u003ESleazy Weasel 6a\u003C/strong\u003E. (I\u0027m up to the 7th generation now.) 33 tons, using quite a few mod parts (B9, hybrid ion pack, etc.) but nothing really unbalanced, can land on its tail on airless moons, and handles beautifully in general.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ncnfgvB.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ncnfgvB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe important parts for this discussion are the ion \u0022pods\u0022 seen on the ends of the wings, although there are also several large xenon tanks on the fuselage. It\u0027s hard to see from this angle, but there are also about a dozen 1x6 solar panels that extend once you\u0027re safely in orbit to manage the electricity cost. (The four hybrid ion engines, the paired blue nozzles, are basically equivalent to two LV-Ns. They\u0027re what you use for escape/insertion burns. Slightly higher ISP, but require electricity and xenon in addition to the usual LFO, hence the fuselage xenon tanks.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, I\u0027ve taken it to Laythe. I was able to get there, land, take off, refuel once in Laythe orbit from one of my fuel depots, and make it back to Kerbin. If I stripped down the design to the absolute essentials (like dumping the landing legs) and added more xenon, I\u0027m sure I could do without the refuel stop, but I LIKE having a design that has all those extras.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SlyReaper","CreatedById":58168,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-24T12:38:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done single stage to laythe and back just using sabre engines, but it involved refuelling in kerbin orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mythic_fci","CreatedById":58577,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-24T12:43:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomeone made a craft named \u0022Astroliner\u0022 that could take 8 Kerbals there, I don\u0027t remember who.
