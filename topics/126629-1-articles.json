Finding it is going to be a pain on the new forums though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOtherwise it is a pretty much a matter of trial and error. If you remeber that passing in front of a planet will loose you energy and passing behind it will gain energy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn general though I would question why you want to do gravity assists. If you are trying to create efficient missions than I don\u0027t believe it is worth it. The size and layout of the kerbal system means that the benefits are consideraly less than in the real solar system and the burns you have to do to adjust between encounters normally eat up any gains you might make.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mhoram","CreatedById":78756,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-30T14:06:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave a look here for the mentioned tool: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/73174-win-flyby-finder-v082-ksp104/\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/73174-win-flyby-finder-v082-ksp104/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-30T15:10:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn all honesty, in KSP gravity assists are only marginally beneficial. \u00A0Just like in Real Life, you can sacrifice more mission time for less dV usage (and vice versa). \u00A0In KSP however, because the distances between planets are relatively close, if you wait for the proper transfer window the dV expenditure is minimal, for a very short mission time (relatively speaking). \u00A0For example, the Rosetta mission took 10 years not because it would have taken that long to get to the Comet, but because there was a serious dV restriction on the probe. \u00A0Had NASA had an unlimited dV budget (as we do in KSP) the mission time would have been much shorter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-30T15:26:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222300767\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022126629\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221448883181\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022150733\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gooru\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Gooru said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow to do a gravity Assist Maneuver?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n......\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as i know i can alter the PE by adjusting my approach and that changes ejection speed and angle, but how do i aim for a specific planet?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven that the net result of any gravity assist maneuver is to have the ship leave the planet on the desired trajectory, then technically speaking adjusting the Pe at that planet is all you as a player do, because this is what affects how you leave that planet.\u00A0 Learning where to put your Pe to get the desired results is the trick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are 2 types of gravity assists:\u00A0 those that speed\u00A0 your ship up\u00A0and those that slow it down.\u00A0 To speed up, your Pe needs to be on outboard side of the planet, so as seen from the ship you\u0027d be going to the right of the planet.\u00A0\u00A0Conversely, if you want to slow down pass the planet on the inboard side (to the left side as your ship sees it).\u00A0 And you can change your inclination by moving your Pe up or down in the normal direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, how do you use this?\u00A0 Well, it depends on what you\u0027re trying to accomplish, simple or complex.\u00A0 Simple stuff, usually involving only 1 gravity-assist encounter en route and not requiring high precision,\u00A0is fairly easy.\u00A0 The most common use is to capture into the Jool system without having to aerocapture or use a lot of fuel.\u00A0 Here, you set up a\u00A0\u0022left-side\u0022 encounter with Laythe or Tylo, adjusting your Pe so that you end up in a closed orbit around Jool without having to burn a drop of fuel.\u00A0 You can also do the same trick with Mun when returning there from other planets, and use Eve to slow down with on the way to Moho to reduce the plane change and capture burns there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNOTE:\u00A0 Even with simple stuff, it\u0027s a good idea to change your (root KSP folder)\\settings.cfg file to make the patched conics in the map view more useful.\u00A0 The following edits are necessary:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCONIC_PATCH_DRAW_MODE = 3\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u0026lt;--- This shows the part of your path within the SOI of another body so is really helpful for tweaking your Pe from far away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCONIC_PATCH_LIMIT = X\u00A0 \u0026lt;---- Where\u00A03 \u0026lt; X \u0026lt;= 8, however much you need.\u00A0 This defines how many different colored segments of your future path you see into the future.\u00A0 Just beware that more than going much more than 3 becomes a botheration for just normal flying because, for simple orbits, you have all these redundant paths stacked on top of each other making it very difficult to place a node on the one you want to.\u00A0 But if you\u0027re trying to do a Voyager-style multi-gravity assist, you\u0027ll need a lot here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich brings us to the complex stuff, like a Voyager-style multi-cushion billairds shot through all the outer planets.\u00A0\u00A0The problem with complex stuff like this is that the planets all have to be perfectly aligned for it to work like Voyager did, going from 1 planet directly to the next, and because the outer planets move very slowly, such alignments are quite rare..\u00A0IOW, Voyager launched when it did because that was a once-in-a-lifetime chance.\u00A0\u00A0So you have to know when\u00A0the desired alignments\u00A0will happen.\u00A0 That\u0027s what you use those tools for, that others linked above.\u00A0\u00A0They\u0027re used\u00A0to determine when to leave Kerbin so that Planet A will sling you into an encounter with Planet B, then to Planet C.\u00A0 Then you just have to warp ahead perhaps a few decades of gametime to reach that point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the alternative, you don\u0027t have to go direct from planet to planet, so you don\u0027t need the timing tools.\u00A0 This makes the flight a series of simple problems.\u00A0 Use Planet A to sling your into an orbit that crosses that of Planet B, then just wait however many orbits it takes until Planet B and your ship end up in the same place at the same time.\u00A0 Unless you\u0027ve just got some horrible synchronous orbit that will never meet the target, you\u0027ll eventually get an encounter, which you use to sling yout to Planet C.\u00A0 Only thing is, you might\u00A0have spend a few years making several solar orbits before you meet the next planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich brings up the key point in all of interplanetary flight:\u00A0 fuel = time saved.\u00A0 If your ship lacks the fuel to make the trip under its own power, so that you NEED to use gravity assists, then you pay for that in elapsed gametime.\u00A0 You either do this up front by waiting for several planets to line up just right for a direct trip, or you leave on the next window for the 1st planet, then do your waiting en route between the various planets.\u00A0 Or you can just take enough fuel to go where you want when you want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
