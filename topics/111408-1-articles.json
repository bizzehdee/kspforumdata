If you ever move symmetrical parts after you\u0027ve set an action group for them, it hoses the action group. To fix this, go to the action group menu and remove all the actions for that group, then put them back in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EProblem #2: very unusual spinning while landing on minimus.

I\u0027ll keep that in mind for the action groups. Unfortunately my miner is already producing so I won\u0027t be reverting. I disabled the reaction wheels on the landers and everything went smoothly. These landers were adding the docking port and it f did fulfill the base contract. Now I need to figure out a landing platform for my refueling ship. I was thinking a low square pad with a docking port. Land above it and raise the gear to dock. Any suggestions on that aspect?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
