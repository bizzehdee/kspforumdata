TAC really adds in an interesting perspective to the game. An easy manned mission to Duna now needs much more planning. And it gives you a reason to keep kerbals on the ground for more then five minutes because of launch windows. What is the best way to go about this? With the launch window planner I can find out perfectly how much life support is needed during the maximum duration of a mission. But waiting for the ideal launch window to go home takes far too long. The travel time is no problem. An extra thousand or so dV and I can get to Duna under a 160 days. Its the wait \u003Cem\u003Eat\u003C/em\u003E Duna ive been scratching my head over. Over what the best way is to go about it.. a big, heavy habitation module with enough LS to last to the next ejection window? Ill be burning extra dV in order to shorten that time, but what I really wonder is.. can I really just spend a few minutes on the surface and return? Lol.. It would be far more simple(*cough*cheaper!). Or would the return dV needed after just arriving be too excessive?

I haven\u0027t played with TAC LS in a few versions, but when I played, the large 2.5m life-support container could sustain a crew of three for several (Kerbin) years, and it didn\u0027t weigh that much either.

If you do the calculation and compare risk for mercury/apollo phase and risk in the shuttle program, both for launch and reentry, the known risk have always been present, and despite disasters, ultimately acceptable. An unacceptable risk falls into the category that is probably best described as a suicide mission. So that the second aspect, the technology, needs to be probed. Guessing I would say that if you probed the NASA planners they would confide that there is not a complete set of technologies that gets healthy nauts to mars, more importantly safely and relyably lands into a high-g surface with low atmospheric breaking. The problem gets more \u0027suicidal\u0027 when one figures in the fact there is no known method to return living animals from the surface of Mars. If you can\u0027t return nauts from a landed mission, then overtime it becomes linearly more difficult to keep them alive, at such a point where it is either financially or technically impossible, the suicide mission is complete. There is no \u0027earth-like\u0027 planet, and even in the closest approximation Mars falls short of the light, pressure, and gravity needed to sustain life. As each of these deviate from Earth\u0027s the cost of technology needed to support life increases. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhereas you want to keep your nova-martians alive you need a space-station in orbit, low cost supply ships, something that can target the base, land successfully at 100 m/s (therefore not needing to burn) and some means of cheaply deorbiting it. Grow the food in orbit and supply the base nutrients either from comet mining or from Earth, but also bank reserves for the half decadal period where Mars is not in a launch window. On that station lots of plant growth bays with LEDs and Large array of solar panels that can supply electricity, and of course the station needs to be manned. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E When we get into the reality discussion, we quaintly have to deal with the fact that the kerbals start their program with no known metropolii, in a junk-yard with a sodded launchpad and a compressed aggregate runway, neither of which are capable of supporting an inter-whereever manned rocket, with a budget a millionth that of NASA. There is no reality to a Duna mission when compared to NASA. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe grand solution here is to mod KSC, mod parts, create reality by breaking the realities-that-be, since real reality does not suffice, and fake reality does not suffice, therefore any other reality is just as good.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
