I just found out that you updated again and added the IP Transfer stuff, \u0027m about to try it out, actually. The only thing I could even come up with that could be considered negative is that I have to build each lazor for every craft. I just don\u0027t get the point of having to assemble the different colored Lazors, especially when it is this tedious. Why not just have each color be a part? But, yeah it\u0027s not that big of a deal, I was just curious as to why you made it that way.....\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the plan was to keep the system like it is now, it would be better to add 6 different colored lazors in stead of 1 lazor and 3 color crystals to do the same thing. The reason why i made it like this is, i wanted a system you have to build on top of a rocket, just like you build the rocket itself. After all, the game itself could come with a couple pre-made rockets you could fly, but the whole point of ksp is the assembly. Originally i planned to add more lazor modifications to the systems, not just color crystals. And honestly i haven\u0027t really given up on that idea. I realize it doesn\u0027t make much sense to have it like this for some of the subsystems and i\u0027m hoping to correct this as the development progress.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redrumssam","CreatedById":28298,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-17T19:07:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the reply, oh and I used ipt last night(well, I tried to) it is quite good!

This system is speciffically made to work with my robotic arms and it is possible to use it to move parts on your vessel in-flight. This system has been tested using one arm. I can\u0027t guarantee that it will work if you create elaborate chains of arms or circular connections. So if you want it to work in those cases you will have to test it yourself and send me the steps to reproduce any bugs you find. The decoupling beam will decouple the selected part from it\u0027s parent. If using this with the robotic arms, keep in mind that the parent part is in the direction of the current root part of the vessel.
