The un-upgraded fission reactors CAN be used as thermal rockets, but you will need to use either the 2.5m or 3.75m reactor and use Thorium in order have an engine more effective than the stock LV-N.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stock LV-N produces 60 KN of thrust and has an ISP of 800 s. It\u0027s base thrust-per-ton is 26.6667 KN/t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 3.75m reactor produces 849.77 KN of thrust at full power using thorium and liquid fuel. It weighs (when fully loaded with uranium) 43 tons \u002B 3 tons for the thermal rocket. This gives it an effective TPT of 18.4733 KN/t and an ISP of 993 s. Assuming a rocket with the same engine mass (i.e. 1 3.75m thermal rocket or ~20 LV-Ns), you will have just under 70% the thrust but around 125% of the dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you swap out liquid fuel for LFO, you get 3,144.15 KN of thrust with an ISP of 595.8 s. This gives you an effective TPT of 68.3511 KN/t. Compared to an equal weight of LV-Ns, this would give you 256% of the thrust, but you would only have 75% of the dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 2.75m reactor isn\u0027t very useful with pure liquid fuel and thorium, as it has only 141.63 KN of thrust, with a weight of 14 t \u002B 1.5 t for the thermal rocket. This gives it the same ISP of 993 s but a TPT of only 9.1374 KN/t. Compared to an equal weight of LV-Ns (~7 LV-Ns), you would have only 34% of the thrust and 125% of the dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing LFO gives you 524.031 KN and again an ISP of 595.8 s. The TPT of this is 33.8085 KN/t. Compared to an equal weight of LV-Ns, you will get 127% the thrust but 75% of the dV. The only advantage of using the 2.75m reactor over the 3.75m is that it is smaller and thus more suitible for smaller interplanetary craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, unupgraded fission thermal rockets are possible, but only advantagous when you are carrying very large payloads. I would recommend using them to build large interplanetary tugs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for plasma engines, those are a different beast entirely. Self-sufficient plasma engines are more-or-less useless until you get either fusion reactors or microwave-transmission. I recommend starting with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/FractalUK/KSPInterstellar/wiki/Basic-Microwave-Powered-Plasma-Spacecraft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis guide on the wiki\u003C/a\u003E, which assumes you have microwave transmission unlocked. If you chose to unlock fusion reactors before microwave transmission, I recommend using the 1.25m fusion reactor, the 67.5 cm plasma engine, and lithium for the fuel. Try that combination with a minimal payload (e.g. just the 1.25m capsule or something) and see how that works for you. It will work much better once you unlock upgraded generators (which are in the node after microwave transmission, I believe)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AngelLestat\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AngelLestat\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere is not plan to make solar sails or beamed propulsion?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, Fractal_UK has a working solar sail.
