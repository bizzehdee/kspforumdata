Look for the option on the probe core part action window to Rename Vessel. There you can reclassify it to a Probe which should trigger the achievement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223922791\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022200192\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221612873842\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022209942\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022autonm\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, autonm said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0027Zero Gravity\u0027 - Reached orbit - Kerbal open the hatch etc = performed EVA ... nothing unlocks.
