What are your favorite mods that you use? Why do you like them? What are some good mods that add to the kerbal space program experience? Post them here, I want to hear what you have to say! As of late, my most favorite mod is probably the KW rocketry pack, because it makes delta V much easier to generate, but you only really get to the good stuff at the end of the science tree, I also like the KAS and Biomass mods because they add new things to the game that allow you to open your mind to more opportunities and great inventions. Feel free to post some mods that you think are great down in the comments and thank you for your time! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Klingon Admiral","CreatedById":69090,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T17:31:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETAC Life Support\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENavyfish\u0027s docking alignment indicator (I really, really want my stations to look good)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemote Tech (not tested yet, but I\u0027m thinking about trying it out)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T17:34:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb .\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"draeath","CreatedById":25709,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T17:37:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E* MechJeb when used responsibly (eg no autopilot junkies apply),\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* RemoteTech2,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Ferram Aerospace,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Deadly Reentry Continued,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Ioncross Life Support,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Either (or both) Lazor Docking Cam or Navyfish\u0027s docking alignment indicator,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* and TAC Fuel Balancer (if you resist the temptation to do things you shouldn\u0027t be able to do, such as \u0022balance\u0022 ablative shielding or dumping CO2)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically things that increase \u0022realism\u0022 or at least add some more challenge, provide information and data entry (MJ\u0027s maneuver node editor for the win!), or make streamlined existing things (fuel balancer - you can try to do this manually, albeit with much hair-pulling)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-09T18:15:56Z\u0022 title=\u002201/09/2014 06:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by draeath\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eformatting\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T17:45:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely Kerbal Engineer Redux.

I would use MechJeb, but it doesn\u0027t like my asparagus designs. I use KE to see what my TWR is and that is about the most I do for math. If I could figure out MechJeb for more than ascents, I might use that again. I just haven\u0027t had the time or inclination to sit down and play with it extensively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really liked MapSat, but haven\u0027t used it recently as it doesn\u0027t seem to work correctly. I enjoyed putting up MapSats in polar orbits just to get the maps. And I figured if I could ever take the time to figure out MechJeb\u0027s landing feature, I could actually land at some of the anomalies. I\u0027m a poor pilot when it comes to landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried KW Rocketry and Nova Punch\u0027s rockets and the mod that I think is called Stock-X parts. Once I started into mods with lots of parts, my game seemed to be unstable. I know I don\u0027t have the best computer for playing Kerbal, so I just play with stock parts now. And there are enough stock parts to satisfy me, so I don\u0027t really need the extra choices.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I would really like is a mod with a stackable parachute for the 1m and 3m parts.
