Now okay, in reality, that obviously CANNOT happen because there is no real connection yet. And what\u0027s more, in KSP, once that happens, and you\u0027re dealing with two very differently configured spacecraft, the actual \u0022HARD DOCK\u0022 takes place longer, because I think this \u0022phantom\u0022 RCS-we-think-as-one that happens, actually screws up the process of getting to a hard dock. I know this, because the moment I turn off the RCS on one or both the spacecraft, a successful hard dock \u003Cem\u003Ethen\u003C/em\u003E follows after a few seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis phenomenon (though not really accurate because this event happens only on truly docked spacecraft in real life) is akin (but ironically opposite) to that situation in Apollo 13, wherein Lovell et. al. were trying to orient the LM, but the RCS on the CSM was dead, so it felt like \u003Cem\u003E\u0022...flying with a dead elephant on our back\u0022\u003C/em\u003E, only this time around, it\u0027s like two LIVE elephants trying to decide who is the elephant with orientation priority.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if this makes sense, but my point in this post is, I wonder if Squad can find a way to look into that, and perhaps \u003Cstrong\u003ENOT allow the RCS to function as one unit BEFORE the two craft have hard docked\u003C/strong\u003E. It\u0027s not a show stopper, but it does waste RCS fuel, if you don\u0027t realize that it\u0027s happening and you wonder why the two spacecraft are \u0022struggling\u0022 to hard dock.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brabbit1987","CreatedById":65801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T07:04:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI find a good solution for this would be to count even docked ships as separate, meaning it still has it\u0027s own controls and can be switched to like a separate ship. Then when you want to truly combine them, you can right click on the command module and click \u0022Hard Dock\u0022 which would combine all controls.
