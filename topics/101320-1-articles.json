The next Minmus crew rotation were due to go up by plane, so it made sense to send the rover along with them.\n\n\u0022Cargo bays?\u0022 said Dr. Von Kerman, \u0022Ve do not need ze cargo bays!\u0022\n\n![jv9FLCA.png](http://i.imgur.com/jv9FLCA.png)\n\nThe rover was therefore to be carried directly on the back of the crew transport. It\u0027s actually surprisingly stable in this configuration. The pitch-up moment can be corrected by pumping fuel into the partially-loaded forward tank. Note also the selective yellow landing lights, which don\u0027t wash out the surface detail quite as much as pure white.\n\n![hbf9i4j.png](http://i.imgur.com/hbf9i4j.png)\n\nBill wanted to get out and ride in one of the command seats, but Kerson locked the door.\n\n![6FCa0hB.png](http://i.imgur.com/6FCa0hB.png)\n\nWhen the team reached the space station, there was an issue. The rover has no RCS thrusters, and only one docking port (attached to the plane). The rover is also in the way of the plane\u0027s own inline port. Fortunately, I keep a mini tug at the station for this sort of eventuality. Bill got aboard the rover, separated from the plane and kept it steady. The remote-controlled tug then docked to the rover and dragged it to the station. When the time comes, the rover will be carried on the nose of the crew bus currently at the station.\n\n![t7VxRLX.png](http://i.imgur.com/t7VxRLX.png)\n\nDawn came just after the rover was stowed at the station. Kerson was then free to open the planes docking port and bring the plane and its passengers safely over.\n\n![B7mEjIy.png](http://i.imgur.com/B7mEjIy.png)\n\nA rather unorthodox method of bringing equipment into orbit, but for light craft such as this, the piggyback method works well.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-05T21:33:22Z\u0022 title=\u002203/05/2015 09:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FlyingPete**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kieve","CreatedById":98713,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T05:25:57Z","Content":"Not bad! ![goodjob.gif](http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f321/Kieve/PWI/tigers/goodjob.gif)\n\nI like the spaceplane too, very elegant.

Docked at the station is one of my older (non-nuclear) crew carriers that can shuttle between the Kerbin station and those around Kerbin\u0027s moons. Think of Dr. Floyd\u0027s moon flight in 2001:A Space Odyssey. The plan is to transport the rover on the front of this crew carrier. Similarly, it will be docked to the top of the lander to bring it to the surface, and hopefully the force of the separator plus some rotation torque will be enough to jump it onto the ground.\n\nI have three spaceplanes in the same \u0027series\u0027. This one, a stretched version with a cargo bay instead of the passenger cabin/docking port, and an unmanned tanker with extra fuel. I like to build simple designs that do a job ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n![wwEQue1.png](http://i.imgur.com/wwEQue1.png)\n\n![sPXFrBq.png](http://i.imgur.com/sPXFrBq.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"FlyingPete","CreatedById":127384,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T21:27:53Z","Content":"So the rover made it safely to Minmus station. Well, almost. Due to a lack of RCS on the rover, it was dropped off a short distance away, while Lodzor Kerman transferred to the lander docked to the station and brought it over.\n\n![DeT9cLV.png](http://i.imgur.com/DeT9cLV.png)\n\nThe rover was brought to the surface attached to the lander\u0027s top docking port. Getting it onto the ground was a bit awkward- it was necessary to use the torque of the rover\u0027s probe core to shuffle it from the roof of the lander. Lodzor got out to help put the little 4x4 back on its wheels.\n\n![m3MI8rn.png](http://i.imgur.com/m3MI8rn.png)\n\nThe rover drives pretty well, though suffers from the usual lack of traction you get on Minmus. Lodzor was having such a good time motoring about that he forgot to detach the docking port to improve ground clearance.\n\n![lDEbyLM.png](http://i.imgur.com/lDEbyLM.png)\n\nWith the docking port detached on the move (in a strangely explosive manner) the Lander Rover has very good clearance over obstacles. The best way to stop on the icy flats turns out to be to steer sharply and let it skid to a halt. The probe core provides enough torque to prevent a rollover. Things did get somewhat interesting during the descent from the landing site- an uneven bit of ground sent the rover airborne. Careful control was needed to get the orientation correct for landing.\n\n![CTHJ57v.png](http://i.imgur.com/CTHJ57v.png)\n\nClimbing hills, however, was a problem. There simply wasn\u0027t the weight on the four wheels to prevent them from spinning on acceleration. The solution was to disable the front pair of motors, and use the rover\u0027s SAS control to lift it onto the rear wheels. With the whole weight now on two wheels, the situation was improved and Lodzor was able to complete the survey mission. Another contractor satisfied.\n\n![1wxehwu.png](http://i.imgur.com/1wxehwu.png)"}]}
