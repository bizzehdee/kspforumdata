In practice that means any orbit with a Pe above about 70km is stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECircularising your orbit isn\u0027t compulsory, but does make things like rendezvous, docking, and planning further manuevers a bit simpler. To circularise, either burn at your Ap to bring your Pe up to the same height, or burn at your Pe to drop your Ap to the same height. Within a few km of each other is good enough to be called circular.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo assist with these kind of orbital maneuvers, have a play with the maneuver node system. In the map view, click on either your Ap or Pe and add a manuever node. Drag either of the light green icons until you get the orbit looking circular (don\u0027t touch the other icons for this manuever). This will put a dark blue marker on the navball showing what direction you need to point in, and give you a time to the burn and how long it will be. Split the burn time and go to 100% thrust when you\u0027re that close to the node (ie: for a 30 sec burn, you want to light it up 15s before the node).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Maneuver_node\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMore info on maneuver nodes\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPr4q5tj-Q\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EVideo tutorials for newbies\u003C/a\u003E, check out this guy\u0027s other videos too.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-30T20:33:58Z\u0022 title=\u002212/30/2013 08:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Seret\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlackBicycle","CreatedById":29657,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T20:28:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome! Your questions seem to indicate you are really into this thing, as most of us are. So here we go, I\u0027ll try to answer the first question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all I have to say we have a very decent wiki where you can learn it all. Other than that, here\u0027s a short primer (without mods. Get MechJeb and it all becomes a breeze (once you\u0027ve learned how to handle it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStable orbit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 1. Press T - that will keep you stable. Launch. Go vertical until 10 km. Make sure your speed does not exceed 200 m/s under 5km, 300 m/s under 10km. Throttle down a bit if needed (down to half-power or more, depending on the vehicle). The Wiki has more exact figures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. At 10 km, slant your vehicle 45 degrees to the right. The navball should indicate 45 incline towards 90 degrees (that is, you are halfway on blue towards brown, and the mark on it reads 90 degrees. You should be traveling east (to the right) along the equator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Press M to switch to map, bring up your navball (map screen, low edge, middle) to make sure you are on course and to be able to cut off engines from the map view. Zoom in with the mousewheel (sometimes you need to rotate around the planet, rightclick-hold and drag, move mouse sideways), take a look at your trajectory. There will be an apoapsis icon. Mouseover that and you will see your apoapsis increasing. When it reaches space (over 70km for Kerbin (edge of atmosphere), you can turn off the engines and fly up there. Make sure your apoapsis does not fall below like 75 (you will need those 5 extra km for corrections, if you aren\u0027t using an autopilot, like MechJeb). You are still in the atmosphere, so if your apo gets low, just do a short burst, same direction, 45 deg up above horizon (into the blue). When you are good, just wait till you are near the apoapsis (if we are talking 75, 70\u002B will be close enough.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Orient your vessel towards the horizon in the direction you are traveling, (there should be that greenish-yellow circle with 3 short sticks protruding from it - that\u0027s where you are actualy going). Don\u0027t match the circle, just lay exactly on the horizon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. When you are about 72-73km, start burning (forward). Let your direction stay on the horizon, switch to map (M key) and watch your trajectory pull out and out until it becomes an orbit. Watch the opposite apsis of the orbit (mouseover the small icon there) and see when that also clears the 70 km of the atmosphere. You can press X then (make sure the navball is UP in map view, or it won\u0027t work) to shut down the engines. You are in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Every orbit has a highest (apoapsis) and the lowest (periapsis) point. The most energy-efficient way to change those are to raise apoapsis at the moment you are passing periapsis and wise-versa. You just burn towards that yellow-green circle (your direction vector it\u0027s called) to increase the opposite point (be it apo or peri), and burn retrograde (backwards) do decrease the opposite point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere we go, Google is our friend.

The only reason to go up is that doing this inside the thick soupy atmosphere is too hard. Basically you want to go straight up out of the thickest part of atmo, then begin turning gradually towards the horizon to get that horizonal velocity.

It was time to return and the chutes worked perfectly, however there was a slight mishap with the lab, it seems it was made of plyboard and the speed of 10/ms we were at was more then the 6/ms it was waited for, i will miss fred rob john and lue, the commander was destrought, he called them by a nickname wailing the name over and over \u0022my data\u0022, \u0022my beautiful beautiful data\u0022 poor man, it hard, bit like the pod. sorry was that too soon?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDay 12\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewe launched again, though i was told the past mission never happened and i should forget about it...wierdly fred rob john and lue were back about so maybe it was all a dream, i have had so many dreams of failure. we watched the plants grow and this time we landed safely it seems our commander had looked through the very fabric of reality into something called a text file and made the lab a lot more sturdy, he also insisted the engineers fit some legs to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDay 13.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe used the same ship but instead of doing science in the outer reaches of space we decided it would be fun to land on another part of kerbal and do it there. we found a problem though when we discoverd that the legs attached to the science pod float, as does my pod, the science pod however pops like a bubble, i was most upset for a minute or two until i relised it too was one of those dreams that have the big revert words in them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDay 14.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA new ship! it was a sight to behold all sleak engines and thrusters, weighing nearly 500 tones, every kind of science lab on it that money could buy, its a shame it couldnt get off the launch pad \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDay 15.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA new ship, some what smaller then yesterdays and this we did get into space, we orbited kerbal in our second to last stage while the small solar panals slowly powered our advanced generator turning raw sunlight into fuel, we then went and orbited mun, the mission controller was praising mechjeb the whole way there ! we did some science and then came back all perfectly successfully! the amount of science we brought back made the commander very happy, he promised that this week we would all get payed! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDay 16\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith some slight tweaks to the ship we had decided to land on mun! extra chutes had been added and some additional rockets to get back up. i have never seen so much space duct tape! all went well untill we got to the actual mun landing, it seems there is a design flaw with mun and parachutes dont work there! something about the lack of atmosphere, there was a flash and it seems it had been a dream again!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDay 17.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith some slight tweaks to the ship we had decided to land on mun! extra rockets had been added to get back up. we were also in two ships held together with two docking clamps the bottom ship was to be the main left off vessel that would then get us to mun, we would undock, land do science then redock and go home, it was an ambitous plan and one i feel would of worked had the docking clamp not snapped mid launch, we lost control of the launch vessel and i can only hope the kerbals in side there knew to pull the chutes ! We fired off our rockets that were designed to ease our mun landinf and get us back off it...but they were more powerful then we could of hoped for and got us into orbit cleanly, once in orbit of kerbal, we began the slow task of deploying all our solar arrays oh how i wish i could bind them to one button in the control deck! and the refueling generator turned that energy into fuel, once topped up we were off again, we got to mun with so little fuel used that there seemed little point in orbiting to refuel, after all once landed our solar panals sticking out at odd angles will refuel us while the science experiments continue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewell, our descent was at a perfect angle and we maintained a steady 10/ms descent speed (though a few times the commander seemed to be cursing something called \u0022sticky keys\u0022 i felt it was prudent to not ask him what that was, what they get up to in mission control is thier buisness affter all), however mun was rotateing and we also had some forward motion, and we landedon the side of a hill...all in all it was not the smoothest of landings, we immediatly toppled over the fueltanks and engines (we have four positioned around the ship) acted as a roll cage as we rolled down the hill, satalite dishes and solar panals were torn from us in little explosions, when we got to the bottom of the hill we spent two days watching the plants grow, we have 600 science, an amount the commander is very pleased with but we cant launch! the commander said he has a plan though he going to publish my journel were like minded people can see it and ask if they have any ideas for retrieval. i hope he gets some soon as he was talking grappling hooks and unmaned vessels earlier and i have seen him on the claw crane in the cafe and it wasnt pretty!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehope you enjoyed me killing an hour or so of work by sharing my kerbals exploits, i know im no shakespear and my dyslexia may put some off but i hope it made one or two of you chuckle \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso yeah, how am i going to rescue all that lovely lovely science? oh and jeb ofcourse, the most outrageous idea i had was to launch a rover and use a grapple hook mod i saw that would allow me to either right the vesel (the engines and pods are intact and have a lot of fuel left. or tow it to a custom built launcher , hook it up and tow it back, but the only rovers i saw are premade ships made to look like rovers and ofcourse not possible to get into space (anything non symetrical is pretty much impossible to get into space lol)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso dont judge me too harshly for using a fuel generating mod, im only playing for fun after all \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***edited bellow*****\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGReat news folks! when i loaded kerbal up it was saved before the crash errrr i mean landing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etook me a fair bit of time but i got them down safely \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=210825464\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=210825464\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei also managed to get them home for a whooping great science injection!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDay 18.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewe made it, we landed on mun, there was shouts of joy from mission control and some of the scientists in the pod stopped praying long enough to enjoy the view!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewe watched the plants grow and then fred volunteered to go out side to plant the flag, he made the first foot print on the moon (not including the ones on his back where we pushed him into the airlock) After planting the flag and writting a report out he started doing jumping jacks eventualy he came back in (we told him if he didnt we would leave without him)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe flight home was hair raising! we were doing over 2000 m/s on approach to kerbal, the uper atmosphere tore off all our solar panals and we could see that it was to be a water landing! its ok though the chutes flared and unlike the mun the worked! im now about to enjoy a lovely plate of bacon and chips while my mission controller gets some food and finishes his victory dance/spasem\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-01T03:23:58Z\u0022 title=\u002201/01/2014 03:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by mrgreaper\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Egame glitch saved jeb!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adson","CreatedById":99024,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-01T18:05:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECongratulations on your successful mission to the mun!

He had a \u0022rover\u0022 idea and using some caterpillar tracks he made a massive rover that included a science lab and just about any small science item he could find space 4, it looked amazing its 4 caterpillar treads and 6 separate rockets designed to lift it back of any planet we land on. it was stuck to a huge two stage rocket. The idea was simple, stage one would get us into or near space, stage 2 would be used to put us into a circular orbit where we could use the fuel generators and some frankly scary large solar panels to refuel...from there off to a new planet! well...there was a slight hicup, we only raised up slowly and didnt even reach 10k before stage 1 was out of fuel! there was some mild panic and stage 2 slowed our plummet (errr i mean graceful descent) down, but little else then that! we detached the rover with the hope of atleast testing its first stage chutes but 4 of its 6 thrusters, which we were then using as retro thrusters to slow our descent had thier fuel go into the first stage rockets (they were after all ment to be refueled in space) so only 2 of the rockets fired, this put us into what mission control refered to as a \u0022death spiral of oh my god thier all going to die\u0022 i had faith in our mission commander though unlike the rest of the crew! well we cut the engines and fired both chute stages at once, this did slow us down...our landing was in water and i feel the rover is more designed for....well...not water, The rescue party took a picture of us:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=211054958\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=211054958\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esome of the rover desolved in the water sadly .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDay 21.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei was passing the rocket design shed when i heard an animated discussion between the mission controller and a scientist, it will never work they were yelling at him, but then there was a chill in the air and i heard our commander almost shout, \u0022all we need is more power\u0022, somewhere i heard thunder, \u0022more engines = more power!\u0022, more thunder,\u0022moooo ha ha ha ha haaa\u0022, yet more thunder...i backed away to prepare for launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDay 22.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewell the scientists have strapped some jet engines around the rockets to give it more of a boost in low atmosphere (in unrelated news the nearby airport has had to ground all flights due to mechanical issues and i was unable to get my latest shipment of jelly beans \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E ) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a friend take a photo of it so you can see it\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=211055425\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=211055425\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe were worried it wouldnt launch (well not me ofcourse, how could the commanders new design fail!) now it did indeed launch but there was a slight issue, we use what we thought to be indestructable ship holders to keep us upright before a launch (wouldnt want to start off resting on our engines after all lol.) however the initial thrust was too much for them and one broke free of the ground and game with us, my friend was thrown in the air with us and took this picture (he will be missed) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=211055232\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=211055232\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewith the extra wieght we still managed to get to an impressive height of 18k, luckly the girder fell off and had a soft landing on Ms Macs Orphanage and lost bunny refuge, once cleaned we can use it again so all is well on that side. we dropped stage 1 and told the autopilot to put us in a circular orbit, now it said we needed a booster flare of 1 minute 53 seconds, i checked the second stage fuel supply, it read 26 seconds of fuel left, so grabbing a bit of paper, a pen and a 20 sided dice i did the complicated mathmatics to determin if 26 seconds would cover it....RATS! we would be 15 seconds short!!!! fred and leu volentereed to jump out to save weight, but it didnt make any difference. we deployed all solar panals and turned on the fuel gen, but it was no good the system is not efficent enough to keep us in flight so we dumped stage 2, dont worry it too had a soft landing, thank god for the near by petting zoo!
