I think the pilot, scientist, and engineer classes were brought into KSP1 mainly to encourage players to bring more than one Kerbal on journeys, which was a good idea, but in the end you could usually replace a pilot with a probe core, so you really only ever needed 2 kerbals. In a game like KSP2 with colonies and stations that might have hundreds of kerbals does this paradigm really make sense anymore? You could of course give kerbal classes more things to do or create new classes but I worry in the end you\u0027re just adding busywork thats not essential to core gameplay. I find particularly on long playthroughs with 50 or 100 kerbals to manage it becomes incredibly time-consuming to fiddle with moving individual kerbals between shuttles, stations, and bases. I\u0027d LOVE to have an interface that allows me to move groups at a time. What if there was a different kind of incentive that encouraged players to bring 5 or 10 kerbals on long exploration journeys? Not just adding a dozen different classes, and nothing punitive like \u0022oh you don\u0027t have a doctor so one of your kerbals died\u0022, but something simple and intuitive that doesn\u0027t require a bunch of finicky staff management. It could be as simple as a modifier that keeps kerbals happy on long journeys if there were more of them, that way you could could get rid of classes entirely, or just have two: \u0022Colonists\u0022 and \u0022Kerbalnauts\u0022.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother thing I find grinds down long playthroughs is the current XP system. In many ways it\u0027s worse than classes because you have to constantly keep track of where they\u0027ve been and individually tour them around on dozens of repetitive missions to level them up. Again, if there was a more collective way in which EVA abilities, science payouts, resource mining efficiency etc. were leveled up for all kerbals rather than needing to manage their careers individually it would open up a lot more time to focus on design and exploration.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-26T16:34:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe three classes are perfectly fine.

On-ground training the Kerbals can do when they\u0027re not on missions (levels up to 1-2 stars, maybe?), training through automated atmospheric missions once they reach that point (up to 3-4 stars), then beyond that they can do automated interplanetary missions or whatever is planned for that. There\u0027s a lot they can do with other systems currently planned. Since we\u0027ll likely be dealing with hundreds, if not thousands of Kerbals scattered across the galaxy, there has to be a way to train Kerbals without manually putting them on the space-bus to everywhere.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"t_v","CreatedById":213541,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-26T17:27:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the first part of incentives to have multiple kerbals, I think it can be both. Having more kerbals helps keep them happy, and having the different classes helps the different operations go smoothly. As for kerbals being able to complete the same tasks, I have a few ideas. First, I\u2019m hoping that KSP 2 has more activities that distinguish the classes so there can be more overlap. Sure, a pilot can transfer a surface sample and rivet a tank onto a girder, but can they properly operate a spectrogram and rewrite an antenna? This makes basic missions less class-dependent while introducing another design element to more specialized missions: if your craft only has two seats, will you give up repairing the advanced parts so that you can plan a baristochrone trajectory properly?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, have kerbals be able to fill multiple classes. This doesn\u2019t merit its own thread but I\u2019m happy to put it in this one. The idea is that as a kerbal pilots, repairs, or does more advanced science, they gain experience in that class. Ideally this would involve raising the maximum class level, allowing very, very \u00A0experienced kerbals to be five stars in all three classes, or super-experienced in one class. This allows for even more specialized tasks to be created, giving a sense of accomplishment when you get a full crew of 7-star scientists to staff the first dark matter chemistry lab.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, this second solution really requires \u00A0a way to train kerbals in bulk before they go out on missions so that they aren\u2019t incapable on their first mission in the far future. Having colony modules capable of training kerbals over time would be a good solution to this. The maximum level that can be trained before the kerbals go out would increase as the player progresses, and you can set up a system where you specify a percentage of the colony population and how many levels you would like in each class (up to the maximum) and they will begin training. That way, you can start with a Pilot 5/ Scientist 1 kerbal, ready to gain valuable experience through real missions.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is definitely not going to be in the game, just another thing that I hope I can make happen through modding.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-26T18:04:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would say use the old system but with a twist; add universities. Kerbals can enroll in a university either as student or as trainer (penalties may apply) and transfer knowledge that way. You still have to advance Jeb (or whoever) to three, four and five stars but after that you can quickly upgrade all Kerbals on the same planet. Then ship one of them off to Duna and repeat the process there on the Duna colony (unless they\u0027ve split off to become the Dunian Congressional Republic of course), etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-26T18:08:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224191155\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210291\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221666802819\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmanually assign\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIIRC one of the main points regarding the existence of colonies but keeping it as side aspect of the game, was to reduce micromanagement.
