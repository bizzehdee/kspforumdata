Somebody will probably correct me on that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, at the moment the Science Lab is only really useful for missions far away that you don\u0027t plan on returning (and even then it\u0027s a lot of effort, and might be better off without it). Science also feels a little grindy especially when talking about laboring around the Mun to all the different biomes. I did actually do a Minmus biome mission with Kethane which I sent to a Science Lab in orbit around Minmus and although it was fun, if I had gone to each different biome, refuelled and stored all the science in the command module, I would have got a ton more science.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spinomonkey","CreatedById":102142,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-23T23:40:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis depresses me greatly. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI spent the past week building a mun base (that failed) then a mun space station (that succeeded) only to find myself at this bleak moment of failure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-23T23:53:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are exactly 3 use cases for the research module. One is on Mun, another on Minmus, and the third is at Jool. These 3 areas are all places where a non-landing science module can receive a refuelable lander, scrub the goo and materials bay, and then let the lander go down to a new biome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s how you do it: Build a 3-module craft:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Lander, crewed and with a materials bay, goo container, and any other science you have (gravioli detector is great!). Oh, and a docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Science module with a big fuel tank, enough to fill the lander up 5-10 times. You can do more but that\u0027s getting greedy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Return craft that can bring your 3 (or more, but 3 is the minimum). guys home. This doesn\u0027t need to include either of the above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen get that thing in orbit around your target body (Start with Minmus, it\u0027s by far the easiest), put 2 guys in the science module, and with the 3rd guy take the lander down and land it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo all your science (Don\u0027t forget to do an EVA report from the ladder and another from the ground! And a surface sample and crew report). Then with your Kerbal right click all the science areas and \u0022take\u0022 it. Including the Goo and Materials bay. You\u0027ll get a warning. Ignore it. You want that science. Also \u0022take\u0022 the crew report from the capsule. It seems dumb but do it. When your guy gets in the lander, he\u0027ll store all the stuff there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet back up to your orbiting station, dock, and then right click your science lab and \u0022clean\u0022 the 2 science modules. While they\u0027re cleaning, get your lander guy out and right click the capsule and \u0022take\u0022 all that science you stored in there. Fly him up to your return craft and right click it, and \u0022store\u0022 the science in that craft. Now you\u0027re ready to go back down into a different biome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERepeat this for every biome you can find (Jool only has 5, one for each moon) or until you run out of fuel. Then get your guys into the return module and come home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave fun spending your literally thousands upon thousands of science points.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starstrider42","CreatedById":104043,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-24T00:21:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022spinomonkey\u0022 data-cite=\u0022spinomonkey\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHere\u0027s what I\u0027ve done...\u003Cp\u003E1: I\u0027ve gone to the Mun and collected surface samples/temp/EVAs/the works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: All of this research aside for EVAs I\u0027ve brought back home and recovered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: On things like Surface Samples, Mystery Goo and Material Studies- typically I get about 80% of the research potential in a single round trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue is, I went ahead and built a research space station over the Mun, with the intent on doing quick trips back and forth and transmit the last scraps of research points I hadn\u0027t collected.

But there is a way to make the transmission boost helpful. The key fact the module description \u003Cstrong\u003Edoesn\u0027t\u003C/strong\u003E tell you is that it only boosts transmission efficiency by 50%. For a surface sample, which normally has a transmission efficiency of 25%, that would go up to 37.5%. If you\u0027ve already gotten more research out of it then that, then you can\u0027t transmit the sample, whether or not you have the lab.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most efficient use I\u0027ve found for the lab module is to do an experiment/sample, use the transmission boost, then transmit it. Then repeat until even the boosted transmission is worthless, then save the data for carrying home. This strategy, though tedious, will give you the most science points overall because you\u0027ve maximized the number of science points you had before you brought a full sample back with you. It still won\u0027t completely fill the experiment potential, but it should get close enough that grabbing the remaining 0.1 science points isn\u0027t really worth the effort.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
