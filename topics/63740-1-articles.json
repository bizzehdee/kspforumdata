Now, though, when doing it live, we have a glitch. This is after we have ditched all of the side small fuel tanks, too. We\u0027ve gone through about 4 stages to get to the point where we are here. We fire the stage and the focus SHIFTS to the dead booster. And it only kicks off ONE booster, not both. The main craft is now out of control with a dead booster still attached, and we are controlling a dead booster falling to the ground. By the time we shift focus back to the main craft, it is out of control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to edit the save file or the persist file or something to fix this somehow?

Not sure how that problem would even arise let alone how to fix it. My best suggestion would be take that stage and split it in two. Stage off the booster that is not disconecting first, then the glitchy one and then swap back to the main craft if it still swaps focus. not a perfect solution but at least your craft will spend only a moment off ballanced and should be balanced for the moment your out of controll and hopefuly wont end up in an unrecoverable spin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mellojoe","CreatedById":69154,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-20T12:15:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBump. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking of trying to launch a new ship from Kerbin and then maybe copy the craft file and paste it over the one on Eve.
