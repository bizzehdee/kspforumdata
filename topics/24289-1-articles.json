Something that drives like a rover and then takes off and fly. The challenge comes from the fact that these rover wheels are somewhat delicate, they break under too much speed and hard impacts, so I\u0027m sharing my two solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe simplest one consists of using both rover wheels and landing gear. When the landing gears are up the rover wheels touch the ground and vice versa, so it\u0027s very easy to switch from car to plane, but you need a runway to take off and land. Here\u0027s a video:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/HDFTM9yNClI?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was fun \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Quite useless though. It would be nice to not need the runway, so we could use it to find anomalies around kerbin. So that\u0027s my second design\u0027s objective! this vehicle has no landing gear, it takes off vertically with a toroidal engine beneath it, which also works for landing, there\u0027s also a couple of small rockets on the front for breaking. For the exploration purpose, I also made it with more fuel and turbo jet engines. I realized however that landing doesn\u0027t have to be vertical, you can get the horizontal speed low enough and use the toroidal engine to ease the touchdown, the rover wheels can take it. It\u0027s tricky to fly this thing, I set up 5 action groups for different stages of flight to help me out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the video below I illustrate the purpose by setting out to \u0022investigate\u0022 some debris near the space center. Everything worked perfectly! except for the very ending, when I did something stupid but completely unrelated to my design. I had already landed and was working as a rover, then I underestimated my speed and the runway slope, breaking the front wheels... doh\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/wibwcGql5II?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can upload the craft files if anyone\u0027s interested. Even though one of the designs has a mechjeb it can fly well without it. I use it in the video only for the kill rot feature, which makes it easier to take off, but it\u0027s also useful if you\u0027re making a long trip to somewhere, as these can cake up to an hour because we are unable to time-warp.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ori41","CreatedById":61269,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-27T07:42:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea of these are awesome, may I ask, do the wheels use Nuclear generators?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diegzumillo","CreatedById":4869,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-27T17:29:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust a handful of solar panels and batteries \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
