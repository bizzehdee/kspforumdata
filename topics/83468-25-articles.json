I\u0027m trying to transfer rocketparts (which RoverDude says are transferrable from the ship on the left to the one on the right, but it\u0027s not happening, and neither is the fuel. I\u0027m using FTT and MKS, and using RoverDudes version of the KAS pipes.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to fly in a supply drone with some KAS parts to see if I can get it with those.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Um, I tried to move the ship closer and ended up accidentially hopping right over it instead because it wasn\u0027t close enough. heh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit2: The pipes aren\u0027t working either.

They don\u0027t seem to be KAS pipes. However, I can\u0027t see them functioning much differently and your camera DOES seem to be targeting it as if it\u0027s the center of mass (Did you do any camera shenanegans to get it to center or was that where it was?) Hooking 2 craft together with pipes in KAS docks those 2 craft together, making a single craft. As far as the game is concerned you\u0027re not transferring between 2 ships, but 2 tanks in the same ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing I can think is, can you transfer resources between the canisters in the individual ships? If so, then those pipes are NOT docking your ships like KAS pipes would. If not, then either bug or you didn\u0027t buy the building upgrade at the KSC that allows you to resource transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
