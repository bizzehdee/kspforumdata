When you place your RCS thrusters in the VAB you should turn on the center of mass indicator and place a ring of them in line with the COM. I like to use 4 way symmetry. 4 thrusters with 4 way control will allow you to translate in any direction and by placing them in line with the COM you don\u0027t get rotation when you translate. Normally your pods torque handles rotation. Do the balancing only on the stage that will be docking. Any boosters or transfer stages should be disconnected. Don\u0027t forget an RCS fuel tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027re in orbit and close, when you\u0027re in docking mode the spacebar switches between rotate and translate.

They\u0027re your positive and negative relative velocity. What direction you\u0027re moving in relation to the other ship. If the yellow Rvel \u002B marker is on the pink target marker you\u0027re going right at the other ship. You can adjust you\u0027re course to place this marker over the other ship by using wsad and Shift/CTRL just like the EVA pack. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo prevent apparent control reversal you can use the chase camera or place a marker on your ship during construction and roll the ship so the top points to the top of the screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERather than trying to select a docking port at long range, I just drift till my closest approach and kill all of my relative velocity.

From that point, it\u0027s just a matter of staring at your instruments and reacting to them as needed until you dock. There are essentially 3 phases to get from a close rendezvous to docking:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003ERotate (pitch and yaw) the moving ship so it\u0027s parallel to the target, and also rolled as desired so it will be at the desired angle to the target once docked (so hatches are in line, protruding parts don\u0027t collide, etc.)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWhile keeping the moving ship parallel to the target, move it using translation until its axis lines up with the axis of the target ship.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWhile keeping the moving ship parallel and aligned to the target, translate forward (slowly) until the docking ports touch and voila!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs others have mentioned, you have to have RCS thrusters (and their fuel) to do the translating in step 2. Step 1 can be done with torque alone and if you\u0027re VERY careful, step 3 can be done with the main engines. If you\u0027re good, patient, and lucky, you can do the whole thing without RCS, but it\u0027s a lot easier if you have RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, RCS is mostly for translating. But if you don\u0027t put your RCS thrusters in the correct place, then their off-center thrust will cause your ship to rotate, screwing up what you accomplished in step 1 and making the whole process more difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are essentially 2 ways to place RCS thrusters. One is to use thrusters on each end of the ship, centered on the CoM, so their asymmetrical thrusts cancel out. The advantage here is you have 2 thrusters in each direction so you have more control authority. The other method is to use 1 set of thrusters placed directly on the CoM. No asymmetrical thrust, but less control authority.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, you don\u0027t want mods, but seriously, KSP has an utterly appalling and unrealistic lack of even basic in-game instrumentation. So I recommend the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/rcs-build-aid-v0-2/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERCS Build Aid mod\u003C/a\u003E, which will let you put your RCS thrusters in the perfect positions so you get pure translation out of them, no unwanted rotation. This mod adds no parts, it just makes the CoM marker in the VAB more useful. It\u0027s still up to you to fly the ship using stock parts, but you can be assured that it will fly as you want it to without a lot of aggravating trial-and-error.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother purely instrumentation mod you might consider is \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/dock-align-indicator/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENavy Fish\u0027s Docking Port Alignment Indicator\u003C/a\u003E.

I guess the question here is just something I will have to try but if I\u0027m in a docking phase, how do I keep track of fuel reserves that are coming from 2 different reserves of fuel?\u003Cp\u003EThanks again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you use more than a few units of RCS to dock, your ship is too wobbly. Take for a small lander about 80 (two of the little spherical balls), for a larger vessel I stick four of the bigger RCS cans on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you\u0027re not using the Steam version of the game, F1 for screenshot.

How am I accomplishing that if I only have my main engine? What is yawing my ship?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 - As a follow-on to question 2, once I have thrusters I will be able to use IJKL for translation and for and aft burns. That makes sense. So far the only way I have been able to slow down and not ram my target is to rotate my entire ship 180\u0060. I guess the question here is just something I will have to try but if I\u0027m in a docking phase, how do I keep track of fuel reserves that are coming from 2 different reserves of fuel?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. RCS thrusters use monopropellant. Since 0.23, all capsules contain a small amount of this but you\u0027ll probably want/need some more. Mono tanks come in inline forms and in external spherical and oblong shapes. Usually, 4x of the spherical tanks will do you from launching a mondo lifter to getting home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. A and D are yaw, W and S are pitch, Q and E are roll. That\u0027s for rotation. For translation (this is NOT in docking mode, which I know nothing about and never use), J and L are left-right, I and K and up and down, and H and N are forwards and backwards. Without RCS, you have no IJKL functions, only WASD rotations and forwards. You can also go backwards by rotating the entire ship 180^ and running the main engine, which makes you accelerate backwards. Of course, you can\u0027t do this too close to the target ship or your exhaust will damage it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Click on the Resources tab in the upper right corner to see how much of everything you have available and how fast you\u0027re using each resource. But in general, you\u0027ll approach the target and rotate backwards to it to stop nearby. So if your ship has main engines on 1 end and a docking port on the other, using the main engines to stop near the target will leave your engines pointing at the target and the docking port away from it. Thus, once you stop, the 1st thing you have to do is rotate 180^ so the docking port faces the target. After that, use RCS translation to get get lined up, then forward slowly to dock.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
