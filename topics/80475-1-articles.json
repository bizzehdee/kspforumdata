Fuel lines are very useful for aircraft; by arranging them carefully, you can make the tanks drain in the order you want them to (engines drain the \u0022furthest\u0022 tank first, and you can manipulate this by chaining your tanks into the order you want them to drain). You can use this to keep the plane balanced regardless of the fuel load if you do it right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) See (1). The other trick is to try and keep your fuel tanks clustered about the CoM as tightly as possible. Avoid putting tanks near the nose of the plane. Ideally, you want to keep CoM steady, but if it has to shift you\u0027re usually better off letting it go forwards rather than backwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) A well done heavy lift spaceplane can toss more than its own weight into orbit; for the big ones, this can be over 100 ton. But it\u0027s not an easy thing to design. Get the basics down before you try to summit Everest. Also, as mentioned above, it\u0027s not just a matter of strapping a load on the back; you need to keep the plane balanced. Having the CoM above the CoL is almost as bad as having it behind CoL. Either of these will make the plane handle very poorly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) No, there is no stock cargo bay. However, there are an assortment of mod packs that include them, and if you\u0027re creative then it isn\u0027t too hard to construct one from stock parts.

If you look around in the Spacecraft Exchange you\u0027ll find assorted examples of people constructing sealed bays from structural panels and wing pieces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Yup, all cool.

In fact, I\u0027ll go so far as to only use odd numbers of fuel tanks, and then put a fuel line that drains from the middle one (at the CoM). In this configuration fuel will draw evenly from the front and rear into the middle. I then also usually mount the engines on the wings, not at the back, because it\u0027s easier to pipe fuel from the central tank to the engines when the engines are also near the centre.
