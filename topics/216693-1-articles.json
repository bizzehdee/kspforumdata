Does it really have to be that hard\u00A0 bouncing? I spent about an hour assembling a vehicle . I had all the struts on and was ready to fly. When the game play starts it bounces it so hard it falls apart and blows up. It continues to bounce regardless if the brakes are off or on. I\u0027ve tried it several times including a reboot of my pc. I know it\u0027s early release but I used to be able to fly now I can\u0027t. It just bounces everything apart.\u00A0 Any ideas would be appreciated.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-19T15:51:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to KSP2 gameplay questions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Heretic391","CreatedById":66101,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-20T13:53:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHad the same issue. Temp fix is to use the stability enhancer and ensure that your craft is sitting on the bottom of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E (wheels just touching the bottom).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, try changing the dampener settings in the landing gears to full. You can reduce spring strength too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kellerlk4","CreatedById":225332,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-21T02:15:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr4g0nb4n3","CreatedById":228008,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-04T04:29:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile it is definitely annoying, I like to think of it as an initial stress-test.\u00A0 If your ship can\u0027t survive the bounce test, chances are it won\u0027t hold up for the duration of a mission either.\u00A0 Better to find the flaws early than to have all of Kerbalkind watching your heroic mission live and be witness to your landing legs falling off at the last moment, dooming all 5 on board.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
