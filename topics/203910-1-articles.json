I think it would be cool to have a planet pack for KSP 1 with KSP 2 celestial bodies. The planets and moons in the pack obviously wouldn\u0027t be exact replicas, and proper credit would be given to Private Division and Take Two.\u00A0 Aside from super realistic terrain and volumetric rings, making KSP 2 planets in KSP 1 is entirely feasible (Rask and Rusk can orbit\u00A0a barycenter).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny thoughts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-07-19T13:52:44Z\u0022 title=\u002207/19/2021 01:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 19, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by wpetula\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
