The only thing I can use the mouse for in map mode during a flight is to control the camera. There also doesn\u0027t seem to be any way to change the inputs for these things. Does anyone have any insight on how to make flight adjustments?\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022GmoqSpG.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/GmoqSpG.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-16T16:25:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this a career game and have you unlocked the tier 2\u002B tracking station?\u00A0\u00A0 That is required for maneuver node editing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
