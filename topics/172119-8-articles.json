myself.\u00A0 i dont really do mods anymore, but if it ever becomes an issue to do mods, well we can always go somewhere beyond the forums like reddit or whatever to post mods and distribute em.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for privacy, good luck getting anything past my firewall without explicit permission which im not going to give any singleplayer game (only exception was back in DPM days, but that mod sorta died off so ive blocked KSP and havent ever let anything through my firewall).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, all that aside, if it really comes down to it, i still have like 3 backups of KSP 1.3.1 on various hard drives, and noones gonna stop me from playing something ive legally bought EULA or not (worst case i just wont get the recent updates)...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Benjamin
