Just build a rocket in the first version of KSP and try to get as high as you can. This is based upon the very first concept of HarvestR for KSP, where it was a 2D flash game where you just get as high or fast as possible, (and for the purposes of this challenge, the lowest version number, so 0.7.3 is cooler than 0.8 or 0.11).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEXTRA CHALLENGE: Get to Orbit! It took a while in the old version for people to figure out that since Kearth (old name for Kerbin) is a sphere, you could orbit it. Of course, it\u0027s hard as there was no map screen at all. Keep in mind also that there is no fuel crossfeed between tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1iwxro/since_theres_apparently_interest_heres_073_for/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDOWNLOAD 0.7.3\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy highest was 111091 m.
