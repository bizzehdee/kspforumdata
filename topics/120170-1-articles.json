The groups are right, it\u0027s just some of the commands don\u0027t fire. The main engine does not shut down, the solids do not decouple and the sep motors to push them away do not fire. The escape tower and decoupling on the pod do work however. So it\u0027s only some of the commands that don\u0027t work. How would I go about generating logs for this? Launch a ship, fire the abort command and then land and end the mission?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
