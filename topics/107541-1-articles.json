No loading screens to be seen. More information below.\n\n***Screenshots***: [http://imgur.com/a/os6Dg#0](http://imgur.com/a/os6Dg#0) They\u0027re kind of bad, but what do expect? Pictured: The not responding box, 2nd is the black screen.\n\n***Saves/.craft files***: N/A\n\n***Reproduction steps***: Start up the game. Notice that your cursor is making the Blue Circle of Loading. Click on the empty space and watch your desktop turn black with the Circle still on screen. Click again, and watch as the darkness turn white, Circle still visible. Click again a few more times as a window pops up saying that KSP.exe is not responding.

If it means anything, there isn\u0027t anything that could be wrong with it to be malicious to KSP, and it\u0027s fully updated.
