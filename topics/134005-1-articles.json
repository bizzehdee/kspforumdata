We haven\u0027t really gotten much solid consensus. In the near-term,\u00A0it just doesn\u0027t seem like there is any slam-dunk reason to live on Mars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy not look a little closer to home? Let\u0027s\u00A0suppose, for the sake of argument, that some entity was willing to build a space station in orbit for long-term habitation. What, other than space tourism,\u00A0would cause people to move there?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a basic economics level, people will endure a higher cost of living if the income they can receive is correspondingly greater. Living on a space station in orbit would be the extreme example. The cost of living is very, very high...to grossly understate...but if there was a way to generate correspondingly greater income, people would live there.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe trouble is finding a lucrative income source in space that is not available on Earth, while also requiring you to actually be physically in space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe current\u00A0jobs in in space come from NASA and other government-sponsored\u00A0space agencies. That is mostly scientific research. While important, it doesn\u0027t serve as an immediate stream of revenue and so it probably doesn\u0027t fit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could imagine other types of research that would be more lucrative. I\u0027m sure there \u00A0experiments which could only be conducted in microgravity, yet would result a lot of profit for companies here on Earth. Another opportunity would be zero g manufacturing and assembly. I don\u0027t know whether that market is big enough, or if there are aspects that would require human presence.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen there are more interesting possibilities. It might seem like a lot of trouble to set up a tax haven in space, but there may be certain business models (investment banking, stock option manipulation, encryption services, gambling servers, streaming servers, etc.) which would benefit tremendously if they could be conducted away from government oversight or control. The same goes for manufacturing of restricted substances.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, there\u0027s space jockey stuff -- going to repair satellites in orbit, assembling satellites, and so forth.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny other ideas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-12T02:16:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that the biggest monkey wrench here is that our automation and AI technology is improving much faster than our space-launch technology is.\u00A0 Which means that the longer we wait, the less reason there is to send humans up there, especially if it\u0027s in near-Earth orbit so that you have realtime links to humans on the ground.\u00A0 It\u0027s \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eenormously\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E cheaper to do things with machines, so the only reason to send a human is if there\u0027s something a machine can\u0027t do.\u00A0 And the category of \u0022things machines can\u0027t do\u0022 is shrinking rapidly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wish that weren\u0027t the case, \u0027coz I would \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elove\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E for there to be a reason to send people up there.\u00A0 But I have trouble seeing it happening.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout the only way that I could see something like this going on would be if we could drastically reduce the cost of getting humans to space-- far enough that there doesn\u0027t have to be such an overwhelming industrial-economic reason to do so (i.e. cheap enough that people could live there just because they want to).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-12T02:50:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cost of living is really going to be prohibitive unless there is some compelling need to be there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAutomation really does eliminate almost all reasons for working in space.

Even IF the effect to people on the planet is marginal. I Think even automation will benefit greatly from having human controllers relatively nearby, at least the safety of a ship or station. I imagine this would only be more practical around another planet. I think the most and possibly only reason you might get people to live in space is mining.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs you said though the infrastructure probably needs to get substantially cheaper before that becomes truly realistic.
