At any rate I started researching, and reading, and was very interested, by apprehensive. Then I learned of the Demo. I have put some hours into it, and had some fun. Have landed on the mun a few times, and left some Kerbals stranded... Tried to rescue them, but to no avail. At any rate I plan to pick up the full version in the next few days (wife asked me to wait a few more days), and am pretty stoked. I have been lurking here, and am impressed with many of the vehicles people have created, and being a gear head, especially love the rovers/cars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have read that I should play the game for awhile mod free, or with just a few mods that make life a little easier, and the game a little better. I read that their are some visual mods, and some sound mods that, but I don\u0027t know which ones. Also not sure about versions etc. Anything else you suggest? I really don\u0027t want to change the game itself much if I get mods at all for now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monsterlunch","CreatedById":135085,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-12T12:57:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should definitely try the Chatterer Mod!

I have been watching Scott Manley for a few days off and on. I am on episode 9 of the beginners guide. Good series, and it has helped understand how the manuever nodes and such work better than the tutorial did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I just now tried to rescue poor Bill. He has been on the Mun for some time now. I built a pretty large rocket with the few parts I have available in the demo. Got to the Mun with enough fuel to get Bill in the second pod, and come back. Buuuuut When I landed on the Mun it tipped over, and when it hit the top pod fell off. Now Lenster and Bill are stuck on the moon. I had it save before I made my decent, but I can\u0027t seem to get that to load now that it autosaved when I landed.... Guess it\u0027s back to the drawing board.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
