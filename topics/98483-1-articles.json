But FAR has optional settings for the latter two and you can just keep the window closed too. Someone has a signature quoting Ferram saying basically that NEAR is FAR without looking like FAR/the graphs and people just think it is the easier one.

Which may or may not be halfway or 3/4 of the way behind the CoM. (I try to build planes as balanced as possible). In reality, as long as its behind its not that big of a deal. Your CoL shifts about with speed and what not\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for your second question, a mod called RCSBuildAid will show you how your CoM moves when tanks are dry. Or you can manually right click on all the tanks and drain them of fuel to see where you CoM ends up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rizzee\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rizzee\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI figured out the problem. A mix of being a bad pilot and not viewing the graphs while the craft was in the horizontal position(my launch position is vertical due to not being able to actually use the runway without aircraft gear) I was planning to say that I\u0027d actually already done what people had advise which was read guides and watch videos, but the problem I appeared to experiencing(last night) was that I couldn\u0027t build a stable flyable aircraft with very early parts. I was able to build stuff in sandbox where I have access to all the parts in the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways the issue seems to mostly be coming from the actual launch and not the stability of the craft itself as I\u0027ve actually managed to get to successfully glide, pretty well actually ableit only for a short distance. But it\u0027s progress. God FAR is much harder than the stock system for planes. \u003Cimg src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/smilies/k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022k_tongue.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those intrigued, this is a image of the glider. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/47XZKD1.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/47XZKD1.jpg\u003C/a\u003E Pretty simple build, but like I said, it\u0027s very early career.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGlad you got things working somewhat. It can be hard to vertically launch a plane sometimes as you generally have to travel through some unstable attitudes before you are in stable flight again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may help if your glider had a bit more wingspan on it by the looks of it.
