The whole sea? The hemisphere? (Ok, I exaggerate a bit.) What you need is a flying car! Using MechJeb surface mode, you can bump along at 50-100 m/s or more, depending on the terrain. A good bump puts you in the sky, but that\\\u0027s ok because you\\\u0027ll stay level and land safely-ish! Just put the back wheels down first. Coming down too fast? A burst of RCS fixes that. Rough terrain or impatience ahead? Get a running start, jump off a bump, and fly over it!

The unbalance is minor enough that McJeb doesn\\\u0027t seem to mind.
