A working patcher would significantly reduce the amount of data needed to download each new version, as you only have to download any data thats different from the current version, and would increase the speed at which we are able to download any updates (less data means less server time means more people can access the server over any length of time). Plus a working patcher could automatically check for new versions of KSP and inform the player when they become available, this would make silent patches like the 1.0.5.1028 easer to release and download.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-06T05:56:46Z\u0022 title=\u002203/06/2016 05:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CaLVin-K\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
