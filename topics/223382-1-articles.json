Not an huge deal as you can still burn and its done then trajectory overlap the prediction. I often just delete the burn and adjust.\u003Cbr\u003E\n1 is sometimes you can not create nodes as the create node disappears then you try to click create node. If hard to fix just create one, you can warp to an 0 d/v node after all. Even set it up in alarm clock mod, this is how I mark about to reenter in alarm clock.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-02-02T17:57:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost annoying?
