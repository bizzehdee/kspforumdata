A level 1 pilot or OKTO can handle it on SAS and you don\u0027t have to touch anything until you are above the atmosphere. When the ship is on the pad, turn on SAS. This locks your rocket into staying vertical. Launch at full power. Watch your Ap marker go up and up until it\u0027s about 130 km or so (you will still be in the atmosphere at this point). Turn off your engine. Wait until your altimiter reads 60km. Turn off SAS, and hit D to rotate your ship. When your ship is pointing at the horizon, stop the rotation and lock it in with SAS again. Go to full thrust. Keep on thrusting until you are in orbit. (Your SAS will gradually climb above the horizon, and for extra points you can tap it back down occasionally to be on the horizon again.) \u00A0You will need a velocity of just under 2300 m/s to be in orbit.\u00A0You\u0027ll make it every single time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-08T09:31:35Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2016 09:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-08T09:34:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222568364\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022139284\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462688179\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022163806\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mpace1217\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, mpace1217 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthen follow the prograde till orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s probably the problem.

When your booster\u00A0stage burn of, you should be on very flat trajectory, wait until about 50s from apoapsis with circularization burn. Your prograde marker should be almost at horizon at that point. If not, you are going up too steep. You can try to cut off booster stage as soon as your AP hits outer space \u00A0(70km) and reignite it higher up to flatten your trajectory to give terrier more working time.
