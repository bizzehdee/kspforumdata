Especially with the asteroids. Larger asteroids are so big they just sorta appear right in front of you. As a suggestion, I think you should make visual models load at least 10 km away and then have physics load at 2.5. Or as an alternative solution I think you should add a setting where you can change the visual and physical load distances (independently) in vanilla KSP. I personally like watching stuff come in from really far away, and to have stuff like asteroids, which would look cool to slowly get closer, to just pop into existence right in front of you really ruins the mood.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Paperback Writer\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NERVAfan","CreatedById":72817,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-05T05:46:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Paperback Writer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Paperback Writer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E Or as an alternative solution I think you should add a setting where you can change the visual and physical load distances (independently) in vanilla KSP. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like this idea (don\u0027t know how hard it would be to implement though).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptRobau","CreatedById":41695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-05T09:40:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/69907-0-23-Distant-Object-Enhancement-v1-3-Planets-satellites-in-the-night-sky%21-%283-3%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/69907-0-23-Distant-Object-Enhancement-v1-3-Planets-satellites-in-the-night-sky%21-%283-3%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mod increases the visual distance (not physical) to 750km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/69907-0-23-Distant-Object-Enhancement-v1-3-Planets-satellites-in-the-night-sky%21-%283-3%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/69907-0-23-Distant-Object-Enhancement-v1-3-Planets-satellites-in-the-night-sky%21-%283-3%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mod increases the visual distance (not physical) to 750km, so it\u0027s definitely possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leax256","CreatedById":57364,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-05T14:20:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only problem I could see is with slower GPU\u0027s, namely intergraded, the increased rendering could slow things down if there are a lot of things around.
