After launching if im in orbit on other side of the Cape where I launched from, I will lose my signal. The game fails to give me the ground station tracking around the globe. I have to jump out and into the Tracking station and toggle the Australia site for example. then go back in my craft to get the signal. I know this is a conflict with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E and/or KCS switcher. Is this by design? Whats my workaround here?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
