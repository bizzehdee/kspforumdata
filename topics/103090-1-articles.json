The video is obviously from communist China. The style, the red stars, everything breathes communism from a bygone era. Leaving the *communist* bit out would mean it could also be a modern China video, or ancient China, or anything in between. Leaving it out would actually be a different presentation.\n\nBesides, being called a communist is not an insult. I know that was one of the most horrible things to be called for a long time in the US, but in a lot of the rest of the world its just a political affiliation, not necessarily synonymous to horrible things."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T02:12:00Z","Content":"Sorry folks, this conversation is entirely too political already, and we don\u0027t see it getting any less so.
