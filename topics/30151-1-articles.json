I can\u0027t seem to get them to work in a satisfactory manner. Should I use a large amount of batteries for energy storage and a single PB-NUK to perform my maneuvers or should I attempt to power them the entire time using solar panels? I\u0027ve tested both concepts using small probes and can\u0027t decide which method is better for a manned vessel that is being sent on an interplanetary mission. Not being able to fire your engines on the dark side of a planet is unacceptable because that may be needed to transfer between planets. At the same time being unable to achieve the required delta V due to low charge is also unacceptable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tavert","CreatedById":57383,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T02:30:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe solar panels have a much better power-to-weight ratio, but require careful planning of your maneuvers to not be on the dark side of any planets/moons.

But while you\u0027re orbiting, you are at the mercy of the planet\u0027s umbra.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven that ion engines are extremely hungry for power, you\u0027ll want to have all of the above. Solar panels, huge stacks of batteries, and reactors. Ion engines are for burning for LONG periods of time with low output, so you\u0027ll probably want to make a girder structure for the body, add a lot of engines and xenon, and cover everything with solar panels. You can hide the reactors inside the girders, too, if you\u0027re interested in it looking good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll be spending a lot of time looping around Kerbin and burning at the periapsis, but once you\u0027ve escaped, you\u0027ll be good to go whereever.

Using my current designs I can achieve 300m/s of delta V per battery charge on my current probes which carry a single PB-NUK, however I\u0027m not sure how well this will scale up to a manned craft.

I put some batteries on ion probes, but just enough to give me a little leeway for times when I\u0027m behind a planet or a I can\u0027t orient the solar panels in the right direction. They burn through energy so fast that batteries would almost never be an effective way to power them. You just have to be careful with timing your maneuvers and it will take many short burns to build up enough velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy ion engine landers thread has lots of different examples of the types of crafts that work well. They can\u0027t be used long in the shadow of a planet or moon, but through careful timing that was never really an issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
