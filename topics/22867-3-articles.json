A person on Europa\u0027s surface would receive 540 rem (5.4 Sieverts) per day, which is higher than the fatal dose. Sure, Chernobyl\u0027s core is higher than that (up to 300 Sieverts per hour, if you\u0027re right in the very center), but it\u0027s still more than high enough to kill cells quickly. Europa\u0027s rate is comparable to that in the various buildings in the Chernobyl complex, and Laythe would be comparable. Just because it\u0027s a bit less fatal doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s the Garden of Eden.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust because a fungus can survive in radiation doesn\u0027t mean anything more evolved could. There\u0027s just no such thing as an immunity to ionizing radiation (any photon of wavelength less than 911 Angstroms will ionize any elements it encounters, to say nothing of cosmic rays or other high-energy particles, so there simply can\u0027t be a chemical that can safely absorb those); a fungus doesn\u0027t really CARE if a cell mutates, because no one cell depends on any other cell to survive. The fungi in Chernobyl aren\u0027t immune to the radiation; they feed off it, and use that energy to reproduce, but it\u0027ll still kill them. If any individual cells are killed by radiation, the fungus as a whole doesn\u0027t suffer from it as long as it can create new cells faster than it loses them. That\u0027s not true of animals or plants, though; if cells start mutating (especially nerve cells) they can\u0027t always be replaced, and they can easily become cancerous. So even if fungi could live on Laythe, that doesn\u0027t in any way make it possible for higher organisms to survive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here\u0027s the thing about evolution: as a wise man once said, evolution is a movement AWAY from something, not TOWARDS something. Creatures don\u0027t evolve to fill a need, they evolve randomly and there\u0027s a small chance they\u0027ll evolve in such a way to better survive. But it\u0027s just as likely (actually, far more likely) to go the other direction, and mutate in a way that makes the creature even less able to survive. Now, why do I bring this up? Those fungi in Chernobyl are mutations of an existing creature. They mutated from a fungus that, like most others on this planet, couldn\u0027t feed off radiation. hat fungus lived in that area for millions of years, and some spores of that species eventually made their way inside the reactor. Even if every single copy inside the reactor died (and they would), more spores would be continually arriving from the outside to keep trying until eventually, a version mutated that could take advantage of the radiation somehow. It might take thousands or millions of generations before this happened, but given enough time, it would happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut for life to evolve on a moon like this, it\u0027d have to have BEGAN with that ability, because otherwise the first generation of life would be wiped out by the radiation, and it\u0027d never have a chance to evolve into something more durable. Somewhere, the first organism would have been born... and then probably died from the radiation long before it could reproduce. There\u0027s really just no safe place to start from, other than the bottoms of the oceans (which\u0027d mask most of the incoming radiation, which actually works against you a bit since it reduces the chance of mutating into a more durable version). This is why most astronomers just aren\u0027t optimistic about finding life on other planets; it\u0027s possible in theory, but too many things need to go right for us to find it in the first few places we look.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZingidyZongxxx","CreatedById":58363,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T06:01:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022allmappedout\u0022 data-cite=\u0022allmappedout\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.lsbu.ac.uk/water/phase.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.lsbu.ac.uk/water/phase.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHigher pressure causes water to stay liquid even beyond its normal boiling point.
