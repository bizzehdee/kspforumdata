They have a relatively low density, and have decently high ore. They range from dark grey to dark brown in color.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nE-type: These are dull purple/pink objects found very rarely around Eve.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nG-type: C-type asteroids with lighter color, lower density, and more ice. These are higher in Ore content and they are much less dense. They are somewhat rare, but they make up the bulk of the Dresteroid Belt. They range from light grey to medium-grey in color.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nS-type: These are lighter, browner asteroids similar in color and composition to Gilly, These are stony in composition, and contain some ices and ore. They are quite common around the near Kerbin belt, and make up a significant portion of the Main Asteroid Belt. They can occasionally be seen orbiting Eve or Duna as captured asteroids (very rarely). They range from dark brown to dull red in color.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nM-type:\u00A0These are shiny, metallic asteroids. They are incredibly dense, hold little to no water or ore, and can be recovered on Kerbin for quite a large sum of money. They are found in the main belt, but also appear\u00A0in the Vulcanoid asteroid belt below Moho. They are shiny grey in color.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nComet: These are mostly icy, with some organic compounds. These are the leftovers from the solar system\u0027s formation, and have a high science value. They appear on inclined, eccentric, and high orbits around the sun. They range from dark grey to grey in color, and have comet tails. They also tend to be much larger.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMinmoids: These are very rare, near-Kerbin-objects which share a similar composition with Minmus. (But, like, not pudding or ice cream)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMystery-type: These strange objects appear only in 90 or 270 degree inclined orbits around Ike. They are very rare, and very valuable. Just, you know, don\u0027t taunt it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIcy-Type: These objects are icy with some silicates and organic compounds. They range from dark brown to yellow-orange in color, and can be found orbiting Jool very far out, or orbiting near Jool or Eeloo.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003EStructure Types\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nRubble Pile: Objects held together very loosely, with a very low impact tolerance. They are very low density, and are the easiest to transport. (as long as gee-forces are kept in check)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSolid: Objects which are decently well packed together.

Almost exclusively M-type metallic asteroids.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNear-Eve Belt: A very sparsely packed belt of objects near Eve. Primarily contains the Gilly-like S-type asteroids and the purplish\u00A0E-type asteroids.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEve Orbit: Very very very rarely, an S-type asteroid might show up orbiting Eve as a sort of mini-Gilly.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNear-Kerbin Belt: A decently packed region of objects similar to Gilly and Minmus, as well as plenty of stones and carbonaceous iceballs.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDuna Orbit: Very very very rarely, an S-type, C-type, or G-type asteroid might show up orbiting Duna, very rarely.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMagic Boulder: Polar orbits around Ike, from 12-25km, where Magic Boulders can spawn.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMain Belt: A large region of space with asteroids of many types, ranging from near the orbit of Duna to near the orbit of Jool.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDresteroids: a belt of G-type asteroids orbiting Dres, with similar composition to Dres itself.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNear-Jool-Belt: Objects orbiting the sun\u00A0near Jool that are made of similar stuff to Jool\u0027s moons.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIrregular Jool Satellites: Objects in distant orbits around Jool itself.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTransjoolean Objects: Objects with orbits in resonance with Jool\u0027s orbit, composed of similar stuff as Eeloo and Jool\u0027s moons.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nComets: Objects in distant, inclined, high orbits around the Sun.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Matuchkin","CreatedById":135127,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-24T02:41:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, I believe we should have rocks that are kilometres across, and have a sphere of influence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-24T13:21:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222644862\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022142352\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221466736109\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022135127\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Matuchkin\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, Matuchkin said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, I believe we should have rocks that are kilometres across, and have a sphere of influence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile procedurally generated asteroids using PQS and the celestial body system\u00A0would be quite cool, it would also be very difficult to implement, as KSP wouldhave to export the scaledspace model and textures each time new asteroids were found. There\u0027s probably a workaround, or instance, maybe you generate the asteroid model not with PQS, but as a huge conventional model (just like asteroids already) and you center them on an empty celestial body with no terrain. For ScaledSpace, the planet could just re-use a small-scale version of that model. Or you could just have the game generate low-definition scaledspace maps of an asteroid that does have PQS, and wait a while whenever the textures need to be generated. 64x32\u00A0textures for a 5km object would be reasonable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-24T13:21:21Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2016 01:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
