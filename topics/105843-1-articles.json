Above around 10km (sea level) Mach effects turn into re-entry effects. So long as parts aren\u0027t actually exploding due to heating you are fine.\n\nIf it is bothering you try throttling back slightly, as you may be over-thrusting. It isn\u0027t a huge problem, but does make your ascent less efficient due to drag losses (ideally your craft travels at exactly terminal velocity while in atmosphere, though in practice such precision isn\u0027t at all necessary for most KSP rockets)."},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T00:54:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Mach effects are OK, not sure about reentry effects.\n\nIn my experience on default settings reentry effects during launch mean you\u0027re getting dangerously close to exploding.
