The de-orbit of the first of two missions was disastrous, though I\u0027m certain what happened there was a noted bug occurring between B9 Procedural Wings and FAR (I\u0027m still in 1.0.2 just yet) where FAR throws daggers at B9 and decides its wings suddenly can\u0027t generate any lift whatsoever. The plane went into a steep dive; I had full engine power and was pointed prograde, yet couldn\u0027t pull up. The same thing happened on the third mission on Saturday, and yet I was able to pull that one out without tweaking the plane\u0027s design. I did manage to cook the rudders off the plane on the third mission during re-entry, but I was able to successfully land the plane (sans sufficient yaw authority) on the plains next to the KSC Runway with no other damage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo save fuel during the refuel missions, I went ahead and let the planes orbit as many times as necessary to catch up with New Horizons, which effectively bled off the time remaining for my ongoing Minmus-bound missions. Straight Flush 7 with Berris and her group of tourists arrived first and performed a maneuver to put them sub-orbital around Minmus, fulfilling the itineraries of her passengers. Bill arrived next to begin his rescue mission of the Bad Idea 7e, with Minmusport 7 arriving last; the space station achieved orbit and Straight Flush became its first visiting spacecraft, dropping off Kacella (who\u0027d hitched a ride aboard) to begin running the station\u0027s laboratory. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile Bill began his rescue op - which involved attaching a KAS Connector Port to the outside of the stranded Bad Idea 7e and a winch to the exterior of his own craft. The op was a success, the winch cable connected to the port in docked mode and the tourists were offloaded from 7e (I\u0027ve heard about folks \u0022liquefying\u0022 their Kerbals to pipe them around ground bases...not sure if anybody\u0027s ever pseudo-beamed them over a \u0022fiber-optic\u0022 cable before...). Valentina collected her crew reports and a surface sample before boarding the rescue craft and Bill went ahead and collected his own surface sample, storing it in the hitch-hiker with the tourists. Before launching, Bill went ahead and drained the remaining fuel from the 7e, the cable was unplugged and Bill removed the winch from the outside of his craft. The ship was then sent to rendezvous with Minmusport. There were no docking capabilities with Bill\u0027s craft, so he EVA\u0027d the winch on over and dropped off one of the surface samples for the station\u0027s lab prior to departure. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill\u0027s craft and Straight Flush then departed Minmus for Kerbin, with Straight Flush headed back to New Horizons and Bill heading straight in. Both retreival missions were successful, and the fulfillment of the contracts raked in about \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1500,000; I used the proceeds to hire three new scientists, which I plan to send to Minmusport once I\u0027ve got them trained up a bit. I do need to haul one of the tourists back up to New Horizons from KSC, Valentina\u0027s available for missions again and four tourists have finished out their itineraries and are ready to come back down, so a Condor or Raven flight is on the agenda for this evening.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Esme","CreatedById":107436,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T15:32:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the weekend I indulged in a bit of nostalgia and fired up KSP 0.23.5 hoping to find the game where I built my best Minmus base (using KAS, Kethane and Scansat) to date.

I removed its cargo bay in favour of more fuel, but the Delta still ran out of fuel without getting its apoapse out of the atmosphere. Afterwards, I built a new plane from scratch, and called it the JetAlone. It had only a single cockpit, and an Okto in a service bay just behind, and had a Swivel and two Turboramjets. I don\u0027t have an image of it on hand, but it\u0027s likely to be the plane I develop further until it can actually make orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI put a Suborbital tourist in the cockpit, and went to test the plane out. Things were looking good: I got the apoapse up to 75km, coasted up, and began to burn to circularise... unfortunately, I fell just a tiny bit short of orbit (periapse 65km), and still had a bunch of my jet fuel left. Then, instead of reverting, I switched to the Space Center... and couldn\u0027t remember when my last quicksave was.

Unfortunately, I was about 50km up as I passed the KSC, so I decided to try and turn around. I lost control somewhat over the ocean as I tried to brake enough to turn: the nose kept trying to point retrograde, so I guess my drag was misplaced. Eventually, I was plummeting straight down, and even got to start to fly in the direction of the runway for a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow my next mistake: physics warp. In physics warp x4, the central fuel tank just behind the service bay overheated and exploded, destroying much of the plane. What remained was the service bay with extremely hot probe core and batteries inside, the cockpit with the tourist, a landing gear, a red-glowing Ram intake, and two delta-winglets that were meant to be canards. This was about 15km above the ocean, nowhere near any land. By using the torque of the cockpit, and the lift of the winglets, I managed to make the trajectory a spiral, and slow the impact with the ocean. In the end, I hit the water at a little under 30m/s, losing only the service bay and the winglets. Somehow, what could have been a total disaster turned into a ridiculous recovery, as the tourist lived despite all odds.
