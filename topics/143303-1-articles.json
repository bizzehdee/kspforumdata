Firing the chaff also doesn\u0027t do anything to enemy radars or AMRAAM/PAC-3 missiles, they still hit me no matter when or how much chaff I deploy.

As has been mentioned however, chaff will not work on heat-seeking missiles. If you are trying to evade heat seekers, deploy flares, shut down your engines, and turn away.\u00A0As for evading laser guided things, BDA has a smoke launcher that\u0027ll shoot out a lingering puff of smoke; using the smoke to break line of sight should save you from laser guided things.

I already know this, and why do you sound like you think I don\u0027t know? Anyway, there is no separate chaff effectiveness stat in BDA settings.cfg (there is something for flares and smoke though). Also, flares appear to have a roughly 100 percent chance of deceiving an AIM-9, while even if i quickly\u00A0spam out all chaff in a dispenser, AIM-120 missiles always hit. Apparently, the only way to prevent\u00A0AIM-120 from hitting is destroying the missile while it is still flying towards me (?!), destroying the aircraft launching it before it launches the missile, or breaking radar lock before missile launch. (or get onto\u00A0a glitch that makes some landed vessels visible but not lock-onnable for radar) Also, does anyone know anything about how ECM jammers work in BDArmory?
