That can be a literal programming or scripting language, or it can be more graphical in nature like how they implemented the mission system. But crippling my ways of controlling the craft to just a very limited set of basic actions like \u0027at such time perform maneuver X\u0027 will NOT be even close to enough.

The science is stuff like scansat and telescopes to make the simulation close to reality, allowing you to do things like picking a flat spot to land in (because inaccuracies and limitations of the simulation mean that you can\u0027t safely land on slopes, without risking the probe tipping over.) The better the simulation, the closer to reality, and the less likely your probe will smash into the ground when it thinks is 100 meters above it.

A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E having been updated much of what I said now falls out of place. Just consider that even a signal delay in the order of fractions of a second is highly disconcerting and very annoying while controlling a craft - just ask any gamer playing a frantic action game over networks or on a subpar computer. This would already play within Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E, and would make safe flying beyond that an almost guarantee of disaster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I still think we would require a form of scripting to pre-program sequences of actions we would otherwise perform manually, like such a simple thing as deploying landing legs at the right time.

COMMANDS being literally anything it would tell the craft to do (increase pitch up, increase roll left, increase deploy airbrake, lower throttle, etc), and FEEDBACK being literally anything that changes in the craft state (velocity, attitude, temperature, part deployment, etc). Beyond Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E... this would be desastrous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf however you conceptually place it at the craft as a part of it, then \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E is basically replacing or augmenting your probe core.... effectively a highly sophisticated pre-programmed end-game level probe core.

Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it. 2. Overpowered. A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E having been updated much of what I said now falls out of place. Just consider that even a signal delay in the order of fractions of a second is highly disconcerting and very annoying while controlling a craft - just ask any gamer playing a frantic action game over networks or on a subpar computer. This would already play within Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E, and would make safe flying beyond that an almost guarantee of disaster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I still think we would require a form of scripting to pre-program sequences of actions we would otherwise perform manually, like such a simple thing as deploying landing legs at the right time. At the very least, we\u0027d need to be able to script action group activation and some \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Part Action Window\u0022\u003EPAW\u003C/abbr\u003E interfaces with predetermined time delays, even in the lowest tech level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou would also have to consider carefully where an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E-level AI is conceptually acting from. If it\u0027s meant to replace ground control, which is how I see \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E, it would have to simulate and suffer the full signal delay between every iteration of SEND COMMANDS -(signal delay)-\u0026gt; AWAIT FEEDBACK -(signal delay)-\u0026gt; PROCESS DATA INTO NEW SET OF COMMANDS -\u0026gt; repeat. COMMANDS being literally anything it would tell the craft to do (increase pitch up, increase roll left, increase deploy airbrake, lower throttle, etc), and FEEDBACK being literally anything that changes in the craft state (velocity, attitude, temperature, part deployment, etc). Beyond Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E... this would be desastrous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf however you conceptually place it at the craft as a part of it, then \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E is basically replacing or augmenting your probe core.... effectively a highly sophisticated pre-programmed end-game level probe core. In which case it would need to be subjected to the same stripped down basic start and gradual progression as suggested for the regular probe cores, or only be available at the very last level of the tech tree in its entirety.
