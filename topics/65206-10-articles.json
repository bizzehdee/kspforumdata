I mean, how would the tanks have to look in order to be seen as \u0022stockalike\u0022? Would they for example have to share the paintjob of existing tanks? Spoiler: \u003Cem\u003Ethey do\u003C/em\u003E (look at the FL-T series). The escape tower is a simple and effective design that conveys its nature perfectly without having bells and whisles everywhere, and the paintjob again matches existing parts. The engines and/or engine adapters are barely even visible from the angle they are shown, and cannot be properly assessed unless you see them from below. The interstage adapter is just a cone-shape - what more did people expect? And that\u0027s all the parts that are visible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I look at the screenshots, I see mostly three things: 1.) you could make a really nice pattern with the tanks if you flipped every second one upside down; 2.) I can\u0027t say with certainty if these are in fact 3.75m or more like 4m to 4.25m. I really hope it\u0027s the former, because it\u0027s been a kind of unofficial standard for the next size step up in the modding community; and 3.) this is clearly only loosely inspired by the SLS and not meant as a replica in any way, shape or form. If it was to be a replica, these parts would have to be far larger (at least another step up to 5m). As such, it\u0027s foolish to hang oneself up on the comparison.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really want to see the engines now. To be honest, I expected single engines and not clusters. That\u0027s the one thing that arguably is new and doesn\u0027t have an analogue in other stock parts. But I think it\u0027s a great addition, as I\u0027ve been known to obsessively build engine clusters whenever possible (and sadly, it\u0027s not possible nearly as often as I\u0027d like).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jcraft","CreatedById":42471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-22T18:51:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bomoo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bomoo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELaziest thing I\u0027ve ever seen Squad release.
