It really is that simple. Barring that, why not just edit the code to make it do what your asking? or make a mod for it? It personally does not bother me at all when I shut the UI down. I just shove my pointer off screen for pics like that any way lol. just sayin\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stratzenblitz75","CreatedById":108287,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-12T17:49:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes please!
