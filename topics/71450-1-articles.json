Looked like a huge spider, it worked but it was very unwieldy and required a bit of reaction wheel and RCS spam. It was also difficult to get into orbit, but was reusable so I only had to do it once or twice. I wish I still had screenshots of this but unfortunately they were lost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe easiest way to do it though I think is just use a pair of radial decouplers of some kind to attach two vertical engines, fuel and some landing gear to the side of your rover. Make sure they are close to the center of mass and maybe throw some reaction wheels on them just in case it gets funky coming down. Add some small separators with low thrust to the engines to fire them away from your rover after landing, or just let them fall on it and drive out, on minmus all you need for this is RCS but anything bigger and youll need small engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs sort of a hybrid of the two above you can make a small \u0022platform\u0022 of some kind to secure your rover to, then attach your engines to that. You can make the rover detach from below and fall a few feet to the surface but it makes rocket, transfer stage construction and flying a bit more difficult, or you can drop the platform to the ground by detaching the engines away and driving the rover off of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems most people tend to favor just slapping one or two of them on the side of their lander somewhere and decoupling/undocking it in a way that rights it when it hits the ground though. If you put some kind of system on your rover that gives it self-righting capability then you can pretty much drop it any which way as long as stuff doesn\u0027t get damaged by that. On minmus all you need to right a lander is RCS, but on the Mun or bigger youll need small engines or clever placement of landing gear... or magic ind robotics parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-05T04:47:38Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2014 04:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by RSF77\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lohan2008","CreatedById":80945,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-05T05:28:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely make rover wider ( I make mine longer) ^ what Taki 117 said\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TLetHgn.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TLetHgn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-05T05:33:50Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2014 05:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Lohan2008\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sgt_flyer","CreatedById":57690,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-05T05:52:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, be sure to disable engine gimballing on a skycrane\u0027s engines.
