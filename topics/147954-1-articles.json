The idea is to land the station upright and use Vernor\u00A0engines to tilt it over and slowly lower it to horizontal position. It actually worked on the launch pad, but not exactly how I had hoped. The Vernor engines were fighting each other and I ended up more on my side. I had to use the reaction wheel to roll into the right position. That worked on the launch pad, but I am not sure it will work on the more uneven Mun surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think part of my problem was that I used the symmetry tool to place couplets of engines. What I think I want is 2 Vernors point down to tilt it over, and 4 pointing up to slow my controlled fall. So I guess the question is, how do you place the Vernor engines so that I can place the station bottom down?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other problem I am facing is the photovoltaic panels. I have it figured out if I am on a North/South axis, but landing it is going to be hard enough without worrying about the axis. I am think of just putting the\u00A0OX-STAT-XL Photovoltaic Panels on top and hope it is good enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch1 lang=\u0022en\u0022 style=\u0022color:#000000;background:none;font-weight:normal;margin:0px 0px .25em;padding:0px;border-bottom:1px solid rgb(170,170,170);font-size:1.8em;line-height:1.3;font-family:\u0027Linux Libertine\u0027, Georgia, Times, serif;font-style:normal;letter-spacing:normal;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/h1\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-17T16:06:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you post a picture?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ty Tan Tu","CreatedById":167214,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-17T16:23:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222761598\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022147954\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221474128402\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022113764\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Foxster\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 minutes ago, Foxster said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you post a picture?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI now this is ugly, but I am playing in sandbox mode. It has been my experience that I could put the Statue of Liberty in orbit with a big enough engine. (Crap! Now I want to put the Statue of Liberty in orbit.). The other side is a mirror image with the Vernors pointing the opposite direction.
