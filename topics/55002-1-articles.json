His age has not stopped him, though--in fact, he is still the most active person in the entire program, and his list of achievements continues to grow. This may be partially because no one else is quite as insane as he is--he\u0027s watched far too many action movies, and always takes the most dangerous mission available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWilliam \u0027Bill\u0027 Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAge:160\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERank: Major\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurvival Instinct: Medium\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAchievements: First kerbal on Minmus\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBackground: While not getting quite as much spotlight as Jeb, Bill has still made quite a name for himself. He is respected as one of the greatest minds on Kerbin, second only to Werner Von Kerman himself. He hosts a science show, \u0027Secrets of the Universe\u0027, and a children\u0027s educational program, \u0027Bill Kerman the Science Man\u0027. He is always the first on the scene when something strange happens and a mission is sent to explain it. After the death of Danke Kerman (see \u0027In Memoriam\u0027), he began to take a more philosophical side. Recently left the program because of the death of Roning Kerman. He\u0027ll be back, though... right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert \u0027Bob\u0027 Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAge: 159\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERank: Major\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurvival Instinct: Pants Wetter\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAchievements: First kerbal on Laythe\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBackground: Bob was coddled as a child, and became quite the coward when he grew up and there was no more mommy to come to his rescue. Desperate not to become a janitor, Bob signed on to the Jedi Space Program. He is now considerably toughened up, but he is still reluctant to go on any mission farther out than Minmus, and even then he\u0027s wary. He has two exceptions: Eve (\u0022At least it\u0027s peaceful\u0022) and Laythe (\u0022The one nice world in this entire [bEEP] solar system\u0022). He\u0027s got it where it counts, however--he is kind, loyal, honest and a good pilot. Expect to see him on routine Kerbin system missions and in rescues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStaff\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJohn Fitzgerald Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAge: 1,969\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERank: President of Kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAchievements: United Kerbin under one nation\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBackground: John F. Kerman is the single oldest kerbal on Kerbin, yet he still looks like he\u0027s in his mid three hundreds. Two hundred and twenty years ago, John ended the constant global warfare racking Kerbin and was elected President of the entire planet. When Werner Von Kerman unveiled the first rocket, John declared that the conquest of space was Kerbalkind\u0027s number one priority. When not running the planet (it\u0027s like herding giraffes), he keeps the space programs in line and attends press conferences.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Director\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAge: 100\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERank: Director of the Jedi Space Program\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAchievements: Created the JSP\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBackground: The Director (his true name is unknown, and he isn\u0027t saying) is an egoistic man with some megalomaniac tendencies. He created the Jedi Space Program after seeing how well the Kurtjmac Aerospace Program was doing. He hopes to one day be the director of the most successful space program on all of Kerbin. He administrates the budget, and as such is all-powerful on KSC grounds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWerner Von Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAge: 220\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERank: Head Scientist\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAchievements: Invented rocketry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBackground: From and early age, Werner took an interest in all forms science and mathematics. In the year 73 AU, he unveiled his greatest invention--a craft capable of taking three brave kerbals into the air by means of a controlled explosion. He called this marvelous invention a \u0027rocket\u0027, and claimed that if it were scaled up enough, it could put kerbals in space. This sparked the space age, and the rest is history. He is at least indirectly involved in all scientific matters the JSP faces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGene Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAge: 200\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERank: Head Mission Controller\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAchievements: Administrated every JSP mission since... ever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBackground: Gene is the real geek of the team, master of both physics and \u003Cem\u003EKillers \u0026amp; Krystals\u003C/em\u003E. Don\u0027t let his easygoing looks fool you, though--Gene knows the upper limit of any rocket that can run a few test flights, how far the laws of physics can be bent and how to bend them that far. Rumor has it that he once studied under the great Scott Manley, but both parties deny this. In any case, he is responsible for Mission Control (he even flies the probes by use of remote control), astronomical event watching and KSC maintenance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIn Memorium\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDanke Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAge at Death: 190\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERank: Private First Class\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurvival Instinct: Low\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAchievements: First kerbal on the Mun\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast Words: \u0022At least I finally got away from my ex girlfriend.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBackground: Danke was a rookie. The Armstrong 7 was his first mission. When his lander ran out of fuel, he jettisoned from the ship and used his EVA jetpack to slow down. It worked, and he became the first JSP Kerbonaut to step foot on the surface of the Mun. Unfortunately, he had no ship. A rescue mission was sent, crewed by Jebediah and Bill, but it landed on the other side of the Mun. When Danke tried to use the remaining fuel in his jetpack to cut the distance a little, he slammed into the side of a mountain, dying instantly from rib fractures. It was the first real disaster in JSP history. Rest in peace, Danke. You got to go jetpacking on the Mun, something not all kerbals can claim to have done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERoning Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAge at Death: 187\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERank: Private First Class\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurvival Instinct: Medium\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAchievements: First Kerbal on Dres\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast Words: \u0022Thanks, Bill.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBackground: Roning had been newly hired into the space program, and the Odin was his first real mission. After several miscalculations, the ship managed to land on Dres, but shortly after planting the flag he got thrown into the sun by the Kraken. Rest in peace, Roning.
