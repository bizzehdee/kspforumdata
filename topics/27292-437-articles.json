This also gave the Moth more torque than I really knew what to do with, which was useful, but became a little awkward later on as I didn\u0027t turn on fine controls. The takeoff needed the kick of the end of the runway, largely because the CoM when full is so far forward of the CoL.

The first sign of a problem was when getting orbit - the transfer stage ran out while circularising to 25km, when it was supposed to also act as a crasher stage. I believe that the increased mass of the parachute and added docking port and RCS thrusters over the ship I had based it on were the primary causes of the delta-v deficiency, though perhaps the Round-8s were more mass than they were worth in fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/iGlDeW.png\u0022 alt=\u0022iGlDeW.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/ZzerPO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ZzerPO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb grabbed some reports and made to land in the Midlands.
