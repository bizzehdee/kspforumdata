Select one, click \u0022track\u0022 in the bottom-left. Now look at it\u0027s encounter with Kerbin. Specifically, zoom out and find the \u0022Kerbin Periapsis\u0022. This number will tell you how close the asteroid will come to Kerbin. Check each asteroid and find the one that has the lowest number as its Kerbin Periapsis (ie: If one goes by Kerbin at 35 million meters, and another one comes within 2 million meters, it\u0027s pretty obvious which is the better choice for a rendezvous). Stop tracking all asteroids except the one you chose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuild your rocket, or have one ready.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo to the Tracking Station and fast forward until the asteroid enters Kerbin\u0027s gravity influence. Look at its orbit direction. Is it going to pass Kerbin in a clockwise, counter-clockwise, or over the poles direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise looking down at the north pole)? If it\u0027s going to pass counter-clockwise, launch your ship into a Kerbin orbit normally. If it\u0027s clockwise (for the most part), using MechJeb\u0027s Ascent Guidance, type in the \u0022Orbit Inclination\u0022 box: 180. If it\u0027s polar, type in 90 or 270, depending if it\u0027s the north or south pole. This will get you at least mostly in the correct direction and save you fuel. Or you could try to estimate the exact inclination (or a closer one than 90 degree steps) and use that. But if you do, be warned that it\u0027s the inclination from KSC at time of launch. You\u0027d need to launch your ship when KSC is directly in line with the asteroids flight path.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce your ship is in orbit open the Map view, and select the asteroid as your target. Open MechJeb\u0027s Rendezvous Planner and Maneuver Planner. On the Rendezvous Planner window, click \u0022Align Planes\u0022, then on the Maneuver Planner window click \u0022Execute next node\u0022. This will put your ship into the same inclination as the asteroid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow comes the semi-tricky part. If you use MechJeb while the asteroid is still approaching Kerbin from far away, MechJeb will try to intercept it very far away and use tons of fuel. You want to intercept it right when it reaches its Kerbin Periapsis. Remember that your ship will take some time to catch up to the asteroid. As a rule of thumb on this, if you picture the arc of the asteroids flight path as a clock with the Periapsis at noon, you want to start your intercept maneuver when the asteroid is roughly at the 9 - 9:30 o\u0027clock position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately MechJeb isn\u0027t very smart about intercepting asteroids. So at this point you have two choices: Use MJ\u0027s Rendezvous Autopilot, which will eventually do the job but will cost extra fuel to get it done, or plan the next maneuver yourself. I do it myself because it\u0027s pretty simple. Just create a maneuver node on your flight path directly opposite the asteroid\u0027s Kerbin Periapsis (on the far side of Kerbin, away from the asteroid). Now just pull the green circle until the dotted line \u003Cem\u003Ejust\u003C/em\u003E intersects the asteroids flight path. As soon as your flight path intersects the asteroids, you\u0027ll see two red (or orange) tags appear. These show your position and the target\u0027s position. Drag your maneuver node around until you get the two tabs to line up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a short video showing how to do this yourself:\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gvuh_vkrSm8?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing Maneuver Planner, select Execute next node. Once that\u0027s done, fast forward until you\u0027re about 30 seconds away from the intercept point (you\u0027re probably still pretty far away, but that\u0027s ok. Relatively speaking, you\u0027re very close). Now open MJ\u0027s Rendezvous Autopilot, type a number in for how close you want to get to the asteroid (50-100 meters is fine). Click \u0022Engage Autopilot\u0022 and let it do it\u0027s thing. It should say \u0022Close to target - plotting intercept\u0022. It will execute one or two maneuvers then say \u0022On intercept course, planning to match velocities at closest approach\u0022 or some such.
