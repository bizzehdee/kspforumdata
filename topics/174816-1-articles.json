\u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E, I don\u0027t think sub forums will help too much.\u00A0 Good ole Space Port (The first KSP mod hosting site, I believe it was Squad run too) had sub sections,

the volume.\u00A0 I have been on a lot of forums over the years, even moderated a couple big ones (similar size to these, minus the mods section), and I have never seen traffic/turnover like the mod release section has.\u00A0\u00A0 I can post something in a thread there, and twelve hours later it\u0027s on page 7.\u00A0 It\u0027s a testament to how awesome our modders and players are, but it\u0027s also like trying count lug nuts on a highway during rush hour.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps requiring a mod thread to select from a list of tags, similar to the sub catergories we\u0027re thinking of, at the time of posting (or editing!), and then revising the search engine for that sub forum to list by tags, would be a good solution, if it ever got implemented.\u00A0 But since this is an off the shelf forum engine, I doubt the moderators/maneTi have the will to tackle that
