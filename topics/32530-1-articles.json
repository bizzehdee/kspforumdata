There is already something similar pop up for crew in some views. You know the one which displays their courage and stupidity? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point I do not know how to implement them. Skimmed the KSP-API but I couldn\u0027t find anything which might allow you to simply use those exact same screens as they use for the planets and courage stupidity. Doesn\u0027t mean someone else couldn\u0027t know or find out of course, but having a way to implement it would be an essential part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow I would go about it, if i really wanted it, was to make a plugin which makes a small GUI window which is fixed to the side with buttons for each kerbal on current ship, which open an new window with the blurb text upon click. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Module_code_examples#Creating_a_GUI_Window_and_Button\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Module_code_examples#Creating_a_GUI_Window_and_Button\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/b-rwQRKz0PM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever to the best of my knowledge the majority of Kerbal names are generated randomly from a set of syllables. I also think it\u0027s somewhat likely that Squad will expand on the courage/stupidity thing, by adding exactly what you suggest. So maybe your time would be better spent by adding your idea to the suggestions section on the forum under KSP development. (You could add the blurbs you wrote/are writing to the KSP Fan-Works section and link to there from your suggestion.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoesn\u0027t mean it isn\u0027t a good idea, because it is. Just wondering if it\u0027s worth the effort at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
