If you mean you built an Apollo-alike rocket and followed the mission pattern, then wow. Not to suck fun out of anything but with Kerbal Engineer, the Cheat Sheet, and maneuver nodes, anyone should easily be able to perform really ANY mission in KSP. Using a launch window planner doesn\u0027t hurt if you are going further.

Why? Mostly because I stopped putting the whole game on the rockets, or in space, or on Duna. I enjoy the planning of missions, the building a rocket, thinking about what I\u0027ll need, what I want it to do and how it needs to do it. Doing training flights, plotting launch windows, calculating deltaV, planning contingencies. The actual mission isn\u0027t \u0027the purpose\u0027 any more, it\u0027s just the climax, it comes at the end of the story. Then it feels fun when either everything goes according to plan, or things DON\u0027T go according to plan and I have to either use my contingencies or come up with another possibility. It usually takes a few days for me to complete an actual mission. For instance, my Kerpollo mission took nearly two weeks of planning, training and design. The actual flight? A few hours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a fun fact, the Kerpollo mission in my video is actually the \u003Cem\u003Esecond\u003C/em\u003E Kerpollo mission. The first one was eaten by LightWorks, and in that one, NOTHING WENT ACCORDING TO PLAN. Every single possible thing that could go wrong did. So I ended up just doing it again, and this time it went off nearly without a hitch.
