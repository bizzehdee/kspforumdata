The precision required is something like 8 orders of magnitude. They have to correct for gravitational time dilation, among other things. Atmospheric index of refraction is not insignificant at this point. That\u0027s easy enough to correct for, however. What it probably doesn\u0027t correct for are pressure fluctuations due to weateher and some lensing effects in upper atmosphere. These will be some of the factors that will result in limited precision of the GPS system. But they do average out between multiple satellites, so the more of them you have the lock on, the less of a precision loss this causes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yourself","CreatedById":4465,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-09T23:29:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.csr.utexas.edu/texas_pwv/midterm/gabor/gps.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGPS receivers can do some pretty complicated modelling of the Earth\u0027s atmosphere\u003C/a\u003E.
