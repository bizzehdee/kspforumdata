The round lights have a much longer range than the square lights. If you put the angled down with say a yellow light, you\u0027ll know you\u0027re a few hundred meters above the ground. If you also have a few red square lights, you\u0027ll know when you\u0027re under 200 meters. If you play around with the arrangements, you can even set patterns to show up at different altitudes. For instance, you can aim the red lights so that as you close with the ground, the red lit portion of the ground starts to separate as you close.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, putting them on planes as a nose light can help with nap of the earth flying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, landing gears have the same settings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
