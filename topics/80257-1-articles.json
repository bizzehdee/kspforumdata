I laughed when the Facebook posting for the dev notes claimed there was a lot to read. Tarn Adams, for instance, craps out more informative and technical content than the KSP dev notes in a single sitting. The Project Zomboid dev blogs are a refreshing read after the stifling lack of information here. CCP did quite a good job keeping the playerbase informed.
