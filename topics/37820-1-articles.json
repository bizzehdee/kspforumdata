I was unable to find my old thread after posting it, and got no views or responses after several hours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve got a couple of questions concerning decouplers. To give some context, what I\u0027m attempting to do is launch a satellite into orbit and decouple with the right velocity and apoapsis so that the additional force from the decoupler carries the satellite into a circular orbit (hopefully leaving the debris behind to fall back into atmo).\u003Cp\u003EMy questions are as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Is the decoupler force applied to both sides, or split between the two? ex. If I put a 100kN decoupler onto a rocket and separate, does each side receive a 100kN force, or a 50kN force?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Disregarding mass, is there any reason to avoid using a decoupler of the wrong size? Would a larger decoupler connected to a small section/satellite/whatever apply a smaller force (when compared to a smaller decoupler of equal force), since there would be empty space? Or are there no differences other than aesthetics and mass?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI appreciate your feedback. Have an awesome day!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
