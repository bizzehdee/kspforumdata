Rather than building one ship to go to each of these planets or bases, and given that the planets and moons have many different biomes, I was wondering how to do this.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nCurrently my Idea is to build a massive space station that is a host to a mining craft that will mine in low G and a small fuel efficient craft to buzz around the low g planets/moons collecting the data. I assume that I would need to have some kind of lander for higher G bodies as well...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI don\u0027t have to process the data on the bodies, I am quite fine with doing that on the station, I really just like the idea of this floating kerbal science station surveying all of the planets and moons in one trip.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat would I need to include, Does anyone have design ideas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jetski","CreatedById":119969,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-19T11:50:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome stuff to think about\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo Eve first-you will need a large lander, and you don\u0027t want to haul that around too much\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSmall miner to refuel a big mothership often needs several trips, so be patient\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPol, bop, gilly, minmus can be done with ions, RCS, or even EVA packs\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTylo needs a special lander, tons of dV and high starting TWR\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuna, Ike, Mun, Vall, Moho, Dres can be done with a single NERVA, or any decent Mun lander\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI often use the drive section of my mothership as a detachable lander, why haul extra engines?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSolar doesn\u0027t work well past Duna, Bring an RTG or cells.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"septemberWaves","CreatedById":160814,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-19T18:46:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d recommend putting an ISRU on the Tylo lander if you\u0027re planning to use it for multiple biomes, that way you can mine fuel whilst on the surface.
