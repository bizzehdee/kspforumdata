Otherwise, it is difficult to tell by eye where the orbit nodes are. This is necessary, for example, to adjust the orbit for the upcoming maneuver to a planet with a near-zero orbit inclination. I think it is better to make this option customizable, that is, allow to show and hide the nodes as desired to not visually clutter up the map of the system.\u00A0The ability to clearly orient to the ecliptic at any time will make positioning in space and planning maneuvers more convenient and less confusing\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vl3d","CreatedById":219348,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-06T23:10:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUseful combined with persistent rotation (to orient solar panels or protect against radiation when in orbit of another celestial body).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ahres","CreatedById":180308,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-13T20:21:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis doesn\u2019t really acknowledge your post, but I\u2019ll mention it in case you don\u2019t know: even though orbit nodes relative to the ecliptic aren\u2019t in the first game, you can use the orbit info menu in the lower left corner to see your orbit\u2019s inclination relative to the ecliptic. Using this in conjunction with a maneuver node can get you a near-perfect equatorial orbit. Of course, in KSP2, some planets will have axial tilt which means the equatorial plane and the ecliptic wouldn\u2019t be the same thus making things more difficult in that regard based off of what we have available in KSP1.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vortygont","CreatedById":223549,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-13T20:30:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224231880\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022211916\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221676319694\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022180308\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ahres\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 minutes ago, Ahres said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbut I\u2019ll mention it in case you don\u2019t know: even though orbit nodes relative to the ecliptic aren\u2019t in the first game, you can use the orbit info menu in the lower left corner to see your orbit\u2019s inclination relative to the ecliptic\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni know this, but you still have to determine the nodes of the orbit by eye, which is very painful.
