And in orbit, you can track position over ground or use laser...but if one is traveling between planets, how do you accurately measure your speed without anything to measure against (air pressure, something for lasers to bounce off of?) I imagine a bunch of really smart people use smart people calculations to figure that a if 3 ton ship that puts out X pounds of pressure burns for 3 seconds, speed should be changed by X amount. But how do they know, other than what it \\*should\\* be? Like if that kid and his monkey that were always hiding in Speed Racer\u0027s trunk had snuck onboard and changed the weight (however slightly). How would you know the difference between what you \\*should\\* be going, or what you\u0027re actually doing? \n\nOr if you were Voyagering your way out of the solar system, and Superman came by, grabbed ahold of your ship, and gave it a good push for 20 minutes. How would you be able to track your new speed when you don\u0027t have known burn rates and velocities to go by?\n\nOf course these scenarios are highly implausible, so feel free to substitute a more likely occurance if that helps."},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T02:08:21Z","Content":"Velocities are usually determined via doppler shift of the radio signals from the spacecraft in question, combined with its angular movement across the sky.

One simple example would be to attach a mass to a spring (or network of springs, if you want more than one dimension) and watch the spring(s). If there\u0027s no displacement, there\u0027s no acceleration; if the mass is displaced from equilibrium, the amount of displacement (times the spring constant divided by the mass) tells you how much acceleration you\u0027re experiencing.\n\n(Ostensibly this is what\u0027s going on inside the Accelerometer when you right-click it and tell it to display data.)"},{"CreatedByName":"ArcFurnace","CreatedById":109240,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T02:15:18Z","Content":"Acceleration can be measured by an [accelerometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer). Taking the time integral of the acceleration gets you the change in velocity, although you have to be careful (if the accelerometer is off by a little, integrating over time will result in increasing levels of error in your measured velocity). See also [inertial navigation system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_navigation_system), which is a more detailed discussion of that procedure. A [star tracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_tracker) can give you your attitude (the direction you\u0027re facing), although I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s possible to get velocity from those. If you have access to a ground station, you can [send radio signals back and forth](http://timeandnavigation.si.edu/multimedia-asset/navigation-in-space) and track how long it takes for them to be transmitted and received, which will give you position and velocity (see also [here](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-do-space-probes-navig/)). A theoretical technique is to use [pulsars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_pulsar-based_navigation) of known locations and frequencies as beacons to determine location (and measurement of your location over time can give your velocity).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-22T02:26:33Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2015 02:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ArcFurnace**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T05:07:25Z","Content":"In real life?
