I\u0027m not looking for duplication, just trying to fill in the gaps in the historical launchers. Basically, because FASA still contains composite parts and Kerbalized textures, this is more of an expansion pack for RO rather than something in its own right. For example, there\u0027s no need for a better RL-10 model, as FASA\u0027s model is great, so all that will be provided here are the Centaur tanks which haven\u0027t been addressed thus far in RO. That being said, at least for the Titan, I think that it\u0027s going to need its own set of engines because of FASA\u0027s tank butts. It\u0027ll give me chance to see if I\u0027m clever enough to make the LR-91 turbopump thrust vectoring a thing ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nBut yeah, by all means, go for it, I\u0027ll strike it from the list!
