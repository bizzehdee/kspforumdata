The game is nagging me over and over to \u0022dock two vessels around \u0026lt;a local moon\u0026gt;\u0022. I don\u0027t want to. I don\u0027t care, I\u0027ve done with that moon, it\u0027s farmed out,\u00A0I probably never want to go back, and the contract is going to cost more to fulfil than it pays by a wide margin. I\u0027m ready to move on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I can\u0027t cancel the contract. If I delete it by editing the save, I just get another one for the same darn thing. Eventually I crack and cheat it so that the game thinks I have done that docking and finally moves on. Now it wants me to land on a planet that I already have a probe around. I\u0027m not interested in that right now, I\u0027d like to go somewhere \u003Cem\u003Enew\u003C/em\u003E; I wait 6 days for a new contract. Land on the same planet.

If a player has been to a body, then the contract system needs to get over itself and start offering OTHER places to go as well. It\u0027s fine if \u0022dock two vessels around \u0026lt;local moon\u0026gt;\u0022 remains one of the things that can pop up, but it can\u0027t be the only thing that ever appears! Sometimes it\u0027s just not on a player\u0027s todo list \u003Cem\u003Eever\u003C/em\u003E, resulting in them never doing it, and never getting any explore contracts outside of that one activity that they\u0027re not interested in.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EBe more random. \u003C/strong\u003EIf a player ignores \u0022explore Duna\u0022 for a month, offer them Dres, or Jool, or Eeloo!

The contracts are really silly 80% of the times. I\u0027m really glad the only thing that matters in my modded career are World\u0027s Firsts. They should be the only thing that is mandatory. Who cares how I achieve the goal?

Then I selected one of my probes orbiting the Mun and just performed rendezvous with another one and all the objectives were then marked as done.
