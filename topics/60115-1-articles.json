Mostly. There is a level IN SPACE that has got me face-palming because of the scientific inaccuracies. In one of the 1st levels, you are on a military Kinetic Bombardment Space Station, but it gets hijacked by the enemy, so you and a squad of Space Soldiers have to kill them all. How in the world do these Astro-Soldiers not get thrown back by the gunfire? In real life, the gunshots would throw back these soldiers because of Newton\u0027s Laws, however in this game you can shoot and not get thrown off-course. Also, wouldn\u0027t NASA or the Air Force have noticed an enemy spacecraft rendezvousing with this station? We all know that rendezvous is a tedious and slow task, but these enemy Space-Soldiers should have been caught before they made it to orbit. They should have been tracked down by the LEO Debris Trackers. And finally, this isn\u0027t a rant BTW, I just want to point out these hilarious problems with this particular game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dharak1","CreatedById":61137,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-16T02:53:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmmmm...
