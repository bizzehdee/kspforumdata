Since I\u0027m learning, I have a lot of failures. My question is, are some of these contracts just impossible for a given tech level? My stubbornness would have me try and try in order to redeem at least some of the sunk costs and gain knowledge, but maybe I should give up earlier than I do if I\u0027m chasing impossible goals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre there any \u0027rules of thumb\u0027 you use to filter out contracts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T21:08:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery few contracts are de facto impossible, although some might essentially impossible at your current tech level. However, nearly all contracts have durations measured in years, so there\u0027s no rush to do them immediately. You can usually finish the tech tree in less than a month (of 24-hr days), which gives you plenty of time to do the contracts later with better tech.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real rule of thumb is whether the contract is worth doing at all. For instance, suppose the contract wants you to do something on Mun, which means you need to build a Mun rocket. And if you\u0027re going to Mun anyway, you\u0027ll naturally want to make the most of the trip, which means lugging all the science instruments you have plus 2 or 3 Kerbals to level them up, which means a fairly large rocket to start with, plus whatever else you need on it for the contract. By this point in the game, you should already know what your standard science-grabbing, Kerbal-leveling Mun rocket costs, so compare that to the contract reward. Is the contract reward a significant fraction of the rocket\u0027s cost, or even more? Then do it. If not, are there any other contracts you can also do on this same trip to help cover the cost?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
