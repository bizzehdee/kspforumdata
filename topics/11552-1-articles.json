And that is with circular orbits. What about elliptical orbits? I\\\u0027ll detail my method below:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets say we want to rendezvous with a damaged space station that was struck by stray orbital debris and is now in a 100km by 300km orbit around Kerbin. We must send a rescue craft up and then return the Kerbals safely to the surface. How are we to get there in the first place?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStep 1:\u003C/strong\u003E Get the rescue craft into a circular orbit with a 100km altitude, the same as the periapsis of the station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStep 2:\u003C/strong\u003E Adjust the inclination such that one of the apsides coincides with the station\\\u0027s periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStep 3:\u003C/strong\u003E We\\\u0027re going to want to wait until our rescue craft reaches the periapsis of the station.

We will then need to calculate the height of the opposite apside of our rescue vehicle such that the orbital period of the rescue vehicle equals the return-to-periapsis time of the stranded station. Then adjust the orbit accordingly. I know how to calculate orbit periods, but \u003Cstrong\u003EI need to know how to calculate time-to-periapsis.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStep 5:\u003C/strong\u003E When the rescue vehicle gets within visibility range of the station, we will then thrust until we match the speed of the station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStep 6:\u003C/strong\u003E Approach the station as you normally would.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, this doesn\\\u0027t really deserve it\\\u0027s own topic. It\\\u0027s an inefficient method that is probably not the best way, if not the worst way.

It just can take more time than some other methods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime to periapsis can be calculated by calculating the area of the ellipse between the angles of its periapsis and its current position. This cannot be solved for analytically, but there is a method of calculating it that involves and affine transformation.
