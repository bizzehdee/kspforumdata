So for the time being, I recommend instead that you set up a braking gravity assist off Tylo or one of the other big moons to capture at Jool, then go from there to where you really want to go.

With aerocapture, you\u0027re coming in on an open, hyperbolic orbit at interplanetary transfer speed and using the atmosphere instead of retro thrust to close your orbit. With aerobraking, you\u0027re already in a closed orbit so are at lower speed, and you\u0027re just using the atmosphere to lower your Ap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReal spaceships that land on Earth use aerobraking all the time---it\u0027s unavoidably part of the landing process \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s been but 1 or 2 real examples of aerocapture, however. The main reason for that, I suppose, is that our real solar system is an order of magnitude than KSP\u0027s, so you need proportionally more dV to go anywhere, and so arrive proportionally more speed. This makes it way more difficult, if not impossible. But if KSP planets have \u0022realistic\u0022 atmospheres, then the speeds involved in KSP shouldn\u0027t preclude aerocapturing even at Jool. Unfortunately, Jool\u0027s air ain\u0027t \u0022realistic\u0022 at the moment (and never has been AFAIK).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T18:11:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI managed to aerobrake a probe on Jool.
