It is symmetrical, the trim is neutral to start, but it still rolls and will continue to roll in spite of extreme dihedral configuration. I try to adjust the roll-trim but nevertheless it will remain unstable. The same things happen on less than 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 dihedral wing configuration.

Of particular interest is that the effect is amplified by swept wings and dihedral. In your case I might suggest drastically reducing the amount of diherdal you have your wings set to.
