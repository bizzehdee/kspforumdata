But KSP is a video game, and video game are nothing if not good presentation. So what if when you research a new technology node, you get a short animation demonstrating how parts of that node are (mis)used by kerbals? For example, when you unlock Survivability, the animation is about a kerbal getting locked in a service bay and accidentally sent into space. Or when you unlock Aviation, it\u0027s about a kerbal trying to fly using wings made of spaceplane parts by jumping from the top of VAB, Icarus style. These are small things, but sometimes small things take up large rooms in your heart.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YargJay9991","CreatedById":143494,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-23T00:08:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a good idea.

I think it\u0027s just a matter of resource constraints. Even if the animation were crowdsourced, Squad would have to oversee it-- and you really want to have a consistent look-and-feel to the animations, which would be hard to do if different people were doing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad is a tiny company and KSP has a small staff. I like this idea, but if they had time to do this, there are a lot of other areas that could really use some attention-- for example, the game\u0027s sounds (both F/X and theme music) are rudimentary at best, and could really use some attention. I don\u0027t blame Squad for the bare-bones sound-- they\u0027ve been working like mad on this game, and I think that they\u0027ve been making the right decisions (i.e. spending time in the right places-- much as I would love to have better sound, I\u0027m glad that they added biomes to every planet first, and resource mining, and contracts, and...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think pretty much any suggestion that would involve putting a huge amount of work into art assets is probably going to take a back seat to other badly-needed improvements.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-23T03:03:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith all the problems this game has there might be a revolt if the devs spent that much time doing something that ultimately adds nothing to gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nikokespprfan","CreatedById":136115,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-08T18:57:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suggest that you pass on this idea to the mod-request section of the forums, too.
