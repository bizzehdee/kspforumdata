Ideally you want to come in sideways with a low periapsis. That allows the little atmosphere that Duna has to slow you down as much as it can. Your velocity will become more vertical as the atmosphere slows you and gravity\u0027s downward pull dominates. Follow the retrograde velocity marker on your navball and deploy your chutes or fire your rockets to continue slowing as you approach the ground. You\u0027ll finish on a vertical descent (pointed upward, that is) and you can engage ASAS to lock in that orientation as you land. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou often need small amounts of off axis thrust to correct for mistakes in your vessel\u0027s alignment, but you shouldn\u0027t need to get more than 5-10 degrees off of vertical once you\u0027re on that last part of the descent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a large vessel with a small command module (or worse, a large vessel with a probe module) then the gyros in the command module might be too weak to rotate your ship quickly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s also possible that you\u0027ve got something wrong in your design that is causing the ship to be flipped over - it\u0027s hard telling without pictures and/or a .craft file. One common problem is that parachutes mounted below the vessel\u0027s center of mass can cause it to flip over when they deploy, and except for very small vehicles it\u0027s nearly impossible to recover to an upright orientation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rryy","CreatedById":57357,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T19:27:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry putting some parachutes \u003Cem\u003Eabove\u003C/em\u003E your lander\u0027s center of mass.
