The basic lander would stay the same, only it would be folded in on itself to fit under a fairing. Once in space, it would be unfolded and locked, and the direction of the hinged joints would automatically give the greatest strength to the direction you\u0027re adding the load (i.e. the claw would pull on the hinge, pulling the structure together above it, and the rockets would be moved to the sides to push the joint together too).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nrotating things: opening up the possibility for swivelling nacelles for VTOLs, space station hubs and suchlike.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nextending things: just like solar panels, only with some structural strength (good tensile, but obviously not much shear), making landed outposts much simpler to build.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEVA-built connectors: i.e. fuel lines and struts that Kerbals can add.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd of course there are mods like KAS and Infernal Robotics which deal with these issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo disagree though: it is a game, and IMO the strictness and simplicity of the rules governing a game are not in themselves a limit to its interest. People can spend a lifetime playing chess. Rather it is the choice of rules, and each of those four examples above would easily lead to a multiplication of \u0022Rube Goldberg\u0022 solutions to any given problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn other words, adding realism and immersion can be a Good Thing for many good reasons (and I don\u0027t want to even touch the \u0022procedural parts\u0022 debate) but such mechanisms multiply the complexity of the game for the player and for the CPU, and vastly increase the likelihood of unforeseen problems. As the game is now, if it lifts off the pad cleanly then the vast majority of potential structural problems have already been sorted (the Klaw being the obvious exception). With hinges and extenders, a whole world of physics abuses and problems opens up. Being somewhat a purist, I have only recently installed KER and haven\u0027t tried any other mods, but the potential for Kraken-like problems with the ones that add structural functionality seems clear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I tend to find criticism of the game\u0027s limitations (and I repeat, I do not want to touch the procedural parts debate at all, at all) to be unfair. A game cannot pefectly imitate real life: a Slinky is a trivially simple device but is good evidence that we are not living in the Matrix, because can you even imagine the processing power you\u0027d need to model it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would really, really like to be able to fold payloads up. Since we can\u0027t, we have to improvise. When I see people\u0027s clean and aerodynamic solutions to problems I often have a \u0022doh!\u0022 moment. When I see things like Reactordrone\u0027s solution I feel better about my own (far uglier) contraptions. However, I\u0027m generally forgiving about the game\u0027s limitations because the sheer variety of other people\u0027s solutions convince me that there is surely another, better way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL;DR: I too would like other solutions, but in most cases their addition would add to potential problems. There is almost always an elegant alternative solution with stock parts, but we don\u0027t all necessarily come to it on our own!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"webkilla","CreatedById":71356,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-08T11:04:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nplusck - I know your feel\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand indeed - my main gripe with my crane setup right now is that I can\u0027t really compress it any more right now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve also considered using the mod Quantunstruts\u00A0 to allow me to affix the crane grabber once I\u0027ve picked up the capsule.
