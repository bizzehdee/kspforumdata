In 20 mins it was done!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd there\u0027s one thing too: they have to relate to things while learning. That way, showing real examples from what they like, and then explaining how it\u0027s done (kid-mode huh, not the technical aspect right off ^^) helps them relate the knowledge to things they appreciate, and if they have the taste to learn and discover (which a lot have, it just gets turned down by a lot of things), they will be interested.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, learn a bit about them before teaching them; what they do, what they love (technology-wise of course), and then try to adapt yourself and you\u0027ll hit their brain in the right spot.

In fact, everytime the bird moves, the game thinks \u0022okay. Is the bird going to touch something? No? Then continue on. Yes? Then look what type of object it is. It\u0027s a pig? CRUSH HIM!

I was going to say I think scratch is wrong, but then I thought back to when I was about 7 or 8...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe IT teacher had this program thing, where you had a blank white space, and a window at the side with arrows in it.

Hate to brag (I don\u0027t) but I beat everyone in my class, and had moved on to the advanced shapes because I had finished all the normal ones. Then I sort of naturally wanted to learn programming 2 or 3 years later. But we only did that program on day, never again. But when I went home I looked it up and tried to download it. I think the thing with teaching the kids to code with scratch is to make sure that it draws their interest in so much that they do it at home. 1 hour can\u0027t teach a kid to become a master scratch programmer, but a weekend playing with it might. You can teach a kid some stuff about Motherboards and screens, for them to forget, or the way of the code, which sticks in your head forever.
