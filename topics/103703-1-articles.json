But then again, look at how \u0022Doom\u0022 was in 1995 on DX2 and where we are now with Call of Duty and Grand Theft Auto. I would not be surprised that there will be a time, and probably sooner than we\u0027d think, that virtual reality goggles can provide the \u003Cem\u003Evisual\u003C/em\u003E effect of sitting in a real cockpit\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACif not life-like, than at least to a level that is acceptable enough for immersion.\u003Cp\u003EThe question then becomes if what those goggles are lacking compared to a \u0022hydraulic cockpit\u0022 (vibrations, acceleration, pushed to the left or right when turning without proper banking, etc) can be compensated by what the goggles can offer that the simulated cockpit cannot. I\u0027m not a pilot so I have no clue what would be relevant, but let\u0027s for argument sake say \u0022Santa Claus sticking to your windshield\u0022 (which maybe a hydraulic simulator can show pretty convincingly as well, but let\u0027s assume it cannot), and how relevant would that be for the simulation? I can see that hydraulic simulators can offer things like real smoke (smelling like burnt kerosene) filling the cockpit, etc, but I can also see how many of those things can be done with really good VR goggles (not the oculus rift at this point, clearly). On the flipside, one set of goggles can simulate *any* cockpit, from a customer point of view that is very attractive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be possible to use a hydraulic chair (see below) to simulate the motion. The problem with this, however, isn\u0027t so much the computing power required to simulate the flight accurately (which is substantial) but the fact that you have to \u003Cem\u003Epay\u003C/em\u003E the aircraft manufacturer to use their flight model, almost like you\u0027re paying royalties for showing a movie.
