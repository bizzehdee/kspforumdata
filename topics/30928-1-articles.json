I have not done the payload fairing, or the interstage adapter yet, but the main parts are probably 90% done. Here is what\u0027s done so far\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECCB model and texture are done, just tweaking the texture a bit (it looks slightly better in game than I thought it would)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECentaur model and texture are done, again just tweaking the texture slightly\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EGimballing on both the CCB and Centaur\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E2 Engine flames on the CCB (thanks to Borklund for that)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here\u0027s what needs doing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFairings and Interstage\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EBALANCING! I have no idea what values I should use, so I will play around for a while to see what works well for me\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI may consider giving a very early version, with just the CCB and Centaur to those of you who wish to test it. I will only do this 1. If people are interested and 2. If I get some figures of fuel, mass, etc that are in the right ballpark.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, here is a quick pick of the CCB and Centaur\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LynN5Co.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LynN5Co.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"J_Man_X_663","CreatedById":29355,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-07T15:25:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow...
