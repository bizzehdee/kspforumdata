I know I\u0027m very late to the party, but it seems like I have a condition that prevents me from playing games early in their life cycle lol. Not sure! Anyway, I play on an older laptop, so not sure how well KSP2 will run, might just stay with 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat really draws me to this game (apart from the space operations component) are the mods! So many talented mod makers doing so many cool things with the game is really hard to resist. Big props to the modders!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-06T05:02:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/223650-trask/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022223650\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/223650-trask/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Trask\u003C/a\u003E!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:happy:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/happy.png\u0022 title=\u0022:happy:\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
