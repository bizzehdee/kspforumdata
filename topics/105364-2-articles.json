The regular jet engines are too weak to even complete the survey Kerbin missions.. they don\u0027t seem to be able to reach altitudes above around 14k under the best of circumstances. The turbojet engines just tear your ship apart at anything under 15k and above that you\u0027re left with next to no control because the atmosphere becomes too thin. The speed at which you burn up parts seems entirely too low, as I cannot get a spaceplane moving quickly enough in the 10-15k range to be able to make orbit without tearing the plane apart. I can\u0027t enter a steep climb above the 15k range with my jet engines because they lose control too quickly above that altitude and the atmosphere becomes too thin for a high angle maneuver like that - the engines just flame out in atmosphere thin enough to not tear the ship apart.
