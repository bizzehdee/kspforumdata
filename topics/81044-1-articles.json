First of all, i am no hardcore - pure stock - no mechjeb player. And I am not a mathematician, nor a astronomer. My gameplay right now is that of an epic journey in my space program, and the enhanced problems following my decision to use deadly reentry, tac ls and far and trying to work mostly with reusable launch systems, recovering whatever possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut right now i find myself most of the time with possibilities, ideas and goals for visits to the planets, but rarely fitting launch windows. And i do not timewarp very often more than 3-6 days, since alarm clock has already a lot of missions that i should handle. My old ways of playing ksp with only one mission at a time and timewarping like crazy are long gone \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo... say i want to fly to moho or eve, but there is no optimal transfer window. Ok, use non optimal, maybe more expensive transfer windows with the information that alarm clock, mechjeb, protractor and the online calculator are offering, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut here everything goes wrong for me. When i try to find possible manouevers i rarely find something that is a bit more expensive - mostly the transfers are extreme in every way. And often when trying to burn one of these manoevernodes with a nuclear engine and lots of time and dv to spare it doesnt hit the target at all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb and protractor rarely get a hit either outside of the optimal launch windows. Surely nothing to rely on. And the very impressing online tools show some tempting options and windows, but give no hint how to use this information to my advantage. And yes, i tried to follow one of the rare guides from 2013, but found it really complicated and not very good explained. Most of the available guides rely heavily on timewarping one single mission anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo... I learned so much in ksp, how can i manage to at least find reliable, non optimal transfers, so that i can concentrate on building vessels capable of handling the extra dv? Is there an easy, step by step explanation that also makes use of the available mods like alarm clock, protractor, ker, mechjeb \u0026amp; co?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do you handle these situations?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-07T15:35:51Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2014 03:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by smart013\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TrooperCooper","CreatedById":110599,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-07T14:24:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehttp://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/ shows you ideal transfer options at any given point in time.
