I\u0027m going to post it here for everyone to enjoy, but I was under the impression that videos using KSP were supposed to include some kind of disclaimer (e.g. \u0022Kerbal Space Program, 2015 SQUAD, all rights reserved\u0022 or something like that), but I can\u0027t seem to find anything about it right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, which forum would it be most appropriate to post it in?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance for any pointers.

The rockets are Fleas with inward-pointing Separatrons to overheat and explode them just off the launch site. You can see the freed Separatrons cartwheeling through the air and exploding on the ground throughout the song.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/kmL88lMDfJ4?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone is interested, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B_o4wjbCXDNvM1Z3VWJjSklmSGs\u0026amp;usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere are the .craft files for the firework stand and the firework subassemblies.\u003C/a\u003E As I said, this was done in 1.0.2. I believe the changes in 1.0.3 and 1.0.4 made it so the separatron overheating doesn\u0027t work anymore, so don\u0027t come back seeking support for that! There are 90 rockets on the stand, and it lagged my computer out, as might be apparent in the video.

Nicely done!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne complaint though; the video is a bit \u0022stuttery\u0022, no doubt due to all the parts in the firework craft. However, you can get around this by using the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/69363-0-25-Time-Control-9-23-14-v13-2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETime Control Mod\u003C/a\u003E, slowing down the game by a factor of \u0027x\u0027, recording it, then speeding up the footage in post-production by the same factor. The explosion sounds will sound a bit weird since they will be sped up as well, but IMO it is a good trade off for a smooth video.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
