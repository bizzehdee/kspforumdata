I then switched back to my lander when I noticed something odd: While my craft was in Eve\u0027s atmosphere, and above 90km, my apoapsis would increase. Everything was off. In fact my engines hadn\u0027t even been activated, so there wasn\u0027t any inadvertent burning. Since I was barely scraping the atmosphere, my apoapsis climbed every time I did an aerobrake. It actually climbed from 107km to 112km (might have been 116km). The periapsis would decrease each time, however. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Finally once my craft dipped below 90km the AP started to come down, but only for the time the craft was below 90. So as my craft would aerobrake from 97 to 90 the AP would climb, below 90km the AP would decrease, and then the AP would climb again as the craft went from 90 to 97. Eventually the craft stayed below 90km long enough that the AP would finally have a net descent for the orbit. I though it had something to do with the construction of the craft, but after making the descent and ascent it happened again. After rendezvousing with the orbiter stage at an orbit of 115km, I detached the lander can. The lander can consisted of 4 massless batteries, 4 massless solar panels, 2 RCS thrusters, a MechJeb module, and a clamp-o-tron. I burned the rest of the RCS on the unmanned lander can which left the PE above 90km but below 97km, and sure enough the AP would rise while the craft was in that same range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else experience this?

It slows you down, which is why your Periapsis decreased. At the same time, depending on aerodynamics of your craft, the atmospheric stream generates lift, which carries you upwards and raises your apoapsis. Happens to me regularly when aerobraking, especially in spaceplanes for obvious reason. Though, I use FAR and I m not sure how much this experience can be transfered to stock aerodynamics...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can even be observed during the ascend into LKO with a plane, AFTER switching off all engines and just gliding upwards... apoapsis rises, periapsis decreases...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EdFred","CreatedById":108599,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-17T04:01:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrently experiencing the same thing with a 1 man lander can, 1 Z-1K battery, 2 of the 2x3 solar panels, a FL-T200, and a 48-7S.

Sometimes even small vessels do this, but it seems to impact larger, more complex ones more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy research suggests that the forces on the parts may be out of balance due to a floating point issue, so there\u0027s a net motion and/or torque of the entire vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecifically the forces of the vessel\u0027s components acting on each other, which would normally be in equilibrium, but thanks to the not-real approximation of floats, are slightly off, so force A doesn\u0027t exactly cancel out force B, resulting in random acceleration vector C and torque D which shouldn\u0027t be there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere may very well even be a bias in the way that Squad doing math (optimized math is not necessarily \u003Cem\u003Ecorrect\u003C/em\u003E math in the world of FPUs or SSE), wherein a careful study may allow them to minimize the error by re-ordering operations such that errors tend to cancel each other out.
