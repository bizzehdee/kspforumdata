KSP was working fine and smoothly so far, with lot of mods and graphics improvments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve mounted an old HD 5850 during the time i was waiting for my new graphic card. Since then, i have freezes in game. I mean, the game doesn\u0027t crash, but like every 20-30 seconds, it keep freezing during 3-4 seconds. No mods installed for the tests, and graphic settings at the minimum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was a bit surprised cause i can even even play smoothly with my poor HD4000 (laptop chipset).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, a few days ago i received my new card, ATI R9 290. Sadly the problem still persists. It Looks there are some problems with ATI cards or am i missing something ? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"slumpie","CreatedById":121922,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-21T14:56:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid you properly remove the nvidia driver?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dacan","CreatedById":122067,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T17:49:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI even made a fresh install... Well some news, i \u0027ve not precisely isolated the problem, but i can say Dark Multiplayer is in cause, this is the only plug i had for my tests but i primarly didn\u0027t think it could be related to this, and even more, that those freezes were massive lags ! I posted on the DMP thread. Thank you for trying to help slumpie. I\u0027m a sorry as i posted without really testing in single mode, which works fine. :/\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
