Ferram is right in that it is the gas turbines that are the limiting factor: mass flow would make the turbine inlet temperatures go far beyond what any current or even near future turbine technology would allow. A variable bypass cycle engine could do it, but I shudder to think of the amount of fuel it would gobble (15:1 stoic to start plus burning rich... ugh!).\n\u003E As for landing speeds, it\u0027s mostly wing planform and wing loading (it\u0027s more complicated than that, but nobody is really interested in every single factor) that determines landing speeds, not the type of engine. Modern jet engined fighters have high landing speeds because of their swept/delta wings (and compensate for it with flaps and slats), not because they lack propellers.\n\u003E \n\u003E IMHO, increasing drag and reducing lift all across the board isn\u0027t the solution to kludging blunt body physics, nor is \u0022fiddling with it till it feels right\u0022 because that is simply using bias to solve an engineering issue that should have been solved mathematically from the beginning.
