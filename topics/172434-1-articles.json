It\u0027s great fun except for one annoying issue; all \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters/blocks add at least 100kg to the spacecraft\u0027s mass when added in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. I\u0027ve already gone into the .cfg file for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters and made the mass 100x smaller, but this made no difference. Any idea what I need to do to get the correct part mass in-game?
