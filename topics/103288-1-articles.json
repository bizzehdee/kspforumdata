The resultant pressure buildup forces the entrance valves from the reactant storage chambers to close, thus protecting the beetle\u0027s internal organs. The boiling, foul-smelling liquid partially becomes a gas by [flash evaporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_evaporation) and is expelled explosively through an outlet valve, with a loud popping sound. The beetles\u0027 glands store enough hydroquinone and hydrogen peroxide to allow the beetle to release its chemical spray roughly 20 times. In some cases this is enough to kill a predator.[^\\[4\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_beetle#cite_note-4) The main component of the beetle spray is 1, 4-Benzoquinone, which is particularly irritating to the eyes and the respiratory system.\n\u003E  The flow of reactants into the reaction chamber and subsequent ejection occur in a series of about 70 pulses, at a rate of about 500 pulses per second. The whole sequence of events takes only a fraction of a second. These pulsations are caused by repeated microexplosions which are the results of the continuous pressure on the reservoir and the oscillatroy opening and closing of the valve that controls access to the reaction chamber. This pulsed mechanism is beneficial for the beetles\u0027 survival because the system uses pressure instead of muscles to eject the spray at a constant velocity, saving the beetle energy. Also, the reintroduction of new reactants into the vestibule where enzymes are stored, reduces the temperature of the chamber, thereby protecting the peroxidases and catalases from thermal denaturation.[^\\[5\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_beetle#cite_note-5)\n\u003E \n\u003E  Typically the beetle turns its body so as to direct the jet towards whatever triggered the response. The gland openings of some African bombardier beetles can swivel through 270\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and thrust between the insect\u0027s legs, discharging the fluid in a wide range of directions with considerable accuracy.[^\\[6\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_beetle#cite_note-6)"},{"CreatedByName":"MasterSounis","CreatedById":114506,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T04:32:39Z","Content":"Limpet teeth.\n\n[http://www.port.ac.uk/uopnews/2015/02/18/scientists-find-strongest-natural-material/](http://www.port.ac.uk/uopnews/2015/02/18/scientists-find-strongest-natural-material/)\n\nIf you need to make a bio-spaceship, this structure is probably your best bet."},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T15:00:52Z","Content":"That\u0027s quite impressive O.o How a small insect can survive such salvo without boiling itself from the inside?

As I\u0027ve said living matter can teach us a lot of incredible tricks and molecular combinations that we find difficult to imagine and calculate by selecting those with millenia of random generations with selections. But for this very reason they are also limited, as in they are pushed at the best they can do with their biological nature, but often the full periodic table and the mind of a intelligent creator can improve this with ease, while evolution was restricted by its own boundary conditions. Take for example cells themselves, they are mostly a byproduct of how living being generates and self organize, but sometimes they are a problem for complex structures, and even more often they end up loosing they strong points like regeneration possibilities, while human industry, that relies on centralized production can improve a complex structure design and functionality by producing it directly and cell-less.
