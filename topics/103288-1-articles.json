The boiling, foul-smelling liquid partially becomes a gas by \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_evaporation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eflash evaporation\u003C/a\u003E and is expelled explosively through an outlet valve, with a loud popping sound. The beetles\u0027 glands store enough hydroquinone and hydrogen peroxide to allow the beetle to release its chemical spray roughly 20 times. In some cases this is enough to kill a predator.\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_beetle#cite_note-4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Csup\u003E[4]\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/a\u003E The main component of the beetle spray is 1, 4-Benzoquinone, which is particularly irritating to the eyes and the respiratory system.\u003Cp\u003E The flow of reactants into the reaction chamber and subsequent ejection occur in a series of about 70 pulses, at a rate of about 500 pulses per second. The whole sequence of events takes only a fraction of a second. These pulsations are caused by repeated microexplosions which are the results of the continuous pressure on the reservoir and the oscillatroy opening and closing of the valve that controls access to the reaction chamber. This pulsed mechanism is beneficial for the beetles\u0027 survival because the system uses pressure instead of muscles to eject the spray at a constant velocity, saving the beetle energy. Also, the reintroduction of new reactants into the vestibule where enzymes are stored, reduces the temperature of the chamber, thereby protecting the peroxidases and catalases from thermal denaturation.\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_beetle#cite_note-5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Csup\u003E[5]\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Typically the beetle turns its body so as to direct the jet towards whatever triggered the response.

Even what you describe isn\u0027t anything that\u0027s particularly special, it\u0027s just stuff that happens at a different scale than what we usually use. But it is also reciprocal, no system in nature has rotating shafts (except for some protein, but none produces ordinate macroscopic movement), nor any animal uses electromagnets to move stuff or no brain is fully programmable with the power of a modern CPU. All biological engines use a propellant of some sort. Most of the time is a chemical potential charge in ATP/ADP/AMP equilibrium or an H\u002B gradient across a membrane. And evolution is just a selection process, no special powers attached, except unmanageable genetic code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn topic, it depends what you mean with organics. Our old \u0022organic\u0022 way of transportation weren\u0027t any different from modern one except in the nature of the materials used. In short, a native making a ship out of wood isn\u0027t conceptually different than making it out of metals (except the wood one is going to float better).

But for this very reason they are also limited, as in they are pushed at the best they can do with their biological nature, but often the full periodic table and the mind of a intelligent creator can improve this with ease, while evolution was restricted by its own boundary conditions. Take for example cells themselves, they are mostly a byproduct of how living being generates and self organize, but sometimes they are a problem for complex structures, and even more often they end up loosing they strong points like regeneration possibilities, while human industry, that relies on centralized production can improve a complex structure design and functionality by producing it directly and cell-less.
