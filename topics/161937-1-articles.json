This story will carry over from the Advancing Through Hardships, but this is significantly more orientated towards the actual missions. The beginning will seem brief because I can\u0027t wait to start exploring! I have only glanced at the solar system and I am so excited! The game will be played Kerbin sized but maybe in another series I will do 2.5x. Let\u0027s us dive into the story.

He blinked, then when he opened them again he saw that the sun was shining through a skylight. Jeb turned his head sideways and saw that he was in an enamel white room with more windows opening out onto\u00A0a dark green field.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA person in a black jacket was sitting on a bench near-by, his head buried in a newspaper.

For example, the Kraken has absolutely no power here. The dominate power here is the Player.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHe spoke to you as well?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe kerbal made a wide-swooping gesture, \u201CEveryone one here is fully aware of the situation. The Player has communicated to all of us that we need a space program, and that he wants to show us the solar system. I honestly am excited for what lies ahead.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb squinted in the sun light, \u201CAren\u2019t you, or weren\u2019t you an employee of mine?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, I\u2019m hired as chief engineer by Wefly Kerman.

Joener started up the engine and the car started. There hadn\u2019t been many great advancements in cars, because the engine puffed and went out like a candle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLooks like we\u2019ll have to hitch-hike.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next day they arrived at the new Kerbal Space Center. Wefly was standing with a group of Kerbals when Jeb walked up with Joener.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJeb, still walking on two feet.\u201D Wefly briefly hugged Jeb then turned to the small crowd.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThese here are our contractors, we still need to unearth and redesign most of our rocket equipment to fit this planet.

The crowds rushed to the field where Valentina had popped off the hatch and was climbing out. Cameras snapped and and flashed. Jeb pushed his way through the crowd and reached the circle around the most famous kerbal on Gaia.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Val!\u0022 Jeb cried and broke through the circle to embrace her in his biggest bear hug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You old bloke, still trying to choke me.\u0022 Val replied, taking a sharp breath.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next day Jeb climbed into the cockpit of the Endeavor. It was simple as well, but it was larger, much larger. It consisted of a giant BACC thumper and a capsule. Mission Control warned him that it would probably would be very hot. But since the engineers still hadn\u0027t been able to make a heat-shield out of scratch so no heat-shield was forth coming.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Launch in 10. 9. 8. 7. 6. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1. Lift-off!\u0022 Jeb felt the g\u0027s slam into his body. 3 gs, 4, 5. It kept on rising. Jeb screamed in pain, then the booster stopped, out of fuel. He jerked against his seat-belt, knocking the breath out of him. He unbuckled the seat-belt and floated.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This is Mission Control calling Jeb, do you read me. You have exited the atmosphere.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This is Jeb. I read you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb looked outside the window and gazed onto the great blue orb sitting just below him. Jeb tore himself away from the window and looked around for the camera. He rummaged through the only locker, then pulled out the camera. He snapped several photos then put it away.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022QFsiBVg.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QFsiBVg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReentry twenty minutes later was a beast. The gees were terrible as the compressed his flesh into the chair he was sitting in. The drag chute pulled, then he once more was jerked against the seatbelt. Shorty afterwards the main chutes pulled and he drifted down. His altimeter read 6500 meters when he hit the ground. Jeb flicked the altimeter, but it read the same. He pressed a button on the controls, then with a whoosh and a bang the hatch was thrown away from the door, leaving it wide open. Jeb climbed outside, he was wearing his suit luckily because at this altitude, he would barely have enough oxygen to survive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This is Jeb. I have landed.\u0022 he radioed Mission Control. He looked around at the grey, flat plateau which stretched on towards the horizon. Jeb decided to plant a flag then wait for Mission Control to pick him up. It might be a while, but he had time to wait.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022vtEvjFx.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vtEvjFx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022yuHY92v.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yuHY92v.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChapter 2: A New Initiative\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb sat in a chair in the meeting room. There were dozens of kerbals all around him. He recognized Joener sitting two seats to the left. He leaned back in his chair and said, \u201CHello, Joener!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoener also leaned back in his chair, \u201CHey, Jeb.

He noticed the person first to his left was leaning forwards and talking to the person on his right. Seating hadn\u2019t been very well organized.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u2019s going to be deciding the agenda of the Kerbal Civilization. So far we have breached the barrier to space, but what is going to be keeping us in space?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb was about to reply when Wefly stood up from his chair and started the conference, \u201CKerbgents and Kerbettes, we are gathered here today to discuss KSP\u2019s goals in the coming years. We have two different agenda under discussion. To either colonize or to explore. So far we don\u2019t have the technology to colonize, but we have the technology to explore. As you know, Rockomax\u2019s agenda was to explore every celestial in that solar system. Now we have very little idea of what\u2019s here.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSuggest to two-pronged assault on the task before us.

Anybody voting for this, raise their hand.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll hands went up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAlright, the vote is unanimous, we will assign two different programs with two different kerbonaut cores. But, we have a launch today so let\u2019s go and see it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022X6NYRg7.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/X6NYRg7.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe launch was of\u00A0the latest rocket, the Valor spacecraft. It used the latest liquid fuel rocket boosters, which were strapped to the core \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E. It had a second stage of a liquid fuel motor which would push the spacecraft into orbit. Ronfort Kerman was the rookie who was tapped to fly the first Gaia mission to orbit. Suddenly the solid rocket booster fired and the two swivel engines\u00A0follow suit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt soared gracefully upwards. Jeb viewed it from his binoculars, \u0022Its on a very steep trajectory.\u0022 he commented. It soon disappeared from view an Jeb stood up and started walking to the mission control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce he entered the door, he was greeting by a loud exclamation, \u0022Blast it! The decoupler to the second stage refused to detach. We\u0027re not getting any signal from the first stage.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Get Ronfort to look out his window!\u0022 cried another controller and the Capcom obliged.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This is Ronfort calling Mission Control, the rocket is gone!\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Are you saying that the decoupler fired for the second stage instead of the first stage?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Probably yes.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Preform experiments then prepare for reentry.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb sighed and walked up to Wefly, \u0022Did you check your staging?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What?\u0022 Wefly was steadily glaring at the information coming into his consul. His headphones were in as well, listening to the air to ground loop.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I guess that this would be a lesson to the engineers.\u0022 Jeb mused.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What?

It was another Valor class rocket and the launch was fairly uneventful. Since the planned orbit would be a high one, and the capsule didn\u0027t carry alot of electrical charge, it would launch straight up then get into orbit using a new terrier rocket motor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe rose up through the sky, until she was nothing but another star in the night. Jeb rushed to mission control and watched from there her orbital insertion burn. The deoupler decoupled right on time and Wefly sighed a very audible sigh of relief.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The radioactive monitor says that I\u0027m in a very dangerous region of space.

The Co2 scrubber has gone off line! She must return to Gaia right now!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Val! do the deorbit burn now. I don\u0027t care where you end up, but get back here this instant!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes.\u0022 was all Valentina replied.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwenty minutes later Val reentered Gaia\u0027s atmosphere and twenty-two minutes after that she landed surprisingly near the space center. Jeb stood up from his chair and raced down to his car, her coordinates on a piece of paper in his pocket.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Where are you going?\u0022 asked Joener as Jeb backed out of the driveway.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022To see my sister.\u0022 replied Jeb, he expertly maneuvered his car around and then stomped on the gas.

The twin-boar engine threw its full weight behind the rocket, propelling it on towards Gol. The faint red glow from the massive crater adding to the feel.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022Detaching second stage.\u0022 Jeb flicked a switch and the first stage departed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022Firing second stage.\u0022 The engine kicked in, propelling them to LGO.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022Engine off.\u0022 Anke dictated and Jeb dutifully did as ordered.

But, what had caused the ejection of the atmosphere. Suddenly the spacecraft shuttered one last time, then flipped prograde. The exterior of the capsule started to burn away. More explosions, now audible through the thin exteriors of the walls. Heat was filtering in. The outer mesh of the skin burnt to a crisp.

Its hunting us!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\nA giant ant-like insect followed closely behind. Anke grabbed a piece of shrapnel and threw it at its head. It embedded itself into its skull, sending it to the ground.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\nWifig sighed a huge sigh of relief. Three days later, a helicopter\u0027s blades were heard in the distance. Anke pilled fresh leaves on the fire, sending up a cloud of smoke.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\nThe helicopter became visible, its blades spinning crazily. It lowered itself down, and deployed landing gear. Jeb punched the air from his position on the floor.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\nIt deposited its clumsy self on the floor, then the door opened. Medical personal jumped out of the helicopter and Wefly himself followed behind.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022Jeb, are you hurt?\u0022 asked Wefly, standing at Jeb\u0027s side.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022Yes, both of my legs are broken. Now please take us home.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\nFour months later Jeb watched the launch of the Gullis 1 rocket. Val, Joener, and a newbie scientist consisted of the mission. KSP had its eyes on Gullis. Strange geographical features were noticed on this moon, including a large scarred patch of the moon. The first Gullis was meant to discover what liquids were frozen on the surface of the moon. Later a manned base would be set up where constant investigation of the scarred patch of land would occur.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\nThe rocket soon reached orbit, then plotted its trajectory to Gullis. Soon afterwards the departure burn was executed and the Gullis left LGO. Jeb could only watch from Mission Control, his broken legs had suspended him from space flight in the near future.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\nThe kerbals in the Gullis mission were doing a video for the general news.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022Here is the interior of the space craft. The cockpit here is tiny, just made to fit one kerbal. In fact it is of the same design which was used when we were still struggling to make it into space. I hear that the scientists are working on a bigger, better cockpit which can hold up to 3 kerbals. \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\nThe video camera caught a swift glimpse as it reached into the Mk1 cockpit, then was jerked out to view the interior of the hitchhiker storage container. The camera panned over to Val\u0027s face, she was smiling wide.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022This is a quick hello to Jeb, my younger brother who just a few months ago, broke both of his legs when he narrowly survived death from jumping from a parachute-less capsule meters from the ground. He waves that off as an everyday occurrence. Now Jeb, I know this will hurt but, I\u0027m going to get to Gullis before you.\u0022 She smirked again, then the video ended. Jeb smiled big. Of course he wouldn\u0027t get to Gullis before Val, but he got to Gol before Val, so that was something.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\nAt the end of the video, a picture appeared.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022n2vIRaI.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/n2vIRaI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\nWefly walked up to the sitting figure and pulled up a chair. They sat for a while in silence, then Welfy spoke, \u0022Jeb, there are speculations about this new universe. Telescopes have found increasing evidence that this was once the Kerbin system, but we have renamed some of the objects, not knowing that they are familiar. Gol is the remains of the Mun, Gullis is what used to be Minmus. Olei and Olemut were captured by Gaia. Duna and Eve still exist. We aren\u0027t so sure of Jool and Eeloo. The solar system has gone over a complete overhaul.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\nJeb smiled, \u0022Isn\u0027t this a better place than the old Kerbin system? This is heaven, isn\u0027t it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022Heaven with violent motives. This isn\u0027t heaven. A kerbal died earlier today, he was pushed off of a cliff. The offender has no memory of that accident and still agrees that the two of them were best friends, and he\u0027s about to be hanged. Kerbals are getting increasingly violent, and there is nothing we can do to stop.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022The Player put us here, it can\u0027t be that bad.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022How do you know it was the player. This isn\u0027t heaven, we\u0027re in hell Jeb, everyone is.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\nWefly stood up and left, leaving Jeb there alone.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChapter 7: A Little Too Much Like Mint Ice Cream\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022What the crap happened here?\u0022 asked Joener, looking on the face Gullis. What used to be highland plains stretching on for miles was just totally wrecked. The mountains were carved out of these highlands were long and thin, covering hundreds of square kilometers. It looked like a gigantic scar across the face of the moon.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022This must be connected to what happened on Gol.\u0022 remarked Neldo, her eyes fixed on it. Joener quickly took a picture of the landscape, then started writing down his report.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022What did happen in this solar system then? There are marks of a catastrophic event all over the solar system.\u0022 he probed, not looking up from his paper.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022Insertion burn in 13 minutes.\u0022 the radio crackled, interrupting his thoughts. He startled for a second, then resumed writing. It took the good part of the next few minutes of relentless scribbling to finish the crew report. He straightened out the paper and reread his report.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022Do you think this does it justice?\u0022 asked Joener, handing over the paper to Val.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\nShe briefly scanned it, then handed it back, \u0022Very poetic of you. Indeed, very poetic.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\nJoener put the paper into a sealed bag and stored it in the experiments folder. Val sat down in her seat and started to boot up the reaction wheels. Joener gazed at her back. He had been watching her for this last six months, his mind made up. He had fell in love with Val the moment he saw her. Joener;\u00A0however, was short of nerve when dealing with kerbettes. Neldo had seen right though him from the beginning, and was willing to put in a word or two for his sake. His mind was further more in turmoil since the three of them had seen alot of each other lately for the last seven days. His love for Val had began to filter into his actions, ad he was painfully aware at the times he stared at her back when she was busy at some task.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\nThe burn into low orbit was completed minutes afterward. Joener stared into space, then was roused by Val\u0027s voice breaking into his mind.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022Joener, I need you to check the instruments while I\u0027ll plot our landing site.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022Yes Ma\u0027m.\u0022 Joener focused his eyes on Val, then turned away embarrassed. He pushed himself off of a wall and drifted over to the instrument board. His firsts order of business was hitting the monitor hard with his fist. The dials fluttered, then started to spin.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022Joener, what did you do!\u0022 cried Val, staring at the whirling numbers.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\nJoener cringed into the corner, \u0022I have no idea.\u0022 Joener looked for the plug, then unplugged the cord. The dials stopped spinning. Joener sighed, \u0022Looks like that did it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022Do you know that it has to be plugged in to work?\u0022 Val frowned down at him, he chuckled nervously. Suddenly a red light turned on on the panel.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022Freaking mother of crap!\u0022 Joener swore, jumping into the micro-gravity.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022Get your blasted butt out of this ship and repair that leak!\u0022 ordered Val. Joener raced as fast as he could down to the airlock and quickly changed into a suit. He didn\u0027t wait for the lock to depressurize, but opened the door and ejected the air into space. With a few thrusts of his eva pack, he rocketed over to the place where fuel spewed from where the leak was located. With some quick duct taping he sealed the opening, then added a little bit more just to make sure. He looked up from his task and stared at the aqua-green landscape.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022Val, had you had a good look of Gullis?\u0022 he asked through the radio in his helmet.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022Yes, I think so. By the way, there must be another leak or something\u0027s wrong with the monitor.\u0022 Val reminded him of his task, and he continued his repairs, talking to her on the way, \u0022You have been to Minmus before, haven\u0027t you. I listened to Jeb\u0027s stories before, and Gullis looks a little to much like mint ice cream, to reference Minmus of course.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022Cut the chatter please Joener, you\u0027re wearing me down.\u0022 Joener sighed, then turned off his mic. This was a wonderful start, annoying the kerbette he loved by being poetic and thinking upon things which could be thought later. The second hole was easy to patch and in no time he was back in the airlock. He\u00A0cycled the air carefully then stripped the suit. Even though he was working in a very easy condition, his interior suit was drenched in sweat and the suit smelled oddly of himself.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\nIt took several hours before pin pointing what had caused everything to go wrong. It happened to be that he forgot that there were two plugs in the panel, so it was completely expected that it should have still worked. Apparently a micro-meteoroid had passed through the fuel tank and exited the other side, leaving two clean holes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022Joener, sorry for being crabby, we need everyone on this team to stay together.\u0022 Joener looked up from where he had strapped himself into the wall, sweat floating off into the air.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022Its okay.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\nVal nodded, \u0022Then you better get a towel and soak up all the liquid you\u0027re dripping.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\nJoener nodded, then got to work cleaning up his mess.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\nSoon later they de-orbited the lander and started to head to the lowland beaches. Joener watched in fascination has Val handled the vehicle, sending it drifting towards the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022TdKAc9N.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TdKAc9N.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\n\u00221,000 meters.\u0022 Joener read off his numbers. In a few seconds the engines should come online. He waited. Seconds passed, and the artificial gravity of the engine hadn\u0027t been activated yet. He looked at Val, her face showed her full concentration on the landing. 750 meters passed and the engine didn\u0027t activate. 500 meters and still he floated, his arms free at his sides. At 250 meters he closed his eyes, knowing that something had gone wrong with the re-ignition of the poodle which had carried them this far. Suddenly the roar of hydrogen and oxygen being pumped into the ignition chamber was heard, as most as soon as the dull thud of the rocket engine kicked against the weight of the landing, decreasing its speed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\nJoener opened his eyes. They were alive and intact on the surface of Gullis. An hour later they posed, taking the mandatory picture of the crew members, the flag, and the lander in the background.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022cmz1Eg9.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cmz1Eg9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\nJoener smiled at Val as they reentered the lander. Neldo was nowhere inside, she was preforming science experiments outside. Val smiled back, giving him a faint hope that maybe, Val acknowledged his admiration for her.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChapter 8: Junior Von Kerman\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGreetings kerbals, I am Junior Von Kerman and I am your new director of space travel. I have heard of the marvelous things you have accomplished in the last year, including the landings on Gol and Gullis. I am proud of how you have done so far under my superior, Wefly Kerman. But there is room for improvement. We have not yet visited the celestial body of Olei and its moon Olemut.

Junior Von Kerman bowed from his platform near the launch pad. Some of the elder workers looked at each other nervously, this new director didn\u0027t seem to have a great sense of humility.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb thought to himself as the meeting dispersed. He had enjoyed Wefly\u0027s time as the director of space travel, it was nice to see one of his friends leading the space agency. Now this new director seemed different. He was the son of Werhner Von Kerman, one of the followers of the Kraken back on Kerbin and had helped to plot of Kerbin\u0027s demise.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hello Jebediah, my father said knew you well.\u0022 Junior Von Kerman interrupted his thoughts from behind him.

I was wondering what you thought of my speech, it was brilliant, wasn\u0027t it?\u0022 He said aloofly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb made a noncommittal sound and started to back away.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJunior stepped alongside him and asked, \u0022Did you think Wefly did justice to your position?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, very well indeed.\u0022 replied Jeb, slight irritably.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Then why aren\u0027t you the head of the kerbonaut operations, chief kerbonaut.\u0022 Junior listed half-a-dozen grand sounding\u00A0titles and then thinking that the ground was softened, continued, \u0022If you support my office, then I will see to it that you receive all these titles.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb\u0027s head\u00A0was spinning, the first day, the first hour Junior spent in office was to get him, a simple kerbonaut with a lot of history, on his side. A part of his mind glowed at the thought of accepting, but Jeb quickly decided to put off the decision for later.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thank you very much, but I would like to think it over, in 6 hours I will give you your answer.\u0022 he added, seeing the look of unbelief on Junior\u0027s face.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb extracted himself out of the crowd and ten minutes later arrived at the kerbonaut complex. There he arrived at his apartment and shut the door. He stood, thinking aloud to himself as he started to pace up and down the small room, \u0022What\u0027s wrong with the offer, anyway?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe looked at the shabbiness of the place, then continued, \u0022Junior is a good guy at heart, isn\u0027t he, if not in body. I wonder what the pay would be for a chief kerbonaut?\u0022 His conscious twitched uncertainly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022All I have to do is say a few things, support several decisions, and all my money troubles are over.\u0022 again he frowned.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027re on the same side, if there are even sides since the Kraken vanished.\u0022 his mind turned back to his conversation with Wefly, about where they were in the \u0027spiritual\u0027 universe.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Confound it.\u0022 he muttered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDown in the science lab, Bob faked a grin, \u0022You see, sir, our research into solid core nuclear rocket motors, or simply nuclear engines.\u0022 He simplified for Junior as Bob gestured wildly at a large engine bell embedded into a wall. Dozens of cores and fuel pipes dangled from the ceiling, feeding into the test engine.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022When finished, it should be able to produce over 1,000 kilonewtons of thrust at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E of 3 times of any engine we have created on Gaia.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJunior pondered the test engine with a look of disgust at the uncleanliness, \u0022You know, my father was a great rocket scientist, but I have always preferred the business side of science. I think I have done that part better than any of my predecessors.\u0022 He waited for a moment, then continued on a different subject.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022When can you build this?\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, we need more time. Our best scientists say in two or three years without any significant developments.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Bob, I need you to answer me truthfully.\u0022 Bob looked at Junior uncertainly, wondering what caused Juniors voice to become so much more serious.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Can a Kraken drive exist?\u0022 He gazed into Bob\u0027s bemused face, hoping for one moment of recognition, \u0022You know, a engine which can harness the power of the Kraken.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The Kraken was defeated by the programmer, this entire universe is kraken-free.\u0022 stated Bob, still thinking why Junior was bringing this up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How do you know? How do you know that the Kraken here is, is different.\u0022 Junior pressed his attack.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I, I personally think it doesn\u0027t exist, now if you excuse me, some of my scientists need me.\u0022 Bob walked quickly away towards the engine bell. He glanced behind him to see Junior stalking off towards the administration building.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next week saw the launch of the Lighting 1, the first manned mission to\u00A0Olei. Jeb watched from the sidelines as Anke and two newbies rocketed away into the clear blue sky. Jeb sat staring at the cloud of smoke which the Lighting left behind, thinking over his decision he made about Junior. Was he right or was he wrong, they were both on the same side, but their paths barely crossed in the region of their personality.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Anke, I hope you think I did the right thing. I wish I told you, maybe then you could have shed some light into the matter.\u0022 He muttered to himself as he stood up and stretched with the crowd. It would be about five days when Anke returned back to Gaia, five days later he would be having a long conversation on what to do, five days later if it all went to plan.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChapter 9: Olei\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Departure burn completed.

She unstrapped herself, feeling remarkable light.The transfer stage was a test bed for a new, small solid core rocket engine which slowly accelerated them up to velocity.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That Nerv was pretty weak if you ask me. Give me some speed any day and I\u0027ll be content.\u0022 remarked Juford ruefully, one of the new rookies.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Its a lovely engine, I don\u0027t see why you make such a fuss.\u0022 squeaked\u00A0Tiffany, the engineer and one of the rocket engineers who designed the Nerv rocket motor, as it was officially called.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Guys, if we are going to be trapped in this capsule for the next week, I suggest that we learn to keep to ourselves.\u0022 Anke warned the two of them. Sitting in between the two of them was going to be a nightmare, she was certain of that.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027ll do the science experiments then.\u0022 Juford climbed out of his seat and pushed himself over to a the other side of the space craft where the experiments were stored.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wow, look at this view!\u0022 he exclaimed when he reached the window. He reached quickly for the camera and took several pictures, \u0022No one else has ever seen Gaia from this angle before!\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022xKhUSg6.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xKhUSg6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnke drifted over to the window and watched the planet slowly recede away, the rings a dazzling aqua-blue.\u00A0\u0022We are privileged to be on this mission, you two. Don\u0027t mess it up.\u0022 She patted Juford on the shoulder then headed down to the service bay to catch a breath.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA day later they received a message from Mission Control as Anke settled back into the pilot\u0027s seat after her second rest period.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This is Mission Control, do you copy?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, we copy. What is it?\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You have now entered Olei\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. Wake up Juford and tell him to get the experiments up and running. Wait, the Lighting is drifting off course, what is causing that?\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnke frowned, then looked at the control board in front of her, \u0022I haven\u0027t the least idea, none of the maneuvering thrusters are on. Tiffany! There\u0027s some thing wrong up here in the cockpit!\u0022 she yelled down to the service module where Tiffany was tinkering with the engine control programming.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Coming!\u0022 she drifted up the hatch and asked, \u0022What is wrong?\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Our course is changing slowly, could you go outside and check if the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E is firing?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sure.\u0022 she replied, and started to put on a suit. Minutes later when everyone was in a suit, they depressurized the cabin then opened the hatch. They couldn\u0027t see anything from inside the hatch, so Tiffany pushed off through the hatch.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It looks like there\u0027s noth.....\u0022 A high pitch squeal of terror sounded through the mic.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Tiffany!\u0022 Anke cried, pushing herself out as well. The limp body was floating over an RSC port, which looked off. Wasting no time she grabbed the body and climbed inside.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Tiffany, what happened!\u0022 Anke demanded.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Her vital signs are fading!\u0022 she could just hear mission control panicking in the back ground. Anke closed the hatch, \u0022Re-pressurize the interior now!\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But.\u0022 Juford started to protest but Anke stopped him.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Get it re-pressurized now or Tiffany might die!\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJuford nodded then flicked several switches. Oxygen started to fill the chamber. Anke looked closely over her body, then noticed a gaping hole in the back of the suit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022NO!\u0022 cried Anke slapping her helmet.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe tore off Tiffany\u0027s helmet, the cabin only half full of oxygen. Her face was purple, but still unconscious.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What the crap are you doing!\u0022 screamed Juford.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnke unlatched her helmet, then her head pounded, and shook with the cold. She shook off the pain then tried to revive Tiffany. Juford was still screaming at her but she didn\u0027t care. Several seconds later, Juford behind her flicked several switches. Then again her head pounded as oxygen ran freely into the cabin. Her ears popped again and again and her breathing hurt. She was going to fall unconscious, but she shook off that feeling and started to strip Tiffany of her space suit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0The burn hole in the suit had penetrated through it, but Tiffany wore a specially thick interior suit under the excuse that she wasn\u0027t used to cold. Her body received a limited exposure to the vacuum of space, but enough to \u00A0kill her.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Tiffany, wake up please!\u0022 pleaded Anke, the pounding in her head had slowed and her breathing had normalized. Juford had took off his suit and was now communicating with Mission Control.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Anke is okay now. But Tiffany still looks terrible. Apparently the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0was firing without our notice and with our engineer out for the count, we can\u0027t repair it. We can either isolate the fuel source and never use it again, or we can try to Jerry-rig the system with a small chance of success.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMission Control paused for a while, coming up with an answer, \u0022Yes, we will send up instructions to Jerry-rig the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E. Also with that batch we will send up the instructions for the insertion burn in two hours.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right, and what do we do about Tiffany?\u00A0She\u0027s still unconscious.\u0022 asked Juford.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain there was a pause, then they replied, \u0022Put her in the service bay and be sure to keep her warm. Also put some alorvera on her burns, that should help.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnke put on some head phones on the chair and butted in, \u0022This is Anke, what should we do about Tiffany?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Anke, we need you put her in her hammock in the service bay and keep her warm. As soon as she\u0027s okay, come back up were you will receive the insertion burn data and execute it in two hours.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnke disconnected, then went to work.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn thirty\u00A0later Juford drifted out of the CM with tools, ready to tackle the problem ahead. Luckily he was good at following instructions and so he figured he had a 50% chance of making it work.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe drifted around, then grabbed at the CM\u0027s ladder as he floated above the port RSC thruster. Suddenly a burst of white hydrogolic fluid flew out towards him, threatening to melt his suit. He dodged backwards, skidding up the CM. The tool bag around his shoulder clanked but he did not hear it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Butterfly started to rotate slowly. He looked up at the night sky, then slowly Olei moved into view from behind the pod.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Crap.\u0022 he muttered. He then started to work quickly on the jerrry-rig. After an hour\u00A0of hard and sweaty work, the RSC ports should now be directly linked to the CM.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe looked down, and gasped as Olei loomed below him. The insertion burn would happen in thirty minutes, so he needed to get a move on.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Anke, can you control the RSC thrusters?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Checking.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA spurt of fluid shot in the blackness and the Lightning started to move its engines towards the planet.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Checked.\u0022 Anke couldn\u0027t keep the cheerfulness out of her voice.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Great, I\u0027m coming inside then we need to burn.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00226s0SvRy.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6s0SvRy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThirty minutes later they were orintated correctly, \u0022Firing engines in 10. 9.\u00A08. 7. 6. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1.

It was another Valor class rocket and the launch was fairly uneventful. Since the planned orbit would be a high one, and the capsule didn\u0027t carry alot of electrical charge, it would launch straight up then get into orbit using a new terrier rocket motor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe rose up through the sky, until she was nothing but another star in the night. Jeb rushed to mission control and watched from there her orbital insertion burn.

Joener watched the recovery teams pull out and follow Jeb\u0027s lead, then he returned to mission control.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA hour later Jeb saw a column\u00A0of smoke in the air over where Val\u0027s location was. His heart quickened and his foot was pressed on the gas even harder. He turned down a forest path and drove full speed ahead. The recovery teams wisely parked outside and entered on foot.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb ran directly into a clearing and into a mud field. He slammed the brakes, but his car kept on going. He unbuckled, opened the door and leaped out. The car slammed into a tree moments later, and his body hit the ground hard.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jeb, is that you?\u0022 said a voice like Val\u0027s.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb stood up, his body aching.

With a few puffs of her EVA pack, she flew off twenty meters away, then held up the camera.

The stars slowly departed from her sight as the blue of the atmosphere began to engulf the blackness. The gs piled on top of one another, reaching peak of 4gs, then it waned. Soon it reached a sufficient one g. Anke flicked a switch, then drogue chutes deployed.

Nothing terrible happened and Bob didn\u0027t complain at any point of the mission. He had returned with all the science we would need for going to Olei, Gaia\u0027s main moon.The problem with Olei is that it orbits in a perfect polar orbit, which had its difficulties give or take.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb and Bill walked into Mission Control,Bill carrying an armful of blueprints.

Amateurs tell us that something shimmers on the surface of this crater. Our large telescopes say that there are patches some light spots which are located at the bottom of the crater. We can\u0027t tell if these are shimmering, but some patterns rearrange in these light spots which could mean a liquid substance. \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Do you have a rocket which can get us there?\u0022 asked Yifu, slightly skeptical.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, in fact we plan to send five kerbals to the surface of this crater.

He took a door on the side, marked as employees only, and walked quickly down the narrow hall. He turned right at the first intersection and then opened the door at the end of that long passage. He entered a sitting room where several kerbals lounged about, kerbonauts taking a break it seemed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Anyone seen where Anke is?\u0022 he asked the kerbals.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of them pointed out the door, \u0022You go out there then turn to your left.

There the last we saw, she was smooching with Ronfort.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb frowned, then went on his way down the hall. He reached the eighth door and opened it. Ronfort was in the mock-up of the Moonshot and Anke was nowhere to be seen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey Ronfort.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe turned to face him, one eye black and puffy, \u0022Hey Jeb.

I couldn\u0027t see much for a minute, but she left the room by the main door.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb nodded, \u0022What was the offense?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRonfort smiled painfully, \u0022Ah, I kissed her. She apparently\u00A0had someone else she wanted to have kissing for, so she paid me back with a punch.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s a good shiny one.\u0022 commented Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, she\u0027s pretty strong. Listen, I wouldn\u0027t go around looking for her if I were you. I probably be best for your health.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I need her to fly a mission, that\u0027s all.\u0022 Jeb inwardly accused himself a lair, then bugged out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs\u00A0he closed the door he saw Anke\u0027s back as she entered another room. He went up to that door and knocked.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Come in.\u0022 came the unmistakable voice of Anke.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb opened the door and entered. It was a woman\u0027s lounge. Luckily, only Anke was there.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, Jeb.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb quickly back towards the door, \u0022Oh, sorry. I just need to see you. I didn\u0027t know that this was a private room.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnke smirked, \u0022Private room, rubbish. What have you to say?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I need a conference with you and some rookies about a mission, can you gather together a group that you think are the best here without experience. It\u0027s about a mission.\u0022 Jeb opened the door and stole out of the room.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next hour later in the conference room. Anke entered with three rookies behind her.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022These Kerbal are Largpond, Wifig, and Higulf. They have the highest grades here. Now what is this mission?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The mission will go and land on Gol\u0027s main crater. There will be five kerbals on board, five. Anke will be piloting while I\u0027ll be co-piloting. Largpond, Wifig and Higulf should be in the hitchhiker where there should be plenty of room.\u00A0\u00A0The total elapsed mission time should be about four days, so its going to be just a little jaunt.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The launch will be in a week, so start training.\u0022 Jeb concluded.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rookies left the room, leaving Anke and Jeb going over the plans of the rocket laid out on the table.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You will be cutting the delta-v requirements very tight.\u0022 commented Anke, \u0022Within a hundred m/s.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Don\u0027t worry, everything will be alright.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Because you\u0027re co-piloting?\u0022 Anke muttered sarcastically.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Because you\u0027re piloting.\u0022 Jeb smirked.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next week the rocket sat on the launch pad ready to go. This launch drew large crowds, the stands which usually sat half-full were packed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u002210. 9. 8. 7. 6. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1. Lift-off!\u0022 The rocket streaked through the sky. Jeb watched the curvature of Gaia as the rocket rose higher and higher. The gs were impressive on this launch. The twin-boar engine threw its full weight behind the rocket, propelling it on towards Gol. The faint red glow from the massive crater adding to the feel.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Detaching second stage.\u0022 Jeb flicked a switch and the first stage departed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Firing second stage.\u0022 The engine kicked in, propelling them to LGO.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Engine off.\u0022 Anke dictated and Jeb dutifully did as ordered. It was a new experience being the co-pilot, but it wasn\u0027t unfavorable.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe radio crackled, \u0022Sending up maneuver node.\u0022 Jeb leaned back and sighed, it was the same for every mission. The heavy launch, the lighter insertion burn, the message of mission control saying that a maneuver was being plotted. The receiving of the maneuver node, then the burn which sent them to Gol.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb drifted down into the hitchhiker container, where Largpond, Wifig, and Higulf sat, talking about the launch.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Does anyone want to go Eva? Its your chance.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027ll go.\u0022 said Wifig.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe suited up and left the capsule. Thirty minutes later he entered, his face glowing with the experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Here\u0027s a photo I snapped.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222yGV0lZ.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2yGV0lZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo and a half hours later they burned into Low Gol Orbit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ZJJSdiT.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZJJSdiT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Plotting landing site.\u0022 said Jeb. He looked out the window at Gol below him. Anke watched him out of the corner of her eye. Jeb was a busybody. He had to be expending energy so that he didn\u0027t explode. He was doing good work though. Jeb turned towards her, and Anke quickly resumed her gaze on the dashboard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Anke, we need to preform crew reports and Eva reports over the site to get a feel for what we will find.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnke waved off that comment, \u0022There shouldn\u0027t be much there underneath the dust. We\u0027ll land at our first opportunity.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, we need to see if there is anything harmful, like, i don\u0027t know, magma. Or harmful structures. We must see if there\u0027s anything which could kill us.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnke faced Jeb, \u0022Who is\u00A0the commander?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You are, but I\u0027m the secondary officer, and I\u0027m telling you that you can get all of us killed.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022My word is final Jeb!\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You could get us all killed because of your impatience! I refuse to allow this order to happen!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You moron!\u0022Anke glared at Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey glared at each other, not blinking. Then the sounds of a scuffle downstairs alerted their attention.\u00A0\u00A0Jeb floated down to the hitchhiker container and saw Wifig and Higulf in the middle of the room in a headlock.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Break it up for goodness sake.\u0022 Jeb floated into them and started to wrestle them apart. He just managed to hold the struggling pair of them at bay.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Now what in the world are you fighting about.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey just kept struggling. Anke floated down and seeing the scene shouted, \u0022STOP.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb loosened his grip on them for a second, then they collided, knocking on another out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What a fine mess.\u0022 gripped Jeb, \u0022Largpond, put these kerbals in their seats and see that they stay there. We have to land.\u0022 Jeb shot a glance at Anke, and floated back up to the command pod.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMinutes later they de-orbited. Jeb had complained, but gave in at last after threats of insubordination.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027re about to come over the crater. Once you here me say fire, you will throttle the engine to 100% on the spot.\u0022 ordered Anke.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb rolled his eyes, \u0022Alright, my life is at stake as well.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crossed over the ridge and zoomed underneath the dust cloud hanging over the crater.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Everything is overheating!

Fire.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb throttled the engine up, and then started a yelling competition with Anke, \u0022See, if we land in magma, we die instantly! Even then if we find dry land, we have only a few minutes or we explode due to overheating, blast it!\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We are going to land Jeb, there is nothing you can do!\u0022 Anke turned back to the controls.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022c2xqMdu.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/c2xqMdu.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Horizontal Velocity canceled.

The spacecraft shook and rumbled, oscillating around retrograde. Th gs were piling up, the concrete brick which lay on his chest grew to his house on Gaia. Anke also was experiencing heavy g forces. His mind turned to the conversation he had with Wifig and Higulf after they regained consciousness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I didn\u0027t realize\u00A0that we were fighting each other. It was like I was in a dream. I couldn\u0027t control myself;\u00A0I have nothing against Wifig here.\u0022 said Higulf, acting as the spokeskerbal for the two of them. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe capsule shook some more, vibrations rippling through the spacecraft. A red button flashed, then with a whoosh, the air in the cabins were ejected. Jeb looked in alarm at Anke, who glanced back, her eyes reflecting his fear. Luckily everyone was wearing spacesuits. But, what had caused the ejection of the atmosphere. Suddenly the spacecraft shuttered one last time, then flipped prograde. The exterior of the capsule started to burn away. More explosions, now audible through the thin exteriors of the walls. Heat was filtering in. The outer mesh of the skin burnt to a crisp. Suddenly their capsule broke away from the other capsule where the other three sat. Jeb strained to look out the window.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe g forces subsided, but they were separated from the other capsule.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Eject!\u0022 cried Jeb, grabbing all the experiments. Anke strapped on a parachute, then jettisoned the hatch. She leaped out of it and disappeared. Jeb jumped out of the capsule then pulled his parachute. He heard a thud as the capsule slammed into the ground. He followed suit. Pain filled his vision, then he passed out.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe woke up, stretched out around a fire. The other kerbonauts were there, their suits blackened. Anke was no where to be seen. It was getting twilight.

Largpond and Higulf had gone to look for supplies. The sample bags and reports where placed under rocks to keep them from disappearing unexpectedly. Anke was busily collected what little remained of the two capsules which plummeted to Gaia.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnke looked up from her work, \u0022Looks like you\u0027re finally wake.

You were right in wanting to be cautious.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuddenly the other three kerbals rushed into the clearing, \u0022There\u0027s some sort of monster out there! Its hunting us!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA giant ant-like insect followed closely behind. Anke grabbed a piece of shrapnel and threw it at its head. It embedded itself into its skull, sending it to the ground.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWifig sighed a huge sigh of relief. Three days later, a helicopter\u0027s blades were heard in the distance. Anke pilled fresh leaves on the fire, sending up a cloud of smoke.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe helicopter became visible, its blades spinning crazily. It lowered itself down, and deployed landing gear. Jeb punched the air from his position on the floor.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt deposited its clumsy self on the floor, then the door opened. Medical personal jumped out of the helicopter and Wefly himself followed behind.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jeb, are you hurt?\u0022 asked Wefly, standing at Jeb\u0027s side.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, both of my legs are broken. Now please take us home.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFour months later Jeb watched the launch of the Gullis 1 rocket. Val, Joener, and a newbie scientist consisted of the mission. KSP had its eyes on Gullis. Strange geographical features were noticed on this moon, including a large scarred patch of the moon. The first Gullis was meant to discover what liquids were frozen on the surface of the moon. Later a manned base would be set up where constant investigation of the scarred patch of land would occur.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rocket soon reached orbit, then plotted its trajectory to Gullis. Soon afterwards the departure burn was executed and the Gullis left LGO. Jeb could only watch from Mission Control, his broken legs had suspended him from space flight in the near future.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe kerbals in the Gullis mission were doing a video for the general news.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Here is the interior of the space craft. The cockpit here is tiny, just made to fit one kerbal. In fact it is of the same design which was used when we were still struggling to make it into space. I hear that the scientists are working on a bigger, better cockpit which can hold up to 3 kerbals. \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe video camera caught a swift glimpse as it reached into the Mk1 cockpit, then was jerked out to view the interior of the hitchhiker storage container. The camera panned over to Val\u0027s face, she was smiling wide.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This is a quick hello to Jeb, my younger brother who just a few months ago, broke both of his legs when he narrowly survived death from jumping from a parachute-less capsule meters from the ground. He waves that off as an everyday occurrence. Now Jeb, I know this will hurt but, I\u0027m going to get to Gullis before you.\u0022 She smirked again, then the video ended. Jeb smiled big. Of course he wouldn\u0027t get to Gullis before Val, but he got to Gol before Val, so that was something.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the end of the video, a picture appeared.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/n2vIRaI.png\u0022 alt=\u0022n2vIRaI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWefly walked up to the sitting figure and pulled up a chair. They sat for a while in silence, then Welfy spoke, \u0022Jeb, there are speculations about this new universe. Telescopes have found increasing evidence that this was once the Kerbin system, but we have renamed some of the objects, not knowing that they are familiar. Gol is the remains of the Mun, Gullis is what used to be Minmus. Olei and Olemut were captured by Gaia. Duna and Eve still exist. We aren\u0027t so sure of Jool and Eeloo. The solar system has gone over a complete overhaul.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb smiled, \u0022Isn\u0027t this a better place than the old Kerbin system? This is heaven, isn\u0027t it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Heaven with violent motives. This isn\u0027t heaven. A kerbal died earlier today, he was pushed off of a cliff. The offender has no memory of that accident and still agrees that the two of them were best friends, and he\u0027s about to be hanged. Kerbals are getting increasingly violent, and there is nothing we can do to stop.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The Player put us here, it can\u0027t be that bad.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How do you know it was the player.

What used to be highland plains stretching on for miles was just totally wrecked. The mountains were carved out of these highlands were long and thin, covering hundreds of square kilometers. It looked like a gigantic scar across the face of the moon.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This must be connected to what happened on Gol.\u0022 remarked Neldo, her eyes fixed on it.

He straightened out the paper and reread his report.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Do you think this does it justice?\u0022 asked Joener, handing over the paper to Val.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe briefly scanned it, then handed it back, \u0022Very poetic of you. Indeed, very poetic.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoener put the paper into a sealed bag and stored it in the experiments folder. Val sat down in her seat and started to boot up the reaction wheels. Joener gazed at her back. He had been watching her for this last six months, his mind made up. He had fell in love with Val the moment he saw her. Joener;\u00A0however, was short of nerve when dealing with kerbettes. Neldo had seen right though him from the beginning, and was willing to put in a word or two for his sake. His mind was further more in turmoil since the three of them had seen alot of each other lately for the last seven days. His love for Val had began to filter into his actions, ad he was painfully aware at the times he stared at her back when she was busy at some task.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe burn into low orbit was completed minutes afterward. Joener stared into space, then was roused by Val\u0027s voice breaking into his mind.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Joener, I need you to check the instruments while I\u0027ll plot our landing site.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes Ma\u0027m.\u0022 Joener focused his eyes on Val, then turned away embarrassed. He pushed himself off of a wall and drifted over to the instrument board. His firsts order of business was hitting the monitor hard with his fist. The dials fluttered, then started to spin.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Joener, what did you do!\u0022 cried Val, staring at the whirling numbers.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoener cringed into the corner, \u0022I have no idea.\u0022 Joener looked for the plug, then unplugged the cord. The dials stopped spinning. Joener sighed, \u0022Looks like that did it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Do you know that it has to be plugged in to work?\u0022 Val frowned down at him, he chuckled nervously. Suddenly a red light turned on on the panel.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Freaking mother of crap!\u0022 Joener swore, jumping into the micro-gravity.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Get your blasted butt out of this ship and repair that leak!\u0022 ordered Val. Joener raced as fast as he could down to the airlock and quickly changed into a suit. He didn\u0027t wait for the lock to depressurize, but opened the door and ejected the air into space. With a few thrusts of his eva pack, he rocketed over to the place where fuel spewed from where the leak was located. With some quick duct taping he sealed the opening, then added a little bit more just to make sure. He looked up from his task and stared at the aqua-green landscape.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Val, had you had a good look of Gullis?\u0022 he asked through the radio in his helmet.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, I think so. By the way, there must be another leak or something\u0027s wrong with the monitor.\u0022 Val reminded him of his task, and he continued his repairs, talking to her on the way, \u0022You have been to Minmus before, haven\u0027t you. I listened to Jeb\u0027s stories before, and Gullis looks a little to much like mint ice cream, to reference Minmus of course.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Cut the chatter please Joener, you\u0027re wearing me down.\u0022 Joener sighed, then turned off his mic. This was a wonderful start, annoying the kerbette he loved by being poetic and thinking upon things which could be thought later. The second hole was easy to patch and in no time he was back in the airlock. He\u00A0cycled the air carefully then stripped the suit. Even though he was working in a very easy condition, his interior suit was drenched in sweat and the suit smelled oddly of himself.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt took several hours before pin pointing what had caused everything to go wrong. It happened to be that he forgot that there were two plugs in the panel, so it was completely expected that it should have still worked. Apparently a micro-meteoroid had passed through the fuel tank and exited the other side, leaving two clean holes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Joener, sorry for being crabby, we need everyone on this team to stay together.\u0022 Joener looked up from where he had strapped himself into the wall, sweat floating off into the air.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Its okay.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal nodded, \u0022Then you better get a towel and soak up all the liquid you\u0027re dripping.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoener nodded, then got to work cleaning up his mess.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSoon later they de-orbited the lander and started to head to the lowland beaches. Joener watched in fascination has Val handled the vehicle, sending it drifting towards the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TdKAc9N.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TdKAc9N.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00221,000 meters.\u0022 Joener read off his numbers. In a few seconds the engines should come online. He waited. Seconds passed, and the artificial gravity of the engine hadn\u0027t been activated yet. He looked at Val, her face showed her full concentration on the landing. 750 meters passed and the engine didn\u0027t activate. 500 meters and still he floated, his arms free at his sides. At 250 meters he closed his eyes, knowing that something had gone wrong with the re-ignition of the poodle which had carried them this far. Suddenly the roar of hydrogen and oxygen being pumped into the ignition chamber was heard, as most as soon as the dull thud of the rocket engine kicked against the weight of the landing, decreasing its speed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoener opened his eyes. They were alive and intact on the surface of Gullis.

I have heard of the marvelous things you have accomplished in the last year, including the landings on Gol and Gullis. I am proud of how you have done so far under my superior, Wefly Kerman. But there is room for improvement. We have not yet visited the celestial body of Olei and its moon Olemut.

He had enjoyed Wefly\u0027s time as the director of space travel, it was nice to see one of his friends leading the space agency. Now this new director seemed different. He was the son of Werhner Von Kerman, one of the followers of the Kraken back on Kerbin and had helped to plot of Kerbin\u0027s demise.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hello Jebediah, my father said knew you well.\u0022 Junior Von Kerman interrupted his thoughts from behind him.

I was wondering what you thought of my speech, it was brilliant, wasn\u0027t it?\u0022 He said aloofly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb made a noncommittal sound and started to back away.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJunior stepped alongside him and asked, \u0022Did you think Wefly did justice to your position?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, very well indeed.\u0022 replied Jeb, slight irritably.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Then why aren\u0027t you the head of the kerbonaut operations, chief kerbonaut.\u0022 Junior listed half-a-dozen grand sounding\u00A0titles and then thinking that the ground was softened, continued, \u0022If you support my office, then I will see to it that you receive all these titles.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb\u0027s head\u00A0was spinning, the first day, the first hour Junior spent in office was to get him, a simple kerbonaut with a lot of history, on his side. A part of his mind glowed at the thought of accepting, but Jeb quickly decided to put off the decision for later.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thank you very much, but I would like to think it over, in 6 hours I will give you your answer.\u0022 he added, seeing the look of unbelief on Junior\u0027s face.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb extracted himself out of the crowd and ten minutes later arrived at the kerbonaut complex. There he arrived at his apartment and shut the door. He stood, thinking aloud to himself as he started to pace up and down the small room, \u0022What\u0027s wrong with the offer, anyway?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe looked at the shabbiness of the place, then continued, \u0022Junior is a good guy at heart, isn\u0027t he, if not in body. I wonder what the pay would be for a chief kerbonaut?\u0022 His conscious twitched uncertainly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022All I have to do is say a few things, support several decisions, and all my money troubles are over.\u0022 again he frowned.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027re on the same side, if there are even sides since the Kraken vanished.\u0022 his mind turned back to his conversation with Wefly, about where they were in the \u0027spiritual\u0027 universe.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Confound it.\u0022 he muttered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDown in the science lab, Bob faked a grin, \u0022You see, sir, our research into solid core nuclear rocket motors, or simply nuclear engines.\u0022 He simplified for Junior as Bob gestured wildly at a large engine bell embedded into a wall. Dozens of cores and fuel pipes dangled from the ceiling, feeding into the test engine.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022When finished, it should be able to produce over 1,000 kilonewtons of thrust at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E of 3 times of any engine we have created on Gaia.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJunior pondered the test engine with a look of disgust at the uncleanliness, \u0022You know, my father was a great rocket scientist, but I have always preferred the business side of science. I think I have done that part better than any of my predecessors.\u0022 He waited for a moment, then continued on a different subject.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022When can you build this?\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, we need more time. Our best scientists say in two or three years without any significant developments.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Bob, I need you to answer me truthfully.\u0022 Bob looked at Junior uncertainly, wondering what caused Juniors voice to become so much more serious.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Can a Kraken drive exist?\u0022 He gazed into Bob\u0027s bemused face, hoping for one moment of recognition, \u0022You know, a engine which can harness the power of the Kraken.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The Kraken was defeated by the programmer, this entire universe is kraken-free.\u0022 stated Bob, still thinking why Junior was bringing this up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How do you know? How do you know that the Kraken here is, is different.\u0022 Junior pressed his attack.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I, I personally think it doesn\u0027t exist, now if you excuse me, some of my scientists need me.\u0022 Bob walked quickly away towards the engine bell. He glanced behind him to see Junior stalking off towards the administration building.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next week saw the launch of the Lighting 1, the first manned mission to\u00A0Olei. Jeb watched from the sidelines as Anke and two newbies rocketed away into the clear blue sky. Jeb sat staring at the cloud of smoke which the Lighting left behind, thinking over his decision he made about Junior. Was he right or was he wrong, they were both on the same side, but their paths barely crossed in the region of their personality.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Anke, I hope you think I did the right thing. I wish I told you, maybe then you could have shed some light into the matter.\u0022 He muttered to himself as he stood up and stretched with the crowd. It would be about five days when Anke returned back to Gaia, five days later he would be having a long conversation on what to do, five days later if it all went to plan.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alpha 360","CreatedById":166007,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-04T18:19:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003EChapter 9: Olei\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ENews: I think I will now do a chapter once a week every Friday evening.

There\u0027s some thing wrong up here in the cockpit!\u0022 she yelled down to the service module where Tiffany was tinkering with the engine control programming.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Coming!\u0022 she drifted up the hatch and asked, \u0022What is wrong?\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Our course is changing slowly, could you go outside and check if the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E is firing?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sure.\u0022 she replied, and started to put on a suit. Minutes later when everyone was in a suit, they depressurized the cabin then opened the hatch. They couldn\u0027t see anything from inside the hatch, so Tiffany pushed off through the hatch.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It looks like there\u0027s noth.....\u0022 A high pitch squeal of terror sounded through the mic.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Tiffany!\u0022 Anke cried, pushing herself out as well. The limp body was floating over an RSC port, which looked off. Wasting no time she grabbed the body and climbed inside.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Tiffany, what happened!\u0022 Anke demanded.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Her vital signs are fading!\u0022 she could just hear mission control panicking in the back ground. Anke closed the hatch, \u0022Re-pressurize the interior now!\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But.\u0022 Juford started to protest but Anke stopped him.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Get it re-pressurized now or Tiffany might die!\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJuford nodded then flicked several switches. Oxygen started to fill the chamber. Anke looked closely over her body, then noticed a gaping hole in the back of the suit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022NO!\u0022 cried Anke slapping her helmet.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe tore off Tiffany\u0027s helmet, the cabin only half full of oxygen. Her face was purple, but still unconscious.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What the crap are you doing!\u0022 screamed Juford.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnke unlatched her helmet, then her head pounded, and shook with the cold. She shook off the pain then tried to revive Tiffany. Juford was still screaming at her but she didn\u0027t care. Several seconds later, Juford behind her flicked several switches. Then again her head pounded as oxygen ran freely into the cabin. Her ears popped again and again and her breathing hurt. She was going to fall unconscious, but she shook off that feeling and started to strip Tiffany of her space suit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0The burn hole in the suit had penetrated through it, but Tiffany wore a specially thick interior suit under the excuse that she wasn\u0027t used to cold. Her body received a limited exposure to the vacuum of space, but enough to \u00A0kill her.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Tiffany, wake up please!\u0022 pleaded Anke, the pounding in her head had slowed and her breathing had normalized. Juford had took off his suit and was now communicating with Mission Control.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Anke is okay now. But Tiffany still looks terrible. Apparently the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0was firing without our notice and with our engineer out for the count, we can\u0027t repair it. We can either isolate the fuel source and never use it again, or we can try to Jerry-rig the system with a small chance of success.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMission Control paused for a while, coming up with an answer, \u0022Yes, we will send up instructions to Jerry-rig the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E. Also with that batch we will send up the instructions for the insertion burn in two hours.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right, and what do we do about Tiffany?\u00A0She\u0027s still unconscious.\u0022 asked Juford.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain there was a pause, then they replied, \u0022Put her in the service bay and be sure to keep her warm. Also put some alorvera on her burns, that should help.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnke put on some head phones on the chair and butted in, \u0022This is Anke, what should we do about Tiffany?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Anke, we need you put her in her hammock in the service bay and keep her warm. As soon as she\u0027s okay, come back up were you will receive the insertion burn data and execute it in two hours.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnke disconnected, then went to work.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn thirty\u00A0later Juford drifted out of the CM with tools, ready to tackle the problem ahead. Luckily he was good at following instructions and so he figured he had a 50% chance of making it work.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe drifted around, then grabbed at the CM\u0027s ladder as he floated above the port RSC thruster. Suddenly a burst of white hydrogolic fluid flew out towards him, threatening to melt his suit. He dodged backwards, skidding up the CM. The tool bag around his shoulder clanked but he did not hear it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Butterfly started to rotate slowly. He looked up at the night sky, then slowly Olei moved into view from behind the pod.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Crap.\u0022 he muttered. He then started to work quickly on the jerrry-rig. After an hour\u00A0of hard and sweaty work, the RSC ports should now be directly linked to the CM.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe looked down, and gasped as Olei loomed below him. The insertion burn would happen in thirty minutes, so he needed to get a move on.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Anke, can you control the RSC thrusters?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Checking.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA spurt of fluid shot in the blackness and the Lightning started to move its engines towards the planet.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Checked.\u0022 Anke couldn\u0027t keep the cheerfulness out of her voice.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Great, I\u0027m coming inside then we need to burn.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00226s0SvRy.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6s0SvRy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThirty minutes later they were orintated correctly, \u0022Firing engines in 10. 9.\u00A08. 7. 6. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1. Ignition!\u0022 The engines flickered, then burned for the minute required. Then they were in orbit.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022JLWNSuX.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JLWNSuX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright, we will send the landing sequence up to you in three hours.\u0022 reported Mission Control. \u0022Also, how is Tiffany. On this end, her vital signs are nominal.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022She looks fine right now. She should be alright in a few hours, then she can help us land.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThree hours later the three of them sat in the cockpit, the maneuver node plotted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Landing maneuver in 3. 2. 1. Ignition!\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe nuclear engines growled, and blue flames sprouted from the engine bells.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a quick ten seconds, red lights flashed in the cockpit, \u0022Abort to orbit, repeat abort to orbit!\u0022 alerted Mission Control.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022WHY?\u0022 Tiffany questioned Mission Control ferociously, \u0022I designed those darn things, why are they not working?\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA slight explosion rocked the space craft, but it returned to the maneuver node vector.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Abort to orbit. There is a very high possibility that the fuel tanks will explode. I repeat abort to orbit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Detaching the Nuk stage.\u0022 replied Anke, pressing a button which sent the stage flying towards the moon\u0027s surface.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Anke! That is highly radioactive waste you are just dumped on the surface. We will have a load of people at our throats for this!\u0022 cried the Junior Von Kerman who just entered the fray.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We are landing this mission. Now please, when do we fire the poodle.\u0022 Anke spoke with authority, \u0022Because if you don\u0027t, we will hit the moon and die with our deaths on your hands.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was an awkward second of silence, then a maneuver node appeared on the screen.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Excuting maneuver node in 3. 2. 1.
