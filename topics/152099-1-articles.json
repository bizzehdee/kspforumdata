Yes, yes, I know blaming a game\u0027s QA system is one of those internet things everyone does, like complaining about certain bands, and hating certain kinds of clothes. But remember that these are good people, many of the testers are unpaid volunteers, and they do a technical and frequently tedious job of discovering problems, tracing the sources, and reporting them to do the devs, for the sake of making the game we all like better. And they do get to feeling sad and discouraged when they get hit with so much blame and negativity. So I would like to take a moment to thank them for their efforts on our behalf, and I invite others to do so as well.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you, QA/testing teams! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Just Jim","CreatedById":148725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-15T22:27:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgreed,\u00A0thank you to everyone involved in making KSP even better!!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEmiko Kerman loves all of you!!!! \u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-15T22:39:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks QA guys.

I simply cannot say anything without repeating what has already been said. The QA that was put in place after the fiasco of 1.0 worked extremely well and the end result was a highly polished product.

QA testing is a task that often misunderstood and so it\u0027s easy to point blame at it and wonder how this mystical process somehow managed to miss an \u0022obvious\u0022 bug.
