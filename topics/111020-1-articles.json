As the Pastebin also shows, I\u0027m running Kubuntu 14.04 and KSP 64bit 1.0.2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have noticed that my performance was really poor ingame, so I installed GCMonitor to find out a bit more about what was going on, and what I could remove to improve the framerate\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it turns out, framerate was NOT being recorded as being an issue, instead being stable at 25-30 fps (yea yea not perfect, whatever, I can live with 25). But the game stutters all over the place. Interestingly enough, if I hide the UI (f2) the stuttering is gone completely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking around a bit, I found that Contrac Window \u002B was often cited as being a heavy offender when it comes for this issue, so I removed that, as well as other UI-heavy mods I had. The situation has improved, slightly, but when playing with the UI on, there\u0027s still a noticeable stuttering issue\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestion is, is it possible to fix? If not, what do I need to remove to lessen the effect as much as possible?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you very much for the assistance, let me know if anything else is required\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zeropositivo","CreatedById":133563,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T19:21:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI hate to do this, but any assistance would really be welcome...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T19:24:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know about addons, but the stock game will stutter if your mouse polling rate is too high, and most gamers have a high DPI mouse these days.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zeropositivo","CreatedById":133563,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T19:31:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t know about addons, but the stock game will stutter if your mouse polling rate is too high, and most gamers have a high DPI mouse these days.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eis it as simple as reducing mouse DPI, or is there another trick to it? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the reply\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OddFunction","CreatedById":143805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T21:40:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOP,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am a linux 64bit user.

It went from being unplayable for me to very smooth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease note that many gaming mouses do not support linux. So in order for your new \u0027125hz\u0027 setting to stick permanantly, you\u0027ll need to boot into an operating system that has your mouse drivers installed (usually windows), save the new profile with the new polling rate to the mouse instead of the system, and when you reboot in linux it should stick with the new settings. That\u0027s how I did it and I have absolutely no problems at all.
