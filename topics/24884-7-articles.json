Even if a pod was heated evenly to 700*, nothing describable as \u0022AC\u0022 would cool it fast enough to be relevant. At those temps, in atmosphere, the most effective cooling will be purely passive, ie into the surrounding air via convection/radiation. The SR-71 had systems for cooling metal in reentry-like conditions because it lived in those conditions for hours. (in short, its fuel absorbed the heat and was burnt, sending the heat out the tailpipe). Space capsules need only survive a couple minutes. The air inside doesn\u0027t have time to heat before the reentry is over and entire capsule is cooling down.\u003Cp\u003EAs for getting close to the sun, continuous 700* is a problem. But the answer is gold foil. 0.0001mm of gold or silver will passively hold off even the most intense sunlight. The side of the craft facing away from the sun also radiates heat out into space. Between the protection on one side and passive cooling on the other, active systems are not essential.

Also, it is not possible to setup the mod to use an alternate resource if the primary is not available through the config file, but it is possible to add a pod generator to convert the alternate resource into the primary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should add though that kerbals will not die from lack of electric charge anymore, their command pods just stop working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also look into modelling temperature a bit more and it seams like handling it properly would be quite involved. As others have pointed out in a vacuum to actually get rid of it requires radiators or venting coolant gas. It\u0027s not just a question of using electrical power to run an air conditioner to move the heat around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo properly model heat you\u0027d have to take into consideration how much heat is produced by the ship and its systems, how much heat it is absorbing from the sun, how much heat is being dissipated through radiation, and how much is carried away by venting gasses such as engines and RCS thrusters. To manage it you\u0027d need extra parts like radiators and solar shades as well as possibly resources and generators to provide heat and cooling as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd most heat management would probably handled by static systems consisting of solar shades and radiators. It adds a bit to the craft design but not much to be managed during the actual mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really do like the idea of it though. It would add a little bit of immersion to be able to monitor your cabin temperature.

If you put the rocket on the pad and right click the crewed parts you should see a reading on how much power they\u0027re consuming. I think the default rate is 10/h \u002B 5/h * crew capacity, and it looks like the Munbug has two cupola pods so that is 30/h. Form the wiki, Mun has a rotational period of about 40h. At 30/h, 400 units of electric charge will last about 13h.
