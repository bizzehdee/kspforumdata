VTVL with a parachute for landing, since it requires less attention this way. I had to quicksave/quickload in orbit each time otherwise the repacked parachute would fall off on deployment, and quickloading on the ground would occasionally break physics for some reason... Anyway, you could go even more times than this with a Kerbal in a seat instead of a cockpit and adding a few more tons of jet fuel (maybe wings too if you want to carry so much fuel your takeoff TWR is less than 1), it just becomes a test of patience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/L2jid\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
