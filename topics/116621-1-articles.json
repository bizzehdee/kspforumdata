I can\u0027t say I\u0027m impressed. It looks kind of dull. No moons. No color. No air. Anyway I\u0027m writing this log today because I feel that logs should be available to all crewmembers in all universes after Hyperyear 1.1. A log is a very useful too for building up characters during long voyages. It can be used to describe one\u0027s thoughts about a situation. It may not have any science value and the public may not care too much for books (although if they did the space program may get a small cash bonus!), but taking pictures and writing words next to them can help to remember an important experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah. Jeb Kerman said it best. These would function similarly to flag plaques, where you get to write a message in the flag, except it is in log format and you can add screenshots to it. Logs could be output as a text file, or read in-game, or even just used solely for the sake of adding a small bit of immersion. They could even be used for taking important notes, all without breaking immersion by using notepad or word. I\u0027m not saying everyone should use it or that it should be a big feature, but I can see some people finding it useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EBob Kerman\u0027s Log Y17 D11 MET 1 Year and 4 days.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote to self: Nuclear engines explode when you crash them into mountains at orbital velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMax safe altitude of Dres: \u0026gt; 3 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, Jeb ate the snacks, so we will have to take the fuel lander and try to refine some snacks out of the Dresilian Regolith.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EBob Kerman\u0027s Log, supplemental.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStranded on Dres.
