Do you also have it checked as an objective? Not sure if that would make a difference, but it\u0027s worth a shot. Also, I down think a splashdown would count, as there\u0027s a specific Splashed Vessel node. If checking it as an objective doesn\u0027t help, perhaps you can check the objective box (with an alternate path checking a splashdown as an objective) and then use the Kerbal Recovery node as the end node. It might provide a way around the problem. Again, if nothing else, it\u0027s at least worth a shot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"frog352000","CreatedById":177141,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-01T05:09:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah I have it set up as an objective and it shows up in the actual mission as an objective with a checkered flag pattern beside it. I have used the splashed down node before and set it as an end node.
