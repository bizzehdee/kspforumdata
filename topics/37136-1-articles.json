Chalk it up to Subject, err, Pilot, 47A\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s incompetence. 6A through 6F were all just as bad. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m beginning to think my comrades in the Kerbal Space Center\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Engineering Department may be the only ones competent enough to actually operate these machines. And if you think I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m going to get anywhere near one of those deathtraps, then you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re just as dim as the rest of our Subjects. I mean pilots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESubject 47A was given a simple task, pilot the experimental FishCraft One SSTO to Low Kerbin Orbit. Spend two days measuring the effect of cosmic radiation on unprotected Kerbals, and return to land at Kerbal Space Center for further \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cstudy\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the first several minutes of the mission went as planned, Subject 47A failed to throttle down the turbofan engines before the designated 22km cutoff point. At 22.5km, the craft underwent an asymmetrical flameout, cartwheeling out of control and exceeding engineering tolerances shortly thereafter. Recovery operations are underway, though 47A\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s remains are almost certainly lost to us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe failure of the mission can only be attributed to Subject 47A. As a result, we are billing his surviving family members the entire cost of the rocket, launch operations and recovery effort. In the unlikely event they are unable to produce the $347,000,000.00, we have arranged for them to pay off their debt in our employ as test Subjects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPilots.
