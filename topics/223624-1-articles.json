I also know that the speed change affects other camera modes as well (I will create a bug for that if it does not exist yet).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut at some point during my game, one of the camera mode which is affected by the caption-cam-speed-change, is stuck at a very slow speed. Increasing the caption camera speed did not increase the speed of this one cam mode, making this mode totally useless because the cam was barely moving.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter some time more and more camera modes became that slow. Now I only have the \u0022horizon\u0022 and \u0022caption\u0022 cam working normally, all the other ones barely moving and not adjustable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReloading, restart game, restart PC did not change that behaviour.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there maybe a setting in the config file or on the save file which I can try to change to reset the camera speed?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mango 233","CreatedById":233067,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-06T14:07:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHad the same problem after playing for a long time, but created a save and loaded it can recover.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
