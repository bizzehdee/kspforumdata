The transfer stage then travels to the Mun, where it inserts into a 10km orbit. When the time to land comes, the transfer stage burns whatever fuel it has left to decelerate, then decouples the lander, which then continues decelerating and descends to land. After landing, it takes off again into a 10km, 90 degree heading orbit, from which it performs a retrograde ejection burn at the appropriate location that consumes pretty much all its remaining fuel.

You\u0027re launching straight into a transfer. Which by itself is not bad, if the opportunity presents itself, but in your case, there is no such opportunity. The Mun is completely elsewhere, which is the reason why you need to overshoot so much in order to get an encounter. You\u0027re basically trying to force an intercept by increasing your travel time to such a degree that the Mun has time to get where you will pass its orbit - you\u0027re traveling 24 hours for a trip that normally takes about 8.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there\u0027s the fact that you\u0027re going orbital velocity and faster while you\u0027re still deep in the atmosphere. You\u0027re below 40km when you get fast enough to comfortably orbit at 80km. And that means you are constantly losing a large amount of forward momentum to atmospheric drag. You should focus on first exiting the atmosphere, and then think about going other places. I\u0027m fairly sure you could almost \u003Cem\u003Ehalve\u003C/em\u003E the size of your rocket if you simply ascended out of the atmosphere and circularized before transferring. That\u0027s how much fuel you lose there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, because of how far you overshoot the Mun\u0027s orbit, you\u0027re going quite fast when you do encounter it, and you need more fuel to slow down again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, well.

You don\u0027t want to hover down slowly, you want to fall and then kill your vertical velocity in a short, hard burn close to the surface.

Via Scott Manley, any time spent falling vertically towards a planet means wasted energy, and he falls vertically for a long, long time. The most efficient landing is one where you get your orbit as close to the planet as possible before burning retrograde to land. This is because of the Oberth effect, which causes burns at higher speeds to be more energy efficient than burns at low speeds. So the highest speed you will reach on a munar mission will be your periapsis above Kerbin, making that the best time for an insertion burn, although if you start with a circular orbit then it makes little to no difference. Likewise, your munar periapsis is the best time to perform your insertion burn to be captured by the moon and to set up your landing. So ideally, you want to make a low circular orbit around Kerbin, make your burn for the Mun using a maneuver node so that you end up with a Munar periapsis of about 6500m to 7500. Then make a burn using a maneuver node to circularize your orbit around the Mun, again at around 7000m, and then another small burn that brings your periapsis inside the mun on the daytime side of the mun for easier landing. Next, for the most efficient landing, is a suicide burn. To do this, put a maneuver node very close but not quite to where your orbit goes inside the planet and pull retrograde until it flicks back and forth, meaning lateral speed goes to ~0 m/s. Start your burn when the burn time and the time to node are equal (if you are brave you can wait a few seconds after if you want but how long you can wait is dependent on terrain). This is kind of scary and dangerous as you are putting your life in the hands of the somewhat inaccurate Orbit Map terrain models. You\u0027ll flying very fast very very low but it ensures that your burns are made at the highest speeds possible for the greatest efficiency. Also, someday (soon?) I\u0027m sure the vanilla game will have deadly reentry stock so shallow reentry trajectories are a good practice.

The most efficient landing is one where you get your orbit as close to the planet as possible before burning retrograde to land. This is because of the Oberth effect, which causes burns at higher speeds to be more energy efficient than burns at low speeds. So the highest speed you will reach on a munar mission will be your periapsis above Kerbin, making that the best time for an insertion burn, although if you start with a circular orbit then it makes little to no difference. Likewise, your munar periapsis is the best time to perform your insertion burn to be captured by the moon and to set up your landing. So ideally, you want to make a low circular orbit around Kerbin, make your burn for the Mun using a maneuver node so that you end up with a Munar periapsis of about 6500m to 7500. Then make a burn using a maneuver node to circularize your orbit around the Mun, again at around 7000m, and then another small burn that brings your periapsis inside the mun on the daytime side of the mun for easier landing. Next, for the most efficient landing, is a suicide burn. To do this, put a maneuver node very close but not quite to where your orbit goes inside the planet and pull retrograde until it flicks back and forth, meaning lateral speed goes to ~0 m/s. Start your burn when the burn time and the time to node are equal (if you are brave you can wait a few seconds after if you want but how long you can wait is dependent on terrain). This is kind of scary and dangerous as you are putting your life in the hands of the somewhat inaccurate Orbit Map terrain models. You\u0027ll flying very fast very very low but it ensures that your burns are made at the highest speeds possible for the greatest efficiency. Also, someday (soon?) I\u0027m sure the vanilla game will have deadly reentry stock so shallow reentry trajectories are a good practice. Set up your return periapsis on Kerbin to around 20k to 30k meters for \u0022safe\u0022 reentry.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh, I didn\u0027t catch the deorbit burn when skimming through the video, just the final approach, which seemed OK.
