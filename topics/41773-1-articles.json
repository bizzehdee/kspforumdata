Finally, additional science packages could be taken up that would not necessarily contribute to the parts tree, but could generate income for the space agency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, just a thought, what do you guys think about it?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-09T13:34:01Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2013 01:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Exsmelliarmus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beeman","CreatedById":28178,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-09T20:30:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027re already planning on making research more or less tied to flights. Like, the more you fly, the more research...exeperience or something you gain. Somethin\u0027 like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHarvester was talking about it in a thread in general discussions the other day. Pretty interesting, but I don\u0027t remember anything specific as to what he was saying, just that he wanted research to happen from things you do, rather than investing time or money...basically, just waiting for research things to unlock. So that\u0027s the direction they\u0027re going with research and development and it\u0027ll probably include bonuses for doing things on other planets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI surely hope they can make the system really deep and complex while still being intuitive and accessible. Otherwise, there\u0027ll probably be at least one mod for such a thing in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nothke","CreatedById":51185,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-09T20:55:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI made a suggestion about this and threw some practical ideas:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/39155-Career-mode-material-bio-medical-particle-research\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/39155-Career-mode-material-bio-medical-particle-research\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Exsmelliarmus","CreatedById":75674,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T07:12:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, you\u0027ve go some great ideas nothke!
