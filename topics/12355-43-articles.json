The clock goes yellow, indicating the physics slowdown is kicking in, and everything slows down dramatically. Changing graphics settings makes no difference. It\u0027s persistent with the craft -- closing and reloading the game doesn\u0027t fix the issue; if you fly that craft again, the slowdown takes place immediately. Other craft don\u0027t seem to be affected.... unless you bring one of the \u0022infected\u0022 craft nearby.
