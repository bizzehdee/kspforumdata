That may not be realistic, but for gameplay reasons i\u00B4d prefer that over more, almost identical, parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe the Nerva would need another little balancing tweek after that. But all variety in the fuel tank department could be limited to size and shape and you could fill them with whatever you need, be it monoprepellant, LF, oxidizer or ion fuel (and whatever else modders might come up with). Maybe a function to color tanks (via the right-click menu) would be useful here - possibly with an optional auto-color scheme for various kinds of fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat i would not be entirely sure about is, wether a single fuel tank should then be able to hold various fuel-kinds. If consumption ratio of LF to OX was always 1:1, you could just attach two tanks of the same size, filling one with LF, the other with OX. So, maybe, by default at the beginning of career, only one kind of load per tank should be allowed and either techs or building upgrades could increase that number.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUI-wise, there could be an extra line above the fuel-tank section in the SPH/VAB, allowing the player to choose what the tanks he is attaching are filled with. If you are yet only allowed to fill any tank with one kind of fuel, you can only have one of these selected at any time. As that number increases during your career-game, you can have more fuel-types selected and tanks that you attach to your ship get auto-filled with the selected fuels in equal proportions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe right-click menu would otherwise as is (for further tweeking), with the exception, that the number of items on that list can be reduced and expanded (upto the limit mentioned above) and reduction of one amount will increase capacity for the other(s), too, and vice versa. It would feature little \u002B and - buttons like the stage-list, when applicable (e.g. \u0022-\u0022 only when at least 2 types are loaded, to delete one, \u0022\u002B\u0022 only when the number of types has not reached the limit, yet).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zolotiyeruki","CreatedById":150224,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-02T13:40:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s another thing that would be kinda cool: \u00A0a 3-seat Mk1-to Mk2 adapter/crew cabin. \u00A0So if you want to ship 4 Kerbonauts somewhere, you can use a Mk1 cockpit\u002Bcabin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blorgon","CreatedById":159569,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-04T04:39:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne small thing I was thinking about today is surface samples and how lame they are.
