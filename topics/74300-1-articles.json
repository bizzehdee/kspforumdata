They\u0027re simply too heavy and the intake of material is limited by the small size of the hole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main idea behind their formation is that shortly after the Big Bang the first stars were so massive that their cores collapsed into a black hole. But, unlike our stars they were massive enough to not go supernova. So you had a gigantic star getting eaten by a black hole from the inside out. But because the star was so gigantic it could last in this state for millions of years, force feeding the hole until it was big enough to grow to a supermassive black hole on its own.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-07T03:59:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe question is how stable this system is?
