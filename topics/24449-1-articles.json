I made a post about a week back and since then I\u0027ve successfully adapted to the \u0022New\u0022 KSP and have even made part of my Space Station that is orbiting Kerblin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow one of the things I used to do in the old KSP was modify Fuel Tanks to suit a design or a need, or just to made the tiniest craft make it to the moon. So seeing that I have a SS in orbit, i wanted to add on a fueling depot to it. While I\u0027d had some success getting it into orbit, my lazy side is thinking of the long-term. I\u0027d like to get a fuel depot into orbit with a gratuitous amount of fuel in the tanks. Like over 30,000 for re-fueling missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever modifying the fuel isn\u0027t as simple as it used to be. Now when increasing the liquid fuel and oxidizer, the weight will increase. Is there a way to increase these measures while keeping the weight down? Or a way to set the weight? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Flixxbeatz","CreatedById":29991,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T04:46:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think not, since it\u0027s already the way it works now.
