It was more complicated than I thought to figure out if an asteroid is nearby, but I got it working. You can get results while latched onto the asteroid or in space nearby (within 2km for now) based on how the experiment is setup in the ScienceDefs file.

You need the model and animation from the DMagic one, but the magnetometer module from Interstellar. Unfortunately you can\u0027t just replace one MODULE block with the other. Look for something with a line that says \u0022animName = ????\u0022 and -change the name of the animation- to match the other MODULE. I can try to share my edit when I get home (moderators: assuming this is ok??)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
