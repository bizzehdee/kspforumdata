The most popular is that Dres was once a part of a larger asteroid belt, but its fellow asteroids mysteriously disappeared. The scientists hope that these missing asteroids will return to Dres\u0027 orbit so that they can study them too. However, they have started to petition the Kerbal Space Centre about sending a probe with more detailed scientific instruments, and possibly something to explore the strange crater they observed around the equator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, it will probably take them years to submit a proposal, so let\u0027s get back to the task at hand!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill finally calmed down, and Jeb persuaded him to take off in his lander. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s14.postimg.org/ohaxgwdjl/screenshot724.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot724.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill had suggested that Jeb simply land using the transfer stage, but there was no response from Jeb.
