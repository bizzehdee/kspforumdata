CoM shifting should only happen when you enter the rocket stage and by that time lift shouldn\u0060t be an issue anymore.

With almost all my spaceplane designs, I keep a small(ish) tank of fuel near the front of the craft, which is locked down so no fuel will be drained out of it without specific instructions on my part. I usually try to get to orbit on the tanks further toward the back, then once I am secure with my engines idling, I transfer the fuel from the locked front tank to the rear tanks. It helps keep the center of mass forward for most of the flight, but without reducing the total amount of fuel I have to operate on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-05T00:47:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a bonus, a locked tank in front means you enhance aerodynamic stability as you ascend.
