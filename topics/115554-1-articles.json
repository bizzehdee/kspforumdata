For reasons. Dumb. If it were a real craft, then the mission could be repair (something an engineer could fix, giving them a role), or refueling, etc. If it to \u0022recover science,\u0022 then collect science and put it in your own pod.\n\nLike pretty much all the contracts in KSP, these are poorly executed."}]}
