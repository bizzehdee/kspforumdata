With an extra seat aboard \u003Cem\u003EFree Bird\u003C/em\u003E, Jeb went ahead and conducted a rescue of Burris Kerman, a pilot who had managed to get himself stuck up there. While Jeb was undergoing the orbital rendezvous ops, Berris and her group of tourists and KSC engineering staff visited the surface of the Mun, having docked \u003Cem\u003EStraight Flush 7\u003C/em\u003E at Munport 7 and taken the station\u0027s Buggy on down for flag-planting ops. They likewise had an extra seat so they went ahead and picked up Lucilla from the Mute City 7 base; contrary to expectations a great deal of Mun surface and flag planting contracts had not been received and Lucilla was begin to show signs of dementia from her extended stay on Mun, so it was time for her to come on back. The Buggy was re-docked at Munport and then \u003Cem\u003EStraight Flush\u003C/em\u003E un-docked from the station. \u003Cem\u003EStraight Flush\u003C/em\u003E did not have enough fuel to head back to Kerbin so a fuel pod for the station was sent up, extending the ship\u0027s visit there by an extra day. Orbital rendezvous ops for the fuel pod was ongoing at the same time that Jeb was making his final rendezvous with Burris\u0027s pod, which made for a busy evening. Burris was successfully rescued and Jeb went ahead and steered \u003Cem\u003EFree Bird\u003C/em\u003E in for docking ops at the Minmusport 7 base; Bob joined Kacella in operation of the base\u0027s science lab there and meanwhile Jeb is awaiting the arrival of Minmusport\u0027s Buggy, after which he\u0027ll take some of his tourists down. \u003Cem\u003EStraight Flush\u003C/em\u003E, meanwhile, is headed back to Kerbin at this point, the emptied fuel pod having been delivered to Munport.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn top of all of this is Valentina\u0027s history-making sun-dive attempt aboard \u003Cem\u003ESundiver 7\u003C/em\u003E.

They will reach periapsis in 27 days and make the final boost out to Jool\u0027s orbit at that point, and then in a year or so they\u0027ll be making the sundiving attempt. I\u0027m concerned that I may not have given them sufficient delta-V to return to Kerbin afterwards...and Val has not had much luck with tourists in this career save...but I\u0027m still somewhat hopeful for success.

Not much to be said about either flight, though I was very happy to land the Vulture. The first three Vulture missions didn\u0027t end all that well; I at least managed to save the plane on the third mission, which was then that I had the notion that what the design really needed was larger landing gear. I\u0027d futzed around with the design and launched it to re-supply the station. Night before last I went to land it and FAR underflowed, plowing the craft into the ocean after a nice, beautiful arcing ballistic dive. Fortunately I\u0027d quicksaved prior to the de-orbit burn; last night I did the de-orbit first thing, and this time around she felt like flying. Overshot KSC 09 on the first approach but I was able to get turned around and made a successful landing on KSC 27; first time in a while that nothing broke either during takeoff, during re-entry, or upon landing, so I was quite happy with the design changes overall.

Got ready to land there and wife comes home from dropping step-daughter off at friends across town, I hit F5 to save and escape to pause mid approach to assist with my 5 month old and comeback to machine and think I hit escape again, when my screen goes dark and monitor goes into sleep mode, but machine is still running. Well .... I hit the sleep button on the keyboard instead of escape smooth criminal. Get screen back up and hit escape after I see i\u0027m back in game and can hear engines but still see pause menu, crap now what? Alt-tab to windows and back to KSP, nothing. Task manager to end task ok, killed KSP. Now reopen KSP nope Steam says App is still running, uh no its not, I have task manager open and see that its not shown in any processes, etc. Close out of steam, log out of steam won\u0027t let me sense it says KSP is still running, huh. go back to task manager, and find steam process or whatever it\u0027s called, kill it. Open it back up log in, get on ksp, and F9 it to where I was at, making approach about to touch down, and \u0022Honey, come get your son and bathe him\u0022 get that done, come back and with son in one arm, successfully land at Inland KSC with one hand, \u0027Mad Skills\u0027 as my Step-Daughter would say. Then I explore the area and stick a flag there next to Launch Pad (bad idea cause later it seams this will cause a conflict with launching at normal KSC-lesson learned later) Anyhow I also parked jet next to Pad, walk around a bit, come back and parking brake came off and rolled me into the pad, so, now I cannot take off, no known reverse for me, then I realize I can push this thing with my Pilots head on the intake underneath yay, this looks rather goofy but works, kinda. took about an hour of me doing this to where the jet would stand still and let me grab ladder or front landing gear and climb up and leave, did so took off and headed towards impact crater west of there, run out of fuel dump two nacelles and glide to a landing no where near where I wanted, but no biggie. Recover. No onto contracts, first up build a munar lander with some tourists in it, experiments on it as well to transmit and all to fulfill Explore the Mun contract, and parts of tourist fly by Mun, and temp, and survey mun contracts as well. Launch get up there and start getting an orbit of Kerbin and thanks to the lovely control interface of this game, and the fact I didn\u0027t put any kind of real SAS to lock onto for this I am flying this mission basically on manual, and burn 3/4 through my fuel of what I was gonna use to transfer to Mun encounter, and to create orbit around Mun while creating orbit of Kerbin. Get to min and dump stage of transfer/orbit engine stage, start landing phase with real eye on the ground so as to not kill tourists and pilots, which speaking of tourist why haven\u0027t I gotten a message of complete part of fly by of Mun, oh for some reason the game didn\u0027t take me as clicking the tourists into the hitchhiker as assigning them. anyways, get closer to ground and realize I\u0027m on a landing course of the night side of Mun this should be fun, 20 min later me hitting burn to help slow down descent when I shouldn\u0027t have been doing since my other fuel got burnt up creating this descent and will need it to head home, but this is first celestial landing for me, which landing went great since I\u0027ve been reading folks issues with landing on Mun, I see I\u0027m coming in at a decent speed and have some horizontal movement and that\u0027ll tip me over so I either burn in that direction or use RCS to assist in killing that movement and touch down, shutdown engines, yeah. No fuel left, oh well with panels extended, I wait for sun, eva, flag, sample, report, run experiments and send them back with transmitter, and get my contract complete, yeah!!!, Now I need to mount a rescue of some sorts...to be continued...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/627474107619968649/7C25E3462A57DF645DB07FA53BD8041CA2D540AA/\u0022 alt=\u00227C25E3462A57DF645DB07FA53BD8041CA2D540AA\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/627474107619969028/561CA8507B17674182AE93DE30088BAE17487850/\u0022 alt=\u0022561CA8507B17674182AE93DE30088BAE17487850\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/627474107619969596/72ECD3642FEC25C6949273014C3A3FB8E4A54141/\u0022 alt=\u002272ECD3642FEC25C6949273014C3A3FB8E4A54141\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/627474107619969933/EDC33119D897C8E12F57A5BB934BE1EA72454988/\u0022 alt=\u0022EDC33119D897C8E12F57A5BB934BE1EA72454988\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/627474107619970405/C17A7366264FC75EADD9ACA66D1763B9E7082C30/\u0022 alt=\u0022C17A7366264FC75EADD9ACA66D1763B9E7082C30\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/627474107619970819/3309D5F2B54BBC8381BEE1B4D5413E273C5425B4/\u0022 alt=\u00223309D5F2B54BBC8381BEE1B4D5413E273C5425B4\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/627474107619971461/7506FBC40F7BBECDB09565FC06ACBF412DF77DFF/\u0022 alt=\u00227506FBC40F7BBECDB09565FC06ACBF412DF77DFF\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/627474107619971744/E3AB19F745DFB471A3EB73D6376F36500B4CB804/\u0022 alt=\u0022E3AB19F745DFB471A3EB73D6376F36500B4CB804\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/627474107619972790/6051040DBF565B84A6F199FD848A34108C50C5A9/\u0022 alt=\u00226051040DBF565B84A6F199FD848A34108C50C5A9\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/627474107619973331/B1A05384B0417C801E9BBB1F7DE4E97BB7ED7A3A/\u0022 alt=\u0022B1A05384B0417C801E9BBB1F7DE4E97BB7ED7A3A\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plume \u0026amp; Akakak","CreatedById":142955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T18:56:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETime to \u003Cem\u003Ereturn window\u003C/em\u003E : 142 days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.hostingpics.net/viewer.php?id=421510KSPkerbaltowerduna01b.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/421510KSPkerbaltowerduna01b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022421510KSPkerbaltowerduna01b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-09T01:14:08Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2015 01:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Plume \u0026amp; Akakak\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T00:51:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESet up my modded install and built a satellite to check out the new Ore scanning as well as that from the venerable Kethane mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/uPAb6k\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm1.staticflickr.com/272/18916532573_0769745664_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002218916532573_0769745664_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was a nuisance.
