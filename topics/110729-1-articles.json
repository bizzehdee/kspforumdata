I\u0027m not clear on why this is so however as I don\u0027t understand the mechanics and I haven\u0027t read anything that articulates it well enough.\n\u003E Can someone explain it succinctly if you please?\n\nSure ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) I can try, so I hope this helps anyway.\n\nSo the first thing to understand (and this is really important in general) is that in general\\* to lower an orbit you must lower the the energy of the orbit (and vice versa). The physical reason for this is that energy [= kinetic energy \u002B potential energy] is conserved, and the lower your potential energy the lower your altitude. Beyond those two sentences it\u0027s a little Maths heavy, but I\u0027ll happily explain later if you want.\n\nThe only way to lower your total energy is to lower the kinetic energy of the orbit, which equals 0.5mv^2 which means your speed needs to decrease. Now we need to think about how speed changes and what it is. Speed is the magnitude of velocity, and if you change the direction of your velocity then your speed doesn\u0027t change, this means that any addition to your velocity in a perpendicular direction will change direction not speed. Thus to change our speed we must accelerate directly along our velocity vector direction. To decrease the speed, we do this in the opposite (retrograde) direction (same line but 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 away).\n\nThat was all ignoring the Mun. Now imagine you\u0027ve just magically escaped the Mun\u0027s SOI and haven\u0027t changed velocity much, then you\u0027re travelling in the Mun\u0027s orbit so you have the same retrograde direction that the Mun has. Then to get back to Kerbin we need to accelerate in the direction opposite to how the Mun is travelling.\n\nNow let\u0027s think about escaping the Mun. The position you burn can vary so let\u0027s just consider the direction you\u0027re travelling as you are leaving the SOI. If this was along the Mun\u0027s retrograde vector, we have basically put all of our extra escape speed along the retrograde direction so we more or less got the maximum beneficial effect of the escape. If we hadn\u0027t been going in that direction then (with Pythagoras in mind) you will have a smaller component of velocity going retrograde, and the other component of the velocity went towards or away from Kerbin (or possibly perpendicular to the plane) and that part is wasted because it will just make the orbit change shape just as we said perpendicular meant a change of direction.\n\nThe practical point here is that it\u0027s about the direction you leave the SOI, not the direction you burn. But the time you burn will be more or less on the prograde side of the Mun, and you should burn along the prograde direction of Munar orbit.\n\n\u003E Also in relation to this, if my lander is on a moon and my coordinates are at the very trailing edge of the moon in relation to it\u0027s vector, would it not be feasible to just burn straight up since my heading is already as the moon\u0027s retrograde?\n\nEntirely because of gravity losses. Put simply, this is the loss of fuel efficiency which is the same as burning on the launchpad without enough thrust to go anywhere.\n\nPut precisely: the portion of thrust fighting gravity (i.e. along the direction of gravity\u0027s pull) is completely wasted.\n\nThis is why to escape you should gain merely ground clearance and then burn horizontally.\n\n\\*Disclaimer: again this is complicated and on some occasions radial burning can do more, but only for much more complicated situations, and only when considering the periapsis since when ever you burn perpendicular an increase in the periapsis will decrease the apoapsis and vice versa.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-25T01:33:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2015 01:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MathmoRichard**"},{"CreatedByName":"McKermack","CreatedById":143137,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T01:31:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Not really.

If as you say \u0022the portion of thrust fighting gravity (i.e. along the direction of gravity\u0027s pull) is completely wasted\u0022, then you\u0027d never escape Kerbin, even though you\u0027re moving steadily at 1km/s away from it.

With a certain interpretation of \u0022Oberth effect\u0022, you are right Khaur, in that our gain in energy is directly proportional to our speed. Many (not you) people think it\u0027s an altitude/gravitational thing, but it isn\u0027t, except than on free orbit the highest speed is at periapsis and lowering the periapsis counterintuitively gives you a bigger maximum speed and it turns out more efficient that way.\n\nI was wrong and right I think because unless I\u0027ve got it all backwards, (the Oberth effect is irrelevant as long as your circular orbit is low) in fact the delta-v required is the *same,* \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9which is really nice if true don\u0027t you think?\n\nThat\u0027s all based on high acceleration and low thrust time and low orbits as I said. If you need a large circular orbit, you will lose significant delta-v by Oberth. If you don\u0027t have the thrust to get up the escape velocity quickly going straight up will always lose because of gravity losses, and that is exactly as I stated before. The gravity losses will be the integral of the gravitational strength with time, or simply gt. Basically the t needs to be really small.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-25T21:53:39Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2015 09:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MathmoRichard**"},{"CreatedByName":"Khaur","CreatedById":144753,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T23:46:49Z","Content":"I think a lot of the confusion comes from that the term \u0022effect\u0022 is a bit of a misnomer, at least in how it\u0027s used. It\u0027s not like there\u0027s a basic price in m/s to pay for a given amount of orbital energy, and the Oberth effect comes on top of that to apply a discount or a surcharge. Discarding the Oberth \u0022effect\u0022 is akin to discarding Newton\u0027s second law of motion: one gives the rate to convert dv into orbital energy, the other to convert thrust into acceleration.\n\nBack to the Mun escape case: what we want is a given escape velocity. Up to patched conics approximation errors, that\u0027s only tied to the orbital energy around the Mun. How much dv is required depends exclusively on the average speed when performing the burn(s) (weighted to compensate for variable thrust over time). In terms of energy, as long as the burns are along the (orbital) prograde vector, it doesn\u0027t matter which way it is pointing. To maximise this we want to stay as close to the centre as we can.\n\nEnters constraint number 1, the lithosphere: we really don\u0027t want to go through it (atmosphere isn\u0027t as hard a constraint and makes things messy, but there\u0027s none in our case). That means we have to stay above a certain altitude, so we have to settle for as low a gravity turn as ground clearance will allow.\n\nConstraint 2 is on the escape vector. If we want to return to Kerbin we want it close to retrograde, but the reasoning applies to all cases. Unless we\u0027re really lucky, that means we have to give up on our grazing single-burn trajectory. \n\nIf we\u0027re on the right hemisphere (actually a little more), we can still try a direct ascent, but it will get less and less efficient the closer to the zenith our desired escape vector is.\n\nThe other (and only if we\u0027re on the wrong hemisphere) option is to transition through an orbit (or a quasi-orbit). This means going a little bit higher to steer clear of additional obstacles, and possibly coasting to apoapsis to circularise, both of which lower efficiency slightly. The upside is that we\u0027ll get to perform the rest of the escape burn from a rather low altitude and we have fine control over the escape vector.\n\nWhich one is more efficient depends on your craft, and how quickly it can reach the desired orbital energy. If it can get up to speed before going higher than the required clearing altitude for the orbit, go for a direct ascent. Otherwise, use an orbit. Additionally, you may want to consider the \u0022free\u0022 velocity from the surface rotation, and higher piloting error in the case of direct ascent.\n\nIf your desired escape vector is straight up, it would requires insane amounts of thrust for option 1 to be better.\n\nTL;DR: Save yourself the trouble and just get into a low orbit first if you care about dv."}]}
