I play lots of KSP, but don\u0027t actually know how the formulae work, and just fly by tweaking the directions of the burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn all of these problems, assume only the Sun has mass, and assume only 2 dimensions. You don\u0027t need to solve them, but pointing me in the direction of references and formulae that might help would be greatly appreciated. My maths and physics skills are really good, if a little rusty, but all I see are differential equations everywhere on Wikipedia, and integration tends not to give very nice answers...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestion 1: A spaceship is traveling on a velocity vector \u0027v\u0027, at a position \u0027s\u0027 from the Sun. Define the conic that that spaceship uses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestion 2: A spaceship is traveling from a massless planet in a circular orbit \u0027r1\u0027 meters from the sun, to another massless planet in a circular orbit \u0027r2\u0027 meters from the sun. The second planet is \u0027O\u0027 radians anticlockwise from the first planet. The spaceship wishes to travel at a speed of \u0027v\u0027. If it is possible, what direction should the spaceship travel to travel to the second planet?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestion 3: A spaceship is travelling from a massless station in an elliptic orbit, to another massless station in an elliptic orbit. Define the stations positions with regards to time however is most appropriate for your answer. The spaceship wishes to travel at a speed of \u0027v\u0027. If it is possible, what direction should the spaceship travel to travel to the second station?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would really like to avoid trying to solve it without using iterative solutions, as I feel that that probably would be very inefficient. But if I have the answer to the first question, I could use the answer to the first question \u002B iterative solutions, and see how long it takes for a computer to solve it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-31T02:08:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think your problem is assuming constant velocities...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-31T02:33:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe easiest way with question 1 would probably be to look for the craft\u0027s specific orbital energy (or perhaps more generally find its orbital elements).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestions 2 and 3 are more vector than scalar, but look related to interplanetary intercepts.
