Keyboard controls depend on your facing. If you are looking directly at target, then A will move you left, D right, W forward, S backward, Shift - up and ctrl - down. You rotate with mose. If you turn lets say 90\u0027 right, then your target would be on your left and therefore to move in its direction you would have to press A instead of w.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Varsi","CreatedById":120571,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T08:50:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you save Kerbals using the Klaw?
