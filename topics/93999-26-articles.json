I tried a workaround by tilting the texture too, but the way the texture is applied to the sphere doesn\u0027t make that work. So Urlum will remain untilted. Since it\u0027d be unrealistic for major moons to form at 90 degree inclinations with respect to the equatorial plane of their planet and such inclinations would probably make the moons very difficult to get to for the non-veterans, the moons will align with the normal plane like the other planets. That being said Urlum will have a major moon that is inclined around 10 degrees compared to that plane and Neidon will have a small moon with an extreme inclination.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"_PRATTER_","CreatedById":137421,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-05T00:57:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eis real solar system 6.4X compatible?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Desrtfox","CreatedById":80185,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-05T03:22:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve installed with CKAN and have the same issue - no new planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Nz2OaDh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Nz2OaDh.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/w0cojlQ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022w0cojlQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/G6cFGSp.png\u0022 alt=\u0022G6cFGSp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBased on the manual download package, it looks like CKAN isn\u0027t designating all of the dependencies.

Like, VERY thin. 1% of Kerbin at level zero, fading completely at 10-12 km. I realise it\u0027d have very little gampelay impact, but could still give interesting options (like additional science, or people experimenting with some crazy ion-driven gliders).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) I see the consensus is that Laythe and Eve offer sufficient Titan analogue. My opinion is that thay don\u0027t. Titan has very low gravity (0.14g), combined with a thick atmosphere (1.45 at \u0022sea\u0022 level) - something neither Eve, nor Laythe have. I\u0027d gladly fly to such planet only to see what crazy aircraft can be used there...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Moons just a bit to small to become spherical, but with some prominent surface features, like huge impact crater (Mimas analogue?) or very high cliffs/deep trenches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) I\u0027ve noticed a Charon analogue being proposed to Plock. Actually, maybe make a more complex system, just like real Pluto? With several small moonlets orbiting Plock at highly eccentric and inclined orbits?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI certainly remember your feedback and it has certainly been taken into consideration.
