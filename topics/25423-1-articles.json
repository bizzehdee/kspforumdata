And since there is no way to really replicate this IRL, ideas and designs are all we can make/share on the forums. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the actual challenge/thought experiment:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy (practical) engineer side says: Triangulate the last known trajectory and velocity before loss of communications to generate a tight grid to send a rescue plane for search/recovery. No need for the stranded kerbal to do much but relax on the sunny beach drinking a refreshing coconut concoction out of the shell (little tiny umbrellas are standard survival equipment, right? Right after a good knife and duct tape). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy wild, \u0022ok, I\u0027ll bite, lets break this down\u0022 engineer side says: Ok. Jeb took off in a rocket by himself while the launch crew were sleeping. Some boosters created a structural failure smashing ship to fragments, and the luckily surviving pod just happened to land on some small, remote island. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore he even starts thinking about building a raft, he needs to know where he is. Building a raft is less than useless without knowing where you\u0027re going. So lets assume that he does know where he is. (using the aforementioned path triangulation or gps or calculus/geometry/seasonal knowledge or whatever, but noone else does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou didn\u0027t mention a distance, or when during flight communications were lost/SRBs exploded. This could leave him laughably close, or on the exact opposite of the planet. Maybe he paid attention in geography class and knows where KSC 2 is. Maybe there is a city somewhere nearby where he can get to a phone to get a ride back. So I\u0027ll just assume the distance is relatively close to KSC (or close to some other civilized area), because otherwise its better to just set up shop on the island. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYet another undefined variable is the weather, and ocean currents etc. Although I\u0027m tempted to say some form of sailboat would be the most effective and efficient (and easy to make) craft regardless. This would cover propulsion, and can be made from readily available materials. The parachute can be repurposed into a sail and cordage, the mast and a steering/emergency oar can be crafted from the local flora. The buoyant command pod, obviously, would be the hull. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, propulsion is taken care of, what next? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EPropulsion\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - food\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - water\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - shelter\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - storms\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFood. Nothing on the island is edible but \u0022koconuts\u0022 so that makes things pretty straightforward. He rations his survival rations in combination with a lovely bunch of coconuts. I honestly don\u0027t know how viable fishing is with a simple hook and line in the ocean (assuming fishing hooks are in survival gear, which they should be) but I suppose its also a way to pass the time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWater. I heard there may be some of it in the ocean. Evaporation stills are pretty easy to make, and he may be able to create a portable version to take with him depending on what kind of survival gear he has on hand. If he can only make a basic one on the island, empty coconuts can be used to store some extra water. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShelter/Storms. Come on... you are worried about shelter when you have a comfy little living space for one that can withstand the harsh conditions of SPACE?! This is pretty self explanatory IMO. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd there are my hastily thought out ideas. Sorry if they are not particularly illuminating or creative. It is sometimes difficult to come up with scenarios which aren\u0027t very clearly defined and you have no restrictions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
