The drag on them is 50 times what it should be at Mach 0 and 20 times what it should be at Mach 1 (and realistically equal to 0 at Mach infinity) to try and deal with the problem, since there\u0027s not much that can be done to design around it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe B9 VTOL thing isn\u0027t something I can fix though; it probably just makes more sense to get rid of that node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wasn\u0027t aware of the graph texture code causing memory issues.
