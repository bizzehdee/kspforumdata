At least not until after the infamous \u0022problem\u0022. And certainly far fewer people cared about the space shuttle program and the ISS than cared about Apollo. Science isn\u0027t supposed to be a popularity contest or a gladiatorial sideshow. The MSL and Philae landings showed that many non space-minded people can get excited about robotic missions and maybe even be inspired by them.
