My method thus far has been as follows...I\u0027ll use Duna as an example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, I get into a circular orbit around kerbin, usually 80k. Once in orbit, I burn prograde until I escape the Kerbol system and enter a solar orbit. From a solar orbit, I\u0027ll make a node and play with it until I get an encounter, but I usually get the encounter on the opposite side of my orbit. My question is, is it better to extend my orbit and get an encounter far far away from my current position, or to wait until I am just behind the planet...I\u0027m having trouble explaining, so I\u0027ll include some poorly drawn MS Paint examples. The first is how I currently do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI raise the other side of my orbit until it matches that of Duna\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ppiX2Ll.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ppiX2Ll.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this a better method?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PSPACRy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022PSPACRy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T21:23:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat you want to do is wait for the right phasing angle. Each planet has different phasing angles from Kerbin. There are different tools to calculate phasing angles, but the simplest one is MechJeb or Protractor. Basically, you want to set your maneuver node and do your transfer burn when the angle equals to zero.

That way you can take advantage of high-warp speeds. I\u0027ll timewarp on the pad until Protractor says the ideal angle is about 30mins away.
