So it\u0027s all done and dusted and mapped to the same textures as the stock avionics nosecone, no problem, \u0027cept i can\u0027t distribute squad derived textures, so all I want to do is, like loads of you have done, use the model node and call the textures from the squad folder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022pln\u0022\u003E\tMODEL\n\t{\n\t\tmodel = BoomsticksRev3/Parts/CannonNoseCone/CannonNoseConeMK2\n\t\n    texture = Cones, Squad/Parts/Aero/cones/Cones\n\ttexture = Cones_Heat, Squad/Parts/Aero/cones/Cones_Heat\n    texture = (local textures go here?)\n   (\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 Now I\u0027ve checked the path a dozen times, chased my own tail, checked how others have done it etc etc\u00A0 this is the path \u0022E:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\Kerbal Space Program\\GameData\\Squad\\Parts\\Aero\\cones\\Cones.dds\u0022 the texture is there i can see it, the path seems correct, I\u0027ve created dummy textures for cones and cones heat as I\u0027ve done elsewhere and yet all I get is texture not found and the subsequent failure to load the models.

That should work.

It can often be a PNG, but I usually use MBM or DDS for this.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf the dummy texture is too small, say 4x4 or smaller, DDS format may result in it not loading properly. Use PNG or MBM if it is this small. I often make mine 16x16 if I want them to be DDS format. From an efficiency standpoint, the image format doesn\u0027t matter a whole lot, since the textures are so tiny.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf the dummy texture fails to load, then the \u0022MODEL { texture = foo, path/to/bar }\u0022 reallocation will also fail.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAdd the appropriate \u0022texture = \u0026lt;old\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;path/to/new\u0026gt;\u0022 line to the CFG. The old name has to match both the texture filename that was stored for the material in the MU, and the filename of the dummy texture. The new path has to use forward-slashes (like in Linux), relative to GameData, and reference the actual texture file that will be used.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-31T15:44:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222609794\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022140878\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221464706875\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105424\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NecroBones\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n35 minutes ago, NecroBones said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t let it export as PNG.
