This is my first time posting on the forums so if theres anything here that I missed then feel free to correct me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay so I have a slight issue with docking a rover to the Clamp-O-Tron Docking Port. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rover just seems to bounce off it and ive adjusted the height of the clamp that its trying to dock to and ive even had to force clip objects together to try and find the correct height but nothing seems to work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have by pure accident docked 3 times in total and thats via raising and lowing different leg combinations on the rover but the game seems to glitch after undocking I.E the rover seems to think its legs are still up and drivers around in odd angles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know ive not exactly designed the sexiest looking thing and its probably not the most function or even safe but im still playing in my early days and just trying to figure out what goes where etc\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some pictures to help you\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(hope these work)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022\u0022 alt=\u0022p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img src=\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022\u0022 alt=\u0022\u0026lt;a  href=\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022%7Boption%7D\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022%7Boption%7D\u0022\u003Ehttp://i1182.photobucket.com/albums/x442/Althaluss213/screenshot9.png\u0027 alt=\u0027screenshot9.png\u0027\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the bottom picture you\u0027ll see that the rover is parked into the docking clamp and that they are touching. if parked near the clamp, it will magneticly pull the rover closer but fail to connect.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
