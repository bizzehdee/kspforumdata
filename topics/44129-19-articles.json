Orbits are different than AN/DN/Ap/Pe because clicking them multiple times does different things. IMO they should be handled differently and maybe even be in a different place. also, I\u0027d LOVE a way for the \u002210\u0022 and \u0022100\u0022 buttons to affect orbit jumping. Not the .1 and .01 buttons though. That\u0027s crazy talk.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
