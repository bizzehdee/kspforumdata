After WW2, metric-using Germans and Imperial-using Americans were working together closely on rocketry, neither could easily understand exhaust velocity expressed in speed units of the other groups, so it was decided to use specific impulse in seconds instead, a unit familiar to both. To convert from a speed to a time requires an acceleration, so they used one that was already memorized by every engineer and rocket scientist, standard gravity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlkBltChemie","CreatedById":135033,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-09T20:44:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you both very much.\u00A0 This certainly explains why many of my landers have been over-specification for the mission at hand.\u00A0 Kind of interesting, picking a value everyone already knows in order to use as an arbitrary constant - makes sense when you think about it; thanks for the background.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
