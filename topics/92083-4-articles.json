If this were clearly defined, we could look at what evidence is supposed to have been falsified, who is supposed to have lied, and what their motive was supposed to have been.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConspiracy theorists claim that NASA faked the TV coverage, still photos and film camera footage. Of course, this claim has to cover all of the landings, not just Apollo 11.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the later J Class missions (15, 16 and 17), a good quality TV camera was mounted on the rover and was remotely controlled from Earth, allowing geology experts at mission control to watch the EVAs in real time. Excellent film camera footage was also shot from the rover while it was in motion across a vast landscape with beautiful mountainous terrain. Film cameras were also used to film the view from the LEM window during landing and take off. Footage was also shot from the Command Module of the LEM, showing the LEM in flight both after undocking and during rendezvous and docking manoeuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was also a lot of footage shot while in space. For example showing the extraction of the LEM from the S4B upper stage. Lots of footage of the Moon was shot from orbit. Also, lots of footage was shot of the crew inside the spacecraft in zero-gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also goes without saying that there\u0027s also a heck of a lot of footage of hardware fabrication, vehicle assembly, rollout, pad operations, crew ingress, launch, splashdown and crew egress.

The bigger the portion of the mission that was faked, the more evidence needs to have been somehow falsified and the more people who would have to have been in on it. In other words: if there was a lie, how big was the lie?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s speculate. Let\u0027s say that the accusation is that the entire programme was for real, but that one of the crews found something that needed to be covered up, such as evidence of aliens or something. Others might claim that the landings were a front for some kind of covert mission. Either way, this would require the entirety of the Manned Spaceflight Centre in Houston to be in on the conspiracy, along with any ground stations that handled relay of TV signals and voice communications. Bear in mind that most conspiracy theorists aren\u0027t claiming this, they\u0027re claiming that the landings never happened at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClaiming that the landings never happened at all requires the conspiracy to be \u003Cstrong\u003EHUGE\u003C/strong\u003E. This would require the entire programme including the whole of NASA and all the aerospace contractors to be in on it, both in the past and in the present.

In many cases, we can stitch together a proper panorama from Apollo landing sites, encompassing a 360-degree field of view, with all landmarks very recognizable and consistent with where they were supposed to be. (For example, mountains and valleys are photographically depicted exactly as they were in later pictures of the Moon.)
