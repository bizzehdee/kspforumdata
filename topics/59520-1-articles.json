I have been building my latest station in .23, Alcatraz, without using ANY RCS. The first four parts were done with the help of modifying the orientation of the target, this latest video was done without even that, and twice in one launch. Granted, the docking parts were rather small and lightweight, but with enough patience, the same method could be applied to even the largest of modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find it to be less complex than using RCS. There\u0027s no extra directions of acceleration to be aware of, just one engine, two docking ports, and a bottle of good scotch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/PKDiaNzhytE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you guys enjoy it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
