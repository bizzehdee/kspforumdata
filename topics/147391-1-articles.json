The game still crashes or, even with no crash, I lose several hours of my progress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving deleted craft files, deleted saves and otherwise done more than a customer\u0027s normal amount of work to get a product to function, I think it is safe to say I have been sold an unfinished game. \u00A0I waited for and purchased a \u0022finished\u0022 game from the Xbox Store. \u00A0Please give me my money back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am a big KSP fan and\u00A0will gladly re-purchase your game when you have a finished product to sell.

And don\u0027t dare ask about dates or specifics\u00A0because that isn\u0027t allowed. The lack of deadlines is very concerning to me. What is an acceptable amount of time to wait?
