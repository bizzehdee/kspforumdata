More than 2045 SP","CreatedByName":"nemwiper","CreatedById":146802,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T17:58:55Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"nemwiper","CreatedById":146802,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T17:58:55Z","Content":"Hi guys, I would like to share my best accomplish so far in this game. I started to play a couple of weeks ago, directly with 1.0. I wish I\u0027d discovered this game sooner... ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nP.S. Sorry for my english.\n\nLets get started:\n\n-BACKGROUND\n\nCareer mode (the only I\u0027ve played! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)). 1M in resource and about 1k of science point. At this point of the game it\u0027s a little frustrating to gain SP, on Kerbin it\u0027s a mess and it\u0027s difficult to track the advance and to plan mission. There are a lot of science \u0022left\u0022 on the MUN, but I would like to jump to different biomes in one mission. So I choose Minimus. Less gravity, less fuel! ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nSo I needed a lander that could jump and a module that could store experiments for bring them back to Kerbin, and a scientist that could move the data and restore the equipment.\n\nI\u0027M HONORED TO PRESENT YOU:\n\n![HSxgsXw.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/HSxgsXw.png?1)\n\nErburry\n\n--ROCKET\n\n![drjQi9a.png](http://i.imgur.com/drjQi9a.png)\n\n5 STAGES, to bring the 83t lander module safe on Minimus.\n\n--THE MISSION\n\nLanded safely on Minimus, I was able to jump to 5 different biomes, collecting 8 experiment each.\n\nThen I deploy the MK1 with the experiment in it and left Erburry in the surface lab... it\u0027s his job, right? ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n![DNqWTL3.png](http://i.imgur.com/DNqWTL3.png)\n\nIn the Mk1 there was 34 experiments awaiting for a correct analysis on Kerbin.\n\n![MHNObGM.png](http://i.imgur.com/MHNObGM.png)\n\nAnd finally...\n\n![tZR4xjd.png](http://i.imgur.com/tZR4xjd.png)\n\n2045 SP!! WOHOOOO! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nAnd hundreds were already been delivered by the antenna (EVA)\n\nThis entire mission costs 290k, but I was able to gain 317k with the \u0022Build a new surface outpost on Minimus\u0022 mission and another 141k with the \u0022Test structural Pylon on an escape trajectory out of Minimus\u0022 Mission, with a total gain of 168k. YEAH!!!!! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) :D ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nThe next step will be gain 1M to upgrade the \u0022Research and Development\u0022 building for spending all those points!!!! \n\nHope you enjoy this mission,\n\nMario"},{"CreatedByName":"GehringGame","CreatedById":145675,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T20:35:26Z","Content":"That\u0027s a mighty nice rocket for someone who just got the game a couple weeks ago, nice job!
