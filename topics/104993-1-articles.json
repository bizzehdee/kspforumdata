I\u0027ll start off with a few things to do:\n\n-Either laugh or cry, depending on if you have finals ending before or after the release of 1.0\n\n-Launch a model rocket in real life (from a hobby shop etc)\n\n-Formally end your current space programs (by rescuing/returning ALL kerbonauts and/or deorbiting stations in a glorious manner)\n\n-Attempt a last minute large scale mission (such as landing/returning from Eve, a Jool 5 mission, or a grand tour etc)\n\n-Build the largest or fastest infinitude you can\n\n-Attempt the countdown puzzles if you have not already\n\nNow lets hear your ideas of things to do in the meantime!\n\nLink to Scott Manley\u0027s Video:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/kjACJoyQeQ4?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Sidereus","CreatedById":135263,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T01:58:12Z","Content":"I was going to build a last minute Eve Rocks Challenge lander, but I started to put one together and by the time I had something with 8,000 m/s dV, it already had 150\u002B parts (which is bad because my computer starts chugging after 100, and after 200 things start approaching unplayable), and every m/s after that was going to be extremely expensive.\n\nGoing to have to look around and see what the most compact Eve-capable lander is....\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-26T02:04:04Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2015 02:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sidereus**"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T01:59:21Z","Content":"Realize and cry over the fact that you will be busy tomorrow so no last-day 0.90 playing. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"BagelRabbit","CreatedById":95028,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T02:19:01Z","Content":"Build a 2.7km high tower of SRB\u0027s and be amazed at the carnage and the destruction!\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/lLuvs2TjEgw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n...and then light up those boosters, causing a massive air strike, hundreds of simultaneous explosions, and other glorious fun!\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/rA1uUxV0FqY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nGo on.
