This has led to the Kerbals becoming very peaceful, and many frequently seek their own adventures and happiness in their lives. The Kerbal Space Program was the offspring of this craving of exploration, and their sheer success was due to the responsibility to their ancestors they felt had been long since waiting for the day that they could explore the cosmos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne stark contrast between human and Kerbal government is it\u0027s sheer size and method of holding leaders: Kerbal government is a strong democracy that influences all of Kerbin, led by several dozen leaders. These leaders are first elected from voters reigning from the same location of origin as the one being voted for. This election is commonly known as the \u0022Sworn In\u0022 election. If they pass this election, they are brought into an \u0022international circle\u0022 of leaders, and come the international voting day each family is allowed to vote for whomever they feel comfortable leading them. Each family if independent of their vote, and only their choice can make decisions that influence them. For example: family A votes for candidate A, while family B votes for candidate B. Candidate A will govern over family A and those who voted for him, and candidate B will govern over family B and those who voted for him. Leaders lose their position as government leader by failing to achieve the minimum amount of votes in the \u0022Sworn In\u0022 election. All this has led to a vastly less apathetic political crowd amongst Kerbals, as well as increased approval the average citizen has over their government and its leader.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGlobal industry invests itself in developing and better future technologies. Some of the largest corporations on Kerbin is Rockomax Conglomerate, C7 Aerospace Division, Kerbodyne Rocketry, and Experimental Engineering Group, all of which work hand-in-hand with the Kerbal Space Program to create new space exploration technology. Of course, many smaller and more nationally-local organizations are also runners in the future technology industry. Many of these organizations have led to advanced robotics, cheap, powerful supercomputers, eco-friendly solutions to mass power production and transportation, as well as aerospace technology, such as those used regularly by the Kerbal Space Program in interplanetary missions and settlements. These powerful technologies have given rise to a powerhouse of a global market in all fields, which in turn benefits with increased potentiality to create new technology.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerbal Space Program has maintained to be the sole effort of space exploration and colonization for decades. The Kerbal Space Program was founded in a relatively violent time of Kerbal history, as well as one when other, larger, space programs existed. This new space program was the first space organization not to be formed not by a government of that time, but rather a private organization. A passionate, brilliant assortment of leaders led the Kerbal Space Program beyond what other space programs had accomplished. Since the Kerbal Space Program has strived not only to be Kerbalkind\u0027s greatest explorers, but also to reach out across Kerbin and its people to teach the necessity of space exploration. With countless strong points and an inspiring tale of courage, space exploration soon became respected, acknowledged, and supported by those all across Kerbin. The Kerbal Space Program shot ahead, and in one hundred years had accomplished exploring every celestial body in the solar system, as well as lay the foundations of permanent settlements on Duna, Laythe, Vall, and Tylo. To this day, space exploration is believed by many to be the greatest frontier and source of a greater understanding and purpose in life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry if there\u0027s any grammar mistakes.

Hunter gatherers that eventually came together to form societies and different countries, molding over time. This is when they differ from ours. The Kerbals have a natural curiosity, just like we do, but theirs is much stronger and more powerful. Each \u0022country\u0022 expands out, not looking for anything specific, just looking around, finding out about themselves. Of course, each \u0022country\u0022 would eventually meet each other, and this would no-doubt cause some friction between them, but I believe that they would quickly learn and realise that they are not so different, that they both have this deep and powerful curiosity to discover. The age of sail would come relatively faster than in our own world, leading to the unified Kerbals of each separate landmass, discovering each other. I believe that because each Kerbal group on each landmass have developed so differently, this would lead to a larger conflict, one that would stay in the history books as a lesson to all Kerbals. This would be a series of longer wars, but eventually, like when the smaller states met, they would see they are not so different, and the wars would soon be over. Their curiosities ultimately lead to each landmass group mingling together and a global society slowly forms out of the embers of the past wars. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach \u0022country\u0022 would be known as a \u0022landmass state\u0022 with each different group inhabiting their own landmass. Their societies would be based on cooperation and sharing, with currency being used for trade between each independent state. The curiosity that once drove each Kerbal to look around them for something new starts to slowly disappear with Kerbals accepting that what they have is all that is. The \u0022landmass states\u0022 don\u0027t have any particular assigned leaders or representatives, so the Kerbals really have no-one to look up to so they eventually grow isolated and the vast trade-routes that inter-connected each society collapse and each state grows independently, building up with what they have, trying to best what the other states have accomplished. It would be an age of great scientific discovery, but each state would have no one to share these new technologies with. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGeneration after generation of this isolation and scientific discovery led to a particular group of Kerbals to come together after reading about the Kerbals of old and how they used to share with all. This lit a spark in each of these Kerbals hearts, one that hadn\u0027t been lit in centuries. They rediscovered what it meant to be Kerbal; Curiosity. They work together, forming so-called governments to help light this spark in the hearts of all Kerbalkind. It works and the kerbals come together en masse, public rallies are held and they rediscover their shared curiosity. Trade is re-established, this time on a global scale, the public cheers at this new-found cooperation and they look to the sky. The kerbals realise that they have run out of places to discover so they look up. They realise that this petty squabbling they had between each state is only a tiny tiny part of the universe and the whole species turns to Astronomy to fulfill their desire to discover. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realise now that after writing this, I\u0027ve just basically made my own history of Kerbalkind.
