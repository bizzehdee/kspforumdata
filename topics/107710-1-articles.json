You\u0027d be able to position your camera arbitrarily in relation to any physics-enabled object or the surface of any planet in a way that mostly resembles the current external camera, but with some restrictions removed (i.e. no more restriction on panning the camera away from the focused object.) You\u0027d also be able to look out from any IVA within physics range, whether or not a Kerbal is present in the IVA.\n\nSome information elements (heat / drag overlays, resources, etc) would be available when focused on a physics-enabled object. The option to hide all overlays would also be available.\n\nI would use the HECK out of this for a variety of purposes:\n\n-watch any launch from the point of view of the administration building, or from the island runway, or from the control tower on the SPH\n\n-watch any docking maneuver from the point of view of the target vessel or station\n\n-watch any flight from IVA, if you were too chicken to actually fly it in IVA\n\n-watch the same flight from a variety of viewpoints\n\n-turn on all the overlays to review your vessel\u0027s performance during a flight\n\n-turn off all the overlays and make some hecka awesome machinima\n\nWhat do we think??"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T22:08:24Z","Content":"It\u0027s a pretty good idea, so good in fact that someone made a mod that does some of the things you\u0027re talking about.

Interesting! =D Thought I maintain that a stock solution would be lovely to have, as it could potentially allow for more extensive camera control. Still, I\u0027ll keep my eyes open for a 1.0.2-ready version of the mod.\n\n@mattinoz, slow-mo would be hecka awesome (probably would work by interpolating between each frame of the recording)."},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T16:29:16Z","Content":"This is such a good suggestion that it gets suggested several times per year."}]}
