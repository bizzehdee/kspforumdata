I don\u0027t understand why. I could understand the COM was misaligned with the CoT and it might spin as though I was holding W or S but it doesn\u0027t.

A craft with a stack engine will indeed spin as though pressing W and S if the center of thrust is not in alignment, but you aren\u0027t using a stack engine, you are using radials. Because there is more mass on one side than the other, the radial engines on the side with greater mass would have to be thrusting harder than the engines on the side with less mass to maintain equilibrium."},{"CreatedByName":"Windspren","CreatedById":134441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T20:07:48Z","Content":"The wheels could be creating torque, or your engines could be misaligned.

I don\u0027t understand the rotation in Q-E axis.\n\nIf the CoT needs to be adjust, I can try throttling engines but my attempts so far have not had any affect. Could it be because the probe core is not aligning correctly with CoT/CoM and therefore tells the engines to gimbal in an inappropriate way?\n\nI am already dealing with prograde and retrograde markers pointing the wrong way because the probe core doesn\u0027t understand it\u0027s own or the engines orientation.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T20:39:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 08:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by THX1138**"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T20:40:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m not sure everyone is clear on the axis of rotation.

Its the one that starts on the lower right in the video. As it spins to the top you can see its thrust going in a slightly different direction than the other engines."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T20:43:13Z","Content":"Are the wheels spinning forward?

After watching the video and looking at your ship, it looks like the problem is the placement of your engines. The engines are all lined up along the axis of the CoM, but it looks like 3 sets are slightly above and 1 set is slightly below the CoM. Because of the way the game flips the way the gimbals turn based on whether the engine is below or above the CoM, you end up with 3 sets pointing one way and one set pointing the other way. I\u0027d move the set on the 2.5m tank up some, and I think that should let you leave the gimbal on."},{"CreatedByName":"THX1138","CreatedById":113955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T21:40:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Even though it stopped when you locked the engine gimbal, that doesn\u0027t solve the root of the problem.
