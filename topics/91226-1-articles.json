I\u0027m having a problem now with two landers in this configuration and both of them have successfully landed and taken off from the mun prior but now both of them are experiencing engine failure about 300 M off the surface in just one engine. I\u0027ve tried taking off with a different engine configuration (it\u0027s a very flexible lander set up) only to have some OTHER engine quit on me at around the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA couple of additional notes. During the same play session, the second lander both landed (using the same engines) and had this problem on take off. I did other things in the middle but didn\u0027t quit the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI managed to look at an engine while it failed and it didn\u0027t have the throttle reduced, it just went from producing 50 KN to 17 (and then it started flipping around so bad that I couldn\u0027t read it, but the throttle bar was always green.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander, as a part of it\u0027s operations, mines karbonite and converts it to LFO for it\u0027s own use. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStopping and starting the engines has no effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure I\u0027m forgetting something so I will edit the post as people have questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have the following mods:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal Frontier,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKarbonite\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKarbonite Plus\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUSI Exploration\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUSI Freight Transport Technologies (not using it.

I think I have it figured out.
