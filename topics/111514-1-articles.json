They are visible in the map view and even add a marker to the navball, but missions such as \u0027perform seismic scan at XXX\u0027 often require me to land once near the target (after using the map and navball to get very close) and then a short hop to actually make it to the proper zone (which I usually overshoot because I don\u0027t know when I\u0027m almost there). Trying to walk to a zone on EVA is even more difficult because there is no navball to give a bearing, so it involves stumbling around making rough guesses from the map.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor these reasons I would like a mod that allows targeted contract markers to be visible in the flight view. This would make landing in a zone much easier to do on the first try, and considerably easier for EVA kerbals. This could be done by spawning a part at the location so that it may be targeted, though ideally this would be possible to do partless-ly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy questions ---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf someone gets the strong desire to make this mod, go ahead. Otherwise I\u0027m going to start plugging away (but I have limited modding experience).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, does anyone know how to retrieve contract objective coordinates? Or, even better, the coordinates of an objective with \u0022activate navigation\u0022 enabled? I really know nothing about accessing contracts through the API, as most of the wiki documentation and tutorials don\u0027t touch on it (most pre-dates contracts).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, does anyone know how to create a dummy target? Spawning and despawning a vessel (ie a cubic octagonal strut or a flag) at the desired location should be easy enough, but it would be cleaner if I could force the target marker to a specific location without a vessel to target, or setting the marker itself to be targeted using the normal system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny answers or references regarding the above information would be greatly appreciated. I don\u0027t expect I\u0027ll have the patience to finish this without a little guidance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cvod","CreatedById":110540,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T17:32:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104758-1-0-2-Waypoint-Manager-v2-3-2-2015-05-02\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E might be what you\u0027re looking for.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"arq","CreatedById":71084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T17:49:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cvod\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cvod\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104758-1-0-2-Waypoint-Manager-v2-3-2-2015-05-02\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E might be what you\u0027re looking for.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven better.
