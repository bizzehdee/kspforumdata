A magnetic field has energy. You have to put that energy in somehow. Any objects within the field may be magnetized by the field, and that will add to the energy requirement, as they now gained potential energy relative to the magnet. That\u0027s the minimum you have to add. From there, it all depends on how efficient your setup is. A solenoid will drain power. A permanent magnet won\u0027t. A superconductor may require cooling, which is a power drain that had nothing to do with how much field it\u0027s generating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nArtificial gravity is much the same way. \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/204885-darthgently/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022204885\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/204885-darthgently/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@darthgently\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0is spot on with centrifugal gravity. That\u0027s real gravity and it plays by the same rules as any other methid would. We just know how to make it actually work. The more mass you have, the more energy it will take to get the wheel going. You\u0027re putting that potential energy in. If ships depart or arrive you might have to adjust that. Other than that, if the wheel is frictionless, it just keeps going. If there is a source of friction, you\u0027ll have to supply some power to maintain the spin. How much energy you\u0027ll actually spend? Depends on how efficient your setup is. If you can literally attach an electric motor, it will be very efficient. If it\u0027s rockets, not so much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther means of generating gravity will work by the same rules, but we have no idea how much overhead there will be for something practical. We know that it can be a lot. If you have to provide energy equivalent to mass energy sufficient to generate that gravity, it will be more energy than the civilization produced thus far. By a lot. We know this brute force method works, but it\u0027s not practical precisely due to energy requirement. Anything else will be between these extremes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S. Completely forgot to add that acceleration is gravity. There is no distinction. That\u0027s part of why we can use the centrifuge as a benchmark. But linear acceleration also works. 1g gravity aboard a torchship is a real gravity. How much energy is that taking? A frigin\u0027 lot, but ot\u0027s energy you need to spend either way.

I\u0027ve mentioned magnetic fields above, primarily because people are familiar with magnets a bit more than electrostatic effects, but it is, indeed, the electrostatic forces that are an almost perfect analog for gravity.

And just like with electric fields, there are rules you have to follow. Relevant one here is the one about the field divergence. I won\u0027t go into the math, but the way you picture this is by drawing the field lines. Any time a field line stops or starts, you have non-zero divergence. So you can\u0027t have the field lines just start at the gravity plate. That would require the plate to be very massive. How massive? Well, the Earth needs all the mass that\u0027s located directly under your feet to generate 1g of gravity, so you\u0027d need that much mass. I hope you agree that\u0027s not remotely practical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause of how much mass we need for even the tiny amount of field divergence, to build a practical \u0022gravity plate\u0022 it would have to be divergence-free. This is where we go back to magnets analogy, because magnetic field also has zero divergence. You achieve this by looping all the field lines back on themselves. If you look at any picture of the magnetic fields around a magnet, you\u0027ll see the field lines pass through the magnet, then expand out at either pole, and then wrap around outside of the magnet creating a sort of a field vortex around that magnet. We\u0027d have to do something similar. We\u0027d want the plate to attract things above it, repel them from below, but then around the edges, the situation would be reversed. It\u0027d be a much weaker field, rapidly dropping as you move further away (as an inverse cube) acting in the opposite direction, applying a bit of gravity in the upwards direction. The net gravity across a slice passing through the plate would be zero, with positive 1g near the plate, and negative, but much weaker gravity, far away from the plate, dropping to zero as you get far enough out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are a whole lot of additional complications here. Like, getting the gravity field to turn like this requires it to have a non-zero vorticity. Or curl, mathematically speaking. There\u0027s a simple way to generate that without bending space-time, but that requires accelerating a lot of mass at very high rate, so again, not practical in the least. Whether this can be a stable system at all is unknown. There is a famous result from mean field theory that the gravity allows for a torsion term. Einstein set it to zero in his field equations, either because he missed them or because he saw no evidence of them. To this day, we have no idea if they are physical. There is no known space-time torsion \u0022charge\u0022. If we had one and could bend it into a loop shape without causing problems, you would, theoretically, have exactly what you want, a gravity plate with properties described above. It might even require no upkeep. It\u0027d just exist, like a permanent magnet. You could install it on a ship and fly around with it. You\u0027d just have to be careful about two ships with such plates passing close, because they\u0027d behave exactly like you\u0027d expect a pair of giant magnets to. But this goes of into such deep hypotheticals that it\u0027s pointless to speculate further. We have zero evidence that this is a physical phenomenon and people have looked.

If we had one and could bend it into a loop shape without causing problems, you would, theoretically, have exactly what you want, a gravity plate with properties described above. It might even require no upkeep. It\u0027d just exist, like a permanent magnet. You could install it on a ship and fly around with it. You\u0027d just have to be careful about two ships with such plates passing close, because they\u0027d behave exactly like you\u0027d expect a pair of giant magnets to. But this goes of into such deep hypotheticals that it\u0027s pointless to speculate further. We have zero evidence that this is a physical phenomenon and people have looked.

If you take a gyro, spin it very, very fast, and then start rotating its cage in a perpendicular direction, you will generate a small amount of artificial gravity along the surface of the gyro. This artificial gravity will rotate along with the cage, meaning it will only point where you want it for a brief moment, and will point in the exact opposite direction at some other point in time (just like before, \u003Cem\u003Eaverage\u003C/em\u003E gravity being zero makes it a lot easier...), but if you time your propellant in pulses, you can get thrust out of it. Will it be a lot? With anything a physical gyro can survive, no. Actually, I don\u0027t think it\u0027d even be measurable with anything we can practically build right now. But we might be able to find some sort of an effect that lets us bottle an enormous quantity of angular momentum in something without it physically spinning.
