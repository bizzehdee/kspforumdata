That was the first mistake, way too close to Jool and would take far too much fuel to push out to Laythe\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Also found that in my low circular Jool orbit the inclination of the fuel station and landing module was very different. Would again take a lot of fuel to match up orbits and dock negating the point for refuelling in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- So I still dropped the probes and sats and got some science but predicted I would not have enough fuel to get to Laythe and then back home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- So I got impatient and went straight home and burned to Kerbin using all the lander fuel but missed my intercept and my 3 Kerbals are now destined to orbit the sun for ever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat I would do next time\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- When getting into Jool orbit don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t circularise too low.

Just correct until your path curves around the planet but remains on the plane, and then finetune your interception altitude. Profit!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight to aerobrake Jool, not Laythe? the answer to that question is Green. With purple Polka dots!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is possible, but *hard*. Typically when I try it I waste more fuel than would have been needed to transfer from a Jool-centric Laythe-apogee orbit. You only need about 35m/s, if you can plan far enough ahead!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy? easy. When entering Jool system, your navball etc align to the current governing Sphere Of Influence. And that SOI will belong to Jool, not Laythe. So you have to translate references, and planes, and hit a fast-moving small *low gravity* target while being sucked in by the biggest thing in existence, after the Sun. Not the easiest task!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce i manage to get to Jool, I apply my course-correction burn as soon as I enter the SOI. (Which I enter at the absolute slowest speed I can manage).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis allows a miniscule course correction (usually under 50m/s) to finetune my plane \u002B aerobrake \u002B resultant altitude orbit. Use any of the moons in a distant low-delta-v encounter to circularise your Jool orbit just enough to not aerobrake any more, and you are on Laythe with less than 100m/s spent in Jool system. 5m/s if you are smart/lucky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhoever said aerobrake is a single event? I use the first air to slow down *just* enough to remain in Jool SOI after the aerobrake. Who cares if it takes another 5 aero-orbits to get the final one you wanted, you can use Jool to trim off even 0.5 m/s if you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.P.S.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eunless you use a resources mod.
