This allowed the first DRV unmanned to be delivered and produce fuel, and then the next DRV with crew and return in the first DRV, allowing colonisation through leapfrogging. The Mars Semi Direct concept was developed to minimise cost, and only commit the crew once the ascent vehicle was fuelled and ready and the return vehicle was in orbit.

Alternatively, HAB\u002BKRV can launch as a pair.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The HAB module provides housing for our three Kerbals during the long transit period (right?). On Duna capture, KRV remains in orbit, and HAB deorbits to land next to the DAV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Science is done. Kerbals stay in the HAB module on Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* On a return window, the DAV launches into Duna orbit and docks with the KRV, and the DAV/KRV combo return to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe manned transit could also be done in the KRV like on the return trip, but that would mean the KRV is quite a hefty ship with enough facilities to sustain three Kerbals for up to a year.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep, that\u0027s the way I think it rolls...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my first pass at the DAV, it\u0027s sitting on Duna right now mining away and replenishing.
