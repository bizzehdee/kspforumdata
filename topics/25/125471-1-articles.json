For example, in my take, my airdrop rover weighted up to 10.2 tons. Round to the nearest whole number, so for me it will be 10 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor multiple vehicles add the total number of tons for pre drop rover and add that to .5 times the total weight of one rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example I had two rovers in my turn so thats 20 tons then when i add 10x.5=5 so my total point range is 25 points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the drop the vehicle that returns to the cargo aircraft can weigh no less than 2 tons its original weight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo because my rover weighted 10 tons pre drop then i ditched its airdrop sled it weighted 8.32 rounded to 8 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApon return to KSC the rover(s) must still be drivable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy attempt\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/3sSpG\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
