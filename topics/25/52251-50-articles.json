After 8 launches, KSS-09 was complete and fueled, the crew was aboard. It was now a matter of waiting for the transfer window that would come in the end of year 27. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, after some standard steering and engines tests, the craft had proven to be extremely bendy and not powerful enough, mission control was now worried that mission success was at stake. It was decided that the ship needed redesign.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Construction of a new ship started, it would have three times more engines and would be more compact, with less parts. 3 more launches and the new ship, KSS-10, was docked to the old KSS-09 in orbit. After de-orbiting KSS-09, the mission of the \u0022Venture Star\u0022 had begun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/rCa8f\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/rCa8f\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission, despite dificulties, mainly fuel level(wich became an worry after Vall) was successful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.:At the time that I found out about this challenge Bob and Jeb were returning from a mission to Laythe, so they didn\u0027t participate on this mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.P.S.: I didn\u0027t post the album for the first ship, but the album is here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/sKEtJ#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/sKEtJ#0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.P.P.S.:Ziv, if I missed something, please let me know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ehsteffano: Congratulations, you have finished the JOOL-5 Challenge on Jebediah\u0027s Level!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Wow, you did not use any mods, not even MechJeb or KER? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI liked that you have landed on the South Pole on Laythe but it takes more fuel to get back to the main ship, ain\u0027t it?

This is my plan so far: \u003Cp\u003E1: Launch bits and pieces of the ship (1 life support section, 4 SOI engines (used to push ship out of Kerbins SOI, and into Jools, and back again), 10 Jool SOI (used for moving inside Jools SOI to get in landing positions for the moons, can double as SOI engines), 5 L/R (2 landers, (incase 1 breaks in some way) 3 \u0022Lifeboat\u0022 ships), 1 command module (a mk 1-2 pod), 3 power modules (with solar panels attached), and a shuttle that ferrys up crew members and brings them back to kerbin, 3 fueling stations, and finally, a Joolieo probe.(to be dropped into Jool, in fact, I have called the whole mission project Joolieo, after the inventor of the telescope, Gaileo).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: After the ship has been assembled, the crew will be ferryed up via spaceplane (I am doing level 2, with 3 (classified as of now) crew members that will land on the moons, and 2 or 3 that will keep the ship running.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: Once everything is ready, the ship will depart Kerbin, and after 1 or 2 years, arrive at Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: The Joolieo probe will be launched, orbit Jool for 5 orbits, then will be sent into Jool\u0027s atmosphere, transmitting data, before being ripped apart by Jool\u0027s gravity/ high winds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5: The landing crew will land on a moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6: They will plant flags, do some experiments, take a soil/rock sample, then come back on the lander to the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7: Repeat 5 and 6 for all moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8: Once the mission is finished, the ship will leave Jool\u0027s SOI, and after another 1 or 2 years, the ship will return to Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9: A shuttle will meet the crew at the space station, and return them to Kerbin. It will take 2 flights, as there are 2 too many crew members to fit on 1 shuttle. In the event of a shuttle crash, the remaining crew will return on a Lifeboat vessel attached to the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10: The ship\u0027s fate will be decided by the top government officals. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11: If the government vote to destroy the ship, It will undock into 3 main pieces and each will be deorbited with the remaining fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12: If the government votes to keep the ship in Kerbin orbit, 3 things could happen:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; The ship could be left intact until it\u0027s orbit decays and it reenters the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; The could be refitted as a space station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; The ship could be refitted as a fueling vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E13: THE CHALLENGE IS COMPLETE, AND KASA SPACE PROGRAM IS SAVED!
