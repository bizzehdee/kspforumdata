I will circumnavigate *every* solid planetary body, nonstop, in one single mission.

So far, i\u0027m at 29 days.\u00A0I\u0027ve completed an equatorial circumnavigation of Minmus, and i\u0027m less than a day from completing a polar circumnavigation of the Mun.

I\u0027m becoming more and more concerned about both getting around Eve/Laythe, and getting to the outer planets. If necessary, i *will* build a ship to deliver more Heavium, but i\u0027m very much trying to avoid that. If i did have to do that, i have 2 grappling claws on the truck (front and back\u00A0under the frame, not sure they\u0027re in any photos yet) that i could use to pick up a Heavium delivery probe. In the effort of being difficult, i\u0027d likely just pick the probe up and bring it with me. In hindsight, replaceable grappled tanks would\u0027ve been a great non-cheaty way to get around, and would\u0027ve had the potential for both danger and hilarity. Downside of that, is repeated delivery missions, which i am trying to avoid. I\u0027ve attempted to calculate how much \u0022fuel\u0022 is on board, but it\u0027s inexact, as the Heavium Converter supplies Monoprop, LF, O, and EC, all of which get used in varying amounts based on the situation.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBeing essentially a monster truck with jet engines, it doesn\u0027t \u0022fly\u0022 so much as \u0022intimidate the atmosphere\u0022. Taking off from Kerbin involved a high-speed dive off of the end of the runway, at about 90% of the wheels\u0027 breaking speed. From there, if you don\u0027t throttle up to full and pitch up immediately, you\u0027ll never leave. My strategy for Eve is to simply spiral out, and in my early testing, it\u0027ll take a very long time. On the other hand, i\u0027ll bet it\u0027d also work as a submarine if necessary, but if it swims anything like it flies that might just not be the best option.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027ll let you know how it turns out, but i can tell you that these wheels are strong candidates for any non-cheaty circumnavigations i\u0027ll be doing in the future.
