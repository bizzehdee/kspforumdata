If you want it removed then you are entitled so please say so else I will let the links and revised quips stay (see bottom of gatecrasher list).\n\nThere is no doubt V1.0 is hard, but then again we do these things because they are hard, to coin a phrase, which brings me to the issue of fuel drilling in v1.0. I would be happy to hear all arguments offered but IMHO while refuelling is a legitimate practice and a remarkable feat especially in a SSTO, the purpose of the K-Prize is to test the limits of the reusable spaceplane in KSP. From that perspective drilling is like fuel transfer. So while it is perfectly legitimate to drill and refine fuel and then deposit it say in a fuel store or bring it back to Kerbin for a Utilitarial Commendation or Distinction depending on source, it would not be within the spirit of the rules to use mined fuel to drive the craft. So yes moving or bringing mined fuel or ore back is a new aspect of the Utilitarial awards and the challenge is to do it with the launch fuel, I hope that makes sense and is agreeable.

The higher orbit allows the 18 minute burn to Minmus to go in one piece.\n\nLanding on Minmus was accomplished with a few pulses of the rapiers to assist the ions. TWR on Minmus was just above 1 with the ions alone, and landing wasn\u0027t too much trouble. For takeoff, I tried to avoid using the rapiers as much as possible. Once it got off the ground, I switched them on for one pulse to make sure it didn\u0027t hit the terrain.\n\nI used multiple aerobraking passes, and I was on a highly inclined orbit, which meant the plane had to travel a long way in atmosphere, using up all of the rest of the fuel.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
