With the lowest possible kerbol periapsis and kerbin apoapsis your periapsis speed is over 100,000m/s, and I don\\\u0027t think you can get a ship with 100,000m/s of delta V to that orbit.

It works out that the sun\\\u0027s surface gravity is about 27g. That\\\u0027s a lot. Plus you have to spend about 150,000 m/sec delta vee. So you\\\u0027ll need to do some hectic .cfg editing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe altimeter is wrong -- the sun\\\u0027s surface is approximately 4700 km above where the game says it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if you want to land on the sun you need an engine that is powerful enough to counteract 27g. And you need thrust vectoring if you want to stay upright; however, thrust vectoring at this insane thrust level tends to tip you over pretty fast. SAS can\\\u0027t cope. MechJeb does its best, but unfortunately this environment is just too tough for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI gave up. Might still be possible, but it\\\u0027s really really hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, the sun does not burn you. This should be possible if you have a lot of patience. To mitigate the thrust vectoring falling-over issue, I\\\u0027d suggest that you have a lot of mass.
