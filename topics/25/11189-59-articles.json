It\u0027s a pretty tiny satellite because they don\u0027t have any money, having had their budget cut by the KEA (Kerbal Endowment for the Arts...). So, it was decided to take it up with the latest (experimental) plane, the K 7, aptly named \u0022The Gossamer Goose\u0022 for it\u0027s flight characteristics. A Clamp-o-Tron Jr. was duct-taped to the fuselage for the satellite and all was ready. Of course only Jeb could be trusted with this mission....\n\nI think the pictures will tell the story, (as soon as I figure out how to post them...) but in short, it was a slowish takeoff and climb, but the insertion into orbit went off without a hitch. Deorbiting was pretty easy also, with plenty of fuel to spare. Almost overflew the KSC due to cloud cover, but managed to float it onto the runway, very much like a goose hitting water. Nothing broken though....\n\nAll stock parts, only a Kerbal Engineer chip installed, which I forgot about.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Though when it becomes \u0022excessive\u0022 is in the eye of the beholder, really. Using more than one intake per engine is pretty much the standard for anything but the most lightweight designs.\n\nAt one intake/engine, the engine(s) will start snapping for air at ~18000m; with two intakes, you push that to ~24km. If you look at how terminal velocity increases in that span, it should be quite obvious why a second intake will take you much, much farther.\n\n![ksp_terminal_velocity.gif](http://ksp.schnobs.de/ksp_terminal_velocity.gif)\n\nNote that engines don\u0027t necessarily flame out immediately when air becomes scarce; they can still produce plenty of thrust, but of course not as much as when fully supplied. Also note that adding ever more intakes doesn\u0027t scale too well: while a second intake will take your from 18 to 24km before air deprivation sets in, having four will only get you to 28km. But then agin, if you have another look at that chart, 28km looks much better than 24km."}]}
