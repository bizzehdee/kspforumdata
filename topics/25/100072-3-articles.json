I tried to improve my design, but it has a major flaw - it needs SAS. It can\u0027t land without disabling pitch control on the control surfaces (trying to land with pitch control on would be like trying to put out fire with kerosene). No SAS means no pitch authority, and no landing.\n\nSmallest SAS module weights 50 kg, smallest probe core is 30 kg, and one Elevon is 20 kg, which already puts me over your mass record. I tried going with a design similar to yours (no SAS, two winglets), but I can\u0027t even take off. (even if I could, I don\u0027t have the patience to go slower than 100 m/s)\n\nSo, hats off to you, because in my view that is just incredible.\n\nHOWEVER!\n\nI never turn down a challenge...
