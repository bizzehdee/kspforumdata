For example, decide that if a Kerbal is going on a mission for X amount of time, the Kerbal requires a certain amount of food. You can easily add storage modules. Perhaps each hitchhiker can hold enough food to support one Kerbal for one year (or two for six months) or something like that.\u00A0 You\u0027ll have to determine a reasonable figure.\u00A0 There is a mod for life support, but if you want to keep away from a lot of mods, this is a way to do it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis also by definition gives you a loss condition.

This is always a fun challenge for me because it really limits what you\u0027re able to send up at once, but it\u0027s still permissive enough to go to almost any planet or moon and return in a single launch. The two exceptions are Eve landing and Jool deep dive (as far as I know). For those destinations or multi-destination landings (Jool 5, grand tour) you\u0027re basically required to do multiple launches, and similarly space stations become a lot more useful. The mobile science lab is possible to use, but again you\u0027ll have to launch several modules for it to actually get anywhere.

I guess that\u0027s part of the mission builder from Making History but if you don\u0027t have the DLCs you can still set a spending cap.
