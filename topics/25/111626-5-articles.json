I was successful. Hoping that\u0027s okay, since it\u0027s basically a quicksave/quickload without the hindsight. I already sent off my mothership to Jool so I can\u0027t do another rendezvous with it in penance, but my refueling ships are still in LKO if I can send up another thing to rendezvous with those in penance.\n\u003E \n\u003E Basically, am I disqualified, and if so is there any action I can do to undisqualify myself?\n\nNot entirely sure what you did here from your description. If you reverted to before the refueling run, then re-did the run to refuel your ship, you should be fine, even if you didn\u0027t take screenshots of the second run you can just use the ones from the first to prove that you did it. If you screwed up your refueling run, then used Hyperedit to refuel your ship instead, you would be disqualified.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Hi! I have a couple of questions before I start my attempt at Level 3:\n\u003E 1. An earlier question clarified that we can bring more than 5 Kerbals along with us, such as scientists or engineers. Does everyone have to come back, or can the extras stay behind while the 5 mission pilots return?\n\u003E \n\u003E 2. After each pilot visits their assigned moon, can they regroup with other Kerbals on the surface of another moon, before returning home, or are they only allowed to set foot on \u0022their\u0022 moon?\n\nYou can bring additional Kerbals, and land Kerbals on more than one moon. They all have to come back, but you could send another ship with extra Kerbals alongside your mission (as long as those extras don\u0027t assist your mission in any way). Your five Kerbals don\u0027t have to be pilots, you could have a scientist or engineer land. A probe core or flight assist module on your lander could help.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E can we use nerteas Heat Control? I have a nuke spaceplane but the nukes can\u0027t run for more than 5 minutes without it. (plus it looks cool)\n\nYes, I\u0027ll add it to the list.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E If the kerbals split up (and the ship) do they need to be reconnected before returning? Or can I split up, complete each landing individually, then fly each kerbal back by itself. I only ask because **\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9I CAN NOT DOCK**. (I really have tried to dock many times, but it just isn\u0027t going to happen)\n\nThat sounds fine, as long as they all go to Jool together and they all have pods, not seats, for the journeys there and back."},{"CreatedByName":"Whovian","CreatedById":101923,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T21:36:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Not entirely sure what you did here from your description.

Your previous grand tour looks like it has pretty minimal clipping, so it\u0027s okay. Mesklin\u0027s SSTO has one glaring problem, which is the Mk2 adapter behind the passenger cabin clipping into the Mk3 tank. The other stuff seems okay (maybe not inside the cargo bays but I can\u0027t tell from the pictures).\n\nAlso, with the newly \u0022balanced\u0022 Mk1 fuselage in 1.0.3, I\u0027m going to allow Stock Fuel Switch and Procedural Tanks. Since the new Mk1 fuselage holds only LF in a 9:1 ratio like the stock rocket tanks, it seems silly but you could get that ratio for your whole ship if you only used those tanks. This will hopefully cause less headache for people looking to balance part count with performance."},{"CreatedByName":"Himynameisjake","CreatedById":101602,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T19:01:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You can clip structural parts aesthetically if you want.

That\u0027s not an acceptable margin in my mind.\n\nThe only other bit of clipping that you might take issue with is putting the ISRU converter inside of the Kerbodyne ADTP-2-3 adapter (near the front). I have to be honest, I kind of love the idea of hiding away the ugly ISRU, it\u0027s got a face only a mother could love. I\u0027d like to do the same if at all possible. I don\u0027t want to put it inside a fairing because of the needless risk of accidentally staging the craft mid-flight, and I have to go from size 2-3 parts at some point anyways.
