Some are better than others, but I have a few that I think deserve way more love and downloads then they are getting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, not so much a challenge as a collective airshow, post a craft from KerbalX (or if you are not on KerbalX, wherever you may have shared it) that you think should be shown more appreciation. Tell us what is good about (efficiency, fun to fly, heavy lifter etc.)\u00A0 When you do so, also download at least a few of the craft other participants will post, take a few screenshots and give your thoughts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is my entry: VANCE, named after the great Sci-Fi and Fantasy author Jack Vance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it is very maneuverable, fun to fly, forgiving and has a lot of range.\u00A0 And it is delightfully weird.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/Klapaucius/Vance\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://kerbalx.com/Klapaucius/Vance\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022PuJG47g.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/PuJG47g.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022TsvsPdT.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/TsvsPdT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fierce Wolf","CreatedById":200019,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-16T13:47:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat must be the most non-Euclidian craft ever\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
