All I have to say. And pay attention to your speed and the air pressure. If you are pushing over 40kpa of air pressure you are looking at 40\u002B times the air pressure at ground level in game. So do the math, 40X your current wing load = Wings go POP! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo strut your wings, stock game lolrphysics don\u0027t work in FAR. And slow down your turns to a realistic level, no more turning on a dime and pulling 14Gs in a turn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
