Must be jet powered only! The craft may not use any oxidizer, monopropellant, or Xenon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Must take off horizontally from the runway (need not retain landing gear for the duration of the flight)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Screenshots! Must have screenshots of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-a. Your craft on the runway (preferrably moving).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-b. Your craft in flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-c. Your craft\u0027s Flight Log (can be accessed by pressing F3) This is neccessary, as top speed will be measured by Highest Speed Over Land\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--c1. For clarification, no, you are not allowed to jump out of your craft then take the flightlog screenshot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-d. The resources tab must be open at all times, as proof of appropriate fuel usage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-e. Any staging events that happen, such as drop-tanks, launch stages, wheel drops, etcetera.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Use of the dev console, particularly for part clipping, is exploitative and will be considered cheating for the purposes of this challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. This is primarily a stock challenge, so only stock parts are allowed, along with no other mods being installed. This means that CFG modding will earn you a permanent ban from the challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. No use of infiniglide, please. If you need more control, please use reaction wheels. (this doesn\u0027t mean no control surfaces, though.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Keep under 500m, as this is the goal of this challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExceptions are as such:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-a. Subassembly Loader, as it does not interfere with craft capability, only ease of construction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-b. Mechjeb, for Mechjeb category entries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-c. Ferram Aerospace Research, but you must specify if you use it, as there will be a special accolade for users of that mod!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-d. Kerbal Engineer Redux, as it only provides readouts, though use of this will disqualify from being stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Rules taken from maching bird challenge, if TheHengeProphet would like this removed, just tell me.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEntries:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStock\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. epursimuove @301 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

I\u0027ve got a hunch that drag matters far more than mass; I bet if I added a little more ballast to the nose that would let me either shorten the craft or use fewer/smaller control surfaces (maybe even ditch the vertical stab altogether) and get a little faster. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a good challenge, thanks jetter!
