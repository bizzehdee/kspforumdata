However, during payload integration, tragedy strikes! The telescope turns out to be too large to fit into the prefabricated fairing. With no time to order another fairing, the Kerbals must find a new way to get the telescope into orbit.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCHALLENGE: Launch an oversized payload -- something too large to fit into a fairing -- into \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E at the lowest possible airspeed. Airspeed is defined as the surface-relative speed below 70 km. To complete this challenge, you\u0027ll have to lift your payload completely through the atmosphere\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ebefore\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eaccelerating it to orbit. The orbit must be anything over 70x70 km.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScores are based on your highest speed during the ascent. Be sure to keep your navball set to Surface relative tracking until you\u0027re over 70 km, or you\u0027ll show orbital speed, which includes the velocity of Kerbin\u0027s rotation. No performance mods. You can use a mod to track your highest speed, or you can just use the honor system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBonus/tiebreaker: keep your orbital acceleration under 1.5 gees.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll submit my entry shortly!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Combatsmithen","CreatedById":146407,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-23T13:41:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is cool.
