It had two parts: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- An observation probe\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- An impact probe\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe observation probe watched the impact probe slam into the comet at many km/s. It analysed the impact to see what the inside of a comet is made of. It was partly successful - It did image the impact, but a dust cloud prevented any detailed images of the impact itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, this challenge is asking you to take one probe with some sort of impactor to hit the smallest type of asteroid possible - a Class-A asteroid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, This is where my submission will be posted:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(insert image of impactor here)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUPDATE: I just tested it. It is very hard to come within 100km. I eventually gave up with that one and cheated (hyperedited) to get a rendezvous of 20m/s. My observing craft was in the explosions (it didn\u0027t blow up, but I took a dramatic shot)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-19T18:16:31Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2014 06:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by TJPrime\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spaceman1999","CreatedById":68861,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-19T21:29:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for posting what it was and you are in first place with 20 m/s!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
