I re-read the rules and am sorry, would a quick loop of the planet and a landing be sufficient or should I redo the whole thing? Whatever gives 100% credit.\n\nShort answer = redo.\n\nLong answer = Yes I agree there is a problem in v16 and its not just the aerospikes IMHO, landing anywhere on Kerbin outside the KSC is a nightmare and even on flat KSC terrain including the runway you can never quite be sure what will sink into the ground or when the collision surface for Kerbin which supports the wheels (sometimes) will be so far below the visible surface that it causes unavoidable collisions between the plane parts and the visible surface, which, despite the wheels ability to ignore it, causes other parts\u0027 destruction. Also I have noticed that craft tend to flex on touchdown. \n\nSo it is particularly tricky to land in v16, though the fuel bug which is also in v16 means it is easier to visit the moons. So a case of what we lose on the swings we gain on the roundabouts, what else can one do but try? (If one is in the mood...) It is possible to land most craft if one finds a nice spot and makes a very gentle final descent to touchdown, but on some craft the placement of the wheels and touchdown angle is also a factor in preventing accidental part removal!\n\nIMHO the whole spaceplane thing is about having a reusable craft, so that is why landing intact is an important part of the challenge. What determines whether a potentially reusable craft and pilot deserve kudos is what the pilot can get the craft to do between making orbit and a successful return to Kerbin. Which means that while an orbit of Kerbin and safe landing will win the K Prize and place on the roll of honour, to win the highly sought after astrokerbal distinction requires a landing on either M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn or Minmus followed by an intact landing on Kerbin. I hope that seems fair. So if you lost the save then ... have another go!

Widomaker is an interesting design, I see you have optimised the forward control surfaces for weight and balanced lift characteristics and also used the avionics package for ASAS. Will have to try that. You have certainly won your wings in the v17 K Prize as well as an advanced pilot precision award.\n\nHenge, your entry in 16 is updated to include the remarkable oinker! (O1-NKR) Which has a very innovative wing with a space stationy look to it. Only viable as an SSTO in 16 though I am guessing... unless you know different! Well done on what looks to have been a very tricky landing!!\n\nGossy thanks very much for your mission report for Falcon 3, a very worthwhile first post if I may say so. I see the dodgy BB caused you to double post, I can understand that having had a lot of trouble with it lately but again it seems better this morning, hope it stays that way. Falcon 3 has an impressive wing area neatly fitted around the essential engines. The fuel management is clearly efficient and allowed you to reach orbit with only 6x 400L tanks with plenty to spare. The return to Kerbin was very precise and the large wing allowed you to glide in to land unpowered on the KSC runway, quite a feat which fully deserves the honour of an advanced pilot precision award. Congratulations on completing the K Prize mission, welcome to the guest list (aka roll of honour).\n\nSuzaku, I think its right to be cautious and if you have other commitments it is responsible not to take on more than you can comfortably handle. As I said, I am willing to carry on with the K Prize but am also willing to surrender it to a bigger project if that would be better for all concerned. I do think the people who want a challenge involving mods and cargo drops etc would enjoy having a dedicated challenge thread but obviously that depends on someone being willing to admin the thread. Though on the other hand one can organise challenges as self administering, if the rules detail requirements for proof, each report becomes self evident and noone need arbitrate but that means no roll of honour which is something I think people quite enjoy.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-22T07:48:36Z\u0022 title=\u002209/22/2012 07:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 22, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by boolybooly**"},{"CreatedByName":"Suzaku","CreatedById":40800,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-22T08:09:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Suzaku, I think its right to be cautious and if you have other commitments it is responsible not to take on more than you can comfortably handle.

I was quite surprised. It is actually much more flyable now, which I assume is attributable to a change in fuel-drain, but landing is still a challenge (I have not succeeded on an empty tank), so I think I can do it without much, if any, modifications."}]}
