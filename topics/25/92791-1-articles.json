While there qhere those who laughed and said it couldn\u0027t be done we here at kerbanotics think other wise. In short, it is universally agreed that an ssto is many times more efficient then rockets. Even Bettre if the ssto can deliver a payload besides fuel and crew. So according to our advanced algorithms two s sstos ought to be approximately 2.0times as efficient as a single one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Description starts here)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a slight twist on the interplanetary ssto. The main challange here being to have an ssto deliver another spaceplane to orbit and have the original spaceplane being capable of returning to ksp safely (on glideslope) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe space plane payload that was delivered to orbit should be designed to function withen the confines of any body with an atmosphere duna jool laythe or eve.
