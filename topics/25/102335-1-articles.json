Basicly anything that is in the same solar system so that everyones ship is in the same solar system - sorry for the confusion and even more so if i\u0027ve only made your understanding worse. i probably should have worded it differently.

At some point you will reach escape velocity and the game does not show a retrurning blue line. At that point you are not in orbit any more.\n\nWell here is my first attempt. Note that in the image I have an Ap and an orbital period so I remain in orbit. I think I can do better.\n\n![fxkTr54.png](http://i.imgur.com/fxkTr54.png)\n\nMy speed was 90624.5mm/s and I had an orbital period of 996 years"},{"CreatedByName":"purpleivan","CreatedById":120081,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T13:41:43Z","Content":"Hi all\n\nI have an entry to this challenge with a max speed of 94667m/s\n\nThis was achieved with an orbit that got as close as 1500m to the sun surface, although by time I took the snapshot at the end of my burn to push out my apoapsis I was already out to 18,320m (28,103 by the time I took the map screen shot).\n\nApoapsis was 9,796,663,571,820m.\n\nBased on an earlier test I did, 1320m seems to be the minimum altitude before the sun eats your ship, plus my apoapsis was not absolutely maxed out, so there is room for improvement.\n\nHere\u0027s the pics.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
