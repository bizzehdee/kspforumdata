The argument \u003Cem\u003EI think\u003C/em\u003E JoCRaM was making is that yes there is a problem in kOS, but a coder could take the problem into account and take steps to prevent it from happening with his program. Which is true, a program can be coded to work around and minimize the probability of a kOS variable persistence bug, despite your claims for this being impossible. (okay, a crash at an inopportune moment will still ruin your day if it happens before you\u0027re ready to save) Now, in kOS you can\u0027t just reset all variables easily for saving and random crashes do happen, so \u003Cstrong\u003EI do agree that it is impractical and should not be necessary\u003C/strong\u003E, but stop pretending like it could not be done at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis whole good/bad code thing is a bit philosophical anyway. If there is nothing wrong in the program per se, it can\u0027t be badly coded, but if it doesn\u0027t take into account the limitations of the environment it is running in and therefore can cause ship breaking bugs, can the program be well coded? Well, yes I guess, but does that turn a program that is well coded and takes into account the limitations of the run environment minimizing the chance of bugs appearing into great coding? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also not clear on the relevant difference between a part going bye bye because of a kOS-Kraken or because of an explosion. In both cases the end result is the same, a part goes poof, though of course the possibility of it happening IRL, the timeframe of the event and the resulting debris is different, but none of these are that relevant to whether you can or should work around it in code. If the parts exploded on load instead of disappearing(or decouplers fired randomly or whatever realistic thing as opposed to a magical vanish), would you be okay working around the problem in a kOS-program until a fix comes out, since it no longer breaks the laws of physics? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, after all that rambling my take on this matter in the end is in support of you. One should be allowed to edit the persistence file to work around the variable-persistence-kOS-bug-thing for this challenge. Because of the game-breakingness of the bug it\u0027s probably on the top of the fix-list when/if Kevin comes back and then such bug workarounds become redundant bits of code. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll tip my proverbial hat for anyone who does work around the bug inside the code, but in my opinion it shouldn\u0027t be a requirement, merely a personal choice on the method of banging your head against the persistence-bug before it\u0027s fixed. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-13T16:44:57Z\u0022 title=\u002212/13/2013 04:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Sacred Aardvark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bobnova","CreatedById":75385,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-14T04:38:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK here\u0027s my NASA style mun mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s entirely scripted, nothing is calculated on the fly (excluding staging).

However the argument the two of you were having, while it started off because of JoCRaM\u0027s comment, was more about whether or not kOS\u0027s game-crippling bugs were analogous to real world problems and should be handled as such than if persistence editing should be allowed.
