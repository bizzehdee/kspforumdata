They were designing fighters for 1000km/h, which is definitly transsonic. Pretty damned sure they\u0027d have passed Mach 1 in a dive.\n\nAlso, they were allready testing guided air-to-air missiles in 1944 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruhrstahl_X-4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruhrstahl_X-4). Not to mention that unguided air-to-air rockets were commonly used. Which means that the ability to carry external loads should matter (also because droptanks, and takeoff boosters).\n\nThinking about actually doing that challenge.

Of course KSP is much more forgiving in this regard since we don\u0027t have to worry about balancing our control surfaces, and attending to the minor details which would of course have serious implications in real life as regards high speed handling."},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-17T17:38:26Z","Content":"Compressibility effects in piston craft were what kicked off laminar flow wings, I think ( see Typhoon -\u003E Tempest for a prime example ).
