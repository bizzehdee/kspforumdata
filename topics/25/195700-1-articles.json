While watching, the youtuber mentioned that you could probably finish the tech tree with just the moons in Kerbin, which the sparked his interest. He then asked the question of, \u0022Can you complete the Tech Tree with just science from Kerbin?\u0022 This question soon spread to the highest administrators, C.E.Os, and, well, soon to me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOur contractors, scientists, and engineers are now arguing this question, wondering if traveling to space beyond a few hundred kilometers is completely useless, and if we could just get all the science and information we need from just a couple of powerful planes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, let\u0027s get serious for a moment, you might be thinking, \u0022It\u0027s impossible, you can\u0027t be serious!\u0022 But with the exploits in the game, including the one with the science lab... it might be possible. We must find out the truth. Must we venture out towards the moons and planets, or can we just stay safely with our little planet? Though, we do have the technology to test this, we here at Victorian Rocketry don\u0027t have the time to stick our main team of 4 into a simulation, we must continue onwards towards our adventure past our star and go interstellar, so of course, we ask the internet for help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere are the rules: No mods, No cheat menu, And to make it more interesting...
