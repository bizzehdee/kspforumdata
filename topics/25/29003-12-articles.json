Of course anybody\u0027s free to start their own challenge using some ideas or variations of rules used in this challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing I had been thinking about is a forum-based cooperative space program with a focus on realism. The idea is that we\u0027ll have two groups to players, one presenting the \u0022scientific community\u0022 and the other presenting the \u0022aerospace industry\u0022, and they\u0027ll be working together to explore space. At each \u0022phase\u0022 (modeled as several years of in-game time) I\u0027ll announce a very high-level exploration objective. The \u0022scientific community\u0022 will propose a number of missions which may further that objective, and there will be a forum vote to select a few of them to fund. Then the \u0022aerospace industry\u0022 will compete to design \u0026amp; build the hardware for these missions and to get those funding. Again there will be a forum vote to decide who will be awarded the contracts. The companies will be able to use the awarded funding (minus the costs) to design and build hardware for the next phase, which will have new objectives and missions based on the \u0022discoveries\u0022 from the successful missions. The total funding will be very limited, thus only the best designed missions will be flown, and the most efficient (in using the limited funding to develop the technologies and build the hardware) aerospace companies will survive after a few rounds. Again, this is is unlike anything done before, and will need some thinking to make it work, so it probably won\u0027t happen anytime soon - the upcoming career mode may also affect how this will work out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Donziboy2","CreatedById":74984,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-18T22:20:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EQuestion about heatshields for Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have landed several test craft and done a few aerobrakings and the only time I saw any signs of heat is when I screwed up an aerobrake and went to close (12k) and just about crashed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we use thrust assisted braking and landings do we need heatshields?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Patupi","CreatedById":71098,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-18T22:30:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom what Sturmstiger has said before (and relating to what I\u0027ve actually done in-mission) as long as there are no visible heat shield effects and you prove it via images etc (or something) then it should be fine.

I try on that one vessel (the Odyssey habitat lander) to slow it prior to landing with a secondary vessel, either the ITVs (my interplanetary vessels) or the local tug I brought with me, so it should be landing slow enough that thermal problems shouldn\u0027t be a problem.
