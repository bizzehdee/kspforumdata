You don\u0027t have to complete all of them to qualify but you need to at least attempt every category of the challenge. And the design specifications I provided were with various mods in mind (not that mods are absolutely required at Easy level\u00A0but I wouldn\u0027t recommend doing this in stock). The larger transport vehicles in particular were initially intended as a way of having life support for very long missions as you can\u0027t usually fit enough in a small short-range vehicle. And in any case, I wanted to give some sense of realism to the colony. In reality, when people eventually go to colonize other worlds with hundreds of people, they\u0027ll need this sort of infrastructure, and much of it will be out of necessity for maintaining the colony.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI realise that this probably isn\u0027t a challenge for everyone, and some aspects can be a bit repetitive (I would encourage building different designs for bases and vehicles to keep it from being too monotonous), but really the scale is the main part of this challenge. Anyone can (with a bit of practise) land a small base and some rovers on any of the Joolian moons. It\u0027s really the scale\u00A0of the operation that makes this a true challenge. It\u0027s also a challenge in design and planning: designing all of these various utilities to specification\u00A0for this gargantuan colony\u0027s various needs, and planning how everything will work together to ensure functionality, safety, and above all success.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo to provide something\u00A0which is probably more of a conclusive answer: no, you don\u0027t have to do absolutely everything in the challenge. And if you\u0027re not doing it to compete over the score you get, then there\u0027s no real need to fulfil every sub-quest (but really you should probably attempt most of them). You win if you make a self-sustaining colony of 500 kerbals in the Jool system in a semi-realistic fashion as intended by the layout of the challenge; at the most basic level that\u0027s all there is to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is one final thing: I mentioned making different designs for bases and vehicles to keep things interesting. Well, I ideally want to encourage creativity and diversity with how people approach the challenge. It\u0027s meant to be a semi-realistic colonization program, but that certainly doesn\u0027t mean that everything has to be similar. All of the mods I\u0027ve allowed are supposed to provide a good variety of options for how to approach each part of the challenge. USI is great for a lot of it (particularly the larger transport rovers), the Near Future mods are similarly good, and\u00A0there could just as easily be any number of designs made out of the desire to either look good or just mess around (for example, I\u0027ve thought of attempting to make an ion-levitation modular train for Pol and Bop; I have no idea how efficient or effective that\u0027ll be\u00A0but I\u0027ll probably do it anyway). You don\u0027t have to complete everything that is laid out (unless you\u0027re trying to get \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E the points and/or complete certain CHALLENGES) but trying to do it all anyway definitely has the potential to be a lot of fun. Sure, it\u0027ll almost certainly take weeks or months to do everything, but it\u0027ll also provide\u00A0the opportunity to try a lot of new things in the game, provided you have that sort of dedication and free time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/158983-wardstone111/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022158983\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/158983-wardstone111/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Wardstone111\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0All of those mods are allowed.

I\u0027m thinking of the really big parts, which are useful for large scale missions like this. Another good mod for such stuff is Deep Space Exploration Vessels. They both include big engines which are very heavy and require a lot of power, but offer quite a bit of both thrust and efficiency. Are they good?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis challenge is demanding an awful lot of ships in flight. 8 comsats orbiting each moon is 40 ships, before even considering all the bases, rovers, transports, space stations etc etc. I\u0027ve run into problems in the past (Kraken, crashes, lag) when I\u0027ve had loads of ships in a given save file. I like running big missions like this but I\u0027ve had to abandon quite a few because the save became unplayable\u00A0. Perhaps there will be fewer problems in 1.1 with this, but I reckon it will still cause issues.\u00A0Would you accept, with those 40 comsats as an example, putting them in orbit, using them to guide probes, then deleting them when the kerbals turn up and craft are manned? Just to keep\u00A0the ship count down? And given how many active ships we\u0027re already going to have, the idea of redundancy to the extent of having almost twice that many ships seems unthinkable.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLifting 25t off Tylo is no picnic. But OK, doable. But the problem I have with it, is \u0027why?\u0027. If I were to plan this whole mission, I can\u0027t think of a single good reason to have that kind of lifting capacity for Tylo. It\u0027s not like I\u0027ll be mining fuel there and putting it in orbit (that\u0027s what Vall exists for);\u00A0the only thing I would ever want to launch from Tylo is kerbals. It feels like it\u0027s just there for the challenge, which maybe detracts a little from the overall concept.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m also unsure about deducting points based on money spent. Surely the point of this is to go as big as possible; send as many crazy ships and SSTOs and rovers and bases as you can. Rewarding thrift seems contrary to this principle.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy problem with Keepfit is that I\u0027ve always built centrifuges for long missions, but the mod doesn\u0027t recognise them. They\u0027re a huge amount of effort to build in space, and in reality would make a much greater difference than simply not cramming as many kerbals as poss into each pod, which is what that mod seems to reward. Instead of keep fit, could I apply a rule where any journey over 20 K-days requires 2 seats per kerbal, and requires centrifuge space for half of the crew at one time?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, I think it\u0027s rather onerous to\u00A0basically complete a full game in career mode before\u00A0properly starting this challenge (this isn\u0027t something to attempt without all parts available). This whole thing will take forever as it is, without having to spend the usual period biome hopping around Minmus just to get to a position where you can start the challenge.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope I don\u0027t sound too critical.

Well, there\u0027s a couple of reasons. The most practical one is that if you send your lifter as one of the earliest vehicles you send, you\u0027ll be able to use it as a skycrane, to transport most of your base modules and vehicles (assuming that they\u0027re not too awkwardly-shaped) down to the surface. The reason I say that that should be the capacity to lift from the surface as well is predominantly for semi-realism. Although in KSP you can get most resources on most planets and moons with a solid surface, in reality you\u0027d likely be finding some resources in some places that are unavailable elsewhere, and would hence need to transport them between moons. There is also a practical application here in that, if you don\u0027t want to spend a long time driving around with a rover to get stuff from one Tylo base to another, or if you have cargo that\u0027s difficult to fit on the rover but can fit on the freighter, you can use it for that purpose as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSemi-realism is also the reason for trying to keep prices low. A colony is going to be enormously expensive, but it\u0027s still good to try to save money where you can (much like real-world space programs try to do when possible). Funds are theoretically infinite in-game but presumably the kerbals have some sort of economy (although considering the lack of any visible civilisation on Kerbin other than the KSC, hmmm...). Part of what makes this so challenging is building enormous things whilst trying to keep your endeavours profitable. Although, since you bring it up, \u003Cstrong\u003EI may separate scoring into points-based scoring and funds-based scoring rather than combining the two categories, though I\u0027d like to get some more feedback as to whether or not I should.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think I may remove KeepFit as a requirement for Hard mode. I wasn\u0027t fully sure about requiring it for Hard mode anyway, and now that I have some feedback and that I\u0027ve looked a little more into how the mod works (I don\u0027t always have time to do this immediately but I try\u00A0to find out a greater\u00A0level of detail about the mods for the challenge when I do have the time), it doesn\u0027t seem like it should be an absolute necessity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the career games, I did suggest having maximum returns on funds and science so that it\u0027s quicker to unlock everything. I still do like the idea of having to acquire some science data to progress though, because that\u0027ll give some purpose to all of the satellites and lander probes that get sent to the Jool system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI appreciate the feedback, it helps me to improve the challenge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/113052-luovahulluus/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022113052\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/113052-luovahulluus/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Luovahulluus\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Thanks for telling me about that mod, it looks like exactly the sort of thing I want in the game.
