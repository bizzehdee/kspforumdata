Land within 5 KM of the Launchpad (you can use launch clamps to know your distance). Do it without mods, no exceptions. That includes trajectory mods. Good luck and have fun. upload the screenshots of the landing on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, the moon the final landing, and your distance from the launch pad.
