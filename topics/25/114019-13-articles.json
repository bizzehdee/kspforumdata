I designed it to look cool, so there\u0027s probably more drag on it than there needs to be to hold the required fuel (particularly since I\u0027m flying two Mk2 cockpits around the world).\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

They always explode when I go fast enough to see heat effects.\n\nKeep the speed below 900 m/s until you hit 18000m or so, then start to level off slowly and get to above 21000 and slightly below 23000, and punch the gas pedal hard. (between 21000 and 23000 seems to be the sweet spot for altitude and speed).\n\nYou need to get into the thinner air to go fast, but you need to be gentle getting up to around 18,000. The thermal effects are pretty nasty below that.\n\nAnother trick: stick a stick antenna on the very front of the intakes. It helps deflect some of the air and keeps the parts behind cooler.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-25T19:44:16Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2015 07:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GDJ**"},{"CreatedByName":"ExaltedDuck","CreatedById":145930,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T20:47:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Keep the speed below 900 m/s until you hit 18000m or so\n\nI disagree. You can gut up to about 1000m/s almost anywhere above 5000m. Between 10000 and 16000m, take the altitude, divide by 10, and that\u0027s your speed target. I\u0027ve had flights where I\u0027ve hit 1700\u002B at around 18000-19000m in about 75-80 seconds. From there, it\u0027s a slow-to-moderate climb to cruising altitude which should be determined by heat and fuel concerns. I haven\u0027t made a formal entry of it, but I\u0027ve had a single engine with a flight of 39:25. Multi-engines, I have yet to break 39:17. If you get heating effects too low, the choices are climb faster, lower throttle, use airbrakes, and/or high g maneuvers. Done right, you could be near terminal heating at about 10000-11000 m, but use the need to nose down and level out to prevent additional acceleration until your altitude is adequate to bear it."},{"CreatedByName":"GDJ","CreatedById":58462,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T01:11:08Z","Content":"**MY LAST RUN!
