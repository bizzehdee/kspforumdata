I disabled the reaction wheels on the lander for the entire time it was mated, and made sure to let everything \u0027settle\u0027 periodically during maneuvers. As mentioned in the report there was a pretty bad \u0027pogo stick\u0027 oscillation mode until I hit upon balancing the two aerospikes of the Wasabi Maru with two from the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAppreciate also that you liked the lander\u0027s Kerbin SSTO performance. Perhaps not all Eve landers can do that, though: some may not fly well without dropping stages. My lander could get away with almost anything in 0.90 due to the riduculous thrust of my Kerbodyne core stage. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
