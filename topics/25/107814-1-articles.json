So, I looked over your challenge and picked 2 of the ones that looked the hardest to fly. The Fighter Project 1 and the FW TA 283. The whole time I was building them I kept thinking, there\u0027s no way they\u0027ll fly. COM is waaay off the COL and the thrust is waaay too high. Well, I got an education. The FP1 flew great and the TA... well it was a bit of a beast but I was pretty surprised with just the fact that it lifted off the runway on it\u0027s own and flew straight.\n\nKinda like the Gotha tho. I\u0027m partial to tailless designs and surprisingly, even without a rudder, it flew quite nice. In the image I\u0027m testing air brakes to help control pitch and yaw. It didn\u0027t really need them though. And yes, it has another engine pod tucked underneath of it.\n\nThe Lippish was definitely the most acrobatic of the bunch, I just couldn\u0027t figure out how to stuff a Kerbal in the rudder... so it\u0027s a drone.\n\n![German.jpg](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/German.jpg)\n\n![German1.jpg](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/German1.jpg)\n\n![German2.jpg](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/German2.jpg)\n\n![German3.jpg](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/German3.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T07:04:19Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 07:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist**"},{"CreatedByName":"Toadstooliv","CreatedById":42298,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T18:51:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E And here I thought I was pretty decent at aircraft design in KSP.
