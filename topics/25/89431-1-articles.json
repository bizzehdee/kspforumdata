This is about how quickly you can play KSP in actual, real, minutes-of-your-human-life-on-Earth time. This is a physical, pound-the-keyboard, arcade race.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking for a quick challenge? This is definitely it! \u003Cstrong\u003EDesign a craft from scratch, fly it to the Mun, plant a flag on the Mun, and then bring the crew home alive again as fast as you can.\u003C/strong\u003E That\u0027s it! Fastest real-life time to complete the mission wins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERULES:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. You are free to use stock time-warp and physics warp as much as you like. (But no use of non-stock warp settings.) So if you can handle a launch at 4x physics warp, go for it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Your time includes the time to build your craft in the VAB/SPH. No loading from a file (although of course you can memorize how you\u0027re going to build it and simply construct it from memory). So build quickly!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Timer starts when the first part is placed in your build and ends when you hit \u0022Recover Vessel\u0022 at the end of your mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. The no unfair advantages rule: Don\u0027t cheat and don\u0027t use mods that convey a material advantage over stock. Declare any parts or performance mods you use. The rule of thumb here is: If your run could have been done almost the same without mods, it\u0027s probably OK. FAR is OK although if people get super-competitive (top times differing by only a few seconds), I may split it into FAR and non-FAR divisions. (I figure for the best runs, FAR gives maybe a one- or two-second advantage.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. No MechJeb or Kerbal Alarm Clock. It\u0027s your piloting skills and your time-management skills. If you overshoot your periapsis burn because you\u0027re set to 100,000 warp, too bad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. \u003Cstrong\u003EA full video is required\u003C/strong\u003E in order to document the actual time taken. No cheating, speeding up the video, or editing the video for length (although you may add a soundtrack and commentary afterward if you like). Note: If someone can come up with another foolproof way to measure elapsed actual time that doesn\u0027t require video, I\u0027m open to suggestions. I realize video is limiting to many people.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Crew death = disqualification.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s it! Let me know if I missed anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Note: This challenge is inherently possible.
