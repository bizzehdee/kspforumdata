I\\\u0027m glad you asked! You are part of a low-orbit observation craft team sent to monitor the equatorial region. Your goal is to fly a low-altitude , atmospheric-jet powered plane around the world, and land back at KSC for image collection.\n\nAs a recap:\n\nGo due east, all the way around the world.\n\nStay at \u003C6000 m altitude.\n\nOnly stock parts and mechjeb.\n\nNo parts my detach from the plane.\n\nOnly Atmospheric Jets may be used, no other types of propulsion is allowed.\n\nHINT: You might need this: [http://www.youtuberepeat.com/watch/?v=s9MszVE7aR4](http://www.youtuberepeat.com/watch/?v=s9MszVE7aR4)"},{"CreatedByName":"GenJeFT","CreatedById":21208,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-28T15:58:26Z","Content":"I\\\u0027m quite sure its not even possible.

I revised it a bit to ensure it would work at 6km, but shortly after I started I decided it wasn\\\u0027t sufficiently cool for a challenge like this. So I decided to go back to the drawing board, and build a replica of the GlobalFlyer plane that the late Steve Fossett flew around the world a few years back\u0027\n\n\u003E ![screenshot737.png](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/6850538/screenshot737.png)\n\nUnfortunately, KSP physics are a bit off, and I had to pack a bunch of wings together to generate the sort of lift it needed. KSP balked at that, and not long into the mission it just became too laggy to fly, not to mention the phantom forces that tended to send it off the sides of the runway.\n\nSo I went back, tweaked the design, spread the wings out, and beefed it up a bit:\n\nAnd made the KerbalFlyer II:\n\n\u003E ![screenshot800.png](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/6850538/screenshot800.png)\n\nMore fuel, better balance, way better framerate. Flying was a breeze--I set MechJeb to maintain \u0027PRO GRAD\u0027 orientation, and all I had to do was come back every hour or so to reduce the throttle a bit so it wouldn\\\u0027t go over 6000m. The only harrowing bit was landing; it\\\u0027s such a good glider it took an hour of slowly circling just to get it down to the ground, and it was on the brink of stalling a few times.\n\nHow\\\u0027d it do?\n\n\u003E ![screenshot816.png](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/6850538/screenshot816.png)\n\nPretty darn well. I did the math and the remaining fuel would have been enough for an entire second trip around Kerbin. But no, it can\\\u0027t glide forever. I deliberately kept control surfaces to a minimum (which wasn\\\u0027t fun when landing...) and used a rocket engine in place of the jet during trials so I could test fuel flow and handling at a variety of fuel levels."}]}
