Kinda like the stupid metal balls that i have on my desk at work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo heres my challenge- 2 Muns- same orbit opposite directions- bouncy bouncy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes im crazy- but its fun\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know what i said above is kinda gibberish but im sure one of the rocket scientist on these forums can put it into some language that will make sense.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouzu","CreatedById":1117,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-10-16T09:25:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_f3SZ5Tu916o/SkoaZ7qiwZI/AAAAAAAANb4/HejDI2CTVpM/s400/DoubleFacepalmRickerPicard.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DoubleFacepalmRickerPicard.jpg\u0022\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cthulufaic","CreatedById":6660,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-10-16T14:28:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI deem this challenge humanly impossible, however, if you build a rocket that automatically puts the mun into orbit, then somehow splice 2 of them together facing opposite directions then yes, its possible, but not humanly possible.
