I immediately dropped Jeb into my signature aircraft, my Aero X-1, to christen the Field Dynamics Ski Resort. Still compatible from its 20.0 configuration, i thought it would handle just as it did. However, since it required SAS to fly in .20, i had a rude awakening as i left the runway. Ladies and gentleman, be aware that the photographer for these shots had to grapple with an entirely new SAS system \u003Cem\u003Eon the fly\u003C/em\u003E to bring you these shots! I did manage, however, to make to my destination, wallowing around in the sky. Landing... was a problem. Jeb wrestled with the controls as a SURDOVPIF (Sudden Unplanned Rapid Dissambely Of Vehicle Parts In Flight) occured, bringing only his cockpit to a safe stop (sorry, no pics of the crash). I did not quicksave, so i didn\u0027t get the shots i wanted, but these are close enough:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the Northern Mountains, on the main continent, lies the site for the future Field Dynamics Ski resort, perched near a mountain lake, and right below the main attraction, the \u003Cem\u003EKrakenhorn\u003C/em\u003E, a impossibly tall snowcapped beast of the earth (Fun for kids, too!).
