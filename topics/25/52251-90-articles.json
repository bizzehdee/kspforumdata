It is one of the most beautiful locations to visit in the Kerbol system and since it has an atmosphere is also very easy to get to, since you can perform an aerocapture. Since the mission profile demanded that every landing would be performed by a different pilot, the task fell to Fermal Kerman to enter the lander and head down to the watery surface of Laythe. Everything seemed to go smoothly at first. But then: disaster! Fermal forgot to retract the solar panels of his lander during descent. The reentry heat destroyed the fragile panels and for a second there it seemed like the mission would be in jeopardy. But the engineers back home hat made the lander very reliable and equipped it with a lot of batteries. Just to be safe, Fermal shut down half of them to have a reserve left should the need arise. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jc7l64e.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jc7l64e.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E \u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wSywGke.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wSywGke.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E \u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/WD8T-tEIMXw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E \u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDespite the solar panel mishap, Fermal Kerman returned safely from the surface of Laythe and docked with the \u0022Joolishka\u0022. After another (boring) refueling operation it was time to do yet another transfer and visit Vall. Roeny Kerman switched places with Fermal, after some angry words about the solar panel, and prepared for descent. Due to amount of dV in the lander and the location of the landing site being close to another Biome, Roeny took a risk and set the lander down again to gather even more science.

In order to get to Bop the transfer has to be quite accurate. But with a little help from MJs maneuver node editing capabilities, they managed to get an encounter with the ugly brown dwarf moon. And since they almost sound similar, Bob hat the honor of landing on Bop. Not wanting to let Roeny have all the spotlight, Bob also managed to gather science from two Biomes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/o4j7KP8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022o4j7KP8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E \u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xB5BavE.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xB5BavE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E \u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then it was almost over. Just one more moon awaited the crew and it was Pol. Jebediah Kerman was the chosen pilot to complete the task and complete he did. Of course, being mission commander, Jebediah couldn\u0027t do less than Bob or Roeny, so he as well managed to get science from two biomes of Pol. The low surface gravity made it easy for Jeb, almost too easy. There was a short scare after the pilot saw some dangerous looking formations while descending down. Fortunately those surface spikes didn\u0027t hurt as much as he feared in the beginning. In fact they didn\u0027t hurt at all. So the crew rejoiced once Jeb was back on board. They plotted their return vector end exited the Jool system.

After a successful aerobraking manouver the Joolishka got into a stable parking orbit above Kerbin. Jebediah, Bob, Roeny, Fermal and Domore Kerman were looking forward to finally head home. But it was not over yet. First they had to deliver their bounty: all of the science they managed to gather from Jool and its moons. In order to do that they detached their science module and sent it on its way down. The crew and ground control watched with trepidation as the lab entered the atmosphere. A sigh of relief was heard when the parachutes opened and the lab splashed down safely in the ocean. The recovery crew immediately picked it up to reap the rewards of this long mission: 20781 science units. Precious data from all of Jool\u0027s moons. Marvellous, the boys in the R\u0026amp;D department were elated. So it was time to get down to the surface for the crew. They detached the command module from the main body of the \u0022Joolishka\u0022 and started their deorbiting maneuver. Tensions were high as the module dove through the atmosphere, but again all systems worked flawlessly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/o1NySTp.png\u0022 alt=\u0022o1NySTp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Jskf6V8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Jskf6V8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E \u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/BP3A9yaME-M?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E \u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so it came to pass that the grandest mission of them all, the \u0022Jool-5\u0022, was completed.
