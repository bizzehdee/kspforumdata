This challenge will require mastery of sideways docking as well as multiple port and multi-directional docking maneuvers while on the surface of the moon. That is the point because I haven\u0027t seen it done by anyone else yet and I would dare say I have fairly and diligently looked. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe overall base does not have to be symmetrical, nor does it have to be connected in all directions at all points, and by my testing it cannot be, but it should be able to be expanded in all directions from any corner not just a central hub, and it should be internally navigable without going through a central hub to get to the other side. The key idea is you should be able to create an interconnected \u0022Grid\u0022 structure and that\u0027s what I mean by \u0022Holy Grail\u0022 or shall we call it a \u0022Krail\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know the corridor thing is a little \u0022whatever\u0022 since you can\u0027t transfer crew internally without a mod anyway, but without resorting to that I\u0027m just pretending to make corridors along a few guidelines because of my own OCD and I REALLY THINK THAT SHOULD BE IN THE STOCK GAME because the clamp-o-tron jr. mentions that it will only transfer \u0022resources and not crew\u0022 which implies that the larger clamp-o-tron, indeed SHOULD be able to transfer crew, yet it does not. Anyway, blah blah, alpha in progress and whatever just saying, otherwise that is also why accessibility of the hithchhikers from the surface with no RCS is there. Because corridors don\u0027t actually work and OCD. The corridor thing also adds a level of complexity to the overall \u0022Grid\u0022 structure mentioned above because you have to figure out how to make different types of modules out of different parts but which still line up and dock in two perpendicular directions. A grid structure is easier with a 4 way symmetrical module that you just line up indefinitely, but having corridors makes it much more tricky and I\u0027m excited to show my own progress.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-29T02:32:54Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2014 02:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Munarware\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdding no decoupling brackets.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-29T00:40:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow to win?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Munarware","CreatedById":117066,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-29T00:53:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMust upload craft files at the least.

That reminds me of those big agricultural sprinkling systems and you know those must work because they are everywhere. You wouldn\u0027t get the bonus but also I see you appreciate the structural fuselage as a corridor. Again however you see the elongated tube like a lot of the examples I\u0027ve seen.

Come on Ed, you\u0027ve got nothing but time right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a side note, I have found landing on the Mun extremely easy compared to docking with my space station. Honestly I haven\u0027t even had time to download a mod, which is funny because it was seeing a space x mod that made me want to get this game in the first place, but for now, I haven\u0027t hit my limits with stock parts and I probably won\u0027t download a mod until I do, but I haven\u0027t even been to Minmus yet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for my space station, I\u0027m getting to where I can intersect within 5 km no problem but even the rendezvous, approach and docking in orbit seems so much more time consuming than just hitting a spot on the Mun. I\u0027ve gotten really lucky with my inclination a few times and encountered with an almost perfect orbit to fly right over my growing Mun city. Other times it\u0027s a simple inclination adjustment that\u0027s usually less than 20 m/s worth of a burn and then it\u0027s a simple retro burn right over my target until my retrograde indicator is pointing straight up. It almost seems not to matter from how high up I decide to start falling because the acceleration towards the Mun in freefall is super manageable with a minimum amount of fuel. I\u0027ve landed some pretty huge modules within about 500 m of my city and even making some pretty big mistakes I easily compensated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, my requirement for full decoupling of all propulsion could get to be kind of a debris problem, but so far I\u0027ve decoupled my landing pods from my docking ports on an action item. I usually have multiple landing pods attached to my extremity docking ports so I just decouple them all at once with the throttle up and they fly off and crash a few hundred meters away leaving little if any trace debris. This may also become a problem as the base gets bigger because as I said above, I have been landing very close and it won\u0027t be long before I hit my city with a ballistic landing pod missile as the modules are extremely dense once placed. At that point solutions can be explored for the tanks which can be easily re-attached to a module that allows for a more controlled ballistic demolition or eventually a return and recovery operation but that\u0027s another challenge... which will occur because I recognize that the current debris situation, at least in my testing, isn\u0027t acceptable to most players on the scale of expansion I am aiming for. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis challenge is about the demonstration of concept though, and then, I will build a Mun city to rival the KSC itself!

Developed to accomplish the tasks of both landing and roving long distances on the Mun, the MK2 LARPTD incorporates several unique features such as Bi-Directional Rockomax Thrust Motor Pods to aid in both landing and high speed emergency stability maneuvers. Heavy-duty landing legs, moderate ground clearance and an integrated roll protection system provides the resilience of a tumbleweed, while the \u0022pretty balanced\u0022 RCS system, integrated lighting, and fully circular fuel crossfeed keeps the top generally pointed \u0022up\u0022 in most conditions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4zO6dvI.png\u0022 alt=\u00224zO6dvI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERefueling stations are in testing as just a small part of our Phaze 2 Munar Development Project, which focuses on reusability and waste management processes that will ultimately depend on the MK2 LARPTD.

Stay tuned, and don\u0027t ask about the very first \u0022unsuccessful\u0022 piece of hardware we launched because it\u0027s going to be a historical monument which we intend to distract people from the huge pile of discarded descent modules that is growing in a nearby crater. Hey craters are a pain in the ass anyway, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can also see, we used this vehicle to scout over 20 km from its landing position to find a nearly flat and level piece of Mun land for our Mun City, which makes docking and installing modules much easier.

And guess what, it\u0027s another rover! Not just any rover though, this is the Asymmetrical Docking and Relocation Rover (ADARR)! It is the epitome of our mission, which is not to preclude the initial conditions of this challenge, but is nonetheless extremely relevant: \u0022To create a symmetrical, modular, interconnected, expandable and universally directional colonization system that is both dense and practical for long term settlement. The \u0022baseCITY\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe could not have predicted all the challenges we might face, but we did know one thing from the beginning. And that was this: For the construction of a true city on the Mun which met all of our requirements, we would need a construction vehicle that was equally if not more flexible and dynamic than the end product we wished to produce. We would need the ability to relocate any module from any point on the surface to any other point on the surface in an efficient and precise manner. Enter the ADARR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EE9Uevj.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EE9Uevj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are three ADARR units in this picture and we have a total of four on the Mun. Three would have been sufficient, six would allow you to move a very large section of multiple modules as a single unit. For balance during flight they are launched as pairs attached to the central node module of the system and the node can also be launched as a set of 3 balanced units when additional ADARR units are not needed, which is important because we are going to need like so many friggin nodes it\u0027s kind of ridiculous, but you really don\u0027t need very many of these ADARR bad boys to get the job done. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, on their own, they are top-heavy, narrow and practically useless at any speeds above 5 m/s on the Mun Surface. This is because the footprint of each rover must be kept to a minimum in order to avoid collisions with the legs we use as the anchoring foundation of our modules, and the real magic only starts to happen when they work together as in the picture below. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/o5CP8hw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022o5CP8hw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, you\u0027re not going to see any of the modules yet, but this image is an excellent example of the sheer utility of the ADARR system. In this configuration the rovers gain a hugely forgiving level of stability and power. The combined unit is surprisingly responsive in all directions and allows a relatively high speed of around 15 m/s sustained on the Mun surface while maintaining complete control. Large batteries allow for a much further range than has been needed thus far, even during the long dark nights. While most modules have landed within 2 km of base center, the ADARR system could easily go 50 km or more and with the integrated solar panels range covers the entire MUN surface just as long as the daylight holds out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, the modules must be designed quite specifically and painstakingly to actually \u003Cem\u003Ework\u003C/em\u003E with the ADARR system and vast amounts of time went into testing and proving that alignment and maneuvers involving multiple docking ports are not just possible, but easy. As you may have guessed, all modules are designed with docking ports in all directions, which means every module is capable of docking with at least 4 ADARR units. At the same time, all 4 of those ADARR units can be directionally aligned with one another, no matter which port size to which they need to attach, and just in case you were wondering, yes all of our modules incorporate both Sr. and regular sized docking ports. Some modules consist of multiple nodes which increases the number of ADARR units that can be attached, and ADARR units can be daisy chained together to create a cantilever effect so that the module can be held from a single direction and placed into a very tight spot. This utility in particular is what allows for modules to be placed into locations where they must dock on three sides simultaneously, leaving only one side for the attachment of ADARR units. Without this capability you can make bases shaped like plus signs, and you can even make checkerboard like structures, but you cannot make an unbroken, densely packed grid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion 2.0 is already in the works because if you look closely, you can see that we didn\u0027t really understand what an \u0022inline clamp-o-tron\u0022 actually did when these were launched, and we sacrificed utility by failing to orient the shielded inline docking ports in any useful direction. We have also designed new modules since this release and will be incorporating features to support those modules that will be used in the final configuration of the system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStay tuned, it\u0027s about to get super awesome in here...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-26T04:38:39Z\u0022 title=\u002208/26/2014 04:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Munarware\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Munarware","CreatedById":117066,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-28T01:51:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a follow on to a previous comment which apparently no one is reading anyway, here is an upgraded ADARR dubbed \u0022Entourage\u0022 compared to it\u0027s predecessor and a larger scale Phaze3 ADARR unit, the \u0022Grande Fermamente\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fnxgHx3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022fnxgHx3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELower overall height, lower center of mass, improved weight balance (those inline clamps are heavy!), active RCS stability control, LF/O roll correction thrusters, ETG Power unit, 360 degree high powered lighting, improved docking capabilities.
