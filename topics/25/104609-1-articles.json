That\u0027s how I did it.\n- FAR is fine.\n- No physics/mass hacking mods.\n- NO CHEATS, No debug menu.\n- Part clipping is OK for the excavator for aesthetic purposes.\n- Part scaling mods are basically OK I guess, just be reasonable!\n- RCS is allowed (because a excavator is tricky to drive on the Mun, trust me).\n- This is a \u0022for fun\u0022 challenge, just enjoy the silliness of it.\n\nNaturally, KSP lacks the ability to actually dig holes in the terrain, so you must get creative with your digger in order to prove it\u0027s worthiness.\n\nOnce you\u0027ve got your machine landed safely on the Mun, take a few funny snaps to send to your friends on Kerbin as postcards.\n\nNo leaderboards for this at the moment, just do something amusingly extravagant.\n\nHere\u0027s my attempt... (Jeb standing on the Backhoe, Bob in the front loader, and Bill having the time of his life pulling the levers in the cab!)\n\n![YfAiAoF.png](http://i.imgur.com/YfAiAoF.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-24T16:34:25Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2015 04:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by wossname**\n  \nadded IR"},{"CreatedByName":"wossname","CreatedById":118005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T20:11:08Z","Content":"Aww ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif), no-one?"},{"CreatedByName":"G4Me_playsmc","CreatedById":140602,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T20:55:58Z","Content":"Probably."},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T20:59:23Z","Content":"Probably better to hold off on the challenge until after 1.0 comes out since it\u0027s so close to release."},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T10:42:17Z","Content":"I think you should add infernal robotics, because it would be a good, easy way."},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T17:24:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I think you should add infernal robotics, because it would be a good, easy way.\n\nYou can see some IR Hinges in the OP picture, so I think he thought of that...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-24T17:24:21Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2015 05:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Slam\\_Jones**\n  \nclarity"},{"CreatedByName":"wossname","CreatedById":118005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T17:27:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You can see some IR Hinges in the OP picture, so I think he thought of that...\n\nYeah I always get KAS and IR mixed up for some reason.
