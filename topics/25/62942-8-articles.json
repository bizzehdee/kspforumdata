The cargo is lifted by a dedicated Cargo Vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause the goal of this challenge is reuseability, I designed the cargo vehicle reuseable too. It can load as many modules as needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mission:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/nWCMr\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled. View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mission went largely as planned. I spawned all Station modules, the spacecraft and the cargo vehicle and went for it. All in all there are 12 modules, grouped into 9 cargo assemblies. The first 3 or so flights were generally uneventful. But on returning from the fourth I discovered that some of the infernal robotics stuff in my spacecraft was not where it was originally mounted, stuff had moved downward. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter one more flight the problem escalated so I was forced to \u0022repair\u0022 my spacecraft. I noted the fuel level after touch down, recovered the vehicle, then launched it without cargo and about the same fuel as it had before. I also fitted a docking port that was forgotten when I first launched the thing. I hope that is no problem, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s against the spirit of the challenge but your call. Nothing I did prior to fitting the additional docking port would have been in any way different if I had not initially forgotten to put it there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlights 6 to 8 went without problem. Disaster struck on flight 9. Undocking from the fuel truck messed up the craft view somehow. It was more or less unusable. IVA and Map view remained functional so I went for it. After all, how hard can it be?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuckily I had very recently installed rasta prop monitor and stuck a few cameras around the craft. Without those and the infinitely better instrumentation this would have been impossible. However the way things were it was tremendous fun \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI spent the whole coast to AP with figuring out how to select targets and and reference parts for docking from IVA.

It\u0027s got a bit of a twist in the design too. The whole thing can be configured into an interplanetary mothership and assembled at its destination. The plan is to park it in the Jool system. This means I\u0027m going to take this challenge to the point of assembling the mothership. I\u0027ll still post images of final assembly on arrival for the sake of interest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s some technical points which Omega Dock doesn\u0027t meet so I\u0027ll attach a challenge requirements module to supply the necessary battery capacity and science module before discarding it for the long voyage. Or, I may keep them to set up a base on Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll most likely be using the Airwolf for this and take the core(center vertical section) on the first trip. I\u0027ll have to modify the Airwolf I\u0027m using to include docking ports on the shoulder to carry up the booms(4) which are light weight but very long. I\u0027ll possibly need to do some re-configuration of the cargo bay with extra docking ports. The scales(52) can be rolled out of the VAB and loaded pre-stacked in the centerline. The other sections are fairly common components which won\u0027t present any special consideration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve previously had an issue with the Airwolf flat spinning when making an unpowered re-entry.
