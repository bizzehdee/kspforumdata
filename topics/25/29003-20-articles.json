They would go to Duna, to build an great settlement there, to learn more about their neighbour. To advance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the other regular space missions wouldn\u0027t be turned down, They had somewhat limited resources. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey hat to construct a Lifter that would be partially reuse-able.

Yet it can do all the assembly of the base Modules, that will ever get moved to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the First transfer Window was getting close, and They didn\u0027t wanted to waste the opportunity to send first Supplies, Kethane scanner Probes and the Crane for reconnaissance over to Duna. They decided to Launch them first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey strapped life support for 3840 days under their Crane to get close to the payload limit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey added 2 Kethane scanner probes in some crude way to the Crane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it was ensured, the crane would survive the aero braking an entry into Duna atmosphere with ease.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Launch was done on day 10.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey reached orbit easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E35 days later, they had refurbished and rebuild the Pluto. They could do the second launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey send the IPES (interplanetary engine segment) up. Nothing fancy, but a lot of fuel and LV\u0027ns to get everything over. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd They could mount it in line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Launch itself caused no trouble. They had to use the LV-Ns to help with the circulation, after they left the Atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately the Mainsail from the Pluto stuttered right before the fuel was used up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt ripped off the back Docking Port. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut someone was smart enough to put another one in front, so they could still use it, to ferry everything over to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome hours after the launch both vessels docked without any further trouble. Awaiting the transfer window scheduled in 10 days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---Part2---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was time for the first transfer over to Duna. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Crane and everything to prepare The landing site, find precious Kethane and for just being awesome was ready. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took only 2 acceleration runs to get on an interplanetary trajectory. Even the correction burn was really small. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe heatshields inflated just in time, and everything was ready for the aero capture. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut thanks to weired aerodynamic issues, the heatshields flipped themselves almost immediately backwards. rendering them utterly useless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuckily though, by that time it was slow enough to not have any issues with entry effects. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClosing in the orbit and jettison the Kethane satellites was easy as eating snacks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crane set of to land at some relatively deep terrain, because the landing would be parachute powered. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd once more, as soon as there were some serious aerodynamic pressure, the heatshields turned themselves into weird drag chutes...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo entry effects, though. The whole twisting ans wiggling due to the heatshields stopped as soon, as they were detached, and the parachutes opened. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything worked fine then, and it touched down gently with 10m/s, at 770m altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kethane satellites went into orbit around Duna an Ike and started searching for Kethane. The crane would then move to a somewhat nearby deposit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile on Kerbin:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next ship needed to get built in orbit. Engines, space habitats, ground base stuff, Rovers, Kethane truck and an the ferrying ship were lifted up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, the ferrying whip (DCV) lifted itself the later half way due to some Mainsail detaching unintentionally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the Rovers, 6 ambitious Kerbals were aboard. In he 30 days before the transfer window, they ensured everything works, and the snack in the space habitats were tasty. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight before the next transfer window, the next vessel construction even started. They could have made this one bigger, but even Jeb was against that. Too slow he said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter 5 acceleration burns, they actually made it into interplanetary space. Still 2 days early, resulting in some bigger correction burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut they reached Duna safely. Because of the known issues with inflatable heatschields, they hat metal plated heathield with them. albeit a little small. So they went for an 15.5km aero brake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey performed the missing parts of the capture right outside of the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey finally adjusted the orbits with 2 more aero brakes, and some fiddling around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime for the first manned landing!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, Jeb would do it. But first preparations, the DCV needed fuel and snacks. Someone snatched all the snacks from the Kethane rover and from the DCV in the Transfer...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb went on EVA to board the DCV. As soon as he wanted to grab the ladder, something flung him away, disassembling a retracted solar panel in the process. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeveral tries later Jeb gave up on entering the DCV and manned the Kethane Rover. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe initial Plans were to skycrane it down via KAS winches. But reality didn\u0027t like that. He ended up digging the Rover front first into Duna while balancing the DCV not to flip over. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd Even the metal heatshield on the DCV turned itself quickly into some not really working drogue chute. The Landing went well (for Kerbal understanding), it just lost the backward Docking Port (note: it hit Duna with the frontal one).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter some wiggling He managed to put the rover back on it\u0027s weels, and droove the final way over to the Kethane deposits. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd he forgot to plant the flag. Gotta do it when he returns to refuel the DCV. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---Part3---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter quite some time the Kethane Fuel truck reached the Crane, and They had indeed stuck Kethane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile Jebediah mined and refined all the precious Kethane, The DCV made a somewhat small hop towards the Truck. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that, things were just a matter of refuelling the DCV. And some really close place was selected as the appropriate location for the outpost. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe DCV finally launched itself from Duna for the first time, to grab the connector parts from the IPS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpon preparing landing, it was clear, that the DCV had a really tight fuel budget, if it was supposed to do one round trip with a full tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that in Mind, Jebediah choosed a shallow trajectory to maximize the atmospheric drag to slow down his Vessel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt worked as intended. And the landing itself was becoming the standard Duna skycrane style - hover over terrain and undock the payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously something broke off. But nothing important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn exiting the DCV it suddenly became clear, that the heatshield was a grave danger to Jebediah. He got stuck in it and got shaked in the event.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission control even called him dead for suffering too high G forces. But Jebediah doesn\u0027t die that easily. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe manned the Kethane truck, though. He didn\u0027t liked it, obviously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe DCV went into Orbit to fetch the first living quarter and Live Support package. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fuel budget was so tight, that it was refuelled in orbit by a little bit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter precice landing, once more the Payload lost an unimportant part. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile refuelling the DCV, the crane managed to assemble the first Base parts to prove that the concept was also working on Duna. Big cheers at KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the DCV launched (it remained unmanned), Jeb placed down the flag in front of the Duna base, labelling \u0022Duna Town\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the DCV was docked with the IPS, the precursory ship docked there, too and brought over loads of fresh supplys for the Kerbals, ready to get shipped down to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 3rd and 4th Landing were pretty boring, tight fuel and such. Albeit on the 4th landing they tried to some advanced atmospheric manoeuvres (thrusting upwards at 10 km) to increase the slowing down by atmospheric drag before hitting the ground. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt worked, and the DCV hat enough fuel to recover from some post-undocking payload problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crane then finally assembled the full Duna outpost, now just waiting for the remaining 5 Kerbals to join them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart 4:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the remaining Kerbals got down on day 353 and an day 354. Jet Kelley was on day 354, and just some hours overtime. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat makes 6 Kerbals landed around day 353.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landings itself were performed by using the rovers with their lander can command modules to hold ther Kerbals. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAns as always, the landings were safe, and sound. Even though Jebediah wasn\u0027t happy to stay on ground. The Ground base was now functional, and The Kerbals could go and do loads of science with the help of their rovers. each featuring vast scientific equipment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile on Kerbin:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe R\u0026amp;D department tried to get an long range exploration Vessel for Duna done: the Duna Kethane jet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt did provide great engineering obstacles. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey had to tackle the issues of no working Jet engines by using The Kethane jet engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point of the plane tipping over onto its wings by using gears on the edge of the wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven though it hat big winds, they were still to small. So they redid them into some biplane style. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther testing revealed that the plane would have serious issues with breaking (not apart) during landing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce more, rockets came to rescue there - retro rockets with fuel to break during the critical stage of landing for 3-4 times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut one big issue remained. If the plane would climb over 2800m altitude, the Kethane engine would simply run out of intake air, and won\u0027t be able to be turned on until it came to a full halt. Effectively rendering the plane unusable. Jeb felt like crying upon those news.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven without the Kethane jet work continued at KSC, subsequently they launched another IPES and IPSH into Orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause the Duna orbit was getting crowded, they also decided to add some structure to Duna orbit by adding a space station to the orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe groung habitaty had to endure some reworking. The life support was now directly attaced to them, and reduced in terms of storagable amount to save upon weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the tacked the issue of the DCV not being able to bring any excess fuel into low Duna orbit to refuel the interplanetary ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey did that by constructing an DCV mk2 that can easily land on Ike\u0027s slopes, and can optionally carry an Kethane harvesting unit while doing that. Effectively using Ike as fuel source for additional interplanetary flights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs with the first Row, the 6 crew contained with the flight were sent up, using the rovers to provide the accent vehices.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the 3rd Interplanetary Ship is on its\u0027 several burns to break Kerbin\u0027s Orbit, this episode it over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Escreens:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/OjGuD\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

It is meant to transfer to Duna and stay there. It will dock with crafts returning from Duna to kerbin, give them their main push and then undock before leaving Duna SOI. The craft will afterwards expend build in power to finalize the burn for kerbin as well as any mid course corrections.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The Duna probe host, a set of 3 orbiter and 3 lander probes. the orbiter probes carry mapsat as well as kethane scanners. Depending on available dV, they will be inserted into Duna polar orbits and maybe ike polar orbit. Two of the lander probes will land on Duna and one on Ike. The first Duna lander probe will be used as a beacon to mark the point where orbital descent should start to aim for the landing zone. The second will be backup for the first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) The Duna waystation and emergency habitat is a small space station that will be placed in Duna orbit that carries fuel and can provide emergency shelter. Unneeded fuel from Duna -\u0026gt; Kerbin flights will remain here. Additional fuel will be brought along as necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) The Duna emergency suppliy drop is a 3.5 ton module containing little else than supplies and the engines nececssary to land it on Duna in case of emergency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase two consists of the remaining primary infrastructure as well as the first manned flights. This phase will see a Kerbin tug very similar to the Duna tug but equipped with 4 NERVA engines since the cargoes going from Kerbin to Duna will tend to be much heavier than the cargoes going back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase two will also see two Duna orbit to surface shuttles (that will probably also serve as Duna -\u0026gt; Kerbin return shuttles) and the major base block, the Duna truck and mobile lab. Those two vehicles are fully mobile and provide long term living and working space for 4-6 kerbals. The vehicles will remain on Duna, the crew will rotate at a later date.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast but not least, phase two will contain the necessary fuel for the Kerbin -\u0026gt; Duna transfer via tug as well as the supplies needed to last until the next arrival.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission plan:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://onebit.us/x/i/Ct8oyC4d3V.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Ct8oyC4d3V.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B\u002B\u002B End press release \u002B\u002B\u002B\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B\u002B\u002B \u00A9 theBlind optikal instruments and space operations \u002B\u002B\u002B\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScreenshots:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/seexS\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

I do have a question about the launch delays for booster construction/preparation. If I were to plan my first transfer to Duna for the 2nd launch window instead of the one at day 55, can I have my rockets built and therefore plan launches closer together. For example, if my launch vehicle can launch 20 tons, normally requiring 40 days between launches, but I will be heading to Duna on the 2nd hohman transfer window, in theory several rockets would have been built and therefore not need as much time between the launches.
