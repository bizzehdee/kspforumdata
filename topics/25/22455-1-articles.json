That reason is to make spaceplanes. Now a lot of kerbal engineershave built planes, but they seem to be vary kerbalish.( explosions, missing parts etc). I talked with a kerbal yesterday and he said ( in a very hard to understand language) that it is impossible to build a spaceplanes without it looking like it it crashed a zillion times before it even rolls out of the hanger.
