KR-2L for 10t and 4 of them strutted together for 40t, just as you and Jouni say:\u003Cp\u003EThe central orange tube there, and its accessories, is the payload. There\u0027s a bit more fuel than you specify because of the parachutes, landing-legs, batteries, etc. 100% recovery if you fly it right, and a lot simpler than a comparable stock spaceplane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUmmm....

That\u0027s also the reason for having a little too much fuel in the liquid stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did try a large SRB as a mainstage with some RT10s, but had trouble getting a nice velocity during ascent - you may be right though.
