Arn1e\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOkey Dokey then, Here\u0027s my entry, from my Company:\u003Cp\u003Ebased on the \u0027Survivability\u0027 Tech Unlock (Radial parachutes, Standard Landing legs and the LV909 Engine) I have created a spacecraft that is capable not only of flyby\u0027s of both the Mun and Minmus, but has enough fuel (Delta-V) to land on one or the other if you so wish! (Warranty void in the event of stranding Kerbals on one of the Moons...) Be warned, it can be a little wobbly to fly due to not having Struts, but these will get unlocked very soon if you have managed to use either of the first 2 ships to get this far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff0000;\u0022\u003EMaximum Returns 3a\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/3299194632624865052/E315B4F059D03FAA946D15D7639E8E8CB6F79009/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/3299194632624865052/E315B4F059D03FAA946D15D7639E8E8CB6F79009/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./view/ki4lw1wlokdir55/Max_Return_3a.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.craft file\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to download and give her a go, and also feel free to adapt/adjust to your liking if you feel the need to! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: oops, just digging out the other screenshots of it now...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill waiting for your other screenshots to validate this as a working craft sir.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-15T06:47:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scarecrow88\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Scarecrow88\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI still fly to the Mun a lot, and enjoy making different designs to meet different requirements.
