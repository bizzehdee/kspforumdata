After Magellan\u0027s death in the Philippines, Elcano took command of the nau Victoria in the Moluccas and returned to Sanl\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BAcar de Barrameda in Spain, completing the circumnavigation started by Magellan.\n\nThis challenge is simple. So simple, it\u0027s easy. Well, it sounds easy. Those of us who have completed it, would probably disagree.\n\n**I now challenge you to become the next Elcano. I challenge you to do what no one, or very few have done. I challenge you to circumnavigate an orbital body, be it moon or planet, solely by ground and/or water.**\n\n**The rules are simple:** \n\nBasically, you are to circumnavigate, either equatorially or via a polar path. Your path should not diverge significantly from the intended direction. You may do as I did and mark your path via flags. Or you may provide ample proof via screen shots. Using ScanSat BTDT (Been there done that) scanners also works provided you don\u0027t have a bunch of different vessels with BTDT.\n\nPlant a flag at your beginning spot and return to that flag... the long way around.\n\n1. Stay on the ground or on (or below) the surface of any water present. (BRIEF jumps over dunes and such permitted.)\n\n2. Your vehicle must be Kerballed.\n\n3. The same vehicle that crosses the land, must also cross water. No ferrying your vehicle on a boat.\n\n4. To document your journey via images, or as those of us who have manage to complete this feat, by words or both.\n\n5. Mods are acceptable, those who complete this stock will have it noted. I don\u0027t think far or near will come into play. You may use Jeb if you wish for it\u0027s \u0027rover\u0027 heading controls. If you read the account of my circumnavigation, you\u0027ll find an alternative to Jeb.\n\n6. You may use replacement vehicles. If you read of my circumnavigation of Eve, you\u0027ll see why I allow this. Game mechanics are not kind to ground vehicles. Your crew must be transferred to any replacement vehicle and it must be very similar to the original. I understand this is a learning process... trust me on that... and I\u0027ll allow some design changes.\n\n7. You may use aerial recon vehicles.\n\n8. You may refuel if needed.\n\n9. Saving and reloading. Yes, you may do F9/F5. But if your vehicle is complex, like mine was when I circumnavigated Eve, I suggest you read over my journey to see what happened as a result.\n\n10. Asteroids or orbital bodies introduced to the Kerbol system via a plugin will not be considered valid orbital bodies for this challenge. Only stock planets and moods are acceptable.\n\n11. Any rule I haven\u0027t thought of that breaks the spirit of this challenge.\n\nThis challenge is not for the feint of heart. It will take persistence and a great deal of patience. If you\u0027re the competitive type and think of this challenge as a race, it will get boring really quick. If you look at it as I and [Wooks](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90261-Am-I-the-first-one-to-circumnavigate-Kerbin-by-land) did, as an adventure, you\u0027ll find plenty to keep you entertained.\n\nSince this is challenge is more about the journey than reaching the destination, feel free to create a thread in [Mission Reports](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/55-Mission-Reports) so that everyone can share in it. It doesn\u0027t matter whether it fails or not, everyone there loves to read the stories, even the sad ones.\n\nGood luck and um... Godspeed....\n\nAnd before you grumble about how long this will take... think back at how many hours you spent doing other things in KSP that ended up being less rewarding...\n\n**Advice to explorers**\n\nI\u0027m still testing a theory but, I highly suspect that issues I\u0027ve had with ground based vehicles while doing extended, multi-save and restore missions are caused by quicksaving while the vehicle is in motion. On two missions I\u0027ve had hugely misaligned parts. Gravitational and motion stresses on ground-based vehicles are a LOT more than spacecraft. If you quicksave while a part is misaligned due to these stresses and then reload, you just doomed your vessel to a corrupt save. Again, it\u0027s a theory I\u0027m testing but it sure sounds plausible.\n\n**Circumnavigators**\n\n**Planetary Circumnavigators**\n\n*Those who have circumnavigated both Kerbin \u0026 Eve*\n\n![Elcano Planetary Resize.png](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Elcano%20Planetary%20Resize.png)\n\nNone Yet.\n\n* * *\n\n**Master Mariner Circumnavigators**\n\n*Those who have circumnavigated both Kerbin \u0026 Laythe*\n\n*Click* [*HERE*](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113778-The-Elcano-Challenge-Ground-based-circumnavigation?p=2161955\u0026viewfull=1#post2161955) *for details on this specific award.*\n\n![Elcano Mariner Resize.png](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Elcano%20Mariner%20Resize.png)\n\n- Claw - Stock - Completed both Kerbin and Laythe water circumnavigations!\n- nigelvn - Mods - Completed both Kerbin and Laythe water circumnavigations!\n- RexKramer - Stock - Completed both Kerbin and Laythe water circumnavigations!\n\n* * *\n\n![Elcano Kerbin Resize.png](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Elcano%20Kerbin%20Resize.png)\n\n![Elcano Kerbin Resize Prop.png](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Elcano%20Kerbin%20Resize%20Prop.png)\n\n- [Wooks](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90261-Am-I-the-first-one-to-circumnavigate-Kerbin-by-land) - Stock (I\u0027m pretty sure) - I believe the first to circumnavigate Kerbin by ground, leaving some 70 Kerbals in his wake.

I wanted to do one but every time I read your post about it taking 6 MONTHS... I thot better of it. After my 3rd day on Eve, I realized, you just kinda took your time. I was greatly relieved.

You forced yourself into replacing crashed vehicles. I chose to go the F9 route. Getting my one replacement to Eve was entirely too time consuming. That and trying to get a raft there that worked... I decided on the amphib approach. I suppose, if someone did it like you did, with a boat... I might still include them. I\u0027ll think on that.
