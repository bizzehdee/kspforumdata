Hitting escape velocity without using an orbit to slingshot is easy but returning is harder as you still have to have enough fuel to burn off the escape velocity. Also at extreme distances it becomes harder to actually hit Kerbin on the return run. If you had enough fuel I guess you could just modify your trajectory a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want someone to get to the sun\\\u0027s distance and back with just vanilla and C7 parts\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Salda007","CreatedById":3432,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-10-12T20:44:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00226677\u0022 data-cite=\u00226677\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI want someone to get to the sun\\\u0027s distance and back with just vanilla and C7 parts\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDone and done; detailed post with screencaps to come in \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=3008.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis thread\u003C/a\u003E tonight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
