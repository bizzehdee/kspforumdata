Watched a lot of tutorials and managed to get some missions going. Now I would like to start doing things like NASA/ESA are doing, e.g. build a kerbal version of the ISS (or a similar large structure station), create a satellite, put it into a cargo hold and deploy on orbit (I don\u0027t like the tutorials/videos that just put the sat thing on top of the rocket and have it wobble all the way through the atmosphere - that\u0027s not very realistic), go to the moons, planets etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat would you consider the absolute must have plugin/add-ons for these things? I already have MechJeb and love it (once I figured out how to the the burns I don\u0027t wanna spent too much time doing them manually). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rpayne88","CreatedById":58336,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T02:46:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d say FAR, KW rocketry, B9, subassembly loader, and vanguard parachutes. FAR remodels the aerodynamics so parts produce drag and lift in a realistic manner. I primarily use KW for its fairings. It also provides new fuel tanks and engines ranging from 1.25m to 3.75m. B9, although a bit \u0022buggy\u0022 for me, adds multiple, believable, hard sci-fi parts. These are mostly structural and propulsion parts useful for constructing spaceplanes. Subassemly loader allows you to build an launch vehicle and place different payloads on it. It basically saves portions on ships so you don\u0027t have to build entire portions again. This is highly useful for orbital construction, saving you the time and effort of rebuilding the same LV several dozen times. Finally, vanguard parachutes adds parachutes to your Kerbals. In the event of an emergency (which will likely happen if you try to build spaceplanes,) this will allow your Kerbals to eject or \u0022bail out\u0022 of their \u0022death trap.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the future, though, you should post questions like this in either \u0022general discussion\u0022 or \u0022how to.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bloodbunny","CreatedById":67274,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T03:44:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely get KW.
