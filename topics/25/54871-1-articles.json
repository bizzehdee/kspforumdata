Points are going to be done more or less by the seat of my pants, but I\u0027ll give out ribbons for crushing it in a soft landing on level terrain on various low-gravity worlds. Soft landing means you touch down at a descent rate less than 1 second of free fall. More points awarded for more thorough destruction of the lander. Lander structural components stock only. All mods used for transporting the lander to the destination allowed. Must include screenshot immediately before landing showing speed, or other proof of soft landing.

Once again you may use any mods you want to get the craft there, including teleporting and save game editing, but only stock parts may be used as structural components on the lander. The same colors apply for the ribbons, but will be listed as part 2 ribbons. The white ribbon is the greatest part 1 achievement, whereas the black ribbon is the greatest part 2 achievement. Scoring will be done also by the seat of my pants, so use any visual tricks you can to trick me into believing that your lander should not, under any circumstances, hold up under the gravity. Taking a pic immediately after setting the craft down and before it crashes into a pile of rubble is totally cheating but I can\u0027t prove you did that, so I\u0027ll have to use the honor system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-02T03:58:01Z\u0022 title=\u002212/02/2013 03:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by thereaverofdarkness\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-01T08:38:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI fail at my own challenge...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComing in for a gentle landing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PCmGYxah.png\u0022 alt=\u0022PCmGYxah.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1x6 Photovoltaic Panel \u0022feet\u0022 buckling and swaying under the weight, but still holding:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rf9SKVvh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rf9SKVvh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESwaying the other way:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AUc3Hvph.png\u0022 alt=\u0022AUc3Hvph.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManaged to break the panels off by using the reaction wheels to slam the panels against the ground:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LD8BZDPh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LD8BZDPh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENothing else ever broke, but it does bounce a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Epthelyn","CreatedById":57970,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-01T10:12:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou underestimated the strength of panels and beams.

Even if you do build a craft flimsy enough, it will probably break apart attempting to land.
