It really worked! The only requirement is to know approximate transfer speeds.\n\nNote: MLX series was an attempt to create a light but reliable munar rocket. But this version is so overpowered that the lander stage can takeoff from the Mun and land back on Kerbin without activating the return vehicle (that can easily return from the surface of the Mun on its own RCS). So the craft has enough extra velocity for some experiments. Just remember to spare some RCS fuel to soften the landing on Kerbin.\n\nP.S. if it sticks to the pad, add decouplers under the engines."},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-08T20:39:32Z","Content":"This is on my to-do list once the college semester is done (next week)."},{"CreatedByName":"Panic","CreatedById":6441,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-11T20:26:44Z","Content":"I went one step further and tried it without using the navball either.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![QZFIg.png](http://i.imgur.com/QZFIg.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![3exyN.png](http://i.imgur.com/3exyN.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![htik9.png](http://i.imgur.com/htik9.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![RmaB8.png](http://i.imgur.com/RmaB8.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Perfect landing!\n\u003E \n\u003E ![9kw5M.png](http://i.imgur.com/9kw5M.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Just rolling away a little bit...\n\u003E \n\u003E ![veonS.png](http://i.imgur.com/veonS.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![IqtlD.png](http://i.imgur.com/IqtlD.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E To home!\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nThey ran out of fuel while trying to get home, though.\n\nAnyone want to try with no interface at all?
