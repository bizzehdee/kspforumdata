No orbital assembly.\n\n- Craft must hold at least FIVE Kerbals.\n\n- Craft must be able to not only make orbit around Jool, it must also be able to return to Kerbin orbit **without refuelling**.\n\n- No refuelling. What you leave the pad with, is what you have to complete the challenge.\n\n- Any parts mod valid.\n\n- Chemical engines \\*must\\* consume fuel.\n\n- Normal exploits rules (ie none) apply. No infinite fuel, unbreakable joints, welding, or hackgravity.\n\n- Jool orbit must fall within \u002B/-5% of the following track: 9,000km circular at 0 degrees inclination.\n\n- At least one complete orbit is required.\n\n- Return station around Kerbin is 500km at 0 degrees inclination (\u002B/-5%).\n\nPROOF:\n\nMission start (on pad) (MET clock START)\n\nKerbin initial orbit\n\nTransfer stage\n\nJool insertion\n\nJool orbit start} To determine whether or not you have actually completed an orbit\n\nJool orbit end }\n\nReturn transfer\n\nKerbin orbit (MET clock END)\n\nScore is your Mission Elapsed Time.\n\nSo far I\u0027ve calculated a perfect Jool transfer takes a little over 6 days at 0.1c (after loading up on exotics), and then you have about 16km/s to burn off to make orbit - or you\u0027re interstellar.\n\nMy SSE Racer, Mk.III (I\u0027m being honest, this is the third try - the other two are in interstellar space out of fuel, out of power, full of Kerbals and pretty much irretrievable). Now working on a MK.IV because this one ended up in an elliptical orbit around Jool (9,000kmx238,000km) then ran out of fuel!\n\n![screenshot124.png](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Zii55ziJ-UY/VPL_OCUoGMI/AAAAAAAABZ8/pr6is89iXHM/w1118-h629-no/screenshot124.png)\n\n(out of interest, anyone know if this forum parses html table tags correctly?)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-02T03:26:39Z\u0022 title=\u002203/02/2015 03:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ihtoit**"},{"CreatedByName":"sdj64","CreatedById":100819,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T23:13:57Z","Content":"What, exactly, do you \\*need\\* KSPI for? Besides the fact that a KSPI entry will beat most entries without it. But there are some mods that can compete, like the USI standalone warp drive (which would easily beat 6 days) and I\u0027m sure there are other mods with non-warp engines OP enough to give travel speeds of around 0.1c like your ship.\n\nThe mission itself is possible in stock if you\u0027re okay with times of a few hundred to 1000 days.\n\nThe forum supports tables, not sure about html but you can find the built in table feature in the advanced editor.\n\n[table=width: 500, class: grid]\n\n[tr]\n\n [td] 1 [/td]\n\n [td] 2 [/td]\n\n[/tr]\n\n[tr]\n\n [td]3[/td]\n\n [td]4[/td]\n\n[/tr]\n\n[tr]\n\n [td]5[/td]\n\n [td]6[/td]\n\n[/tr]\n\n[/table]"},{"CreatedByName":"ihtoit","CreatedById":78942,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T03:24:05Z","Content":"because this is a speed run (with the exception of the orbits), you\u0027re not going to do a 6 day transfer on chemical engines. If there\u0027re other Alcubierre type drives out there that could complete this challenge, I\u0027d like to see them because the only one I\u0027m aware of is KSPI. Apart from that, you\u0027re going to do 0.1c on chemical rockets, turn around and decelerate to orbital speed using the same engines?? I doubt it, the amount of fuel needed would be beyond ridiculous.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-02T03:30:18Z\u0022 title=\u002203/02/2015 03:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ihtoit**"}]}
