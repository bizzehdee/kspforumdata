I\u0027ve spent the past week devising the biggest craft I ever built. Which probably isn\u0027t all that big by other people\u0027s standards -- I\u0027ve seen single launch Eve missions that were at least just as big. But anyhoo, for me it\u0027s huge.\n\nAs I write this, the mission clock says 1h22m and I\u0027m moving at 6500m/s away from Kerbin. It will be another 1h40 to leave Kerbin SOI, and a good ten hours until I will finally shut down the engines. Due to the vessel\u0027s size, physics warp is out of the question, so I\u0027ll probably just leave it running overnight and while I\u0027m away.\n\nTurns out that once you\u0027re moving in a nearly straight line, even 30-minute maneuvers will be executed with insane precision.\n\nApart from the obvious problems (like spending 30 hours of development time and several kilograms of CO2 emmissions), there\u0027s also the minor issue that I used the kOS autopilot in order to instantly plot ~30 maneuver nodes.\n\nIf that would disqualify my entry, please let me know."},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T17:57:47Z","Content":"Looking forward to seeing this^.

It\u0027s just a case of me being trapped by the strangely attractive force of KSP in general, and a silly-but-intriguing engineering challenge in particular.\n\nMission plan: two stages (1000m/s@TWR=1, 600m/s@TWR=0.5) to get me away from Kerbin and moving in a relatively straight line;chasing Oberth with asparagus nukes for a burn time of ~4 hours, then another seven hours worth of stacked xenon tanks. After twenty minutes, every maneuver node equals one stage; there\u0027s gaps of about one or two minutes between the nodes/stages, and between them I\u0027m adjusting the maneuvers. Adjustments have been very small small, a few m/s for the first few, and after leaving Kerbin I\u0027m doing adjustments of less then 1m/s for maneuvers that last one hour and have several km/s of delta-v.\n\nDestination is Laythe. Last year, there was a challenge of \u0022maximum impact velocity\u0022 and it turned out that the soupmosphere will stop nearly anything. I approached Kerbin with ~30km/s and hit the ground at like 4km/s. Plotting the shortest possible path through the atmosphere was important. So this time, I\u0027m plotting a glancing blow and hope that it will allow for a parachute landing. I now realize that I haven\u0027t tried this before launching the mission; as I write this, I\u0027m halfway through my \u0022transfer\u0022 burn. It will be another six hours before I find out if my great plan can even work.\n\nSunny day outside; I\u0027ll leave this to mechjeb and will tell KAC to pause the game when I still have a couple km/s left."},{"CreatedByName":"purpleivan","CreatedById":120081,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T12:48:08Z","Content":"I took a crack at this challenge in the form of a landing on Mun and I\u0027m submitting my time of 37:24 minutes.\n\nAll burns of the vehicle were manual (i.e. no Mechjeb) which made life \u0022interesting\u0022.
