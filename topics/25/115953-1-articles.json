After that, you will EVA to the rover and land on the surface, leaving the command pod in orbit. After you have landed you will then need to meet back up with the orbiting craft and EVA back into the command pod. You can now go back to Kerbal.\n\nRecap:\n\n1. Get into Mun orbit.\n\n2. Take rover to surface, leaving command pod behind.\n\n3.
