But as you can see from the screenshots in the KTC thread where the resource tab is open, even above 6km on Duna I still have about 1/2 the FScoolant. Perhaps it has something to do with Duna\u0027s lower gravity? Or that Duna\u0027s atmosphere isn\u0027t oxygen? Or that Duna\u0027s colder than Kerbin so there\u0027s less need of coolant? Or maybe the mod\u0027s code works on ASL and not pressure altitude so the engines think they\u0027re in thicker air than they really are. I have no idea. Also, solar panels work better on Duna than they do on Kerbin, I\u0027m guessing because the atmosphere\u0027s thinner even though Kerbol is further away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, during the course of building the D\u0027OH, I discovered that high altitude on Kerbin isn\u0027t a good approximation of Duna for whatever reason. Plus, there\u0027s no ground that high to practice landing and taking off on. So, there was nothing for it but to \u0022build a Duna simulator\u0022. Meaning, in a separate save file from the KTC, I used HyperEdit to put the various prototypes into Duna orbit with a small deorbit stage slapped on. That way, I could test the whole thing from initial atmospheric entry to landing, taking off again, and flying around. Once I had something that could fly on Duna, I copied it over to the KTC file and set about working on getting off the ground on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe second problem I face, is, as I said, getting the darn thing to orbit. ...

I know of 3 alternative methods. One you\u0027ve already thought of, 2 copies of the plane. Part count killed me on this, too. The second I call the \u0022Bothersome Method\u0022 after the guy who explained it to me. In this one, you use the airplane\u0027s wings as the tailfins of the rocket and build several boosters on outriggers surrounding, with more on the top side so the asymmetrical thrust balances the asymmetrical lift and the CoM is above the CoL as it should be. Never could get that to work. The 3rd method is to turn it into a horizontal take-off spaceplane, which is how I eventually got the D\u0027OH into orbit. You can see pics of this monstrosity in the KTC thread. What I did was put some fuel and SABREs behind the D\u0027OH with some of the B9 Heavy Wings and fiddled with their positions to get the CoM and CoL lined up correctly, taking the D\u0027OH\u0027s wings into account. After much work tuning the fuel ratios, I finally got this to work. And when I did, it was the sweetest-flying spaceplane I\u0027ve ever made. It just walked on up there without any of the typical control difficulty. It had so much wing it never had much angle of attack so leveling off for speed at 20km was no problem--it practically did it by itself. Once in orbit, I docked on a transfer tug and off to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAerocapture at Duna was a bit tricky. First, I got a REALLY bad encounter due to a glitch with the patched conics. Then, having the heavy transfer tug on the back end, which I had to keep to fill up the D\u0027OH with Kethane before landing, screwed the CoM. Thus, I couldn\u0027t go very deep without getting dangerously unstable, which meant I had to make a significant burn. Good thing I brought enough fuel for that \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI never put chutes on the D\u0027OH, just earlier prototypes. I agree, CoM placement is the only way to prevent lawndarting, but it raises other problems. First off, CoM chutes have to be your sole means of descent because you can\u0027t keep going forward, so you need enough of them to get your vertical speed down into the safe range. Which on Duna, especially with the challenge requirement of landing and taking off at a minimum of 2500m ground level, means a LOT of chutes, at least with something as big as the D\u0027OH. I did check the parachute calculator while building the D\u0027OH and found I needed like 6 or 8 TONS of chutes. Given that I\u0027d had to pare weight to the bone just to get the D\u0027OH to fly at all, I could tell that wasn\u0027t going to work, so instead focused on making the D\u0027OH able to fly slow, tough enough to bounce, and very unlikely to flip over.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-31T23:10:23Z\u0022 title=\u002210/31/2013 11:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 31, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Geschosskopf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"1D-1()T","CreatedById":75340,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-01T08:02:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/hK1Mz#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/hK1Mz#0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is an album of my plane.

IE fairings etc. Not sure whether you consider FAR adjusting aerodynamics too much to be allowed for a plane challenge anyway, but I thought I\u0027d ask.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this challenge, all mods are fair game except those that defeat the spirit of the game. IOW, I have no problem with HyperEdit used to merely to test how your plane flies on Duna, but you still have to launch and transfer it there without it. And IIRC, you get a bonus point for making completing this challenge using FAR. If not, I\u0027ll go and add that now because that was in the original version of this challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t used FAR since 0.20 so I can\u0027t speak with authority on how it acts these days. However, back then, FAR really like rockets to be like arrows. That is, long and skinny with the weight at the front and tail feathers at the back. FAR also created a lot of lift off fairings. The reasons for using fairings thus were to reduce drag and to make the lift and drag of the payload symmetrical. But the more fairing you had on the top, the more tail feathers you needed on the bottom to pull the CoL down well below the CoM. I used to use stock delta wings with standard control surfaces as my tail fins instead of the usual winglets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, a plane that can fly on Duna needs to have an extremely low wing loading (low mass, huge lift). If this is on the top of the rocket, it\u0027s exactly the opposite of what FAR liked back then and probably still likes. And the lift would be asymmetrical. I suppose that you could only cover this up with a procedural fairing, but FAR would probably still give that a huge amount of symmetrical lift. So you would probably have to build huge B9 or procedural wings on the bottom to make it launch correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T04:32:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00221D-1()T\u0022 data-cite=\u00221D-1()T\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/hK1Mz#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/hK1Mz#0\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is an album of my plane.

They have essentially the same general design- but mine was upsized and optimized a bit for higher thrust (about 1/3 greater relative to mass), higher lift (maybe 25-30% more), and about the same wing load... It probably flies that high on Duna (whereas that design wouldn\u0027t have reached even 17,200 meters cruising altitude on Kerbin) due to the lower gravity...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, about the solar panels Geschosskopf- the atmosphere on Duna is going to be similar at max cruising altitude on Kerbin and Duna in terms of thickness (a bit less on Duna, as the reduced gravity means cruising is possible at lower atmospheric pressures). What I\u0027m pretty sure the main difference is, is the scale height. Since Duna\u0027s atmosphere has a smaller scale height than Kerbin\u0027s (that is, it falls off more rapidly), you have less atmosphere above you at a give pressure level there. Which means less atmosphere to interfere with the sun\u0027s light, even though solar radiation *IS* weaker there...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, somehow my craft files got corrupted for the electric planes I designed for Duna (I think it might have been from some additional mods I installed- all my SPH designs but one were corrupted- they fell through the runway and crash the game when launched. On that note, I also lost some traditional jet designs,and an adaptation I made of my Duna flier for the Kerbal Airliner Challenge that never circumnavigated due to the severe lag from all the External Command Seats I strapped on for crew capacity...), and I don\u0027t have the heart to design it all over again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I downloaded the KSP Interstellar mod, added it my Career save, and developed an even better design! I introduce, the Nuclear-Powered Thermal Turbojet! Here\u0027s a couple images, and I\u0027ll post a craft file just as soon as somebody can tell me how to get the darn Forum file attachment system working right now (I can\u0027t find the button to attach files?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LJSbo3J.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LJSbo3J.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MubesfO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MubesfO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that the second image is a slightly earlier version than my current working one- I moved the parachutes a tiny bit closer to the COM and adjusted them so they weren\u0027t clipping into (read- almost completely concealed by) the front winglets, which I added into the design after the parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found it\u0027s an excellent design, able to reach 18,750 meters cruising altitude on Kerbin- shattering my previous record with electric propellers. Because it\u0027s a type of jet, rather than propeller, the engines still work very well at that altitude- so it could conceivably fly much higher if I could find a good way to reduce its wingload or increase its thrust further. It\u0027s still in the prototype stages- I\u0027ll send an improved version (with crew capacity for 2, instead of 1) to Duna. I\u0027ve also FINALLY developed SABRE engines not long ago (the tech node is really expensive, and advanced)- so I\u0027ll be able to use that to get it off Kerbin- since I assume you won\u0027t take kindly to my using my newly-installed (but thus far largely unused- except for an orbital scrapper/recycler ship I built with it and an Extraplanetary Launchpads recycling part to clear debris from Kerbin orbit...) Orbital Construction mod to simply build a copy in-orbit...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich brings me to another point- there are actually TWO ways to increase a plane\u0027s altitude ceiling. ONE is to increase lift relative to its mass, or decrease mass relative to lift (reducing \u0022wingload\u0022). The OTHER is to increase thrust relative to wingload- thus increasing max speed and making the existing wings effectively provide more lift, and reducing the effects of gravity if flying in the direction of the planet\u0027s rotation... I\u0027ve taken more this approach with my Nuclear Powered Thermal Turbojet, since I find adding too many wings and winglets drastically increases my game\u0027s lag... (my electric propeller design I was going to launch to Duna, while it did carry 5 propellers- which could only be fully powered near maximum altitude where the sunlight was strongest- still mostly relied on minimizing wingload to raise its altitude ceiling- as propellers work very poorly at high altitude).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a side-note, the high mass, high thrust approach actually works BETTER on Duna than on Kerbin- where the lower gravity means that you essentially get penalized less for the extra mass, whereas you still see the same benefits from the TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, finally, you must be asking by now \u0022What exactly is a Nuclear Powered Thermal Turbojet?\u0022 Well let me tell you. A turbojet, as you know, relies on pushing exhaust out the rear of the plane to achieve thrust. A traditional/conventional turbojet achieves this by combusting jet fuel. However, as we all know, jet engines don\u0027t work on Duna thanks to the lack of any substantial amount of oxygen there...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA thermal turbojet, on the other hand, works on a slightly different principle. Rather than relying on combustion to generate thrust, it relies on heat transfer to air passing through the engine- superheating it and then pushing it out the rear of the engine. \u0022How do you heat this air if you can\u0027t combust fuel?\u0022, you might ask. Simple. You pass it over a small nuclear reactor. Now a nuclear reactor isn\u0027t exactly light- but if you can manage to lift one into the air on a plane, you have a very efficient means of propulsion- one that can last for YEARS without needing refueling (provision of fresh uranium supplies for the reactor).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plane\u0027s reactor\u0027s uranium supply doesn\u0027t last forever, though. That\u0027s where the other components of the KSP Interstellar, and the Kerbal Attachment System (or hard-docking, if you\u0027re feeling really masochistic) mods come into play... Since KSP Interstellar mod introduces nuclear reactors that *DO* consume Uranium Hexafluoride (the \u0022UF6\u0022 in my screenshot resources tab) at a very slow rate; it also introduces a way to replenish that nuclear fuel supply- albeit a slightly expensive/unwieldy one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe nuclear fuel doesn\u0027t simply disappear as the reactor utilizes it. Instead, like in real life, depleted uranium rods are left over (the \u0022DUF6\u0022 in my screenshot resources tab). The mod allows these rods to be reprocessed, re-enriching the uranium at a Science Lab with a sufficiently powerful nuclear reactor attached to it (which is used as a breeder-reactor: look it up if you\u0027re not sure what that is). So, you can recycle the uranium, prolonging the service life of your nuclear-powered craft essentially indefinitely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never actually used the re-enrichment system yet, as I just installed the mod, and like in real life the nuclear fuel supply is consumed VERY slowly- with most nuclear reactors taking something on the order of years to exhaust their uranium supply. However, I know the reprocessing can be done- and since I intend to greatly reduced the uranium loading of my plane\u0027s reactor to save weight (like in the screenshot- the three reactor cores it hosts can normally hold up to 0.60 UF6- however I only have a bit less than 0.03 loaded on the plane for the test flight- thanks to TAC Fuel Balancer...), I might have to do it sooner rather than later. The UF6 isn\u0027t light, by the way- a single reactor (which is already rather heavy to begin with) holds only 0.20 UF6- but that much fuel weighs a solid 1.0 TON of weight in the game... Hence why I reduced my plane\u0027s loading for the test-flight to determine maximum cruising altitude (a bit over under 19,000 meters on Kerbin- but I rounded it down to the nearest 250-meter mark for safety).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe strategy of increasing thrust (and thus airspeed) relative to wingload in order to raise maximum altitude has another benefit, by the way. The plane moves a lot FASTER! Which means, it won\u0027t take me nearly as long to circumnavigate Duna (even with a greatly reduced nuclear fuel supply, my design should easily be able to fly for several weeks or more of continuous flight- which is more than enough time to get anywhere my Kerbals are going, and then eventually return for some freshly-enriched uranium from a Science Lab base-site on Duna. In real life, the thermal turbojet engine would probably need maintenance long before the fuel supply ran out.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, it\u0027s not a cheat-mod. The thrust isn\u0027t free (the necessary nuclear reactors are VERY heavy, and still require a constant UF6 fuel supply), that\u0027s for sure. Initially, given the weight of my craft, I was surprised it even made it off the ground at all on Kerbin. As-is, the thing barely clears the end of the runway on Kerbin due to its weight- but it should lift off much quicker on Duna, thanks to the reduced gravity... I might also install a level deployable-runway or two on Duna using the Extraterrestrial Launchpads mod- if that\u0027s allowed (I won\u0027t be using it to build the ship, and I probably wouldn\u0027t be bringing the necessary Rocket Parts warehouses to build things there anyways- at least not at first, though maybe eventually for future expansion of my operations there- just not for this plane challenge), just for the permanent bases of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, one last bit before I cut this post off. The Nuclear Thermal Turbojet Plane I built is capable of using a couple SMALL parachutes in \u0022drogue\u0022 mode in level flight- thanks to its very high weight, and thus significant momentum. They don\u0027t exert enough torque relative to weight/rotational inertia to tilt the craft, at least not in slow flight close to the ground. This should prove ESSENTIAL to safely landing the thing on Duna, thanks to the much thinner atmosphere at landing altitudes there requiring some sort of way to further slow my craft down in landing, thanks to its relatively high wingload...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI DO have to cut the chutes before the fully deploy in its current configuration however, else the thing will probably still lawn-dart when they open all the way... (though I haven\u0027t let them stay open long enough to see if that happens yet- and Duna gravity is lower, so the lawn-dart might be at a safe speed). Since cut chutes obviously can\u0027t be re-packed, this means I am probably doing to have to either restrict their use on Duna to landing sites too high up for full deployment before touchdown, or find a way to attach KSP\u0027s stock drogue chutes to the thing somehow- which are problematic for their ability to only be connected to a proper attachment port, rather than radially.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, I lied, one more thing. I\u0027m looking at building upgraded (larger) versions of the plane, using either 2.5 meter stacks or additional outboard fuselages, to further maximize thrust-wingload ratio. So the design I eventually launch to Duna might not even too closely resemble this one. Larger designs would of course have the benefit of being able to carry more cargo- as it stands, I\u0027m worried about the drag effects of just slapping more than a couple lawnchairs on the thing, to increase its crew capacity (currently only 1- so it doesn\u0027t yet meet the minimum requirements- though a single centrally-placed External Command Seat, or larger/additional cockpit, should fix that).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you like the Nuclear Thermal Turbojet idea- and don\u0027t consider use of the KSP Interstellar mod cheating (let me know if you do). As is, I\u0027m not even using the highest level of upgraded nuclear reactors (better reactors equal more Thermal Power, and higher core temperatures- and thus more thermal turbojet thrust, though at the cost of higher fuel consumption) for the thing- since I haven\u0027t developed the tech nodes for anything beyond solid-core reactors (level #2- upgraded once from the basic version, but not to the most advanced level) yet...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeedless to say, I\u0027d get an even higher thrust return on my mass with an Antimatter Reactor (which I haven\u0027t developed the INSANELY expensive tech node for yet)- though the process for refueling that thing\u0027s a huge pain-in-the-rear (it requires MASSIVE amounts of electrical power to produce Antimatter, and a Science Lab- which by the way, is huge, and weighs 3.5 TONS). Those things also require antimatter containment tanks, rather than carrying their fuel internally- which makes for an even more unwieldy plane design...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar1989\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-13T04:47:35Z\u0022 title=\u002211/13/2013 04:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"1D-1()T","CreatedById":75340,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T04:55:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou seem to have put a lot more thought into this than I did, Northstar1989.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just found a propulsion method that would work on Duna and made something with big wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, I have thought of a way to get a LOT more points, which I am considering attempting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
