Where is the fun and the challenge in that if we can cheat to get it into orbit? Just building an RCS transfer stage with about 1500 dV is easy (pod, rcs tank, energy source, some thrusters depending on how patient you are), and using a cheaty infinite fuel stage for orbit doesn\u0027t make this any more challenging, just tedious (you will need about 100-200 RCS additional thrusters to get a tolerable TWR). Seriously, did you even try that for yourself and thought \u0022hey, that would be fun and/or interesting\u0022?\n"}]}
