This is because I am not a very good pilot when it comes to gravity assists, I have only did 1 other interplanetary ship with a proper mission and though put into it (and no cheating.) Rather than me strapping a whole bunch of stuff together with a satellite and then throwing it off to another planet, of which halfway through I turn on infinite fuel because I wanna see pretty places. This will be my secondary interplanetary (or third, if an eve window is earlier, this IS my kolonization save, so it\u0027s not a seperate JOOL 5 save.
