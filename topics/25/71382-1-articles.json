When i built my GPS constellation i used an external Java tool (OnScreenProtractor), but an ingame tool for this might be really helpful. Anyway, this is not an entry, as my constellation has 9 probes on each of the three orbital planes, the altitude is different, and i launched the probes in packs of five.

Nice constellation there... the way I do it is to set my apoapse to synchronous altitude and fine tune my periapse until my orbital period is 5h0m, then release one satellite per orbit and burn at apoapse to circularise. Coming in from above is also fairly simple, it just deploys your satellites in reverse order: set your periapse to sync altitude then fine tune your apoapse to 7h0m, release 1 bird per orbit and burn retrograde at periapse to 6h0m. Either way, if you do it right you\u0027ll have precisely 60 degrees separation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ihtoit","CreatedById":78942,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-04T15:47:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor three birds at 120 degrees, just set your orbit to 2/3 sync (ie, 4h orbit), release 1 bird per orbit and insert to synchronous orbit.
