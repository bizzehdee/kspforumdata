Here is the biggest challenge I have ever conceived. I have determined that it is at the very edge of being possible, with reasonably-balanced parts. \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EI don\\\u0027t think anyone\\\u0027s ever done this, but I could be wrong.\u003C/span\u003E Jellycubes is a witch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s deceptively simple. Design a rocket that launches to orbit, then lands on kerbin, then launches to orbit, then lands on kerbin, then launches to orbit, then lands, at long last, on Kerbin. \u003Cem\u003EEdit: Apparently this has been done. So let\\\u0027s try an adjustment: No water landings. Kerbin\\\u0027s oceans are (apparently) made out of liquid mercury (or else KSP rockets are made of solid air, hard to say which.). Everything floats, and everything floats really really well. Land on land. (unless you\\\u0027re a witch, in which case you will float. Like a duck. Or very small rocks.)\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\\\u0027s three launches, three landings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve successfully completed all the individual components of this mission, but I\\\u0027ve never successfully strung it all together into a single attempt without messing up at some point. I used Foamy\\\u0027s instant orbiter to successfully test my ability to go from orbit -\u0026gt; kerbin -\u0026gt; orbit -\u0026gt; kerbin -\u0026gt; orbit -\u0026gt; kerbin, and in a separate mission I have launched the same full rocket into orbit, but I have yet to do it all in one mission without catastrophically messing up one of the landings or launches. The first stage of the launcher consists of 19x 3-meter LFT\\\u0027s and 36 of those jumbo KW SRB\\\u0027s. The first stage, alone, weighs 5000 kerbin tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are no bonus points here. To even imply that any successful execution of this mission could possibly be made more awesome is sacrilege of the highest order. If you succeed, then you have won. Post lots of pictures, or a video, if possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly balanced parts allowed. KW, downunder, novapunch, the kerbalon launch tower (you\\\u0027ll need it), my miscellania pack, etc. Silisko edition engines are allowed only if they get all their fuel from silisko-edition tanks. No C7, except for the hardpoints and RCS. And don\\\u0027t use the ultra-RCS for thrust. Maybe use foamy\\\u0027s instant orbiter to test the lander stages, so you don\\\u0027t end up having to rebuild your launcher because you need to rebalance the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck.

Burn the witch!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm. It never occurred to me to try water landings. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeh on the high power RCS. I find a small number of high-power RCS are less laggy than tons of small RCS, and thus prefer them for that reason. Using the RCS as primary thrust wouldn\\\u0027t be particularly effective for getting into kerbin orbit except maybe for the last launch. And honestly, the last stage is such a tiny fraction of the total mass, it\\\u0027s a moot point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, challenge adjusted: no water landings. Water landings are only possible because the water is so unbelievably dense compared to all KSP rocket modules. (for example: decouplers are solid metal, yet float extremely well.) You\\\u0027ll need landing legs, and a slower landing, plus you have to waste delta-V aiming for a flat landing site. I think that ramps up the difficulty a bit. Plus, the fact that jellycube weighs the same as a duck won\\\u0027t help him. \u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
