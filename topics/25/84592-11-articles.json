Only because real aircraft have a way to shift fuel quickly and easily from tank to tank without needing to run a million giant yellow fuel hoses. Like the F-15C Eagle for example, it automatically shifts its fuel load to maintain the optimum balance for the aircraft during flight. TAC Fuel Balancer is just one of those things that if you use FAR you should use something like it to maintain the realistic balance of the aircraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd Real Chutes is just awesome.
