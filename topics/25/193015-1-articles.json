I\u0027ve pretty much concluded that my original plan with two crewed Mun landers is just not doable in caveman mode. Instead, I\u0027m thinking of going with two probe landers with a single Science Jr. and goo can each, plus a single fly-by / o\u003C/span\u003Erbit mission (which might as well be crewed). And maybe launch a couple of extra landers, just in case I crash one or land in the wrong biome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill having some issues with lander stability. On the plus side, apparently my return stage is capable of horizontal takeoff. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/kU71Fg-tD-c?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-04-14T07:54:52Z\u0022 title=\u002204/14/2020 07:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EApril 14, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by vyznev\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dnbattley","CreatedById":176526,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-14T08:03:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223770651\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022193015\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221586849941\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002290620\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vyznev\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n18 minutes ago, vyznev said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(And contracts \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E give science rewards.
