I sure do. It was called Project Mun, designed and failed in my first version, 0.23.\n\nProject Mun\u0027s Mission Plans:\n\n1. Use the 4 jet engines to boost it up to 10km\n\n2. Decouple payload, which was a 3-man pod, big fuel tank, and nuclear engine (was unaware of low thrust and terrible ISP in atmosphere)\n\n3. Fly into an orbit, and fly to the Mun.\n\n4. Option 1: Land and wait for rescue. Option 2: Orbit and study the surface for future missions \\*cough\\* my first landing\n\n5. If I chose Option 2, go home.\n\nIt failed miserably, it\u0027s highest altitude was 72m, as it crashed every time.\n\nLet\u0027s not drift away like a noob\u0027s EVA now. This challenge is to pull that first rocket idea out of the vault, and recreate it to be successful. Let\u0027s bring out DA RULES now.\n\n1. 100% Stock (You most likely did not have mods)\n\n2. No cheats or edited configs, don\u0027t forget the debug menu.\n\n3. Parts relating to the [update!\\[arrow-10x10.png\\](http://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/) of design only (I would use any parts circa .23, because it was my first version)\n\n4. No Commando Seats or Probe Cores (To be honest, all of us just stuck a 3 man pod on and stuck with it)\n\n5. Have Fun (Not having fun will disqualify you)\n\nScoreboard (lowest cost)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nMaybe I\u0027ll get a badge soon ;D\n\nFollow rule 5, I\u0027m serious.\n\nHappy flying!"},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T01:42:41Z","Content":"You\u0027re asking me to remember something I did years ago?

It got me reminiscing about my trip to the Mun in the free demo. First I crash-landed, stranding Jeb. I slapped two Mk1 capsules onto a rescue ship (there being no Mk1-2 in demo) and sent Bill to get him. Success! But I ran the ship out of fuel in Mun orbit. Following the rule of \u0027leave no Kerbal behind\u0027 even in demo, I sent Bob with with THREE Mk1 capsules (stacked in line, with the middle one upside-down) and made the rendezvous in a crazy elliptical Mun orbit without benefit of navball markers. Jeb and Bill had to EVA 10km to get to the rescue ship, and all splashed down safely on Kerbin. I learned a lot about KSP that day, and I bought the full game immediately afterwards.\n\nThanks Kaboom for reminding me of that ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Jean Deaux","CreatedById":59842,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T01:23:07Z","Content":"I couldn\u0027t figure out if your challenge was to recreate your first mission, or if you were just recalling your first mission as an example.
