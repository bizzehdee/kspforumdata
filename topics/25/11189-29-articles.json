I had to double-check if there were any NERVAs. I still find it amazing that you got that thing to Laythe without a NERVA.\n\nThanks! I\u0027ve found that for my designs at least, NERVAs don\u0027t work too well with low part count ssto\u0027s. The low TWR of NERVAs means many maneuvers will require more dV, and the relatively high mass of each NERVA (2.25T) reduces the overall amount of dV that you get (on small craft anyway). The LV-909\u0027s on the other hand give me a good TWR allowing me to do maneuvers for less dV cost. Likewise, the single jet engine has a much easier time pushing two LV-909\u0027s and the lower mass of those engines gives me nice boost to overall dV once I\u0027m in orbit.\n\nYou can get around this by having 20\u002B air intakes and a few jet engines take you to 40km\u002B at 2000m/s\u002B and then using a NERVA or two, but then you don\u0027t get a low part count which is what I wanted (especially since extra intakes will probably require extra struts).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-23T23:03:29Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2013 11:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by PotatoOverdose**"},{"CreatedByName":"carazvan","CreatedById":73074,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T09:54:57Z","Content":"Here\u0027s a run to Duna and back ... it\u0027s the 3rd album in [Ant SSTO Presentation](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/41382-Ant-SSTO-%28versions-2x1t-Payload-VTOL-Docking-or-Vertical-Landing%29?p=532717)"},{"CreatedByName":"japa","CreatedById":9777,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T11:08:28Z","Content":"\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

People have been asking me for a video of how I build my crafts so I decided to make one sens I wanted to try some stuff out for future crafts. Its not my best craft so its more experimental.\n\u003E I went with a low profile slim wing with closely mounted engine nacelles. This allows the wing to support it self with out the help of the fuselage or external struts and that was a must to accommodated the cargo hold or it would just collapse on it self from previous experience. The closely mounted engine nacelles allows fuel to be stored in them with out adding stress on the wings and the low profile wing in combination with the closely mounted engine nacelles allows for landing wheels to be placed optimally to take stress of the fuselage and wings. The Cockpit is mounted with a 10 degree down tilt to allow for IVA take of and landings and overall easier IVA flight. A probe core is mounted at the default angle to allow for a proper vector when doing burns in space.\n\u003E \n\u003E It also has stock cargo bay doors that can open and close. Not my idea so I wont take credit for that. But they do help stiffening the fuselage when close.\n\u003E \n\u003E The cargo bay is relatively long and can hold more jumbo tanks then the craft can carry but the intended cargo tends to be a lot longer VS weight then a few jumbo tanks so I wanted a long cargo bay, as long as posible. Benchmark payload was 63 tons and thats its max with out any further optimization to the craft. The craft is 99 ton dry weight so its not a light one due to a lot of I beams, many are cosmetic but most are structural. Further optimization with less esthetics\u0027s could reduce tonnage and increase payload capacity with 16 tons at least.\n\u003E \n\u003E But I think its sufficient to lift my Explorer version 2 or a equally capable version of it sens it was about 58 tons. But a real mission has not been undertaken yet.\n\u003E \n\u003E I call here the Falcon XII Skymaster Transport (didn\u0027t come up with anything better, names are not my thing)\n\u003E \n\u003E -snip-\n\u003E \n\u003E Here is two videos, part 1 covers construction and part 2 is the test flight.\n\nI made something similar (almost identical actually) a few updates ago, I just never got time to finish it.
