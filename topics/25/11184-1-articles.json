They want a Rover which can cover vast distances in as shorter amount of time as possible without sustaining any damage. So to achieve this they have called on you and others to design and test your own Rover which does exactly this.*\n\n*KSP has chosen a testing site which they feel best represents the surface likely to be encountered on Mun or Minimus. The test is to reach the mountain ranges located inland from the Kerbin Space Centre. Distance is roughly 40 000m.*\n\n![distances.jpg](http://img36.imageshack.us/img36/2275/distances.jpg)\n\n*The winning Rover will be the one that makes this distance in the least amount of time* Undamaged.\n\n**Rules:**\n\n-You can only use stock parts.\n\n-Rover cannot leave the ground and become airborn at any time (Minor bouncing acceptable).\n\n-Rover must be constructed in the hanger (Aka launch from the Runway).\n\n-Rover must traverse the ground between the runway and the mountain ranges.\n\n-Rover must arrive at the mountain ranges in undamaged.\n\n-Must travel at least 38 000m (38k) to qualify. Over 40k is deemed excellent.\n\n-Pictures/Videos or it didn\\\u0027t happen.\n\n**Scores**\n\n*\\*Scores are based of the mission times when you submit your score remember to screen capture your flight results menu\\**\n\n**\u0027Distance: 9k - \u003E40k\u0027 Scores**\n\n1st: 3:27 chanic (overshot by 4.1k)\n\n2nd: 3:51 chanic (overshot by 5.3k)\n\n3rd: 3:52 Kosmo-not (overshot by 600m) \n\n4th: 4:04 Optical9090 (overshot 700m)\n\n5th: 4:13 SasquatchM\n\n6th: 4:22 Kosmo-not\n\n**\u0027Distance: 38k-39k\u0027 Scores:**\n\n1st: 3:38 Kosmo-not\n\n2nd: 4:54 Shades\n\n3rd: 5:20 Optical9090\n\n4th: 5:33 Shades\n\n5th: 5:54 Shades\n\nGood Luck ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif), it\\\u0027s challenging.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChallenge Inspired by this video: [http://youtu.be/Rhei9mwR3P0](https://youtu.be/Rhei9mwR3P0)"},{"CreatedByName":"0muffins0","CreatedById":25347,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-22T10:29:09Z","Content":"This is deceptively hard.\n\n\u0027Hey 60 m/s seems safe, lets do 70\u0027\n\n\u0027It\\\u0027s nice and stable at 70 m/s.
