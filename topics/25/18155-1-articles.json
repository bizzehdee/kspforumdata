If I wasn\u0027t flying at 3 frames per second I could test it completely myself, but I can\u0027t stage fast enough with the framerates I have. As soon as I activate the separation rockets the next frame I get (2 seconds later) it is pointing more or less straight up, then I can\u0027t separate properly, it should work if I could send it commands. So here are the challenges for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) How fast can you get the small drop plane (more or less a booster with wings) flying and successfully land (hopefully the drogue chutes don\u0027t pop the capsule off this time)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) How high can you get this thing before (successful) separation?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) How high can you send the drop plane (and land)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Can it reach a stable orbit?
