The mission plan was as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 6 spacers in total: Jeb, Bill, and Bob were the experienced ones, and Kenrie, Rodtop, and Lumy were the trainees\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- each landing had to include at least one experienced spacer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- each landing was two Kerbals\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the trainees would be allowed to take control for landings on each of the smaller 3 moons, with a trainer along for supervision\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- order of visits went Laythe, Tylo, Vall, Pol, Bop\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- F9 was only permitted for incidents which completely killed the mission. Turned out that, with the exception of Tylo, only one was required, and that was during assembly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- MJ was the only mod used. I used to have the NF Docking tool but haven\u0027t gotten it working in 23.5 yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the mission had 10 comfy seats in total (6 in the lander cans, 4 in the HH can) which we felt was enough leg room\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe original mission was designed in 22. I skipped right over 23 because I knew 23.5 was coming, plus I still had stuff to do in 22. However, ultimately I uploaded 23.5 at about the same time as my first attempt proved to be fatally underfuelled in 22, so I went ahead and relaunched in 23.5 The mission itself used no new 23.5 parts however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDAISY-B was assembled in 4 pieces - the main drive went up first (this is documented). Then I sent up the twin Tylo/Laythe landers in two smaller launches to dock. Then the BVP lander was sent up with an even smaller launch. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy confession: prior to the BVP lander launch, I had to refuel the 20 nearly empty OT\u0027s. We drove to the space station (which I haven\u0027t used in a LONG time) and sucked up all fuel that we could, but still had a long way to go. Tried a couple of refuel missions with pre-23.5 designs, and they worked fine, but frankly they were pretty wimpy and would have required 40 or 50 missions to complete. So we used the new 23.5 parts and designed a whole new fuel supply ship which got \u0026gt;10,000 units of fuel to orbit, and completed refuelling in many fewer missions. SO, it\u0027s a 22 ship, but with help from 23.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wanted to avoid strapping the spacers to chairs, so every landing involved a 2-man lander can. This, plus the weight of the Tylo/Laythe landers, added a whale of a lot of oomph required for the whole mission. I started with a 10-OT design using the same landers, but realized after the Laythe landing that we were short on dV. Then I returned to the VAB and discovered that I could detach the 2x5 OT drive section, switch to 4X sym, and reattach - all fully strutted! - with a 4X5 OT drive section. Without further ado, off we went.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did not worry about debris. I feel it can be collected and used by future generations of spacers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI learned a lot from this challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I could have put HH cans onto each lander instead of the 2-man lander cans for the same weight and landed 4 Kerbals at each moon, but it seemed cheaty to me to not include an obvious \u0022command spot\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I got far far better at efficient maneuvers as the mission progressed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- MJ can not drive 20 OT ships, no matter how well balanced you think they are\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- MJ can not land my BVP lander on small moons - I watched in fascination as it spun around and around the lander\u0027s center of mass about 4 KM above Pol until I grabbed control\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the strange glitch whereby a Kerbal disappears from the main view happened a number of times - could always be fixed by exiting and coming back\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- really, REALLY make sure the fuel lines run in the right direction on your Tylo land/ascent vehicle\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the inspiration!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-04T15:57:38Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2014 03:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by James_Eh\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ziv","CreatedById":91995,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-04T11:23:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ChaserGrey\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ChaserGrey\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGrr.
