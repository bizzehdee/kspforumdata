Budget restrictions meant we only had enough funds for 2 landers so the two problem moons Laythe and Tylo were singled out as the limits of performance for the landers. An airbreathing lander was designed for Laythe and a High Dv lander was created for Tylo with the orbit section of the Tylo lander having refuel capability for the center stage and this stage was given landing legs to enable it to land on the remaining 3 moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was decided to build the craft in orbit at the OCS (Orbital Construction Station) and refuel it there. A previous failed mission to Jool had found that the KR-2L did not have the performance envelope required for the mission so a cluster of NERVA engines was used for the second attempt. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launches were separated into tylo lander, laythe lander, propulsion section, Hab unit (designed for reentry at the end of the mission), Ferry unit with 2 NERVA and some utility adapters with differing sizes of docking ports and RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was decided that just a few fixed solar panels would supply enough energy for the mission but a hefty battery bank would be needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe images show the construction of the Jool 5 starting with the ferry unit meeting up with the OCS then the propulsion unit. The rest of the sections are launched and assembled in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce this is done the fuel needed is sent up and the hub and refuel craft are pulled from the middle of the two sections which then dock to make the final configuration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen we go off to Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe initial aerobraking was not enough to capture the craft in Jool orbit so a burn was made to keep the craft in Jool SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuite a few aerobrakes followed to reduce the Ap closer to Laythe. A chance encounter with Tylo increased the Ap a bit requiring yet more aerobraking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA small correction burn put the craft on a course for Laythe SOI. Another aerobrake and correcting burn and we entered Laythe orbit where the Laythe lander and ferry unit detached from the craft and burned to circularize around Laythe. the lander detached and burned to deorbit. There were a few failed attempts to touch down on land as it seems the Laythe lander was prone to exploding on quicksave reload if landed in water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter launch the lander docked with the ferry unit which then burned to rendezvous with the main craft. After docking the lander was left in Laythe orbit and a maneuver was planned to transfer to tylo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA similar method was executed for Tylo. Attain orbit, detach lander and ferry, circularise, land, launch and dock. This left the lander in a much smaller state than before although still with 2000Dv when refuelled and a good TWR. After meeting up with the main craft again the next destination was Val.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERinse repeat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen Pol\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Erinse repeat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally Bop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point it was noticed that nearly a full large fuel tank remained giving nearly 8000 Dv and only needing just over 1600 to get home so the mission could probably have been done with only two of the three fuel tanks in the propulsion unit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe burn home was made and another burn to make the craft reenter kerbins atmosphere. A couple of quicksave reloads gave us the right Pe to hit Kerbin at and the Hab pod was landed in the water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then spent about 10 minutes getting all the kerbals to stand on the pod looking cool but the pod then rolled and they all fell into the water...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my Jool 5 mission report.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"purpleivan","CreatedById":120081,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T15:29:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking of taking a crack at the third level challenge (5 kerbals using 5 landers) but before I start on this, I\u0027d like to confirm whether or not the Lazor docking cam is an allowed mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does make docking a little easier, but mainly I use it to make it a little more fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that the only mods I would use would be purely aesthetic (Hotrockets, Better Atmospheres etc.) and Precise Node, which I only use to get around the \u0022can\u0027t place maneuver node on current orbit\u0022 bug (wish Squad would fix that).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deutherius","CreatedById":125381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T16:45:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022purpleivan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022purpleivan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking of taking a crack at the third level challenge (5 kerbals using 5 landers) but before I start on this, I\u0027d like to confirm whether or not the Lazor docking cam is an allowed mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does make docking a little easier, but mainly I use it to make it a little more fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that the only mods I would use would be purely aesthetic (Hotrockets, Better Atmospheres etc.) and Precise Node, which I only use to get around the \u0022can\u0027t place maneuver node on current orbit\u0022 bug (wish Squad would fix that).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom the first page: \u003Cem\u003EMechJeb is permitted.
