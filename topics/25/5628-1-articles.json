I am the new deputy administrator of our nation\\\u0027s space agency. This briefing is intended to orient new astronaut recruits to our facilities and practices, as well as re-orient survivors of the previous administration to our new, streamlined ideology.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will take a bit of background, so please be seated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you know, our space program has been increasingly short of funds ever since it was founded. It doesn\\\u0027t help that we keep losing prototypes about as fast as our engineers can build them... no, Jebediah, you\\\u0027re not allowed to use SRB\\\u0027s to commute, this is the fourth time you\\\u0027ve asked this week, and I\\\u0027m going to have to deny yout request again, it\\\u0027s not going to help our budget issues if you can get faster to work when you\\\u0027re undoubtedly going to crash your rocket boosted car to the VAB. Again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...As I was saying, the leaders of our nation have become increasingly concerned about loose spending within the program, and since there will eventually be elections again, they don\\\u0027t want the public to think that we\\\u0027re intentionally wasting money. Yes, Jebediah, when parts of rocketry come crashing down into someone\\\u0027s potatomoto patch or explodes their barnyard animals to smithereens they tend to notice it and they usually don\\\u0027t like it very much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...Yes, Bob, I know, our rockets are not expensive. The people don\\\u0027t know that. The politicians don\\\u0027t care about real things, they care about what people think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, like the sensible, far-thinking individuals the politicians are, they have decided that the space programme needs to be more cost-conscious. That means: No more dropping expensive-looking equipment away unless it is an absolute necessity. Secondly, there are no absolute necessities. Thirdly, for every piece of KSA property lost or destroyed, a materiel loss form must be filled in three copies, processed by five separate offices in four different administrative facilities in as many cities, and then carefully filed away in the bunker at an undisclosed location.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, do not treat these new guidelines lightly, my dear kerbals. It is not only your careers, but also the future of independent space programme in our proud nation, that is on the line here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that this nasty business is out of the way, let me explain the main goal of our newest program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will go to the moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...yes. We intended to go there to begin with, Bill, but let me finish-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will go to the moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith one single stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then we will get you back from there. Without leaving stuff behind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the stupefied looks on your faces, I can see you\\\u0027re thinking the same as I was when I first heard about this. How are you supposed to get to the Mun and back without staging?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, no one said it would be easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, there is light at the end of the tunnel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an announcement for the engineers in this room, our government has made agreements with the following public sector space and aviation corporations:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC7 Aerospace Division\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETiberDyne Aerospace\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKW Challenger\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany of you might already be aware that TiberDyne Aerospace has taken over the manufacture and distribution of the equipment originally designed by Silisko Industries Doughnut Research \u0026amp; Spacecraft Development, as well as Sunday Punch Wobbly Rockets Selection, and is marketing them under a re-hashed product brand of NovaPunch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe should begin receiving shipments from these companies as soon as we have some designs to put together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are allowed to use or intermix any parts in these product catalogues, but be advised that the turbine engines provided by C-7 Aerospace Division are aviation engines, not rocket engines. They will not work outside inner atmosphere, so lugging them around will just be waste of delta-v. Use of wings for stabilizing the craft for landing after re-entry would probably be quite sensible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have any questions at this point?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, we do realize that we will probably lose a lot of VERY LARGE prototypes during the course of this program. However our analysts have calculated that due to all those parts being part of a single spacecraft, their distribution around the landscape will be less random, and thus attract less attention. Worst comes to pass, we can always say it was swamp gas or a weather balloon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, it will probably be more expensive overall than building a sensible, staged Munrocket design. These orders come from the politicians, what did you expect?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I do realize that you will probably end up landing a blockhouse-sized spacecraft on the Mun, and somehow need to get it back and through atmosphere safely, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo one said this was going to be easy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have unknown amount of time to do this until the laws of physics are altered to include re-entry heat. After that point, this exercise will probably be futile.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Goddess Bhavani","CreatedById":14001,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-16T08:22:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wondered when someone would design a monster like the Rodger Young of Starship Troopers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sheer size of such a thing could probably make it to the Moon and back.

You can use C7 equipment if you wish (I can think a few uses for his rather crash tolerant fuselages and wings as well as RCS thrusters) but I wanted to put a limitation to using the aero engines in atmosphere only.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said my... design, I guess you could call it that, is acting strangely once its out of atmosphere. It starts to rotate by itself and tends to vibrate itself to pieces when I use the main thrusters.
