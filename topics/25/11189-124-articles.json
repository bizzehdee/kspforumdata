I just got frustrated with imgur messing up the order of my pictures. I was thinking of doing a mission report type thing. But that so much work now, and I fat fingered a few of the shots I really wanted, So didn\u0027t get them. So if it\u0027s acceptable I\u0027ll give you the rundown here.\n\nLuna Station is a fuel depot I\u0027m building around the Mun, It\u0027s had 4 launches now. 1 was with a 50 tonne class \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003Essto\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E), I was going to enter, but I just couldn\u0027t get it to the same weight class within the aesthetic, when I swapped out non stock parts. ( nothing was op just different. ) 2 were with an apollo style lifter, due to volume of the segments. the last launch was this one. Crew and supplies. There are more planed. One more Apollo lift for a hab ring. and 3 or 4 heavy \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003Essto\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E lifts. I might use the stock one for some of the light payloads. That\u0027s the backstory. \n\nFor this launch, Jedos and Samwell were tasked with ferrying a crew and supplies up to the station. It would seem even though the tanks were full, they weren\u0027t pumping. Hence the need for a self sufficient mission to repair it. (That\u0027s the excuse I\u0027m using. the station is meant to eliminate that need.) The relay was actually a convenient add-on to the flight. Necessary for the station, but it only flew now because there was room.\n\nNow for the sats:\n\nShip: Stubby Joe SK (Sock K-prize.)\n\nOriginally built as an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E cargo ferry, In its original form it is capable of 10t to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. Outfitted for crew, it was tested to 5t, but realistically it\u0027s volume limited, you won\u0027t fit that in useful payload. \n\nLoaded mass: 3800kg\n\nFuel: 18490kg (14650 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003Elf\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, 3460 Lox, 380 mono.)\n\nPayload: 4 kerbals ( 380kg.) Relay sat (760kg, 81 Xe), misc cargo. (864kg) total 2004kg.\n\nDry Mass: 17516 kg (With pilot and flight engineer.)\n\nMission report: (AA used  as a fly by wire system only. No autopilot features used. (honestly pregaming that would be harder.) It is also non functional out of atmosphere.\n\nNominal accent, mode switch @ 21000 m, lox cut off @ 5600 m  parking orbit of 105000 m ish. Ejection burn of 834 m/s mid course deployment of the relay to allow it to enter a high inclination orbit.  Relay course correction of 43 m/s, it\u0027s capture burn was 193 m/s. The ships capture was 266 m/s But due to also juggling the relay, a 43 m/s inclination change was required, and it was a slow rendezvous coming in behind the sation. Docking was uneventful. After unloading the cargo and getting the crew settled in Stubby joe performed a 2 m/s obit raise maneuver for the station, before undocking and setting a course  for home. Projections suggested reentry one day later within range of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. Although this being the first high speed return for this design Mission control was unsure how the ship would respond exactly, having only come back from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E before.  Approaching kerbin the crew was directed to jettison excess propellent. The pilot unsure of this decision had kept back some monoprop, just in case. It turned out to be a good thing. The was a glitch when AA was turned on late. An attempt  by the system to zero out the controls on startup caused a brief spin very high in the atmosphere. Fortunately with  the remaining monoprop the spin was corrected before anything burned off. After that reentry was nominal, that is to say stable and with tolerance. It was clear we were not going make the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and the attempt was quickly aborted in favor of a skip reentry heading for the desert airfield. This required an inclination change of 150 m/s, It was all that could be spared without dipping into emergency reserves. Engineering never should have told the pilot about the extra \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E margin from taking out the unnecessary pre-coolers. the mission would have been more efficient form the outset.  While no longer carrying the speed of a munar return the ship was still on high ballistic path, another unknown. In the end the last reserves had to used to keep from flying out over water. This was why the desert field was selected. It\u0027s a little rough, but there\u0027s lots of it. Stubby Joe landed safely 45 km from the facility. Running on fumes the landing gear was easily able to accommodate the abuse. \n\nWell... I guess that turned out to be full report. Sorry about that. I\u0027m not risking moving it though.
