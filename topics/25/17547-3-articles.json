The concept of the SilberJeb is to fling it out of the atmosphere and have it skip like a stone a few times over the dense air, then glide. Depending on how well it goes here, I\u0027ll see about fiddling with more wing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I would guesstimate that I\u0027ve already passed my previous best.

First off, I don\u0027t know the hotkey for video capture (is there one? Or is everyone using some other capture method for video?) but if I did I would record a bounce after this current flight crashes. As far as the canards go, there is a picture of my bounce-launcher on page 4 of this thread, although it\u0027s a bit small. The front set of wings is NOT angled. The back set is very slightly angled down. There are two pairs of landing gear wheels. You want a rocket that turns very little. It basically flies sideways, drops a bit before it picks up speed/lift, and the impact with the ground ricochets it up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: 227 km. Nuts.

In the last image you can see some land which is actually the island in the middle of the ocean east of the KSC on the map. I was glad to not hit it.
