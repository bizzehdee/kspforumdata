For this reason, this challenge is much, much harder than expected. For the love of all that is holy, use aerospikes.\n\n**Goal:**\n\nYour challenge is to design a stock, manned vehicle which begins in orbit, dives into Jool, reaches an altitude of under 1 kilometer, and returns to orbit. Previously, this would\u0027ve been nearly impossible due to the Delta-V requirements imposed by errordynamic drag. Due to errordynamics no longer applying, however, this should be much easier.\n\nYou may reach Jool orbit by any means, including hyperedit, infinite fuel, or transfer stages. However, please do not exploit any physics bugs (ladders, K-drives if you can figure out a way to make them work, etc) once in low Jool orbit.\n\nYou need not use a single-stage vehicle. In fact, I suspect that most GOLD level entries will be multi-stage vehicles, as making a pure-rocket SSTO on Jool is probably nearly impossible, given engine and tank masses.\n\n**Scoring:**\n\nScoring is based on...\n\nBRONZE. For entries that don\u0027t make it to 140 kilometers, score is based on altitude.\n\nSILVER. For entries that DO make it to space, but don\u0027t make orbit, score is based on orbital speed.\n\nGOLD. For entries that achieve orbit, score is based on the initial mass of the vehicle. Lower is better.\n\n**High Scores**\n\nGOLD score list:\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\nSILVER score list\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\nBRONZE score list:\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\nWill post entry soon, I have 3 midterms in the next 3 days.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T09:59:33Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 09:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pds314**"},{"CreatedByName":"Rfmeijboom","CreatedById":91078,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T08:47:48Z","Content":"I think this may be impossible, at 1km height the atmospheric pressure might be so high that all the Engines have an ISP of 0."},{"CreatedByName":"Pds314","CreatedById":70014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T09:06:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I think this may be impossible, at 1km height the atmospheric pressure might be so high that all the Engines have an ISP of 0.\n\nI doubt that engines will reach zero ISP.

They have an Isp of 65 s there. That means their thrust is about 80 kN, so they can barely carry a small tank of fuel by themselves. I tried making a 900-part aerospike asparagus ship, but only got to about 5 km altitude on Jool. It\u0027s way harder than it was [pre-1.0](http://imgur.com/a/DrPqp#0).\n\nMaybe the challenge should be how low can you go inside Jool\u0027s atmosphere and still make it back into orbit."}]}
