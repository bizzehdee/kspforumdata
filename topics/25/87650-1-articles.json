Your spacecraft during or after your trans injection to your next planetary target. Any of the tasks in the scoring/point system that are optional must have pictures them being performed, like the solar panel removal after in the \u0022Kasteroid belt\u0022. Post landing, de-orbit, landing, and landed images of any of the lander landings. And if there is, EVAs, take off, orbit insertion, rendezvous with the spacecraft, and docking. Docking and refueling with fuel tanks, if there are any. And finally, back in Kerbin orbit, you don\u0027t have to do images of them actually going back to the surface of Kerbin.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003ESCORING/POINT SYSTEM:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EAbsolute Minimum entries will get 0 points.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E10 points per crew member you take with you to the planets, capping at 6 crew member at 60 points (\u002B10 per crew member, cap 6 crew at 60 points) \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHave at least 1 lander be manned and return to the spacecraft (\u002B20 points) \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHave the Duna and Laythe landings be manned and return to the spacecraft.

But, it\u0027s good fun, and in terms of scientific accuracy, way better than most dramas or movies. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I think this is an excellent idea for an architecture challenge. The scoring looks good, my only very slight concern is that the scoring incentivises doing things differently from the show, losing points for refueling tankers in orbits around destination planets, and also for the Jool Aerobrake (quite a significant moment during their tour). But I get that these things make the mission easier, so should reflect negatively on the points total.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne idea for an addition; perhaps extra points for life support mods? This being such a long mission, life support adds plenty of difficulty. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, after a fun few fours in the VAB, the ISV Pegasus is in LKO, awaiting crew for its epic voyage. The plan is to go for max points, though I may have to aerobrake at Jool if my low solar gravity assist causes me to hit the Joolian system at stupid speeds. We\u0027ll see. And I might end up having to send a fuel tanker or two out.
