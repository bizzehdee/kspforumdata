I constructed it in orbit from a specialized cycler habitat module, three supply modules and an orbital solar array. The five components require three launches of my four ton capacity rocket. I sent up a Kerbal in a crew vehicle to assemble it and was pleased to discover the ship was capable of self assembly. Everything even went together right the first time!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft is equipped with enough supplies for a full return trip all the way back to Kerbin if needed. Communications gear, balanced RCS (so the cycler is capable of being the active craft for docking to improve safety). Plenty of electricity provides power for the habitat and three ion engines (One aft and two on the habitat that are angled slightly away from the hull to prevent fouling of the rest of the craft).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ended up favoring electric drive for three reasons, safety, thrust to weight requirements, resupply. As cyclers are expected to operate in deep space for years at a time and far from... everything, the fewer moving parts represent a significant risk reduction. In addition the fuel is not highly corrosive and no radioactive materials are required on board to make it work. Once up to speed, the orbit a cycler vehicle will be operating on requires only minor propulsive maneuvers, with plenty of time to do them. The low thrust on ion engines is adventurous when setting up multiple gravity assists, in which precision is important. Anything being delivered to a cycler needs to be brought up to the velocity of the cycler, a significant and exponential investment. The high Isp reduces fuel mass considerably and ultimately creates significant savings. In addition the nature of the xenon fuel would eliminate fuel losses due to the boil off real world cryogenic fuels such as hydrogen and oxygen would be prone to.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-26T04:24:46Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2014 04:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by meyst\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"meyst","CreatedById":59881,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-27T05:39:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProgress continues, a three module lander undergoing TPS testing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Zuy2Zc6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Zuy2Zc6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"meyst","CreatedById":59881,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-14T07:20:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy mission plans keep breaking down because of serious supply issues (using a 4 ton lander to bring in 1 ton of supplies to the surface of Duna was just not efficient enough, even though the mobility offered was amazing) and time constraints due to \u0027real life stuff\u0027 and \u0027being responsible\u0027.

It would also save me a headache on supply-missions, being able to simply launch a few big, heavy greenhouses and then not have to worry nearly as much about resupply in the future- though I could just as easily launch a lighter giant TAC Life Support barge to Duna orbit (and ferry the modules with a reusable-rocket deriving its fuel from Interstellar-ISRU or Kethane as necessary) to accomplish the same thing for less mass, and allow my outpost to continue to be sustainable past the end of the challenge...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-24T15:03:29Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2014 03:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-25T00:13:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just \u003Cstrong\u003EKNOW\u003C/strong\u003E somebody who doesn\u0027t have experience with KSP-Interstellar is going to come around and criticize it as \u0022cheaty\u0022 or \u0022OP\u0027d\u0022, and the thread host will believe their (unfounded) claim, and that will be the end of my request to utilize KSP-Interstellar Microwave Beamed power for some realistic and innovative mission strategies for this challenge...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m going to pre-empt that with some concrete examples of how it\u0027s not really OP\u0027d.

Not coincidentally, the size of it I used has a maximum rated power capacity of approximately 8.314 GW, so this is at \u003Cstrong\u003EMAXIMUM\u003C/strong\u003E power for a thruster of this size, with realistic ISP and Thrust levels (unlike the stock Ion Thruster, the KSP Interstellar ion thrusters DO NOT have higher Thrust-per-kW than their real-life counterparts) and based on use of Hydrogen as a propellant (optimal in ISP for this thruster type, but lower in thrust than heavier propellants)- which KSP Interstellar takes LiquidFuel to represent...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GkkuNei.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GkkuNei.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E56.8 kN.\u003C/strong\u003E You read that right- \u003Cstrong\u003EFOR MORE POWER THAN I COULD HOPE TO LAUNCH FOR MY ENTIRE MASS BUDGET FOR THIS CHALLENGE\u003C/strong\u003E, assuming I launched nothing but nuclear reactors, \u003Cstrong\u003EI only got 56.8 kN of thrust\u003C/strong\u003E.

But it\u0027s certainly not a game-breaker. And it *IS* realistic technology- real life electrical engines could get this kind of thrust and ISP (in many cases, ISP increases with power levels in real life electrical engines) if they had access to 8.34 Gigawatts of power (and they could have access to 8.34 Gigawatts of power if NASA would just suck it up and pay for a Microwave Beamed Power network instead of shuddering at the initial-investment cost of $2 million a MW for both the generation capacity and transmission capacity to do this at small-scale: and costs decrease as this is scaled up)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd some of you might be wondering why this thruster (or the Microwave Receiver dish) didn\u0027t melt at this power level. Well basically, they did- or rather they rapidly heated up, and quickly overwhelmed the limited mass of coolant and radiator I built into this spacecraft (approximately 200 kilograms\u0027 worth)- the engines could only run like this for about 20-30 seconds before things began to overheat and went into Emergency Shutdown:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XlAs97w.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XlAs97w.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd at a heat-dissipation of 8 Megawatts of WasteHeat a second at close to maximum-temperature of 3500 Kelvin (if I had actually reached this temperature, things would have begun to explode), this is going to take a LONG time for the spacecraft to cool back down...

And yet, it will probably end up using 1/5th-1/6th of its Delta V just to get a minimum-energy intercept with Sentar. The leftover fuel is NOT for a return journey- I prefer to send my craft on much higher-speed transfers than necessary, to role-play reduced radiation-exposure and psychological stress on the crew, so it will be accelerating towards Sentar until it has used over 60% its Delta-V, with the remainder being used to reduce the G\u0027s of the aerobrake by a last-minute deceleration before atmospheric entry, and to rendezvous with the crewed modules which will also be arriving on fast transfers...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-25T00:33:46Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2014 12:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"borisperrons","CreatedById":76286,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-25T10:46:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAgain, kudos to you.

Along with the Deadly Reentry Redux mod, BTSM includes requirements for life support and very high demands for electric charge on both crewed and uncrewed vessels. The mod also includes methods for processing raw materials into fuel, life support and monopropellant in space and while landed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe life support resource is very heavy and there are no command pods which are suitable for interplanetary multi-crew missions (there is a habitation module/science module but it\u0027s more for science vessels not for interplanetary travel). The fuel, life support and monopropellant processing parts are also very heavy and have a slow production rate. Most stock parts are either nerfed or completely modified to have different roles. The effectiveness of RCS and reaction wheels have been reduced, solar panels are only partially effective at Duna\u0027s orbit and even the LV-N\u0027s great ISP has been reduced to 800. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, trying this challenge in a BTSM environment is probably a fools-errand.
