Background:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA while ago I was on reddit and I saw a post of someone\u0027s Kerbal getting krakened out of the solar system. Usually this happens at ludicrous velocities, but this one was surprisingly only going at 150 kilometers per second, almost a reasonable velocity. I started doing the math and realized that it would be possible to use a series of four xenon powered ships to bring him home at an almost reasonable part count, assuming better time warp was used. Unfortunately, KSP\u0027s exponential fuel flow calculations prevented this, but if Jeb was going 140km/s instead of 150 I would have attempted it. In either case, he never sent over his save file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other method I was going to attempt was using Stratzenblitz\u0027s high speed mass driver technology to shoot parts out at over 150 kilometers per second and EVA assemble them. However, I could not get stable launches beyond about 80 kilometers per second.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis has gotten me wanting to attempt, or at least think about, more extreme rescue missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nComment below a scenario you would like to see me attempt, save file optional, and I will give it an attempt (I\u0027ll teleport the Kerbal there if a save is not provided), or at least work out the math if it proves to be too much to actually fly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"camacju","CreatedById":207172,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-27T16:56:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooks a lot like this challenge!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022214340\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed7707140901\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/217258-orbiting-brick-recovery-services-have-your-stranded-kerbals-get-rescued/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:195px;max-width:500px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor this one, I submitted a pair of Kerbals in quite the situation.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Retrograde Kerbol orbit\u003Cbr\u003E\n-periapsis 4921 km\u003Cbr\u003E\n-apoapsis 536000 km\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey are in a very heat resistant vessel so that shouldn\u0027t be an issue.
