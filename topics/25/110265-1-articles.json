They have stated the following list of requirements for the aircraft designs:\n\n-Must be in 1.0.2\n\n-Stock aerodynamics\n\n-All Mods allowed with the exception of tweakscale\n\n-Must be a completely custom aircraft(no stock planes, no downloaded from elsewhere planes, no copies of real life planes, etc... Build it yourself from the ground up)\n\n-Only one entry per person\n\n-Once you comment with your entry you cannot change it\n\n-Must use BD armory\n\n-This will be an air to air interdiction fighter\n\n-under 15 tons(15 tons includes only main gun ammunition and internal fuel storage, all other weapons such as missiles and also external fuel tanks if you wish to include them do not count towards the 15 tons)\n\n-under 45,000 dollars not including weapons\n\n-must have 6\u002B mounting hard points\n\n-must have at least 1 countermeasure pod\n\n-must have at least one main gun(any caliber) and at least 300 rounds of ammunition per gun(stored internally)\n\n-Must have at least 250 gallons of fuel per engine stored internally\n\n-Must have the ability to utilize detachable external fuel tanks that can be jettisoned while inflight without damaging the aircraft(must have the ability to attach a small decoupler, can take up one mounting hard point per fuel tank)\n\n-must be able to go 300m/s under 1,000 meters and 500m/s between 5,000 and 8,000 meters\n\n-Must be able to take off at speeds under 100 m/s and before passing the control tower on the KSC main runway\n\n-Must be able to roll and climb vertically immediately after liftoff(so it can perform combat take offs)\n\n-Must be able to perform short/unimproved runway takeoff and landing(island airstrip off the coast of main KSC)\n\n-Must be able to perform agile high speed and high G maneuvers\n\n-Must be sturdy so it doesn\u0027t break apart during high G flight or from barely being hit\n\n-If it isn\u0027t listed here as a requirement then assume it is not one\n\n-must look cool(this is a fighter jet after all)\n\n-From the time of this post the competition has started. You have until 2359 eastern standard time on May 24th to submit your entry. To enter comment here with a link to the craft file and whatever else you want to add but you don\u0027t have to add anything else if you don\u0027t want to. After the time limit is up I will judge the craft that are submitted and then announce the 3 finalists and say what I liked and did not like about each of their designs. After the finalists are chosen they will have 3 days from the time of my comment to make any changes that they feel are necessary to their aircraft.(minor tweaks only, fine tuning wings, gimbals, and adding or removing small parts. The final aircraft must still resemble the initially submitted aircraft.) After that period they must comment back with the new link to their new craft file and I will test their final design and announce a winner after I have decided. Good luck and thank you in advance for your submissions!\n\nThis is the UKSAF\u0027s hanger containing all of their current and retired aircraft and equipment. Feel free to view and download for inspiration.

Without the main gun, ammo, or stores weight is about 14.8 tons. [http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/29616916292647763/41F9EC7FD0388EEBC87EC3882883B800C62F871A/](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/29616916292647763/41F9EC7FD0388EEBC87EC3882883B800C62F871A/)\n\nHowever, it does carry twice the internal fuel requirement (530 units/engine), cost without weapons 42,181.\n\nTakeoff speed is about 50 m/s fully loaded. Landing speed is 20-50 m/s (So yes, island runway is not problem.)\n\n9 hardpoints (11 without bags), total fuel amount with external tanks is 1690. Maximum speed with bags is 340, without them it\u0027ll go very fast above 6000 [http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/29616916292662419/9AFD206526DE3DF75945170C259529B03721461B/](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/29616916292662419/9AFD206526DE3DF75945170C259529B03721461B/)\n\nDurability seems ok.

Maximum recorded safe G-load is about 45. Extreme AoA should be avoided above 700 m/s at medium altitude, otherwise it\u0027s pretty hard to break the thing.\n\nMissiles all launch ok unless you do something silly like full deflection aileron rolls at 250\u002B m/s or hard negative G\u0027s when firing.\n\nAirbrakes are bound to group 5, though with the speed it bleeds during turns that\u0027s hardly needed.\n\nSAS optional, it\u0027s pretty stable with or without. If you ever want to give it to the AI or dogfight with it yourself, just give it about 50% fuel on takeoff. Or burn off that much by the time you get to the target area.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T19:38:26Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 07:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Phearlock**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T20:36:48Z","Content":"Mine so far meets every requirement, and can do 8g turns at 1,000m/m @ 1,000m.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nHere\u0027s a image:\n\n![onkwL5K.png](http://i.imgur.com/onkwL5K.png)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nHere\u0027s another picture:\n\n![9P8xhV1.png](http://i.imgur.com/9P8xhV1.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"TMasterson5","CreatedById":144591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T20:57:30Z","Content":"Thanks for the tips on the format guys it\u0027s my first time posting on here!
