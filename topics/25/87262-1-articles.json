I recently made this: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/MO2Qe#1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/MO2Qe#1\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is essentially a minmus lander, but that has 4 science jr.s, 16 mystery goos, and 4 solar particle arrays (sometin like that.) However, ALL OF THAT WAS STORED IN AN AREA THE SIZE OF A MEDIUM ROCKOMAX TANK! I used infernal robotics to make my science assemblies (4 goo, 1 sci jr, and 1 of the solar things.) fold out from the center. I challange you to make a Deployable Craft, whether it be a lander, interplanetary craft, or whatever, just build it! The craft has to be completely self contained, so it can\u0027t be made of a bunch of things that you built and then docked together in space. The reason you dock is because of aerodynamics and prettyness, so solve that by folding in the sticky out parts! The goal is to make it fit within a procedural faring with no bulges. So see what you can do!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid I mention that I will feature your builds on my stream?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright, I realize now that I wasn\u0027t very clear.

For example, the DMagic magnetometer is slightly too large for the Universal Storage science bays. You could scale down the magnetometer. Another time it would be appropriate is with functional things, but I will use my own judgement on such things if/when I pick out some of the best submissions. It\u0027s useually fine if it\u0027s part of the main fuselage, like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8bnBVTYs.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00228bnBVTYs.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr if it is part of an external fuselage (I am sure that there is a better name than external fuselage, but I don\u0027t know it.):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Etb56Hes.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Etb56Hes.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only time I don\u0027t like tweakscale is where it is simply used to make things smaller so that they can fit. For example, If you have something that folds out from the craft when the craft deploys, but it doesn\u0027t quite fit into a faring while it is folded in, don\u0027t use tweakscale to make it smaller. Oh yeah, I forgot to talk about fairings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, this challange uses procedural fairings instead of KW rocketry fairings for one simple reason. Part of what you are scored on, is the fairing. Put simply, the fairing needs to be completly flat in the middle, no bulges. The reason you can\u0027t use KW rocketry fairings is because you can clip things through them, but you can\u0027t fool procedural fairings! The reason this is important is because this is the whole point of the challange, to make a craft that can start out aerodynamic, get to orbit (hyperedit allowed, this is about deployable craft, not lifters, though you may gladly make a deployable lifter.), then deploy into a non-aerodynamic craft with plenty of potential. Take a look at these examples:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/47gvcKns.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002247gvcKns.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would not fit in a fairing without a big bulge towards the bottom. But we want this in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gA47Ydfs.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022gA47Ydfs.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere! Just fold in the infernal robotics hinges!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright. One more thing about tweakscale, you are DEFINATLY allowed to use it for infernal robotics parts and modular girders. They are purely structural, and can DEFINATLY be tweakscaled to your specifications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, you need to build something that fits inside a fairing (nicely!) and when in orbit it deploys. Oh wait, one last thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAction groups are important. They aren\u0027t required, but they definatly help. If there are no action groups, then at least explain what does what so I can add my own action groups.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal thing, when you submit your craft, I would like 3 (plus one optional) things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKronal Vessel Viewer Pictures of the craft (Yes, KVV is availiable for 0.25, and yes, you can make the IR stuff work while in the VAB/SPH)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few screenshots of your craft in action (F1 key by default)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe .craft of the DEPLOYABLE CRAFT\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOptional: the .craft of your deployable craft on a lifter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVERY IMPORTANT!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether or not you can get your craft into orbit is great. Give me a .craft of your craft with a lifter. but PLEASE, don\u0027t give me just that. I would love that, but I would REALLY rather have just the deploying part (aka the deployable craft \u002B a fairing, nothing under the fairing unless that\u0027s part of it.) on its own, along with another .craft of your craft WITH the lifter, if you are that talented. Also important, in both .craft files, please make sure that there is a fairing!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-18T16:07:48Z\u0022 title=\u002210/18/2014 04:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MrabEzreb\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EI didn\u0026#039;t explain the challange well enough.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cmdr.
