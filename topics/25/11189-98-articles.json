Realizing this challenge celebrates its 5th anniversary this year I needed to do something special...\n\nThe rules clearly state that losing parts in flight is against the rules and that decoupling was forbidden as well. Realizing that a ladder does cost 440 funds while a stack decoupler comes in at around 400 funds, I developed the cockpit lift system which lets your Kerbals exit the cockpit without the need of expensive ladders. You might argue it was against the rules, but that\u0027s all totally legal once you stage after landing. You mission report will state that you separated instead of using the forbidden word of decoupling. So well in that sense the space plane would be both a valid entry and a gate crasher until [@boolybooly](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/6572-boolybooly/) comes around and measures it.
