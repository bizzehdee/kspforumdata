All their benefactors had pulled out, leaving them with no contract work and therefore no way of making a profit or even breaking even. Unfortunately, there was a problem. A big problem. All the long term interplanetary missions\u00A0were still flying with no chance of return before the Space Center shut down. Lucky for them, Billy-Bobbles Kerman had had a small stake in the Space Program which he had\u00A0cashed in before it had become completely worthless. He knew that he had to help as many of the stranded crews as possible. So, on the very last possible day, he cobbled together a small rocket that would allow the scattered craft to dock and refuel eachother so that they could all come home safely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EYour mission:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaunch a Rockomax HubMax Multi-Point Connector, along with a docking port on all attachment\u00A0points, to another body for less than 50,000 funds (or roots, money, dollars, Kerbin Standard Monetary Units or whatever you want to call them).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EScoring:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(50,000 -(Mission Cost ) * (Direct DeltaV / DeltaV Expended) * (1 \u002B (Planetary Systems Visited * 0.5)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBonuses (added to score):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E: 10000\u003Cbr\u003E\nPer Kerbal (No seats): 5000\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMods:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInformational mods, visual mods and parts mods that aren\u2019t overpowered are allowed.

Use the orbital heights actually used by your mission.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor example, if you went to Jool using two Eve gravity assists, then went to Duna with help from Tylo, you would enter a Kerbin - Jool transfer (making sure to set the latest departure date to Year 10, Day 1) including circularisation. If you go from an 80km Kerbin orbit to a 210km Jool orbit, this will result in a DeltaV of \u00A04,881 m/s. Repeat this for the Jool - Duna transfer (60km Duna orbit), getting \u00A04,345 m/s of DeltaV for that. Finally, add the two values as well as the 3400 m/s (the DeltaV needed to get into orbit in 1.1.3 according to the DeltaV map)\u00A0to get 12626 m/s as your Direct DeltaV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVisiting the Kerbin System does not count towards your score.
