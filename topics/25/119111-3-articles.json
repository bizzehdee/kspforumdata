I\u0027d suggest looking at the dynamic deflection settings of the F3C\u0027s pitch authority. Usually, the aircraft would have maximum maneuverability available at low speed, and then get steadily more stable up toward the mach .8 to 1.0 region as the control surfaces become less effective. Which means you usually can\u0027t turn as hard, this is further enforced by the dynamic deflection settings that drastically reduce control authority around that region due to dynamic pressure. That\u0027s part of the main reason most fights end up with just big turning radius at high speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, notice how the F3C gets around this: it\u0027s actually only allowed 50ish% max deflection when at 0Q atmospheric pressure, which is takeoff and low speed. While once it enters a bit of atmospheric pressure, typical of low altitude flight at around .7-1.2 mach the dynamic deflection is set to provide 100% control authority to all the surfaces relating to pitch control. This compensates for the reduced control surface authority usually experienced at these speeds, and lets the aircraft pull close to it\u0027s maximum AoA around the transsonic region, which quickly converts a bunch of speed into drag and lift, letting it turn very well while also dropping airspeed to prevent overshooting (hence why setting 500 max speed for the F3C isn\u0027t as big a deal as with the MiKs, as the F3C will naturally bleed its excess speed once it starts turning, while an aircraft with standard dynamic deflection settings will be unable to pull enough AoA to start bleeding speed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow of course, letting the AI pull upwards of 15-17G\u0027s maxiumum at low altitude does mean I had to ramp up the wing strength of the main wings all the way to 2.0 to prevent it from tearing the aircraft apart. I daresay the F3C could indeed pull harder the settings currently allow, however, the AI doesn\u0027t know when to stop pulling and let the speed build up again. So to minimize the risk of the aircraft being stuck at 150 m/s where it simply doesn\u0027t have enough rate to dogfight effectively, the maximum deflection is tuned down just a little bit (though this is still an issue at times, and can be exploited if you wanted to design something specifically to defeat the F3C).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, all this is moot if you don\u0027t have an aircraft that can pull 20-30 AoA comfortably without any risk of stalling out. I saw a lot of the MiK versions had issues with pulling beyond 15 AoA without starting to flop around pretty badly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceplaneAddict","CreatedById":149322,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-08T13:24:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPhearlock, how did you set the ctrl surfaces like that!
