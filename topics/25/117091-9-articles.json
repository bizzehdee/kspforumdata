Does it make much difference to designs, relative plane performance or framerate?\n\nFAR is a lot about tradeoffs as usual. TWR, High speed performance vs Low speed performance (especially with the AI involved, as they can only really fly a plane at one speed), what engine setup to use, weight of weapons, you have to choose what you want, cause you can\u0027t have everything. Lot of fine-tuning compared to stock (as is the norm for FAR). Framerate is perfectly normal apart from a few hiccups in the SPH when FAR needs to recalculate a bunch of factors on the fly.\n\nI believe FAR will cause a lot more difference in handling between planes than stock does, as you don\u0027t have to make as many tradeoffs in stock (CoM sliiightly in front of CoL, add wings and engines until desired turn rate is achieved). Aircraft aesthetics seem pretty diverse so far. But it\u0027s though to say until the challenge is finalized and more people submit their designs."},{"CreatedByName":"tetryds","CreatedById":50204,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T09:39:14Z","Content":"@colmo: Phearlock nailed it.\n\nAbout performance, FAR is actually lighter than stock for bigger vehicles! It has consistent performance so the processing it requires barely varies with craft size.\n\nBut it\u0027s important to note that it\u0027s easy to make stuff fly on FAR, the challenge is making something fly well and then give it to the AI.\n\nComparing this challenge to the stock one I would say that this one is way more complex, there are many factors involved and you must put much more effort into it."},{"CreatedByName":"colmo","CreatedById":25950,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T09:44:53Z","Content":"Thanks for that.

I love pwings but build wings from multiple segments anyway. In real life totally removing a wing in one go during combat wasn\u0027t a rule, except when the root was severely damaged. Especially when being hit by bullets instead of shells, you\u0027d just have a decrease in lift and increase in drag due to the holes.\n\nA nice thing to play with is [this Fluid Dynamics simulation](http://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/fluids/). Select an airfoil from the barrier menu, then erase some pixels from the top and bottom. Play a bit with the visualization, viscosity and speed. A nice way to demonstrate the difference between the flap types, it might even be nice to visualize the interactions of a biplane.\n\nAlso in real life a part of a wing can already be stalling while other parts are not. A multi-segment wing in FAR will have the same effect. \n\nPSA: when applying control limits, do not just look at pitch, a stalling aileron is sometimes even more dangerous. And make sure you have a large rudder with enough control authority, when your ailerons are stalling and you are in a spin, your rudder is your only way out."},{"CreatedByName":"Phearlock","CreatedById":90274,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T10:22:43Z","Content":"I\u0027d say Pwings is very very beneficial in this format, as you need very light wings for some designs, especially biplanes.
