([Example](http://i.imgur.com/ri17JmG.jpg))\n\u003E \n\u003E - **Rover must maintain contact with the ground throughout the race.**\n\u003E \n\u003E -- Spoilers (defined as: any horizontal lift-creating surface used to keep the vehicle planted to the road) **are** allowed.\n\u003E \n\u003E --- I\u0027ve become aware that the lightness of the Karts, combined with the power they produce, can become an infini-glider. While endlessly amusing, I ask that you do not abuse this mechanic... do your best to keep the vehicle on the ground, and, in general, try to behave like a sportsman.\n\u003E \n\u003E -- You may cut some corners, as long as at least one wheel is on the track at all times.\n\u003E \n\u003E - **Rover must finish in the same condition as it starts** (no part dropping), however\n\u003E \n\u003E -- Rover may drop a crew pod (so you can get a kerbal into the seat) before setting off.\n\u003E \n\u003E - **Your race starts with a screenshot that shows the time and that you\u0027re at the starting area at 0.0m/s.**\n\u003E \n\u003E -- Often, if you stay under 2m/s in the starting zone on the runway, the mission timer will not start. Use this to your advantage.\n\u003E \n\u003E - **Screenshots** should be able to prove you did the course as intended.\n\u003E \n\u003E -- A video is, of course, very welcome in lieu of pictures.\n\u003E \n\u003E - **Tweakscale (very) encouraged, but** **not** **required!**\n\u003E \n\u003E -- Similarly, part clipping is allowed as well.\n\u003E \n\u003E - **You are allowed to submit as many vehicles as you wish**, just make a separate post for each vehicle.\n\u003E \n\u003E -- General rule: one post per vehicle.\n\u003E \n\u003E -- If you are re-doing a course for a faster time, then update your post containing that vehicle.\n\u003E \n\u003E --- You may also post a new comment or message me so that I know it\u0027s been updated if you so choose.\n\u003E \n\u003E - After submitting your vehicle, **you may choose to do whichever races you want**. **You may do all of them, or none of them.** The choice is yours!\n\u003E \n\u003E -- Re-trying a race is, of course, very much allowed. Just update your post with your original time, and your new time (and pics/vid if needed).\n\u003E \n\u003E - Many of these rules are not 100% enforceable, so **the honor system is in place**.\n\u003E \n\u003E -- If we suspect something may be afoot, I may ask you provide a .craft file for testing.\n\n**====MODS====**\n\nRecommended mods:\n\n- Tweakscale\n\n- HullCam VDS\n\n- Kerbal Engineer (this should be the first mod any player installs IMO)\n\n**Dis-Allowed mods:**\n\n- Anything that adds thrusters/boosters/engines/etc\n\n- Anything that changes physics\n\n- If you\u0027re not sure, please ASK and I\u0027ll probably say yes!\n\n**Questionable mods:**\n\n- FAR/NEAR/DRE: If folks insist on racing with one of these installed, I may make another class for them (assuming it makes an appreciable difference)\n\n- MechJeb: It may or may not make a difference.\n\n**====COURSES====**\n\n*KSC-based: All courses start and end at the same point on the runway.*\n\n**Sprint course**\n\n\u003E ![7QZ1rHR.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/7QZ1rHR.jpg)\n\n**SPH course**\n\n\u003E ![MrKuTdC.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/MrKuTdC.jpg)\n\n**Science Course**\n\n\u003E ![yvhlRVa.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/yvhlRVa.jpg)\n\n**International course**\n\n\u003E ![0cGNftU.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/0cGNftU.jpg)\n\nFull course\n\n- Runway, SPH, Mission Control, VAB, LaunchPad, Tracking, R\u0026D, Complex, Admin, SPH, Runway (pic coming soon!)\n\n**====RESULTS====**\n\n**Standard (Modded) Class**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Best In Show:\n\u003E \n\u003E *(This is for the best vehicle score ONLY)*\n\u003E \n\u003E 1.
