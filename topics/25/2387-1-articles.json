The dark side is where you can barely see the ground. Now for a story of why to people who read.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerth is always sunny... Always! Because as we know Kerth doesn\u0027t spin. The people of Kerth are stuck on their landmass and have always wondered whats on the dark side of Kerth. So instead of just flying there and landing they want to send a shuttle there to see if there are any dangers. You are only allowed to use one parachute and the liquid engine from the C7 pack. Good Luck and the people of Kerth need you... so they can sleep.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"plazmaXIII","CreatedById":2935,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-16T13:52:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDERP parachute?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-16T14:19:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMore parameters required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those not in the loop, the Delta Glider is a spaceplane with delta wings (duh!) in the flight/space sim Orbiter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr its a rocker/recliner... which might make more sense for the Kerbal space program, trying to orbit a La-Z-Boy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo obviously we can\u0027t JUST use C7 Engine -\u0026gt; Command Pod -\u0026gt; Parachute as that leaves out... fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts also rather lacking in gliding without some wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo... 1 engine/tank/set of wings?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, partial orbit?
