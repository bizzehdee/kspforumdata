Unfortunately I wasn\u0027t able to land, but maybe you can do better. Rules are simple. It must take off horizontally, land horizontally and have no wings. Bonus points for landing on the runway!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_Barrett","CreatedById":3206,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-12T22:59:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPretty sure that\u0027s a rocket with wheels and a buttload of RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoodGuy","CreatedById":17980,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-12T23:07:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe theory here is called the \u0022flying brick theory\u0022.
