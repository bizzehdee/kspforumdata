Capable of deploying the following colonial equipment to the destination body:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea) A large, single-piece (CANNOT be landed as multiple pieces) colony base, with room aboard for at least 32 Kerbals. The colony should be landed manned. A colony is defined as any surface or immobile airborne installation with room for 32 or more Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E A set of outposts, each with room for at least 4 Kerbals. There should be no fewer than 4 of these outposts. The outposts should be landed manned. An outpost is defined as any surface installation or immobile airborne with room aboard for 4-31 Kerbals inclusive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec) A set of manned rovers, each with room for at least 4 Kerbals. There should be no fewer than 4 of these rovers. Note that the rovers can be landed unmanned. Aircraft will only be considered as rovers on bodies with an atmosphere (i.e. a \u0022puddle jumper\u0022 spacecraft on an airless body does not qualify as a rover). To be considered as a rover, the aircraft must meet the following criteria:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei. Capable of vertical takeoff and landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eii. Capable of travelling at least 500 km overland under its own power, unrefuelled, in atmospheric flight on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eiii. Does not use suborbital or orbital ballistic trajectories to achieve overland travel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eiv. Uses aerodynamic lift or buoyancy to maintain altitude during horizontal flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ev. Meets all other criteria for a rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Evi. Is deployed on one of: Eve, Duna, Jool, or Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Evii. Is not designed for long-term habitation (i.e. the airborne rover cannot also be counted as an outpost).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eviii. Uses some means of powered propulsion (i.e. infinigliders do NOT qualify).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ed) A set of space stations, at orbital inclinations of 0, 45, 90, and 135. Each station should house no fewer than 8 crew members. Their orbits can be either prograde or retrograde, but they cannot intersect the body\u0027s terrain or atmosphere at any point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ee) Any other equipment that is deemed useful (Kethane refining equipment, mapping satellites, farm installations, what have you).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Capable of travelling from Kerbin orbit to orbit over any planet or moon in the Kerbol system nonstop and returning to Kerbin orbit after dropping off the colonial equipment, all without refuelling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Capable of long-term operation (i.e. should have as little reliance on consumables as possible - for instance, using gyroscopic steering instead of RCS).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. All colonists should be kept in a habitation block during transit - i.e. the colony equipment should not be used as habitation space during the journey, and should only be inhabited immediately prior to landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Capable of unmanned return to Kerbin orbit, to pick up a new load of colonial equipment, and delivering this equipment to a different body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Capable of deploying any piece of colonial equipment at any time - there should not be a requisite order for deploying equipment (e.g. \u0022this piece deploys before this piece\u0022).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Designed as a single, monolithic mission architecture (i.e. multiple flights to the target body should not be required to deliver all requisite equipment/fuel. Multiple flights to Kerbin orbit to assemble, fuel, and crew are OK, but only one craft should have to leave Kerbin\u0027s SoI). In addition, no ship components (other than the colonial equipment) should be lost during the voyage (i.e. drop tanks are not permitted).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are allowed to use any mods you like, so long as they are balanced. HyperEdit is not permitted (all components should be launched from the ground or built fairly on orbit). You are not restricted by budget or number of launches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, your assignment is to develop a re-usable colony ship that can deploy a whole colonial infrastructure in one go, and then do it again and again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWin Condition/Points Breakdown:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe win condition/points breakdown is as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAll conditions above must be met to earn ANY points.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EPlanetary Destination:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese points are earned for reaching and deploying the full colony (ALL equipment) at the indicated body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin: 0 points, and no bonus points will be awarded to Kerbin colonies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMun: 15 points (you\u0027re going to all that trouble to colonize the Mun?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinmus: 20 points (or Minmus, for that matter?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoho: 90 points\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve: 75 points\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGilly: 85 points\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna: 75 points\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIke: 80 points\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDres: 90 points\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJool: 150 points (note that ALL equipment must be airborne to qualify for this.
