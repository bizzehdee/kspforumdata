Due too the ambition of the trio, the KSP has been left without any of the usual larger engines in stock. And they need to launch a single kerbal to orbit to perform maintenance on their orbital communications up-link. They need you to build them a way to get this kerbal mechanic into space using only the engines they have in stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plan:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing no engines bigger then 0.625m scale(same size as the new mk0 liquid fuel fuselage), you need to build a craft capable of sending a single kerbal \u0022into space\u0022. Yes, that is up too at least 70Km height. achieving orbit is a bonus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rules:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: No engines of a scale larger then 0.625m may be used. So the 48-7S Spark, J-20 Juno, or smaller engines... I\u0027ll accept the ion engine if you ask nicely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: You may use as many of each engine as you need to as long as they follow rule 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: ANY(yes that means you can use mk3 and the 3.5m fuel tanks if you really want too) parts can be used to make the rocket part of the body and the kerbal doesn\u0027t need to be housed inside a cockpit. External control seat is acceptable. Any kind of staging is acceptable as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: No solid rocket boosters, other then the sepratrons, can be used. Jeb took the rest with him to celebrate their Duna landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5: Mods are not allowed, to be un allowed. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E Any mods can be used as long as no engines larger then 0.625m scale are used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6: Special Tweak Scale notice: Any engine can be Tweak Scaled down too 0.625m as long as they do not become too powerful or too broken.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7: Most Importantly!!! Have fun and be creative. Thinking outside the box is good, but thinking the box is made of cheese and kracken repellent is even better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChallenge level 1: Simply get to space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat simple. By any means you can come up with, within the rules, get your kerbal to space.(over 70,000m) Keeping him there is not required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChallenge level 2: It\u0027s not that simple son...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet your kerbal to space, and keep him there. So get your craft into a stable orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChallenge level 3: And they said there would be snacks...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBring some snacks up with your kerbal. So that\u0027s reach space, get into a stable orbit, and bring at least 0.5 tons of non fuel cargo(aka: snacks) with you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChallenge level 4: Everyone needs a little help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBring a satellite or micro tug to help your Kerbal once they\u0027re in orbit. This craft need to come up with your kerbal, in the same craft, and be deployed once in orbit. The satellite only needs power, an engine, \u0022some\u0022 fuel and a form of communication. OR The tug only needs to be capable of moving your kerbal around in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESSTO..oh my level: And it all comes up with you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot only do you need to reach space with your kerbal, but your entire craft needs to come with you, nothing is left behind. If your craft does not reach a stable orbit, then it all needs to come back down again and land. note: not everything needs to survive the landing, just your kerbal, because that\u0027s KSP for ya. If it does reach a stable orbit, then mission accomplished.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpaceplane level: More like space...pain...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan you get your kerbal into space using an aircraft? How about a spaceplane that does not have any of the normal spaceplane engines? How about one where all the engines are no bigger then 0.625m scale? Yep, Juno and spark... or smaller...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESepratron level: You want me to use this cellophane, with the sticky stuff on it, to fix things???\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow high can you get using only sepratrons for engines? Can you reach space? Can you bring this container of snacks with you? That\u0027s it, is it possible, once again, to lift 1 ton of mass to over 70,000m using just sepratrons? I\u0027ve seen it done once before, somewhere, using nearly 20 staging sequences, now can it be done again? Kerbal not required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome pics or a short video would be appreciated, but are not really necessary. This challenge is open to those that simply want to challenge themselves as well as those that want to challenge each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy failures... I mean submissions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESSTO..oh my level: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuilt a simple craft using 8 spark and 8 Juno engines, mounted onto 2, stacked, fl-t800 fuel tanks. The sparks were clipped into the bottom of the tank using cubic octagonal struts. The Juno\u0027s were mounted radially on mk0 liquid fuel fuselages with a small intake on each. On top I had a mk1 command pod for the kerbal. This craft also had landing legs and 4 radially mounted parachutes for landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft reached a height of only 4,200m before the engines failed and I aborted the mission. deployed the parachutes and used the juno\u0027s to slow the descent. The landing was nearly flawless, but it was not a good run, may have to try it again without the juno\u0027s though...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpaceplane level:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuild a small spaceplane from a fl-t800 and fl-t400 fuel tank. I mounted 4 juno engine nacells, made from a juno, a mk0 fuel fuselage, and a circular intake, onto pylons and attached them to the rear of the craft. behind them, on the back of the fl-t400 I attached 6 spark rocket engines. I had a mk1 cockpit on the front for the pilot. This craft flew pretty well but had a hard time climbing under the power of the 4 juno engines. When it was all said and done, I once again failed to achieve orbit, but I was getting very close. 64,000m. So this challange is quite doable for someone more skilled with spaceplanes then me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/0.5mspaceplanefail1_zpsjqojndj6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220.5mspaceplanefail1_zpsjqojndj6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA note: Juno\u0027s drop out on power pretty early, cutting out entirely well before 20km, so plan acordingly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-16T05:17:03Z\u0022 title=\u002211/16/2015 05:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jakalth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFixed the title\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kagame","CreatedById":141304,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T04:59:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EQuibble: The size 0 engines you\u0027re reffering to are all 0.625m cross-section.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jakalth","CreatedById":136495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T05:49:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eah, thanks for that correction. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vreivai","CreatedById":153554,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T06:11:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EChallenge level 2 done with a 2 stage rocket.
