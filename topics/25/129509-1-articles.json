This will the universal lander for all moons except Tylo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1 Vertical Take-off SSTO with mining equipment, specialized for landing on Tylo.

Reach orbit at Laythe. Land using spaceplane at Laythe. Land a tug on top of it and refuel both of them by attaching with claw. Spaceplane will\u00A0make orbit around Vall and land. New\u00A0tug\u00A0will be sent to\u00A0land on top again. Repeat procedure for Bop\u00A0and Pol. After, rendezvous around Tylo and wait. Switch to the Tylo\u00A0lander and do the whole mining process. Orbit again and rendezvous with spaceplane. Refuel spaceplane with any leftover fuel.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFly back home!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo? Whaddya think? Possible?

Why are you bringing 4 tugs on the mission? I know you are trying to land the tug on-top of the space-plane to refuel it, but this seems like overly complicated way to refuel something. I\u0027d imagine it would be much simpler to just include a drill and an ISRU unit on the space-plane itself. Also, what are using to power the ISRU units? I haven\u0027t done any ISRU around Jool, but I\u0027ve heard that those suckers are very power hungry, and that solar panels don\u0027t provide much juice at that distance.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. What are you going to use to get into orbit around Laythe? Are you going to use\u00A0engine power, or are you going to\u00A0aero-brake? In the case of the later, I\u0027ve found reentry heating to be very brutal in 1.05. You might want to consider heat shields if you haven\u0027t already. Additionally, make sure your space-plane can handle an interplanetary reentry at Kerbin on the way home or can carry enough fuel to slow down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be more efficient, I would build a separate, smaller lander for Vall, Bop, and Pol. However, seeing as you\u0027re a space-plane addict, I doubt I would be able to change your mind on that one ;).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEverything else seems fine though. As long as your crafts pack the necessary delta V (and the necessary TWR and power generation in the case of your Tylo lander), you should be good to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceplaneAddict","CreatedById":149322,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-08T14:04:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFour guys for disposability.
