That dessert mint coloured speck of dust in the night sky. If only you where as bright as M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn... - Me.\n\nI propose a challenge. Minmus is conveniently situated on the edge of Kerbin\u0027s SOI. It has low enough gravity to move heavy stuff around by RCS trusters.\n\n**Build the tallest construction on Minmus you (or your PC) can handle.** \n\nThe rules are simple:\n\n- Place your tower on Lesser Flats on Minmus. Ground = 0m\n- Place a light in the top of your lighthouse\n- No cheats\n- No Hyperedit (see rule 3)\n- Use any other mod you like . I don\u0027t care, as long as it has a foothold in our current knowledge of physics.\n\nThere are 4 categories:\n\n**BoyScoutExtravaganza:** \n\n**\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9** Construct your lighthouse parts on Kerbin and fly them to Minmus and assemble your tower there.\n\n Score: *height (m) x n\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 launches*\n\n**WernersGotNothingOnMe:**\n\n Construct your entire lighthouse in orbit around Kerbin and land the whole contraption safely on Minmus.\n\n Score: *height (m) x n\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 launches x 2*\n\n**RealKerbalsBuildOnSite:**\n\n Build an ExtraPlanetaryLaunchpad infrastructure to accomodate an on site build.\n\n Score: *height (m) x n\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 launches* (from Kerbin)\n\n**ShowEmWhosBoss:**\n\n Build your entire lighthouse on the surface of Kerbin and fly it as a whole to Minmus. Land safely.\n\n Score: *height (m) x 5*\n\n**DivineIntervention**\n\n Your construction exceeds the length of the rendering distance. Congratulations, you win the Internetz. Have a cookie.\n\n**LEADERBOARD:**\n\n1. 1of6Billion: 168m x 7 launches = 1176pts\n\n2. turkwinif: 88m x 5 = 440pts\n\n3. McFarnsworth: 70.8 x 5 = 354pts\n\n4.
