We all know this, right? You can make a glider that glides forever. In fact, you can make a glider that accelerates upwards, generating free lift and thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here\\\u0027s the challenge: build a glider capable of eternal level flight (This is easy, just pile on a bunch of wings), and set it in a long-term level glide. Now the tricky bit: achieve the maximum \u0027cruising\u0027 speed you can. Take several pics with the altitude and speed either staying the same or going up slightly. ASAS will probably help with this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMod packs: C7, mostly. But you can use pretty much anything if you like short of config edits. C7\\\u0027s experimental pack is handy, as it has those decouple-able engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\\\u0027s my entry: 241m/s. Oddly, it goes a LOT faster when I hit the ASAS. The whole thing shakes with vibration, and it almost looks like it\\\u0027s \u0027flapping\u0027. I\\\u0027m not sure how the aerodynamics system works, but it really does look like the ailerons themselves are propelling it forward.
