As we all know, asteroids tend to float around in space. Sometimes, these asteroids are brought near Kerbin, and on rare occasion, may even impact! Now, currently these impacts are quite sedate, but if the laws of physics keep being rewritten (read: updated), they may very well prove fatal in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbalkind must not be wiped out. So, our only option is to spread out among the outer planets, and populate other celestial bodies!
