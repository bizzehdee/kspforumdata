I then thought it would make a good challenge for people to try.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EObjective:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing only the parts and features in the current KSP demo (0.18.3) build a plane that meets the \u0022Wright standard\u0022 of powered, sustained, controlled flight. Safe landings are optional.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERules:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re using the demo, it\u0027s simple enough, just build a plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will allow entries done in the full game, for convenience and game performance issues. However, you must ensure you do not use features absent from the demo as well as limiting yourself to the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Demo_parts\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edemo parts\u003C/a\u003E. In particular this means \u003Cem\u003Eno\u003C/em\u003E mods full stop, no tweakables, and you must build in the VAB and launch from the pad. I\u0027ll grudgingly tolerate full game SAS usage; keep in mind it is very different to the SAS in the demo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if they\u0027re even in the demo, but no gravhack or fuelhack obviously. Glitch powered aircraft are allowed only if done in the actual demo because glitches change with versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinimum entry requirement is a screenshot of the plane in flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo formal scoring, just meet the requirements.

Launched atop an SRB. Once free it flies OK, using about 1/3rd-2/3rd throttle and controlling it on fine controls and pitch trim, no SAS. It\u0027s not a \u003Cem\u003Egreat\u003C/em\u003E plane: it tends to drift left or right, doesn\u0027t like going much above a couple of km, and has trouble pulling out of dives if it gets in one. Landing without using the chute was not successful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPost-flight stats showing distance covered and flight time \u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/pHF5N7\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://flic.kr/p/pHF5N7\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
