So when Jeb gave his three part vessel throttle to leave LKO to head for Duna he quickly ran into problems. After immediately shutting down throttle, Jeb radioed home and asked that two transfer vessels be launched so the before mentioned Duna vessel could be split into 3 and go to Duna separately. Unknown to Jeb, the two transport vessels are linked together and will be launched that way, also unknown to Jeb this has come at a time when KSP is facing sequestration and thus this must be done on the cheap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChallenge\u003C/strong\u003E: I will provide the craft file that you will then design a rocket to launch into 74k orbit.
