There\u0027s no way to do this ahead of launch. Do you make the link if asked to do so?\n\nWhat defines \u0027destroyed\u0027 is rather hard to say and in a lot of cases varies from plane to plane, so if I\u0027m being completely honest it\u0027s going to come down to personal impartial judgement in some cases. However, I will define the following things as situations in which the plane is DEFINITELY dead. \n\n1. The cockpit is destroyed. \n\n2. The cockpit and EVERY weapon are completely SEPARATED (not necessarily out of ammunition), such as if the cockpit was shot off of the plane. This includes if it is separated from all ammo boxes, but still connected to a weapon. \n\n3. The cockpit and flight computer are separated. \n\n4. The cockpit, or any part of the plane the cockpit is still attached to, makes physical contact with the ground and cannot recover itself. \n\nThere are also situations in which the plane can be considered \u0027dead in the water\u0027 as it were, such as if it ran out of fuel, defined as the following. \n\n1. The plane is unable to maintain flight due to wing loss. \n\n2. The plane is unable to maintain flight due to engine loss. \n\n3. The plane is unable to maintain flight due to fuel loss. \n\n4. The plane is unable to maintain flight due to structural damage, such as being shot in half by 30mm ammunition. \n\n5. The plane has completely run out of ammunition for every weapon attached to itself, missiles count as their own ammunition. (This is extremely unlikely.) \n\nIf both planes become dead in the water simultaneously, such as if they both ran out of fuel and started gliding, whichever one meets a death requirement first (most likely death condition #4) is considered the loser. \n\nAs to what you said about linking radar receivers, pressing the 0 key, which activates the AI flight computer, is the last thing I do. The only buttons I touch after that are the brackets to switch views and the mouse to control the camera. My hands are off the keyboard otherwise. If a preparation can\u0027t be done before that, or bound to an action group to trigger at the same time as the flight computer goes off, I can\u0027t do it.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Haha! I just did some test and putting radiators and structural panels does work! Some bullets hit my radiator instead of my cockpit so I survived to win in the test!\n\u003E Also, what happens when the only radome exploded/fell off? Is that a lose or not? I also got shot down by a engineless plane once, is that a lose too?\n\nI recommend strapping radiators on directly and using the offset tool, but whatever floats your boat. \n\nIf the radome is destroyed or disconnected from the rest of the plane, the fight continues as normal. Its reason for being there is to extend the range at which planes can see each other so they don\u0027t fly off into the sunset.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E here you go, the FA-34 Lightweight with:\n\u003E AIM-9 x2= 12\n\u003E \n\u003E Vulcan Hidden = 7\n\u003E \n\u003E Ammo Can = 4\n\u003E \n\u003E 5 Chaff= 10\n\u003E \n\u003E 5 Flare= 15\n\u003E \n\u003E 12\u002B7\u002B4\u002B10\u002B15= 48\n\u003E \n\u003E FA- Proto 3\n\u003E \n\u003E Vulcan Hidden x2= 14\n\u003E \n\u003E Ammo Can x2= 8\n\u003E \n\u003E 4 Chaff= 8\n\u003E \n\u003E 4 Flare=12\n\u003E \n\u003E 14\u002B8\u002B8\u002B12=42\n\u003E \n\u003E 42\u002B48=90\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://www./download/9pbztad9d91odn1/FA-34_Lightweight.craft](http://www./download/9pbztad9d91odn1/FA-34_Lightweight.craft)\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://www./download/bf6b6qupkaslo0p/FA-Proto_3.craft](http://www./download/bf6b6qupkaslo0p/FA-Proto_3.craft)\n\u003E \n\u003E Also: Action Groups\n\u003E \n\u003E 0-Toggle AI\n\u003E \n\u003E 1-Toggle Guard Mode\n\nReceived, inspected, edited and accepted. \n\n The FA-34 Lightweight had a pair of Wing Connector Type D\u0027s that were pretty clearly clipped into the fuselage which the rest of the wings attached to.
