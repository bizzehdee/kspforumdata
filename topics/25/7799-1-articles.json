Munar landing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Munar orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. LKO (about 100,000m)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. HKO (at least 1,000,000m)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe catch is that you cannot leave any debris orbiting in space! Landed debris (i.e. a spent descent stage on the Mun) do not count. Post a shot of the tracking station, where you can clearly see each orbit. You get 100 points for each of the 4 orbits achieved, plus 100 for no debris left on the Mun! -50 for each debris chunk left in space. In other words, a perfect score is 500 points! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are the illegal parts/ships you cannot use: hyperdrives, instant orbits, single-stage ships, RSD-100 Range Safety Device, and tweaked stock/mod packs.

When you\\\u0027re about to jettison them, point your ship retrograde, throttle up and jettison them quickly. If you do it right (the necessary thrust depends a lot on the design of the stages) they\\\u0027ll collide safely and continue to burn straight.
