I don\u0027t think it\u0027s any more unrealistic to give people eccentricity and node position than it is to give them apoapsis and current velocity, though. In real spacecraft autopilot software even getting THAT much telemetry information is not automatic and takes work. Once you\u0027ve accepted that it\u0027s okay to dive into the API to get things like your position and velocity it\u0027s hard to make the argument about avoiding the other data. Also, while having to make utility routines that calculate that data may be a fun programming challenge in a fully functional computer, it\u0027s not so fun in a 10k computer that runs at about 10 commands a second. Once you have to use up most of that 10k of code to just have library support routines there\u0027s nothing left for your piloting. Yes I know the real space program used computers with tiny storage but they weren\u0027t trying to fit ascii source code on them. The computer only stored the machine language code and also the designers didn\u0027t make the computer do all the work. Some of the logic was the responsibility of the peripheral control electronics, which they were also designing from scratch.
