This daunting challenge has strict guidelines that must be followed, such as:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. NO ORBITING. This is to be an atmospheric (i.e. jet-powered) flight.

I ran at full throttle to avoid the fuel bug since I have not installed the fix. I burned ~20 of my tanks getting half way then burned the last ~8 in the final half. I\u0027m not trying to use fuel line bugs or anything. If it is accidentally, then perhaps it\u0027ll be better to see it in 0.17 when that is fixed. The calculation is more like this: 6x400L @ 2.8L/s then 6x400L @ 2.0L/s then 10x400L @ 1.2L/s then 8x400L @ 0.4L/s. This gives a flight time of approximately: 3 hours 43 mins.
