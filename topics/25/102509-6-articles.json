My second question is what are the rules on replacing parts with KAS for repairs/ upgrades? Finally, any suggestions?\n\nMy basic theory on mods. This challenge is more about challenging yourself, your patience, your design skills, your determination, than testing a mod. If you feel like a mod would make the trip more enjoyable, by all means use it. If your mod has you performing quantum tunneling, whereby you end up on the opposite side of the planet instantly, I\u0027ll probably not look favorably on it.\n\nAs for replacement parts. I took a KAS care package on my trip, I ended up replacing a vehicle 3/4 of the way through because of corrupt saves. I loathed having to replace the vehicle but it was that or completely restart. Your conscience is the determine factor. If you can live with replacing parts or vehicles, so can I.\n\nSuggestions: Read my mission log. Especially if you\u0027re using wheels and not fueled propulsion. I used AutoHotKey to basically hold down the \u0027w\u0027 key for me. I have one of the scripts in that thread that I used. At 13 m/s crossing Eve, it saved me a lot of bandages. You can find the link to that thread in my OP.\n\nSecond suggestion. Do NOT quicksave while moving over land.

Going by RCS and staying near the ground might work, but you\u0027d run out of propellant quickly.\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m really curious how to pull off an Elcano on Gilly. What do you say, Fengist?\n\nI would say... very carefully. I haven\u0027t done an ore scan of Gilly yet, but with 1.0, running out of fuel isn\u0027t a huge concern any more. I would think, that in order to stay on the ground while drilling that KAS grappling hooks would be a very good thing. I used them on an airship recently and they do a great job of keeping you planted on the surface. Beyond that, keeping pointed in the direction you want to go would be the biggest challenge.\n\nOne thought I just had, instead of RCS to keep you on the ground, how about Ions pointed downward?"},{"CreatedByName":"Redjoker","CreatedById":68444,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T23:28:17Z","Content":"The Labrador 1 has completed it\u0027s final trial runs and is ready for its attempt.
