My Interplanetary Tug and Duna Transfer Habitat both have heat shields made of structural panels installed at front, just in case they need to use aerocapture in an emergency (they are not intended for reentry normally).

Be careful and do testing on those folding heatshields. In my experience the robotic parts that allow folding don\u0027t handle the stress of re-entry/aerobraking well! Most likely the sections will wobble uncontrollably. Make sure to do a test run on this before doing the mission! I know for a fact the rotatatron won\u0027t work as I tried this approach myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMisanthropia66, as Sturmstiger said, mass distribution is key to re-entry position. Most of the time, empty fuel tanks on the top of the ship, and heavy engines on the bottom mean the drag is in the middle of the ship and mass is to the bottom. Thus the ship pivots to leave the engines towards the source of drag. Yes, if you have sufficient control surface/RCS/torque producing items you can overcome this, but definitely test this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother way around it (though trickier) is to place the engines high up on your ship thus raising center of mass above center of drag and then put the heatshields on the top of your ship. Basically you re-enter prograde to get the heatshield aligned. One problem with this approach is that any gimbals on engines won\u0027t work right above the center of mass of a ship. They\u0027ll actually destabilize and throw a ship\u0027s course off! This is a bug in KSP control where it should reverse the gimballing in this situation, but doesn\u0027t. Using other controls than gimballing would solve that. Just turn it off and use fins/RCS/torque items etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also means that on a normal ship with engines and heatshields on the bottom that you have to be careful with the position and quantity of heatshields on a craft. If you place too many surfaces down there it lowers the center of drag down towards the bottom of the craft. If you also have heavy payload high up you might find the ship flipping prograde on re-entry as the mass is actually above the center of drag!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso bear in mind that with the new ASAS in 0.21.1 you may have trouble getting it to automatically stay on heading during re-entry. Honestly I haven\u0027t played 0.21.1 much (though I have a version of it installed) as I\u0027m sticking with 0.20.2 for this challenge.

I think if you\u0027re using Deadly Re-entry mod he won\u0027t have a problem. I\u0027m currently playing with a few launcher designs myself and one possibility is a third stage on a almost totally re-usable system, with the rest on a ballistic course, landing on that continent to the east of KSC. Actually, from testing, I doubt I\u0027ll use that configuration, but I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s allowable. It does leave a low part count at orbit however, but I\u0027m currently testing a much lower part count vessel over all, though some does splash down rather than land *shrugs*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI doubt he\u0027ll have a problem with Ioncross oxygen containers either, but you might want to try Thunder Aerospace\u0027s WIP Tac Life Support. I\u0027ve been following that since I noticed it a couple of days ago. It models life support needs even when the ship is not player controlled! It\u0027s still being developed but looks very promising!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to remote tech, you might consider a manned launch on day ten with multiple control sats docked to it if he doesn\u0027t allow a pre-emptive launch of the sats. Though I doubt he\u0027ll have a problem with sats in Kerbin orbit prior to day 10. Duna orbit perhaps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sturmstiger","CreatedById":60543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T11:49:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022IronGremlin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022IronGremlin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHiya!\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been following this thread for quite awhile, lurking quietly while I designed my mission modules.

(I use a combo of B9\u0027s Aerobrakes and some probe torque to keep it pointed engine-side down). Additionally, the launch profile is such that I actually have time to circularize and then switch back to my final lifter stage to manually land it. Does that still count as re-useable?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Does the use of Ion-cross preclude the rule about supplies entirely, or are you simply allowed to ship Ion-cross oxygen containers as if the were supply units?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could see that going either way, although, I will say, actually needing to be concerned about the oxygen that your kerbals are consuming while in transit most definitely adds another layer of difficulty - The mass of enough oxygen to survive a Duna transfer drastically exceeds the amount of mass you\u0027d need to ship up in abstracted RCS supply units for the same period of time, and any manned off-window transfer attempts are incredibly difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Assuming I am using Remote Tech, can I launch my initial Kerbin relay satellites for without re-setting my launch window timer? I really enjoy how much challenge Remote Tech is adding to the actual Duna mission, but it seems a bit punitive to include those first few launches as part of the general launch limitations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Deadly Re-entry can completely substitute the stock reentry rule which is based on reentry visual effect. In another word, if the parts survived reentry with Deadly Re-entry, then they are considered good for use (and reuse) even if there\u0027s reentry visual effects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Ion-cross can also completely substitute the stock supply rule, which is how it is used some current entries. See my reply to KeithStone in Post 146 for details.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Yes you can launch Remote Tech Sats completely independent of the rest of your missions. They are not restricted by the rules of challenge as long as their purpose are to provide comm relay. It is assumed that before the crewed missions there were already a number of probe / robotic missions which had done preparatory work such as surveying landing sites and building a communication relay system.In fact, you are welcomed to present the outpost missions as a stage of a larger Duna exploration program, proceeded by various orbiter, lander, rover and perhaps sample return missions, although only the outpost missions will be scored for this challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Death Engineering","CreatedById":68528,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T20:14:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPosted \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/43260-Duna-Space-Program-or-Do-we-have-to-call-it-Death-Engineering?p=565504\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post565504\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u0022Mission Entry 6 - Bob Loses his Rover\u0022\u003C/a\u003E, where Bob\u0027s rover winds up in Macly\u0027s possesion, Jeb and Bill head out to Duna to visit Bob and Mission Control gets good news about the future of the Duna Space Program.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Patupi","CreatedById":71098,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T03:01:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK, during testing of the replacement for the BHL series (this seriously no longer is \u0027bulbous\u0027 so the name will have to change) I\u0027ve ended up with a ship where the final, disposable booster hefts the payload way up beyond 75km.
