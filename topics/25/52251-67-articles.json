Fair point, sadly don\u0027t have a way to kill the Kerbal inside this if there isn\u0027t O2 present... yet. But anyone using this outside of the atmosphere is kind of missing the point of it. Also worth considering that the lack of SAS makes space use difficult as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mk1 weighs in at 0.7 mpK (Mass per Kerbal, after adjusting for things like mono-prop storage and SAS).
