As well as the rover I took a relay sat into orbit around Eeloo and since I had to wait five or six years for that to happen I also sent five relay sats into orbit around Kerbol - just past the orbit of Dres.

For the most part landings are gentle and take care of themselves. For the whole trip speed can be kept above 50m/s. Unfortunately this means that Eeloo is very boring and and the main danger comes from falling asleep while moving.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter Minmus this is the second fastest circumnavigation I have completed and by far the easiest.

I\u0027d already taken a boat around Kerbin and Master Mariner had a nice ring to it so the next circumnavigation had to be around Laythe.

Which includes re-sending the two relay sats. The second boat didn\u0027t quite have the range to cross the Degrasse Sea - it was 280km short of the start point when it ran out of fuel.

The afterburners, which would have sped things up, were almost never used.

There are no objective dangers - no fear of crashing or breaking the rover and any big jumps, well, the landings are pretty soft. The sixteen wheeler was easily able to maintain about 15m/s and hit the surface about a dozen times on the way around. Once I accelerated to 20m/s and ended up at 42km above the surface. Unfortunately, above about 28km you start going backward over the surface and I eventually landed not far from where I jumped. Very small bursts from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters were used to keep the rover straying from a 90\u00B0 heading.

Val also just happened to be aboard. This time I kept the speed down to between 4 and 7m/s. However the rover still spent an apppreciable amount of time above the surface but it was usually more akin to very low flying. It was quite fun to be able to turn on physics warp while skimming just above the surface. Val also had a much more limited supply of monopropellant and no way to obtain more, so all course adjustments had to made on the surface - usually accomplished by making sure the rover was pointing in the right direction just before it bounced. And on the way to the start waypoint the rover sunk down to the top of it\u0027s wheels into the surface before being spat directly upward with some force. I\u0027m not sure it was ever the same afterwards.

Bill climbed into the one Kerbal rover and proceeded to drive around Bop. This small rover normally has a top speed of around 24m/s and early on it took a number of fairly heroic jumps that I was certain would end in disaster. The last one resulted in the rover hitting the surface with a speed of over 50m/s but it handled it just fine. So I stopped worrying about it. Bop is most notable (besides having a dead Kraken near the north pole) for the elevation of it\u0027s peaks. The lowest point on my route was around 4 500m but the highest was over 20 000m. The long climbs up to the high points were soporific but the descents were exhilarating. On the last one, Bill went from 20km elevation down to 7km without once touching the brakes.

Being able to send four relay sats and a rover in one craft definitely speeds things up. The rover is slow and slow to accelerate but the small size of Pol meant that would not matter and may even be an advantage. I found Pol\u0027s most striking feature to be the unevenness of the terrain. There is no going to sleep driving around Pol - course and attitude corrections need to be made on a second by second basis and even 20m/s is hard to maintain given the resulting lack of contact with the surface. Even though they lack the elevation found on Bop, the mountains on Pol look bigger and much more spectacular. This is enhanced by the richness and vibrancy of the colors of the terrain. Sometimes the steep escarpments threw the rover so high into the sky that only \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E saved it from the vertical speed of the surface impact. Slowing to 10m/s meant that this happened less often but it still happened. A lot of these jumps are breathtaking and make Pol one of the better choices for a circumnavigation.

The overwhelming majority of the trip is in the Midlands and Lowlands. This is good because on the high grav moon, steep inclines slow a rover to a crawl and if it operates at an ec deficit, as this one does, it can be easy to run out of power before the top is reached. This is why the sixteen wheeler has two vernier engines and on this trip, fuel was saved exclusively for uphill climbs. On the downhill side I tried to keep the speed between 90 and 100m/s although sometimes when my attention wandered I found myself going faster. The wheels can only take the rover to 55m/s - faster than that and it becomes pointless to hold down the forward key.

For the TR-2L Ruggedized Vehicular Wheel, that I tend to favor, it is 100m/s. On nearly any body you choose, you will find long downhill stretches that will want to accelerate you past this safe velocity and losing contact with the surface then accelerating more in freefall will be the last thing you want. Even when your route flattens out or turns into a climb, you will often find yourself maintaining an unsafe speed. You will want to be very sure before you take any jump and usually have little time to assess the situation. I would suggest that braking engines on the front of the rover would be of more use than any added to the rear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, all but the smallest engines add significant weight to the rover which not only increases the difficulty of transporting to and landing on your target but also increases the stresses on the wheels every time the rover lands. If engines are heavy then fuel is even more so and the difficulty of your task is increased again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven the most parsimonious stock engine consumes fuel at such a rate that to be any help at all in speeding up your circumnavigation, you will have to refill your fuel tanks multiple times. This means carrying an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E, radiators, at least one mining excavator and at least one ore tank. Again, as the rover mass increases, so does the difficulty. At the same time the ability of the rover to cope with the stress of landing a jump decreases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter circumnavigating many places carrying all of the above on a rover I would advise you to only use engines on long very flat spaces or on uphill stretches. Rest assured that you will not need engines to make many jumps capable of destroying your rover. Before fitting engines and all the supporting paraphernalia it would be better to think about a decent \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E system. This is the thing that will really save you time because instead of repeatedly destroying your rover and having to reload your game, you will be able to slow descents and soften impacts. Also, even the best rover will spin out of control on occasion and being able to flip on a good \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E system will save your rover.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn some of my circumnavigations, I didn\u0027t use engines at all and never filled up the fuel tanks. Frankly, I didn\u0027t want the extra speed and certainly not the extra weight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you really want to circumnavigate somewhere while using engines try going to Tylo - you would be mad not to take them. Moho also has some excellent flats. And on Kerbin, Laythe and Eve you will require them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course if you are thinking of using engines on Gilly, then as far as I\u0027m concerned, yes, that would make you a dirty cheating alpaca.

Motorized wheels in water preclude economy and speed so I decided to place a couple of pairs of canards on top of the rover and on entering water I would flip it upside down so that the canards could act as hydrofoils. It made for a particularly ugly boat but 400 units of liquid fuel behind a Panther gave it a range of more than 300km at 50m/s.

Likewise, if mountains were encountered on land, they were crossed and not skirted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was my first major foray ever onto the Southern and Northern Ice Shelves. They are very big areas and perfectly flat. Eventually I began to wonder how fast I could go so I opened up the Panther and hit 160m/s. Great. Kicked in the afterburner and accelerated to around 230m/s. And held that speed all the way to the edge of the ice sheet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have never approached the Ice Shelves by sea and didn\u0027t know about the 31m high ice cliff surrounding them. Fortunately, the Panther on full afterburner provided just enough power to inch up the 85\u00B0 slope. Exiting from an ice shelf back to the sea required the same maneuver but this time in reverse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEstimated time to complete : 30-35 hours.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImgur album - \u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/52AuM7j\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/52AuM7j\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022mEbqrGn.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/mEbqrGn.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00229qoD1iX.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/9qoD1iX.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022LPNVxr2.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/LPNVxr2.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022WtBVIRD.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/WtBVIRD.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-08-23T08:40:37Z\u0022 title=\u002208/23/2018 08:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 23, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by mystifeid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mystifeid","CreatedById":187479,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-04T06:05:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEve - completed using a separate stock KSP 1.45 install - no added mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStart and finish at 0\u00B0N 12\u00B040\u0027W - Landing zone just to the south-west.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a surreal feeling that accompanies finishing the circumnavigation of Eve. So much time...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom a cursory inspection of the Elcano threads there appears to have only been six people before me who have completed this challenge and about half of these used a stock install. I\u0027m not sure how true this is but given the difficulty and time involved, I\u0027d believe it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEve really is in a class of it\u0027s own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom the beginning I had three goals - to make my route as circular as possible, to do it stock and not look at how anyone else had done it. Up until nearly finishing my last Elcano, I thought that circumnavigating Eve involved getting my Kerbals feet wet - or island hopping around a lot of the planet, often circuitously. I\u0027d been playing around with different designs but none seemed to offer the range across the seas that would be required. There is no oxygen on Eve so any engines would need to be \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E. The only way I could see that offered some hope would be to use a stock prop but I was worried about not only landing it on Eve but also it\u0027s ability to propel the rover up steep slopes. (Nevertheless, I see now that is exactly how someone else solved the problem). I was stuck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I decided to actually look at Eve closely and to my joy discovered that a very circular polar route was possible by land. On both sides of the planet though - around the equator - there appeared to be some very high terrain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo problem. I threw another four wheels on the 16-wheeler and set off after also launching my relay sats. Yeah, right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe 16-wheeler can have the springs/dampers set to 2/2 on any other planet. Adding four wheels made this unstable on Kerbin so I had crossed my fingers and left them at the default 1/1 for Eve. For some extra speed I had also bolted an extra (decouplable) aerospike on the back. After landing and half a dozen blowouts, the aerospike was the first thing to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUndeterred, I pushed on for 25\u00B0. By this time I\u0027d had about another fifty blowouts and had developed quite a long list of improvements I wanted to make. For one, I didn\u0027t have nearly enough EC generation for twenty wheels and I was having to stop regularly near the equator in the middle of the day to recharge my batteries. What was it going to be like near the poles? For another, all those lightweight doodads that make no difference on airless worlds - in Eve\u0027s thick atmosphere they provide a lot of drag. Trying to coast down even steep hills was like having the brakes on. And a lot of aerials self destruct at speeds greater than about 25m/s (there is only one choice - the 16S, which is strong with low drag).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven though I had estimated that ten degrees on the flat was taking me 90 minutes - meaning I had driven for more than three hours - and it had taken a couple more hours to get there, set the relay sats up etc, I bit the bullet and deleted the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter starting anew, I made the changes I wanted in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. I also decided to action key the motors in the extra four wheels to provide economy/power modes. And five or more hours later I was back where I left off. The springs/damper settings had been changed to 1/0.8 and this seemed to make a huge difference because in the flatter biomes I could now drive for hours between blowouts. But in the other biomes it was a different story and it would have been nice to have some way to either change these on the fly or experiment beforehand. All up I had somewhere between fifty and a hundred blowouts on the trip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy top speed was a little faster now - I could get 28-29m/s on the flat with 16 wheels and a bit faster with 20 wheels. The rover would also now accelerate when coasting downhill. However, the thick air meant that it was rare to go above 40m/s and my fastest speed on the trip was 47m/s. Hitting that speed on Eve felt more dangerous than going twice as fast anywhere else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the tropical zones - plus/minus 30\u00B0 from the equator - in the middle of the day I could drive without depleting the batteries. This represents about a third of the trip. Outside of these zones stops to replenish EC became more frequent the closer I was to the poles. It was always a good feeling once a pole had been reached and the course turned back toward the equator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore starting, I\u0027d had grave fears about the terrain but the Shallows, Lowlands and Poles (for the most part) biomes were very mellow and more than two thirds of the route was in these biomes. The Midlands always looked like it should be safe but it wasn\u0027t and it was a popular place for blowouts. The Highlands, Foothills and Peaks biomes often regulated speed through inclination when going uphill and fear when going down. However these last three all provided lots of opportunities for more blowouts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe worst places of all, and possibly the worst places in the Kerbol system, are found within 2\u00B0-3\u00B0 of the poles. The terrain becomes very angular and often the driving proceeds from one rover trap to another (see pic below). These need to be dealt with a lot of care while the rover uses considerable power to overcome them. Six degrees in the Lowlands takes about an hour but near the poles...who knows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDriving toward my first pole - the North Pole - I was thinking that it would be nice if there was actually something there. Besides the awful terrain, I got my wish. The poles are...different and worth visiting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the Peaks I found that despite the savage appearance of the mountain sides, the rover could often drive straight up and so I made no detours. Around the halfway mark I reached 4500 meters. Much later, as I was nearly finishing the circumnavigation and again passing through the Peaks, I started trying to climb the highest mountains I could see. The highest altitude reached was just over 5700m.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn total, with planning and the aborted first attempt, I would estimate this challenge took in excess of 70 hours. Good luck if you are thinking of doing it and my sincere congratulations if you succeed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImgur album - \u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/WDRfbyI\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/WDRfbyI\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/158904-rkarmark/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022158904\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/158904-rkarmark/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@rkarmark\u003C/a\u003E - this marks the last circumnavigation of all the planets and moons in the Kerbol system and I believe it should entitle me to the Eve, Master Navigator and Grand Master Circumnavigator badges.
