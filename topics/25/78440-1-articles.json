You can still enter the challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the 18th of September 2013, Tommy99534 set us all the challenge of making an ICBM - Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile. The challenge recently became on the front of the challenge page again, however someone mentioned that it was around 8 months old (it\u0027s actually 10, but whatever) This challenge will be based off that challenge to fit with the recent updates - 0.22, 0.23, 0.23.5 and 0.24. I also consider the challenge to lack some details. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Kerbal Missile challenge remake!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBack-story...\u003C/strong\u003E (mission control text, perhaps?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerbals are at war - across the entire planet. The war only recently broke out, but technology has only given them missiles as weaponry. And the kerbals can\u0027t be bothered to go and find other ways to fight. The kerbals at KSC wish for you - yes, \u003Cem\u003EYOU!\u003C/em\u003E -to develop missiles capable of hitting other continents and destroying bases owned by the karbals - kerbals who are fighting against you. They are on all continents except for yours. You must regain these continents to gain superiority over the karbals! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDetails\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are two categories for entry:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Interplanetary\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the names suggest, the Kerbin category aims to have a missile impact one of the other continents (map will be provided soon). The interplanetary category requires the missile to reach another celestial body - such as the Mun or Duna. The rules for both will be mentioned later on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is recommended that you do this in sandbox, but you can use career mode for a sub-category: cheapest missile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGeneral rules:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- No cheating through the debug menu (no infinite fuel, hacking gravity, ect.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- All ICBM\u0027s must be unmanned\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Certain mods are allowed.

I built one and a launcher a few days ago, and they work quite well. Rules something like: no flying above 1km, so not to get detected by enamy radar, missiles marked for range, accuracey and the destructive capabilities of the weapon system. Launch vehicle must be manned, comand pods only, as it could be a long mission, and be capable of staying on station (staying all systems go) for long periods of time, to be a deterant for other nations of kerbin to attack.
