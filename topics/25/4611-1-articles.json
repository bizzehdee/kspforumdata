Thus, being in a simple free-fall achieves it. In fact, as just having your engines off is weightlessness, no matter what direction you are travelling. As long as the ground isn\\\u0027t in the way, and you aren\\\u0027t applying thrust, you are weightless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, the reason I say \u0027weightless\u0027 is because zero-g is impossible. Zero-g implies zero gravity; that is, no gravity at all. However, because gravity still exists everywhere in the universe, it\\\u0027s impossible to not be under the influence of it, even if it\\\u0027s only in minuscule amounts. In ksp, zero-g is technically possible however, due to rounding numbers when the number is incredibly small.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Iskierka","CreatedById":2116,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-12-20T01:02:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWrong, it\\\u0027s both easy, and basically impossible, because there\\\u0027s no way to confirm. Having engines off in atmosphere is not weightlessness; lift from wings and drag from everything apply force to the aircraft, which applies force to the occupants. Thus, it is not a zero-g environment. This challenge could not be completed within the atmosphere ... and everyone who has left the atmosphere has achieved this anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, shush, zero-g does not imply an absence of gravity.
