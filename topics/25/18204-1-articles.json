VTOL landers, multiple landings, etc so far has all been done. Really the peak of my challenge was the one issued by bioman where with a single rocket I orbitted and landed on both moons with orbit captures, orbited kerbin\u0027s poles, and finished with a bombing run of KSC2 finished with it landing spaceplane style. To keep my personal challenges going, I have been re-doing old tasks, but with flashy and complex rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to test creativity and piloting skills, design and post up a flight of your choosing. The goal is to combine a difficult flight along with style and flair to your own rocket\u0027s operation. From ground to mission complete. Mod parts make for awesome styling and creativity, and as such, not used since then it wouldn\u0027t be as much of a challenge. Stock parts only and feel free to share it up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHints at things I look for:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003Estreamlining\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003Edecoupling form\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFUNCTIONAL complexity\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember, it is a combination of ship and mission design. A purdy ship that barely gets into orbit likely isn\u0027t going to get my vote unless is really well done. Likewise, if you can fly to all the moons and orbit the sun consisting of nothing but a single stack of tanks, likely isn\u0027t going to get ahead since not really any style.
