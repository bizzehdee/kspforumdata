What I will do is make a new Space Program and then make sure to do all those challenges in the correct order, and guys, feel free to post suggestions on challenges in the comment section!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo some rules I would use, of course you guys don\u0027t have to: 1. Make all flights manned so flags can be planted wherever you land. 2. Try to not kill too many Kerbals or destroy too many ships. 3. Try to not overkill the easier challenges, like building a huge asparagus ship to get a small thing into Low Kerbin Orbit, be money-efficient! 4. This is totally optional, just saying what I will do, I will name all flags after the challenge I accomplished, like Challenge 1 and then write in the description both the challenge, the progress and which Kerbal who finished it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s the rules I would follow when I do this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, for the challenges, I will try to make them harder and harder the further down they get:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChallenges:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet an object into sub-orbit and land it successfully on land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet an object into orbit and then bring it down again without having it explode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet an object to a million meters height and back to Kerbin again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESend a manned vessel into a Mun encounter so the Kerbals can see the Mun from close range before slingshoting back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave some kerbals get into an orbit around the Mun and then manage to successfully land at Kerbin again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELand some green men on the Mun, make the walk around a bit and then safely return them to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet into Minmus orbit and back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELand on Minmus and then safely land on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStart building a space station consisting of at least 6 different modules, each launched separately from the others (Some ideas for the modules: Habitation, Power, Communications, Science, Refueling, Ion-Probe carrier, and Escape Pods) Remember to put on parachutes, as the station might have to be brought down to Kerbin later on!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELand a rover on the Mun and drive it around for some time, then get the Kerbals back to Kerbin again! (Hardcore version: Get the rover back too)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELand a rover on Minmus and bring the Kerbals back to Kerbin again! (Hardcore version: Get the rover back too)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake a ship first get into Mun orbit, then slingshot to Minmus and land there before it can travel back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELand on both the Mun and Minmus with the same lander. Then get it back to Kerbin (Hardcore Version: Bring a rover and use it on both the landings!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStart making a Mun base by landing at least 4 different ships within 250 meters from each other. (Ideas for the different modules: Habitation, Communication tower, Rover, Escape Pods, Kethane Mining Unit (Only if Kethane Mod is installed), Science lab)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuild a Space Station in orbit around the Mun, consisting of at least 4 modules. They can be the same that was used for the Kerbin Station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELand at Kerbal Control Center from space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFind at least one anomality/Easter egg on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBreak out of Kerbins Sphere of Influence, travel a lap around the Sol and land on Kerbin again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuild a Minmus Base consisting of at least 4 modules, they can be the same as the Mun base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuild a smaller station around Minmus for refueling, it has to consist of at least 3 modules, where one has to be a refueling module with a minimum of a full Rockmax 64 (orange) tank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELand on the Mun, then land on Minmus and land on the Mun again before you return to land on Kerbin. Try to land as close to Kerbal Space Center as possibly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet into a Duna encounter, and then return to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnter a Duna orbit and return to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELand on Ike and return to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELand on Duna and go back to Kerbin!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet a rover to Duna and drive around. (Hardcore version: Get the rover back too)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELand on Duna, then Ike, then go back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELand on the Mun, then Minmus, then Ike, then Duna, then Ike, then Minmus, then Mun and lastly go back to Kerbin. (Hardcore Version: Bring a rover with you on all celestial bodies!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will add more when I have time!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to post ideas of challenges and if you decide to do this, I would love to see screenshots of your progresses!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeroignite","CreatedById":1377,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T16:21:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24898-Challenge-Submission-Guidelines\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24898-Challenge-Submission-Guidelines\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
