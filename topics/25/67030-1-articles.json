I have been happily plumbing (some might say raping) space for science in my first game of KSP when i finally decided that it was time to put a kerbal on the Mun. All was going spectacularly until landing. I had not tested the amount of force that the shock absorbers on my landing gear would take and had promptly stranded young Jebediah on the Mun with perfectly intact lander bar the \u0027sploded thruster...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo problems thought I, a rescue mission can be launched to save the promising kerbalnaut. So a rescue mission promptly was. But due to some navigational issues during launch and a less than optimal Mun entry vector, not enough fuel was left to escape the Muns pull and escape back to Kerbin. Thats fine, i\u0027ll send another, but this time i will make it an unmanned mission so as not to leave stranded any more poor kerbals... All went well, the mission was timed so as to require the minimum of fuel to get to the moon. The entry angle was good so i didnt need to waste alot of thrust to land safely. I now even knew the speed at which i could land without destroying my thruster. With both stranded kerbals safely aboard i proceeded to head back to Kerbin. Almost. With all the extra fuel i had i thought \u0022Hell, why dont i go and explore a bit of the Mun\u0027s surface?\u0022 and so i did, and used most of my remaining fuel. But it was fine, when i was done i plotted a course back to Kerbin and off we went. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs i frequently do through a mission, i quicksaved not far from entering Kerbals atmosphere. At this point i made a shocking realisation. I had no parachutes on my lander.... Not only did i have no parachutes, i had also wasted most of my surplus fuel exploring the Mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI now have a craft with two crew plummeting toward Kerbin at great speed with no way to land safely. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHE CHALLENGE:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELoad up my quicksave and work out a way to save my two beloved kerbals.
