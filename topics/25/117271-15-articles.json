I just built a BD Armory installation two days ago and I\u0027m still learning the systems. Not to mention my KSP time is rather limited, and will be split between building and testing fighters, and working on the Apollo Applications Challenge.\n\nI\u0027ll probably have to skip the current tournament, but I\u0027ll see about hosting after this current one is finished. I\u0027m thinking 2v2 or 3v3 fights over the North Pole.

Already got mine ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif).\n\u003E During testing the Stormwind a problem has ocured to me. The missiles fired at any plane simply seem to ignore all the countermeasures. Every missile hits by 100% chance, regardless how many chaff and flares my plane/the enemy plane fires. Does this happen to one of you guys, too, and do you have found a solution?\n\nAs Alph has suggested, the problem is that your plane is not changing its heading. The radar-guided missiles seem to track last-know-heading in the case of loss of radar lock. Is your craft climbing to its min altitude while this occurs? If so, lower the min alt.\n\nThe downside to this is that having a low min altitude can lead to collisions with the ground. The other possible solution is to design your plane in such a way that it constantly oscillates in flight. Maybe try making the plane aerodynamically unstable and lower the damping value on the AI flight module ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)."},{"CreatedByName":"GDJ","CreatedById":58462,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T17:44:44Z","Content":"Hey Alphasus;\n\nWould you mind trying something on my plane with the AI?

I do know that the radar dome is heavy for it\u0027s size, and of course the fuel tanks. It does have alot of wings, but wings don\u0027t weigh much.

Less fuel = less mass = more menuverable. Conversly, packing extra fuel on a plane costs menuverability early in the match, but you might be able to outlast the competition. Manditory fuel allotments would remove an eliment of depth to this competition. As would removing the penalty for running out of fuel by calling it a stalemate.\n\nMy revised recomendation for a new rule:\n\nFor the sake of keeping matches to a resonable length, have a time limit of 10 to 15 minutes. When the buzzer rings, the plane with the least damage taken wins. If both planes are undamaged, its a draw."}]}
