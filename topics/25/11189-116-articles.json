So, I decided to do an aerobrake.\n    - However, if I set my periapsis too low, I\u0027m at greater risk of blowing up.\n\n![r5lAMCV.png](https://i.imgur.com/r5lAMCV.png)\n\n- Spinning about my roll axis while approaching my periapsis at ~3.1 km/s.\n- I\u0027m moving further away from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n    - It\u0027s not that big a deal, though --\u003E I already have the APPA First-Class award.\n        - Not that it mattered, since Round 2 began.\n\n![TPT9W1Y.png](https://i.imgur.com/TPT9W1Y.png)\n\n- My orbit right before my second time around.\n- I didn\u0027t plot any nodes since I\u0027d be right on top of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003Eby the time I reached the periapsis.\n    - Though my wish was granted, I would be going around a third time.\n\n![pzOmS9Z.png](https://i.imgur.com/pzOmS9Z.png)\n\n- I knew I couldn\u0027t reach the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E my third time around without help, so I decided on establishing a low circular orbit above the atmosphere before making a good de-orbit burn.\n\n![ePYQggM.png](https://i.imgur.com/ePYQggM.png)\n\n- Making my de-orbit burn to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\n![75ItXMW.png](https://i.imgur.com/75ItXMW.png)\n\n- Seems pretty fast for being that close to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.

As soon as my velocity got below 300, I deployed the landing gear and leveled out while flying slightly to the northeast. That way I could straighten out when it was time and land facing east.\n    - FIRST TRY\n- I didn\u0027t use the rapiers at all since re-entry; the only reason I used any liquid fuel is because I used a Vernor engine to keep my nose up during landing.\n\n![iPaRDv0.png](https://i.imgur.com/iPaRDv0.png)\n\n- Nothing broke, and we have some fresh ore from Minmus.

Who gives a bus a glorious name?)  \n\nSince finishing its design it has been a veritable workhorse of AHTech\u0027s aerospace division. We\u0027ve made at least a dozen trips to our gateway station (\u0022The Gate\u0022) and other destinations in Kerbin orbit or around Minmus and the Mun. Recently - since even the fearless Jebediah Kerman prefers to no be on board when our more experimental craft launch - many of our interplanetary craft launch without crew and the crew is shuttled up in this craft.\n\nSo we sent Julhat Kerman on ~~a joyride ...~~ a  tour to show off what our shuttle can do. The full picture gallery can be seen [on imgur](https://imgur.com/a/CIhQ3dz), here are the edited highlights.\n\nAs the name suggests the craft is optimized for the transport of personnel within the Kerbin system. In addition to a two Kerbal flight-crew it has space for eight additional passengers:\n\n![5v78qPp.png](https://imgur.com/5v78qPp.png)\n\nStart, take-off, and ascent to orbit is fairly typical. If the pilot doesn\u0027t mess up you\u0027ll have more than 3.1 km/s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\nSpoiler\n\nRotation at about 100 m/s, a fairly steep climb to 5000 m, then drop the nose to about 7 deg up and let the powerful RAPIER engines do the rest, the curvature of Kerbin will \u0022raise the nose\u0022 on it\u0027s own. Just remember to engage the NERVs and switch the RAPIERs to closed cycle at appropriate times.\n\n![XQ8Wfmv.png](https://imgur.com/XQ8Wfmv.png)\n\n![ljkNa06.png](https://imgur.com/ljkNa06.png)\n\n![ZyyG0kh.png](https://imgur.com/ZyyG0kh.png)\n\nFirst stop of the tour was The Gate, AHTech\u0027s refueling station in a not-so-circular-anymore 500 km orbit around Kerbin.\n\n![u2rlHlx.png](https://imgur.com/u2rlHlx.png)\n\nSpoiler\n\nDocking is a bit tricky because the docking port is not in-line with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E of the shuttle, so the automated systems don\u0027t manage to keep it straight and docking needs to be done manually. But this is helped by the fact that in contrast to rockets with a cylindrical symmetry the shape of the plane makes it clear which directions are up/down, left/right etc. reducing instances of spatial disorientation of the pilots.\n\n![82ACi4w.png](https://imgur.com/82ACi4w.png)\n\n![gAQCuZS.png](https://imgur.com/gAQCuZS.png)\n\nAs usual, no refueling of the person shuttle was done. During a routine visit it is not needed to return to Kerbin, and this time the goal was to demonstrate what can be done without refueling.\n\n![utwZp6r.png](https://imgur.com/utwZp6r.png)\n\n(Yes, I used the opportunity to transmit the accumulated science from the science lab.)\n\nNext stop was Minmus. Not much to be said here, the transfer and landing are fairly standard. Not so standard was maybe the noise from the crew cabins. After the risk of detection (and complaints) by the crew of The Gate was over, the passengers broke out the drinks and started their multi-week party.\n\nSpoiler\n\n![aXW9ME0.png](https://imgur.com/aXW9ME0.png)\n\n![wipEB5j.png](https://imgur.com/wipEB5j.png)\n\nOne trick the make landing on the landing gear easier is to control from the docking port and set \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to \u0022surface / radial in\u0022, that will tell \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to keep the landing gear downwards. Because I didn\u0027t have any more use for the monopropellant I expended some to slow down the \u0022fall\u0022. Not that it\u0027s needed on Minmus.\n\n![M5CAl0y.png](https://imgur.com/M5CAl0y.png)\n\nOn Minmus everyone was reasonably sober, but most were hung over. So only Julhat took a quick peek out of the airlock, while the others settled for looking out of the windows.\n\n![4OlXgBT.png](https://imgur.com/4OlXgBT.png)\n\nAfter takeoff - and as second part of the triad for newbie training(\\*) - Julhat and her crew left Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E to \u0022orbit the sun\u0022. (And if you think that sound ominous, then you don\u0027t want to know what happened in the crew cabins during that time. But even the youngest crew member was an adult so no harm was done.)\n\n![Px2qcRg.png](https://imgur.com/Px2qcRg.png)\n\nAfter having a good look the darkness of deep space, Julhat turned the shuttle around and headed towards the Mun. The sudden acceleration took a few of the not-really-sober-anymore passengers by surprise, but Claudon - the co-pilot - had foreseen this issue and stocked a large amount of barf-bags, so no lasting harm was done.\n\nBut a fairly wide elliptical orbit was all that the fuel situation allowed. They spent a couple of days in that orbit, allowing the occasionally sober members of the crew a long time to look at the Mun. And while Julhat claimed that they \u0022needed to wait for a good transfer to Kerbin from their current orbit\u0022, she spent a long time on the radio during these days.\n\nSpoiler\n\nGetting back to Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E took more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E than planned. I shouldn\u0027t have left the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E at high-ish speeds in a direction that took Julhat and her crew away from Kerbin when accelerating straight towards Kerbin. In the end it took 300 m/s. More than planned, but not not so much to scrub the mission.\n\n![3TC5AFI.png](https://imgur.com/3TC5AFI.png)\n\n![BmMiypC.png](https://imgur.com/BmMiypC.png)\n\nSpoiler\n\n![YfYNyRa.png](https://imgur.com/YfYNyRa.png)\n\nAs exciting as the return to Kerbin was for those who hadn\u0027t done this before, so routine was it for Julhat and the other experienced Kerbonauts. Yes, the hull got a bit toasty during aerobraking, but nothing that the craft couldn\u0027t handle. And, yes, they needed several trips through the upper atmosphere to shed enough speed, but that\u0027s how you avoid overheating. And if you worry about crashing while gliding to the runway, then rest assured: there was still enough fuel in the tanks to get you out of a sticky situation. (Not that it was needed.)\n\nSpoiler\n\nHigh drag configuration: set control to the inline docking-port and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to \u0022surface / prograde\u0022. That will keep the belly towards the onrushing air for maximum aerobraking.\n\n![tHseemL.png](https://imgur.com/tHseemL.png)\n\nOnce you shed enough speed that you\u0027ll deorbit if you keep the high-drag attitude, you can keep the nose pointed prograde (control from the cockpit) for low drag. This can keep you in orbit long enough until the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E is in a suitable position for landing.\n\nAfter final entry into the atmosphere, adjust the attitude to balance drag and lift to get onto a trajectory to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. (And if all else fails: fire up the RAPIERs and just **fly** there.)\n\n![vB9idrW.png](https://imgur.com/vB9idrW.png)\n\nA fairly uneventful end to a tumultuous trip!\n\n![H42UMka.png](https://imgur.com/H42UMka.png)\n\nBut, was this the end of the trip?\n\nJulhat managed to glide the shuttle down to the landing on the runway, so nobody in the admin building noticed her return. And while orbiting the Mun Julhat had been chatting with her pal Lizlorf on the radio. Lizlorf currently has the thankless duty of crewing the refueling truck on the apron. So she could sneak onto the runway and refuel the shuttle for Julhat and the others.\n\n![Hsz4Y4w.png](https://imgur.com/Hsz4Y4w.png)\n\nAnd under cover of the falling night Julhat and her crew of misfits took to the skies again.\n\n![vLBiF7A.png](https://imgur.com/vLBiF7A.png)\n\nThis time she went straight to the Mun. After waiting some time for the sun to rise at her destination she turned the shuttle for landing.\n\nSpoiler\n\n![L3gkR3O.png](https://imgur.com/L3gkR3O.png)\n\nLanding on the Mun is actually quite tricky. (Took me a few tries.) The shuttle has just enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E for a landing, so you have to brake really early - and watch the 2000 m/s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E from Munar orbit dwindle while doing that...\n\n![iwE7MCQ.png](https://imgur.com/iwE7MCQ.png)\n\nBy now all the high-proof drinks had been consumed. So after landing everybody got out to get a good look at the Munar surface. Julhat had landed next to a monument about alien explorers.

While it is capable of getting me APPA (landing at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E), it cannot dock. The Martian, on the other hand, CAN - and you just saw proof in my latest entry. I hope this clears up any confusion we all may have."},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-14T19:19:56Z","Content":"OK I see, thankyou for explaining.
