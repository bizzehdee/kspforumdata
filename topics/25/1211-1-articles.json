While graphic packs exist, it\u0027s so low on the graphics that it\u0027s merely dots moving about the screen at all times. Yet there is such a level of textual detail that the game engrosses you. Combat reports, descriptions of personalities and appearances, more combat reports, details about engravings and decorations on items, and more combat reports. With just a puff of imagination, the entire thing takes sail into a grand, randomly generated masterpiece of chaos and bloodshed. Of course, it gets interesting when you start using mechanisms. Similar to Minecraft\u0027s insane non-sequential wires and impossible devices, the mechanics available in Dwarf Fortress are unbound by structural or rational limitations, instead only limited by your hard-headed desire to use water logic and infinite pressure plates. This, of course, lends itself to some of the most insane designs imaginable, from flooding chambers, cave-in traps, automatic magma launchers, sequential flooding of trade depots while someone is attempting to trade, and ultimately the dwarfputer, a working calculator that runs entirely inside the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this in mind, the mandate is simple. Be a Dwarf. Do the impossible, be the insane, challenge physics and not only spit in its eye, but bite it in the lips from behind and send the severed part sailing away in an arc! Design something insane, and make it work! Definition of \u0027work\u0027 subject to sudden and violent change, of course. Let\u0027s see your worst designed rocket ever place itself in a perfect orbit! Add more solid boosters! Ditch those parachutes!
