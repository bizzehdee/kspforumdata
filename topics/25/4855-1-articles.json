At Kerbin\\\u0027s orbital altitude plus or minus 84100 km, you\\\u0027re only closing at \u00C2\u00B129 m/s. That amounts to only 1 day per Kerbin year... If you\\\u0027re 2.5 days behind (about 8.5 degrees of angular displacement), it will take you on the order of 260 days to rendevous. Compare that with about 104 days until rendevous if you were to set yourself up in a 13,108,000 km x 13,534,442 km orbit instead.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"semininja","CreatedById":3837,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-04T20:51:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the readers of this thread would be interested in the upcoming updates to the aforementioned orbit calculator...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
