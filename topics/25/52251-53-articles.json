But with refueling this mission can be done much more easily so it\u0027s not as a big achievement as normally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut on the other hand your idea is not bad. So if you don\u0027t go on the novice way to \u0022put a lot of huge fuel tanks and big engines together and it will be done with some refueling anyway\u0022 then this can look good.
