No. Missiles. Only wimpy 50 cals.\n\nSecondly, despite having bone-crushing acceleration, and the maneuverability of an A6M Zero, the AI flies the plane so wildly that it seriously reduces its ability to point itself in the right direction. My 40-ton fighter-bomber, with very obviously sluggish handling, won against this thing in a turning battle. Yes, my freaking 40-ton plane WON a turning battle against that craft.\n\nAlso, the countermeasures and wild flying make it very hard (but not impossible; I did record a few missile hits) to hit with missiles. This would be an advantage if it had weapons with greater range, like missiles. But with the low muzzle velocity of the 50 cals, and the very unstable flying, this thing rarely gets to shoot against other aircraft, let alone hit them.\n\nSorry sasquatch, but you need to make some improvements to that craft if you want it to do well.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-29T08:29:35Z\u0022 title=\u002212/29/2015 08:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by drtricky**"},{"CreatedByName":"MostExcellent","CreatedById":110994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-29T10:02:13Z","Content":"Hello all\n\nI bring updates regarding my tournament\n\n**\u003Cu\u003ETournament Bracket:\u003C/u\u003E**\n\n![ZU5YPsk.png](http://i.imgur.com/ZU5YPsk.png)\n\nI was hoping TBD would be [@ihtoit](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/78942-ihtoit/)\u0027s X-wing but if he does not submit it by the time I run the simulations it will will be [@SasquatchM](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/11888-sasquatchm/)\u0027s Adder Mk3\n\nProps to [@brianjwm](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/156087-brianjwm/) for creating the bracket\n\n**\u003Cu\u003EFormat Clarifications:\u003C/u\u003E**\n\nTo win a match a craft must win 3 rounds against its opponent.

It is fast enough to out-run AIM 120\u0027s if it flies 90 degrees to them and its turn rate is lethal. I may try and fit a Gau gun to it as the .50 cal turrets are good but have some limitations for something like this."}]}
