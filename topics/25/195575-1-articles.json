Three years, if I\u0027m not mistaken. How about another?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLast time, we were allowed to assemble our own payloads. Quite naturally, these tended to be dense, tight, and aerodynamic without a fairing. Now I don\u0027t know about you, but my payloads tend to be rather bulky. So I wonder if it would be alright to provide a dummy payload?
