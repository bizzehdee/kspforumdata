I did make a craft with multiple parts with docking ports so that somebody who has never done docking before could play around with it and learn how to dock the different objects together. This is, however, somewhat moot as anybody who has docked knows that once you are close enough to use RCS only the hard part is over. It\u0027s getting one object close enough to the other to actually target a specific docking port that is the most difficult. I think a stock craft that would be most useful to a beginner is one that could easily get one Kerbal safely to Mun and return home in one go. It is a quite common thing for a new player to get Jebediah stranded on Mun and lobby other players for how to get him home again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"advil","CreatedById":113133,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-14T07:34:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf any of you are interested I created a challenge for the above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85929-Stock-Challenge-To-da-Mun%21?p=1265290#post1265290\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85929-Stock-Challenge-To-da-Mun%21?p=1265290#post1265290\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo da Mun!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"advil","CreatedById":113133,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-14T07:36:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022manni01\u0022 data-cite=\u0022manni01\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have 17 votes in. idk if there will more. should I announce the winner or wait til tuesday? if no reply I will wait.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d say give it until Tuesday, but I\u0027m curious who won now lol\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-14T08:51:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E8, Manni01 \u0022Reusable Adaper Tug MKIII Page 5\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy vote as above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy point of view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/2kkvrw6rm3c0wrm/Book1.xlsx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/2kkvrw6rm3c0wrm/Book1.xlsx\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"advil","CreatedById":113133,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-14T09:02:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sirine\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sirine\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMy vote as above.\u003Cp\u003EMy point of view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/2kkvrw6rm3c0wrm/Book1.xlsx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/2kkvrw6rm3c0wrm/Book1.xlsx\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat was the utility you had in mind by creating this spreadsheet that seems mostly based on your own opinion?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-14T09:14:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022advil\u0022 data-cite=\u0022advil\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat was the utility you had in mind by creating this spreadsheet that seems mostly based on your own opinion?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll previous \u0022Better Stock Crafts Challenge\u0022 do have participants presenting their own ideal on how and why they vote for certain people, and they do put it in spreadsheets, with various \u0027technical data\u0027 base on their own judgement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, you want other to just shut up and vote?
