It seems like most voters aren\u0027t concerned with part count, but I believe it\u0027s important for stock crafts to be very simple and have a small amount of parts. I mean, just look at the already-existing stock crafts. I believe the two ones with the highest part count are the Kerbal X and the Z-MAP Satellite Launch Kit, both at 78 parts.\u003Cbr\u003EWhat\u0027s so important about low part count? Well, for one thing, it allows you to more easily re-create that design. For example, the rover and skycrane is easily able to be reproduced by players and put on their own crafts. Usually you\u0027re not going to do a lot of modifications to the original stock craft - you\u0027ll adapt some techniques it uses to your own designs. For that, low part count is excellent.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapable of a Mun landing and return.\u003C/strong\u003E I think that the way the current Kerbal X is designed isn\u0027t very good for newbies. In the description, all it says is that it has an \u0022optimistic set of landing legs on its upper stage.\u0022 The first place a newbie would want to go is the Mun.

You can have more fuel and more engines and achieve the same delta-V. That\u0027s true. But you can \u003Cem\u003Ealso\u003C/em\u003E have \u003Cem\u003Eless\u003C/em\u003E fuel and \u003Cem\u003Eless\u003C/em\u003E engines - and the same delta-V.

Smaller RCS tanks and using either LV909 or 487S engines would have brought this much higher ranking. Nice looking design with real world rocket feel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Kerbal G - Giggleplex\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELifter waaay too underpowered needs much higher TWR, but despite that it does make it into orbit ok. Could use better engine than poodle. If had better lifter TWR and saved weight by switching poodle for LV909 or 487S would be much better ranked. Looks nice and really does have the Delta Heavy feel about it, like the escape tower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) CROME - Xeldrak\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI absolutely love the lander design (great performer and easy to land) on this but the lifter seems pretty inefficient if needs 5 orange tanks which is way more than anyone else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) sft_flyer - Kerbal Y\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery nice tidy efficient design, not ranked higher though as the last lifter stage with only 1.14 TWR is a bit low and means you need quite a bit of orbiter fuel to get into orbit leaving only just enough to get to Mun and back, beginner might find the lifter design and lack of delta-v a bit frustrating, like the escape tower. Also I prefer stock craft not to have science parts as for use in sandbox too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Deathsoul - Kerbal Z_Z\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally like this design and it was very close to getting my vote. Love the real rocket feel to the lifter and takes off well, like the novel landing leg placement. Loses some credit for Poodle and not a big fan of the oddly placed docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Antbin - KerbalXX\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain another nice looking lifter and with great TWR. Slightly drifts even with SAS on but can be easily brought back, better control once boosters gone. Very smart and efficient lander design that does same as Kerbal X for less. Biggest issue is the last stage burns out too late to be returned to Kerbin but too early to dump into Mun or Minmus.

And Giggleplex77 craft design not only does that but its even better as it hits the altitude where TWR requirement increases rapidly with (\u0026gt;8km) with the end of first stage burn where TWR above 2 is put to good work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI invite the non believers of low TWR to the \u0022Payload Fraction Challenge\u0022 thread, to look on some of the crafts (particularly mine 3stage no asparagus 18,76% payload one \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55615-Payload-Fraction-Challenge?p=770578\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post770578\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd when the update with currency hits you all will wonder why does this kind of low TWR craft are the cheapest way to orbit. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInteresting I\u0027d always got the impression from reading various threads on here that just under TWR of 2 for Kerbin launch was best balance of minimising gravitional vs aerodynamics losses with TWR dropping lower for each successive stage. As long as you stay below terminal velocity I always went by the principle of getting through thick part of atmosphere quickly and with Kerbal G having initial TWR of 1.1-1.2 (if I remember correctly) I assumed it was losing too much to grav losses. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECertainly be interesting to read the payload fraction thread to see why low TWR stages can be efficient. Of top of my head I\u0027m wondering if high TWR saves delta-V but if high TWR translates into more engine mass maybe that means less delta-v (vs grav) but more actual fuel or is losses to grav at low altitude balanced by gains higher up? Maybe totally wrong as just thinking aloud with getting calculator out....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELow TWR means a different ascent profile and big changes in TWR from one stage to the next can be an issue as I found flying sgt_flyers rocket when I hit the last stage the sudden drop in TWR to 1.14 meant I had to pitch up to avoid overtaking the apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy only issue with your post is I now can\u0027t stop trying to imagine a Kerbal Jeremy Clarkson \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E actually you can also hear Jeremy Kerkson asking for moar horsepower/boosters!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-22T17:50:54Z\u0022 title=\u002211/22/2013 05:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Kerolyov\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"antbin","CreatedById":22389,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-22T18:12:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelp, voting looks to be closing up soon - just want to congratulate everyone who entered this BSC - despite the stock craft being not really all that bad, the entries were pretty excellent!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"breakthrough","CreatedById":75359,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-22T18:24:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Carl\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Carl\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGlad to help.

TWR of 2 and resulting flight at terminal velocity was concluded as the most fuel efficient method of vertical atmospheric ascent on unlimited power (actually it was close to 2,1 due to acceleration). To make the craft more fuel efficient, we started taking away engines, so that the deltaV to orbit increases but at the same time deltaV of the particular craft increases even more. At around 1.85 the net deltaV is the largest, resulting in biggest fuel savings. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we reduce the TWR further, by exchanging some of the engine mass to fuel, up to 1,7 TWR the net deltaV change is also positive reducing the total takeoff mass of a rocket with the same payload to a minimum, while burning a little more fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point we could further reduce TWR in pursuit of minimal cost as engines are (and probably will be in next patches) more expensive than fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiggleplex77\u0027s rocket has TWR of 1,18 which is indeed low, and actual payload to orbit isn\u0027t that great but it does fly similarly to how real rockets go (a plus) and will probably be one of the most cost efficient launch platforms of the entries here, when we get actual cost balance sorted out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso can you guess who i voted for \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022antbin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022antbin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWelp, voting looks to be closing up soon - just want to congratulate everyone who entered this BSC - despite the stock craft being not really all that bad, the entries were pretty excellent!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EIndeed \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.
