I have seen a few accomplish this in the old soupmosphere, but flying at high speeds with just the slightest movement throwing you off is a much greater challenge. I myself have gotten inches away, from docking in flight using a prop plane, and I would love to see a few avid pilots accomplish, what I believe is the hardest thing in Kerbal Space program! Below are a few images of me getting close, and I am fluent in the art of formation flying now ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) I used KAX for the propellors, and B9 procedural wings for the nice looks and functionality.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
