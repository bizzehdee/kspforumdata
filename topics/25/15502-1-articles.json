Ed only has 1% of his fuel left since he was advised to keep some in reserve even after the last-ditch attempt to avoid escaping the Munar sphere of influence, so a very close rendezvous will be necessary. It is imperative he is recovered as quickly as possible - a state-of-the-art space suit has preserved his life for 50 days already, and we have reason to believe it will cease to function after a short while.
