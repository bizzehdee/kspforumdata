KK is now patched, so...\n\nHow To:\n\nInstead of back-to-back launches, use KK to build two bases (one runway per plane) about 10km apart. Setup radar installations (on launchpads) at each and link planes to them. From a launch pad halfway between both, launch two rockets with weapon managers, one for each team. The radars pick them up and scrambles their planes. By the time they get anywhere near the rockets, the rockets will be out of power, destroyed or staged into a dead state - they were the starting pistol only.

I was testing my heavy fighter-bomber against a much smaller, lighter, more nimble fighter I designed (which I\u0027m not entering because I designed it in 15 minutes. It wouldn\u0027t feel like a challenge to me if I entered it), and my fighter-bomber won 70% of the battles mainly because its faster climb rate (thanks to it having seven engines compared to the other\u0027s single engine) allowed it to reach the minimum altitude faster and engage sooner with its AIM-120\u0027s (Both planes had a minimum altitude of 900).\n\nThe fighter-bomber shouldn\u0027t have won because due to the dumb AI, it bled a ton of speed when trying to point itself towards the enemy or dodging missiles, and thus bled maneuverability. On the rare occasions the fighters got caught in a turning battle, the smaller fighter held the clear advantage. What this means is that in the beginning, climb rate is a significant factor in the battle. Too significant.\n\nPerhaps instead of having the fighters take off relatively close to each other with the AI turned on, they should be flown a significant distance away (enough so that the AI won\u0027t engage each other when turned on), and then turned towards each other and then have the AI turned on.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 40 minutes ago, Triop said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Ok, bring it i\u0027d say...

It\u0027s only redeeming quality at the moment is its sports car-like acceleration.\n\nIt is a worthy challenger in terms of engine count ![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif \u0022;.;\u0022)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-28T04:06:00Z\u0022 title=\u002212/28/2015 04:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by drtricky**"}]}
