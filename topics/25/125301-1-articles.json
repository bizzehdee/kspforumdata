Since M1 has some grip issues and strange steering I have chosen TR-2L which offer good grip and fast responsiveness (responsivness can be simply edited with car design) (we will have new wheels in 1.1v so it will be interesting) I can simply limit car width so you can\u0026#39;t use very wide cars to keep stability and go without wings for no drag. Key will be to make well balanced and stable car for cornering. With more heavy cars there will be also more fuel and more complexity and creativity with designs (like a real formula k). With all of that a lot of parts can be used so cars won\u0026#39;t look all the same. I think this will add more strategy into play.
