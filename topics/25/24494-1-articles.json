I angled the two extra ion engines up 1 notch, which let the plane fly with no extra input. I think I might be able to use canards instead of the winglets to completely get rid of any infiniglide accusations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI took off using the ion engines at full power, then when I got to the end of the runway, detached them, and pulled up until I got gliding (which happened pretty quickly).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d love to hear if anyone has any suggestions or questions. This is my first challenge attempt, and my first forum post!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ih9EJRN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Ih9EJRN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Rrzd9fH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Rrzd9fH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sandermatt","CreatedById":61813,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-04T13:35:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis looks good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause you like suggestions, my 2 cents how you might get a little further:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you flew in the other direction (270 degrees) you would have about 40% more daylight time, and it seems this was your limiting factor. But be careful, there are mountains that become a problem if you don\u0027t ascend fast enough. If by removing all control surfaces (your low number of them is nice) you cannot turn you could always just drive around using wheels and then start your plane in the desired direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso you could probably save the weight from the battery, the buffer in energy may not be needed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
