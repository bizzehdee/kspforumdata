This make the HS almost dragless, especially at supersonic, as front and rear face of drag cube had been removed. During Eve reentry, it was fuel empty so it slow down fast, won\u0027t explode due to heat. During Eve ascent, the KSP\u0027s shock cone mesh-based heat system (node-attachment-unrelated) will form a cone-shape(probably) region behind the HS and will shield heat for the sharp-nose fairing (sharp-nose fairing means much less drag, but is far easier to overheat), and other parts are not that vulnerable. btw the trajectory is very fine-tuned (rocket phase at least 30 hours of tests, more than 100 quicksaves), by using canard\u002Bstock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E control laws mechanism to be able to affect \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E a little bit, I control the maximum ascent angle (the highest value of angle of velocity vector and horizon) to about 15deg (\u0026lt;14.5 deg result in explosion. the maximum thermal percentage seems to be almost exactly a function of max ascent angle, so it will be safe and won\u0027t explode at all (despite, it will go to 90%\u002B, but indeed it\u0027s under design so no problem).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the way, in the world of Eve \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, actually this is a small design. One of Eve \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s locking properties is KS25, we need 85-100t per 1000kN (85t per KS25 is best for small, clipping-less Eve SSTOs), so any Eve \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E design \u0026lt;85t don\u0027t seem to be good, as small engines don\u0027t have comprehensive performance as good as KS25), Eve \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E mass seem to be 85N-100N tonnes (N is an integer). mine is only 170t \u002B 2xKS25, already minimal design (less than a single Mammoth). And, Eve \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E also have size effect, at a region of, at least, 170-3000t, with top-tier design technique, the larger, the more effective (mainly increase in aero effiency, allow of use for mammoth (reduce 25% engine mass), smaller portion of truly dead mass like landing gear and mining equipments, etc.).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
