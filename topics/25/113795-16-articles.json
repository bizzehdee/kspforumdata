Is there a particular reason the turbojets are restricted to 50% thrust? [edit]Turns out a singular TurboJet has 130 kN of thrust, and the singular F-16 engine has 131.2 kN of thrust. Forcing half throttle here is hardly a good way to display a 5th Gen fighter when its engines can\u0027t compete with a 4th Gen. Thoughts? [/edit]\n\u003E Edit: More questions. Edit: More data to back up the questions.\n\u003E \n\u003E Is there a particular reason droptanks are requested for bonus points? Is it simply because it\u0027s easier to dump fuel for a fight that way? My current plane iteration has an internal capacity of 1610 (8050kg) units of fuel on board, but it\u0027s unreasonable to load it with more than 630 (3150kg) for \u0022local\u0022 work. [edit] In contrast, an F16 carries 2685kg of fuel internally. [/edit]\n\u003E \n\u003E Is there a reason you ask for an operational time versus an operational range? [edit] I believe most fighters are measured in operational range rather than time... [/edit]\n\u003E \n\u003E Sorry for the question bombardment, but I\u0027m just trying to figure out if the jet I made while just goofing about qualifies. That and the operational range is more useful for a multi-role fighter than an operational time.\n\u003E \n\u003E [edit] Another reason for this question bombardment is that I really do want to enter this, as the contest here quite interests me. [/edit]\n\nIt\u0027s all about catering to KSP.\n\nThe rules are supposed to encourage certain choices to limit the weight and flight envelope.\n\nA 100% throttle turbojet is too much, it often ruins airframes when the throttle is held open and produces speeds which are too fast to even compare with real world jets. In KSP it\u0027s just excessive unless you\u0027re going to build an SR-71.\n\nAs for drop tanks, they do extend the range of a fighter so having the capability is important, they tend to take a backseat with the BD armoury version of the challenge, when not using BD armoury they are a means of determining how much armament is possible for a design, even though weapons systems themselves have other constraints like where to put them all.\n\nAlso the operational time rule is just based on the FAR data screen so it\u0027s not that accurate but gives an indication of how viable a fighter it is. 5th gen fighters are multirole so time in the air is a great indicator of operational effectiveness.\n\nEDIT: I\u0027ll add you\u0027re plane to the leaderboard\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/AYOH1pU.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/AYOH1pU.jpg)\n\u003E As a Messerschmitt fanboy, I have to find a way to make this thing reach it\u0027s historical calculated top speed of Mach 2 with a basic jet!

I noticed that if I tried to have the AI take off, it would scrape your engines off. I fixed this by altering the AI\u0027s take-off speed from 70 to 120, which allows it to barely get by without scraping those things off.\n\nI\u0027ve been trying to dogfight it with my plane, but I\u0027ve been having issues with the AI kind of mucking around and not firing missiles, or just being a very bad shot with the vulcans. I was impressed, however, when I shot the left engine off one of the two hornets I pitted against, and it continued to perform admirably, all things considered. I\u0027m looking forward to testing your updated version.\n\nAnd I get what you\u0027re saying about the way engines perform. They\u0027re incredibly undervalued at low speeds, and cascade to ridiculous power at high speeds. They\u0027re also incredibly inefficient...\n\nOh, since you commented that you\u0027re going by FAR standards on the estimated flight time, you may wish to amend the OP to reflect such. Even if the FAR readout comments I have 4\u002B hours of flight time, I rarely get more than 20 or 30 actual minutes, which makes me wonder if it\u0027s calculating on Kerbin time.\n\nI am somewhat curious, though... You want a supercruise with fully-loaded drop tanks; however, that fuel is going to be used getting to supercruise altitude and speed. As an alternative to the exclusive drop-tank bonus fuel rule, might I suggest an alternative option of excess fuel over a set amount, or even a maximum lift mass beyond its dry weight? \u003Csub\u003EAn F-16, for example, has a dry weight of 9.207t, and a maximum lift of 21.772t.\u003C/sub\u003E I mean, if I wanted to really exploit the drop-tank rule, I would have almost 0 fuel in the main craft, and just load up on drop-tanks. That would net me a bonus 1000L\u002B of fuel in drop tank score...\n\nI think I may rework my the Adder a bit to allow for used mods to help conform to what most of you are using (basically getting rid of KAX on the craft, because I only use it for the landing gear), and also exploit Tweakscale a little more to fit more fuel in those drop tanks by shrinking down fuel fuselages."},{"CreatedByName":"Halsfury","CreatedById":54576,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T02:26:43Z","Content":"Yes the hornet\u0027s engines are truly redundant as on the real thing.\n\nWere you facing off against the old version? my advice is that speeds should be kept up so give the AI a 270m/s maximum speed for low altitude (up to 5000m) and crank it up to 320m/s for high altitude dogfighting.\n\nIt will break itself if you allow the AI to operate it in high dynamic pressure modes.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nAlso I have no way of doing much in terms of changing the endurance rules.\n\nAnd the drop tanks being partially empty by the time you reach altitude is ok, the primary reason for the test is to determine how tolerant the aircraft is of having that extra skin friction and wave drag associated with the drop tanks. The weight mainly impacts acceleration and climb rate which are considerations for a real aircraft.\n\nThe rules are rather threadbare but altering them except to ask that you don\u0027t subtract any fuel from your aircraft would be difficult since there are so many submissions scattered across so many pages that I would have to go back and fix each one.\n\nIt would be bloody nice if FAR calculated flight time based on actual fuel in the tank, maybe the solution is simply to ask for delta V readouts and calculate the flight time based on the mass flow rate of the engines at super cruise!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nEDIT: actually I think that from now on it\u0027s best if you do use the mass flow rate and the delta V or the reported amount of fuel to determine flight time\n\nThat actually is quite sound and works just fine with the current rules\n\nAccording to the resources screen, with 1/3rd throttle (super cruise setting) the 2 turbojets on the hornet eat through 0.19 litres per second.\n\nNot including ballast fuel (160 litres) there is 1,016 litres of liquid fuel on board at takeoff\n\n1,016 divided by 0.19 = 5,347.4 seconds\n\n5,347.4 divided by 60 divided once ageing by 60 equals 1.4854 hours or 89 minutes at cruise\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-20T02:42:36Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2015 02:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Halsfury**"},{"CreatedByName":"FourGreenFields","CreatedById":139309,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T12:42:27Z","Content":"Ok, the Heluan HA-300 scored 13.8 points, basic jet, no BD armoury.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I took the liberties of modifying it, as I noticed its area drag was fairly extreme. You had two blisters near the tail planes, which were causing an unpleasant quantity of drag; also, I replaced the nose cone (as you did in the latest update) with the similarly shaped radome, and was able to angle it to minimize drag, bringing it down fairly close to 1. I also moved the AMRAAMs to the wingtips, and loaded two sidewinders each per mount (realistically, they should hold 3, but the game melts them if you do that), which improved payload wave drag. I never bothered to reattach the drop tanks, considering they weren\u0027t useful for dog-fighting.

Don\u0027t want to bother uninstalling FAR just to test this, though.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Just to inform everyone that FAR will update soon, and some crucial things will change, like critical mach speed being properly implemented and some other stuff.\n\u003E If you really know what you are doing I recommend you to grab the dev version now.\n\nThanks for the update! I might have to do that, and see how stuff is.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-21T18:20:20Z\u0022 title=\u002208/21/2015 06:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheHengeProphet**"},{"CreatedByName":"Halsfury","CreatedById":54576,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-21T20:27:07Z","Content":"I Figured out the laser targeting system eventually, I sort of couldn\u0027t help but notice as my missiles flew right past an AAA cannon emplacement.\n\nWhat I haven\u0027t figured out yet is HARM missiles, I think that a version of the hornet with electronic warfare missiles would be much more useful but I can\u0027t get a lock on the smaller track and scan radar I\u0027ve been using on my air defence platforms\n\nIn short I would like a wild weasel F-18\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Weasel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Weasel)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-21T20:29:15Z\u0022 title=\u002208/21/2015 08:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Halsfury**"},{"CreatedByName":"Scoundrel","CreatedById":15369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-21T21:27:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E IWhat I haven\u0027t figured out yet is HARM missiles, I think that a version of the hornet with electronic warfare missiles would be much more useful but I can\u0027t get a lock on the smaller track and scan radar I\u0027ve been using on my air defence platforms\n\nOpen up BDA manager window, select modules, select Radar Warning Receiver and then click on the illuminating radar (your SAM) on the threat display.
