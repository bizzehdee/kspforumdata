(I won\u0027t be entering the challenge.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI built a shuttle (actually, a couple; explanation upcoming) that launches quite well. I spent time tweaking it for the major stages of launch: initial launch, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E burnout \u0026gt; SSME-only phase, orbital insertion. In a nutshell, it flew as intended. I just needed to control pitch-over, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E, and flipping over before dumping the ET. For the most part, it was far more stable during launch than I originally thought I could get it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote\u00A0I mentioned stable launching. Recovery is a whole other matter for some reason. I seem to be facing either trans-/supersonic instability (does stock aero do this?) or I\u0027m facing some horrible body lift issues with the MK3 design I\u0027m using while at high speeds. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E is a\u00A0good distance behind the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E and DCoM (per RCSBuildAid). However, I did notice during a few re-entry tests with F12 on that the MK3 bodies were generating a lot of body lift. Re-entry is usually fine if I keep a reasonable \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E, but if I hit a critical angle of some sort, it flips and either flies backwards or becomes uncontrollable. Nothing I do helps (if anything, making it worse) until I hit lower speeds. Typically this is under 200m/s or so. I\u0027ve tried to replicate this, but I apparently need to go stupidly fast in relatively thin atmosphere for this to kick in. (Thin enough that natural \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E won\u0027t\u00A0affect\u00A0changes in\u00A0prograde fast enough, but still thick enough that my control surfaces still work and create body lift on the MK3 parts.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave any of you had to design around/take into account body lift issues with shuttle designs? I\u0027m more used to Mk2 designs where the \u0022body\u0022 lift is already accounted for in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E (since MK2 bodies are treated as wings.) I think the body lift at high speeds is screwing me over whenever I try to do any maneuvers at those speeds for my MK3 design. (Honestly, this is the first time I\u0027ve bothered this much with a MK3 design.) The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E is about a small MK3 fuel tank behind the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E. My re-entry tests have been with mostly full tanks coming back down. I\u0027m suspecting the body lift is enough to shift the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E ahead of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E. (Relevant parts ahead of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E are just a large MK3 Cargo Bay, a small MK3 Cargo Bay, and the MK3 cockpit. Not much, really.) F12 showed those parts generating some absurd body lift during a few of my tests, IIRC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll post pics of the design if you think it might help... Or you\u0027re just curious what kind of design I made. I have a modded install. I started with a mostly stock design. The exceptions were the ET (FuelTankPlus parts to mimic the actual STS ET) and separation motors (from BlueDogDesign). It\u0027s got more modded as I iterated the design: more FTP tanks and a switch to OPT\u00A0wings. (The switch in wings was to test my instability problems... That,\u00A0plus extra fuel and lift.) I only have the most recent design though. I wasn\u0027t saving versions, unfortunately.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"53miner53","CreatedById":172955,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-03T00:33:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222973657\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022156151\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221488500389\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022139783\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022StahnAileron\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 minutes ago, StahnAileron said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote\u00A0I mentioned stable launching.
