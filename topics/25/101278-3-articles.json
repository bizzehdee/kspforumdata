For ATO, get to orbit, and then land at KSC (so you\u0027ll be going around Kerbin at least once). You are also welcome to leave it up there and go for a docking with any fuel pod in orbit to complete the other goals in the mission concurrently. But ATO means abort to orbit... so you have to at least make it to orbit as part of misssion. What you do after that is up to you, either continue the mission and then land on the africa land mass or ksc (if going for pilot or commander), or make preparations to land back at the africa land mass or KSC when you come around again.\n\n2. if you can use a stock solution, go for it! No restrictions there. Be as creative as you wish. The sat does have to be in the bay and survive landing at KSC or KSC Island though if you\u0027re intending to capture it and return it for the Commander rating. Good luck! I look forward to what you can come up with!"},{"CreatedByName":"kookoo_gr","CreatedById":57720,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T18:30:09Z","Content":"thanks i goggled ATO and i did it, also completed the refuel pod recovery at commander level, expect pics tomorrow"},{"CreatedByName":"willshmo258","CreatedById":122304,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T19:29:56Z","Content":"It\u0027s me again, I just got the badges, there awesome.

If anyone can design a more optimal space shuttle, let me know. I intended to create a good looking space shuttle for use on a private gaming multiplayer server with friends, and didn\u0027t expect it to fly so well. But in short, I figured out the design principles early and committed to them, and wow. Simple rule of shuttle design? Don\u0027t design it empty. Build it, test it, and balance it with a fully loaded cargo bay and whistles. Your maximum rating for launch, and maximum rating for landing. Since if you can make it fly heavy, then flying empty is already built in.\n\nAnd yes in addition to joining the STS Astronaut Corps, and earning all badges all the way up to a Commander I rating, you have secured a 2nd place finish to the Hall of Fame! Congrats Commander! These are yours:\n\n![fagZP7S.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/fagZP7S.jpg)![JfuP7ZU.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/JfuP7ZU.jpg)![Rvs3vgQ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Rvs3vgQ.jpg)![sE1QW9Q.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/sE1QW9Q.jpg)![Gm9RLVR.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Gm9RLVR.jpg)![EynVoXa.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/EynVoXa.jpg)![WUvoQpP.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/WUvoQpP.jpg)\n\nAwesome pics, awesome missions! \n\nFor RTLS with STS Fuel Pod, I ditch the ET early and then fly the shuttle in using the fuel pod\u0027s fuel to fuel the SSMEs. The STS-4 flies very well as a space plane in her own right. Just give her some fuel and watch her go. Go easy on the throttle though or shutdown the top SSME.\n\nEpic pictures!\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s me again, I just got the badges, there awesome.
