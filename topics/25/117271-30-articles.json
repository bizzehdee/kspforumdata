Who crashes first is stupid and arbitrary. I originally counted a plane dead for these purposes (though it can still shoot!) if it was no longer under powered, controlled flight. Thus, a mid air collision of the last two planes is rightly a draw, not a result because the wreckage of one plane hit the VAB earlier than the other which hit the ground.\n\nTop Gun AI was not originally a 1v1 format, it was 2v2. Allowing dissimilar planes is a nice extension of that, though the requirement of a radome misses the opportunity of a slow, radome equipped spotter scout and a radomeless lead strike plane. Now radomes have had their mass reduced, it likely doesn\u0027t matter, always worth having.\n\nI\u0027m presuming the start positions of 100m apart means back to back launches?

Turrets rotation values should be set to 0/0/0 such that they can not rotate. I apologize for previous confusion. \n\n3. I will use the latest version of BDArmory and update it if a new version is released while the tournament is in progress, legacy targeting will be turned off for this tournament. \n\n4. If you want me to do anything to the plane, such as turning the RCS on or slaving the turrets before it launches, then describe as much in your submission and I will do so. \n\n**I should have mentioned this in the tournament rules but it slipped my mind. All submitted planes should have \u0022Activate AI\u0022 bound to the 0 action group. To launch the planes, I will put them in position, activate and adjust guard mode, set teams, press space until all stages have been fired, and then I will press the 0 key, bracket to the next plane, press 0 and repeat until all planes have launched. I will edit the planes already submitted to be in compliance with this, as it is my fault for not posting it in the original tournament rules.** \n\n\u003E \n\u003E I recommend changing the conditions for draws. Who crashes first is stupid and arbitrary. I originally counted a plane dead for these purposes (though it can still shoot!) if it was no longer under powered, controlled flight. Thus, a mid air collision of the last two planes is rightly a draw, not a result because the wreckage of one plane hit the VAB earlier than the other which hit the ground.\n\u003E Top Gun AI was not originally a 1v1 format, it was 2v2. Allowing dissimilar planes is a nice extension of that, though the requirement of a radome misses the opportunity of a slow, radome equipped spotter scout and a radomeless lead strike plane. Now radomes have had their mass reduced, it likely doesn\u0027t matter, always worth having.\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m presuming the start positions of 100m apart means back to back launches? This is preferable to parallel launches, which make for farcical mismatches.\n\n**The rules are solidified, as sign-ups have already begun. There will be no rule changes from this point forward. If I failed to mention something, such as the 0 key launch function, I will personally edit the planes myself to be in compliance with the rule I failed to mention. As a result, your suggestions regarding the rules for draws will be disregarded for THIS tournament. I will take them into consideration for the next tournament I run.** The pairs will start back to back, with planes of the same team side to side. So team A\u0027s first plane will have team A\u0027s second plane to its right, and team B\u0027s second and first planes behind it.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E **AWIMBAWE**\n\u003E Okay I\u0027m locked in, please read the description to my cx-11 hubris... and play nice with the rules ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://kerbalx.com/crafts/4988/edit](http://kerbalx.com/crafts/4988/edit)\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://kerbalx.com/crafts/5007/edit](http://kerbalx.com/crafts/5007/edit)\n\u003E \n\u003E please do record this! i wanna see how hard i fail ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E - - - Updated - - -\n\u003E \n\u003E I know its early to be asking, but is anyone planning on running a 1 craft top gun ai tourney after this top wing one? i have one hell of a design... just need the rules to be 155 part limit ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nWhen I clicked the link to your craft files, I received this error. \n\n[http://imgur.com/zZRmlgV](http://imgur.com/zZRmlgV) \n\nI\u0027m not familiar with KerbalX, but I think you set the permissions for who can access the craft incorrectly.

With unlocked turrets your enemy can be behind you and you\u0027d be able to kill them. Totally fake in a Top Gun fighter plane, but on a bomber it would be fine.\n\nIIRC, we agreed on a \u002B2 / -2 / 4 degrees total yaw allowable movement on the rotatable turrets. This compensated for the plane\u0027s bouncing and vibration but they still required decent aiming on the plane\u0027s part.\n\nIn my personal experience any movement beyond 5 degrees in any direction. and you might as well toss the missiles away."}]}
