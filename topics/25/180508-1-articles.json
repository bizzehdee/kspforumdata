Apparently the contract to return or transmit science data from the surface of Laythe was about to expire in eight Kerbin years, and his return craft was stuck in low Laythe orbit with a critical amount of delta-v remaining. While a direct transfer from Jool to Kerbin was possible, the Kerbin re-entry speed would exceed 6 km/s and fry Ribfrod to a crisp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe weren\u0027t able to get the save file because he was on the Console edition.
