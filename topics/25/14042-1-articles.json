Thus, a new challenge is born.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere, we will focus primarily on the various methods of transitioning from Munar Intercept to Descent. Is it more efficient to go directly into the descent phase after entering the Mun\\\u0027s Sphere of Influence (SOI)? Or perhaps it will save more fuel to set up a bi-elliptic transfer into a low-Mun orbit before beginning your descent. There are plenty of options to explore, but only one will prove to be Optimal. I\\\u0027m sure some of you have done the math, and that\\\u0027s wonderful for theory but let\\\u0027s see how it works in practice. As always, be encouraged to discuss that math (even though I won\\\u0027t understand most of it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E), and any theories you may have for saving those precious fuel units. Even though this is framed as a challenge, the true goal is a greater understanding about how to get the most from our rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that, we come to the substance of our challenge. The goal will be to insert into a 3km by 3km orbit around the Mun. Success will be measured by how little fuel is used during this phase. To create the scenario, I have taken the original stock lander from the Optimal Descent (to theMun) challenge and placed it on a free-return trajectory through the Mun\\\u0027s SOI with a Pe of just under 1 million meters. This was chosen to allow a subsequent return to Kerbin with a Pe of roughly 30,000m (a safe re-entry altitude) and thus simulate a more realistic flight plan. You begin the challenge at the not-quite-half-way point, right after I had performed the Mid-Course Correction1 burn with fuel leftover from the Trans-Munar Injection stage. As with the previous challenge, the lander must be activated with [spacebar] as my proof to you that the lander starts with 100% fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1246.photobucket.com/albums/gg615/Tarmendel/My%20Mun%20Landing%20Challenge/MunChallengeSetup.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MunChallengeSetup.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those of you who did not participate in Optimal Descent, and are unfamiliar with how to use the attached persistance files, a brief explaination: Simply move your existing persistance file (found in the \u0027KSP/saves/default\u0027 folder) to another location for easy recovery, download mine and place it where yours was.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpon starting the challenge, you are free to use whatever method you desire to reach the designated orbit.
