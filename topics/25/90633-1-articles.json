It does not matter in what tank or configuration, just get the fuel up there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E The total cost of a flight must be less than 80.000 kerbucks, including fuel. I managed to get under 50k but I know that\u0027s hard to achieve so 80k should be an easier goal for everyone. To clarify, \u0022flight cost\u0022 means how much kerbucks are lost for a single orbital delivery (including the delivered fuel itself), so if you\u0027re recovering your rocket, you\u0027re only paying for the fuel and boosters or whatever else you\u0027re using up. In my case, the Hercules craft costs 500k but the vast majority of it is recoverable and the flight and fuel itself only costs roughly below 50k.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec) You are only allowed to use stock parts and no other mods except MechJeb and FlightEngineer (or other mods that do not provide any technical advantage but will help make your development and rocket flight easier). Obviously also no mods that modify part costs \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ed) It does not matter what means you use to achieve the previous goals. Recoverable rocket, disposable rocket, space plane, whatever you want to do, the goal is all about costs, load the required fuel, and keep the costs as low as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and it must be done in a single flight!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my entry to the challenge: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://goo.gl/y1x2HY\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://goo.gl/y1x2HY\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd a video with a not-so-great commentary \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/9-JjdscfXwI?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-18T14:29:43Z\u0022 title=\u002211/18/2014 02:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by GoodGameHunter\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-18T14:58:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ET-80 (it has it\u0027s name because it\u0027s just a Kerbodyne tank on top of my generic 80t lifter):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.schnobs.de/tanker/T-80.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://ksp.schnobs.de/tanker/thumbs/T-80_03.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022T-80_03.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(click for gallery)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E208 parts, ~15Min to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E369k funds to launch, 357k funds recovered, for ~1.4 Kerbodyne tanks worth of fuel delivered.

Getting the same amount of air from any of the radial intakes will definitely require more than two parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-19T09:10:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECost after recovery on a large (\u0026gt; orange tank) spaceplane tanker is about \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A16,000.
