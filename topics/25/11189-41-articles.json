Is that right? So it also earns an admirable Kosmokerbal Commendation.\n\nI am sorry if it seems pedantic. To explain, the point about decoupling is that the K-Prize is about comparing spaceplanes. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Rules\n\u003E 1. The craft may not lose any parts in flight, **no decoupling allowed.** \n\u003E \n\u003E 2. The craft must lift off horizontally, reach orbit (PE \u003E 70,000m) and land intact ready for \u0027refuelling\u0027.\n\u003E \n\u003E 3. All fuel tanks, wings (lift generators) and engine parts must be stock, for fairness. \n\u003E \n\u003E Provisos to rule 1.\n\u003E \n\u003E **A.** Payloads may decouple from the craft providing all payload tanks are full on decoupling and **any thrust generators on the payload were not used prior to decoupling**. \n\u003E \n\u003E **B.** Docking is permitted providing no fuel is transferred (net per fuel type) into the K-Prize craft (it can be transferred out). Crew transfers are permitted.\n\nDecoupling parts is explicitly not allowed in the challenge rules because it is about comparing reusable ships and decoupling is only recognised under clear provisos for payload delivery and this is also the basis for crew transfers to control seats.\n\nThe detachable section which landed on Tylo does not qualify as a payload as it provides thrust for the main ship, but it decoupled and left half the ship behind. There are precedents for this, people have made capsules into rovers which decoupled and roved then rejoined the ship. The best option IMHO (without destroying the K-Prize rules) was to accept the lander as a flying rover and not disqualify the mission. The K-Prize does not have a category for that, I am happy to hear other peoples opinions on that. \n\nSirine, Albatross is definitely a K-Prize winner and WafflesToo said he preferred if only K-Prize winners use the badge.
