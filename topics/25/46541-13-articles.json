Datum level pressure has not changed, but the rate of pressure drop with increasing altitude is much less. The game also now calculates density as a function of pressure, temperature, and molecular weight, unlike before when it was simply a function of pressure. At low altitudes the density of Duna air is less than pre-1.0; however, at high altitudes it is much greater. At the datum level, Duna air is about half as dense as before, at 3000 m it\u0027s about the same, and at 6000 m it\u0027s about twice as dense. By the time we get to 15000 m, the air is more the 10 times denser than v0.90.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess this means that flying with FAR will be easier, too.
