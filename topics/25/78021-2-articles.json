On Some flights I got the total cost to be $900, but the problem is trying to use this on Laythe. While that much fuel isn\u0027t a problem from kerbin surface, the amount of fuel needed to get that much extra fuel and have everything returned is enormous. It would take two of the largest NASA tanks if I try to add more then 1 nuclear engine to reduce the time from 2 hours and that would only reduce it to 1 hour 30 minute burn time. Getting that much fuel into orbit using my fuel version of my SSTO would take donzens of trips. So what do you guys think would be the best solution, should I make a ion SSTO for Laythe?
