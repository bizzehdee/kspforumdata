Try to get the lowest score where the score is defined as:\n\nScore = date\\_of\\_completion \\* number\\_of\\_missions\\_to\\_completion\n\nSo, finishing soon is good. Finishing with fewer missions is even better. A \u0027mission\u0027 is defined as any time that you hit the \u0027launch\u0027 button -- so even if you just cruise around KSC, that counts as a mission. Do fewer rather than more.\n\nNo part mods, but information and autopilot mods are allowed. Reverts, loads, and saves are encouraged. This is a strategic challenge, not a piloting challenge per se.\n\nScoreboard:\n\n- 4.61 -- Jasonden\n- 6.4315 -- SkyRender\n- 10.73 -- Jasonden\n- \n- \n\nAs a scoring example, consider my demonstration entry below.

Happy now?\n\n![val5_24.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_24.jpg)\n\n And yes, I did do that mid-second-flight. Why not?\n\n![val5_25.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_25.jpg)\n\n Lookin\u0027 good, Jeb! But you are not the one who is going to benefit from this challenge. Oh no.\n\n![val5_26.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_26.jpg)\n\n Launch #3 is going to the Mun. And it is doing it with only 30 parts. AND it\u0027s leaving a satellite there. It\u0027s not landing, though. If you\u0027re wondering how I have a Terrier on there, it\u0027s because contracts are awesome for jumping the tech tree queue.\n\n![val5_27.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_27.jpg)\n\n Never neglect contracts mid-mission. You can get some seriously powerful ones without any real effort!\n\n![val5_28.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_28.jpg)\n\n![val5_29.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_29.jpg)\n\n Two more upgrades from funds earned mid-mission. And not a moment too soon for the tracking station!\n\n![val5_30.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_30.jpg)\n\n Long story short: the Mun mission went off without a hitch. It got into Munar orbit, deposited the probe, and got back to Kerbin. There was never the slightest bit of concern about its success.\n\n![val5_31.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_31.jpg)\n\n It didn\u0027t get me quite enough science and funds for my tastes, but that probe let me milk the Mun for both so I could upgrade the VAB and launchpad AND get the last critical tech tree node for mission #4.\n\n![val5_32.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_32.jpg)\n\n That being the mini docking port, of course.\n\n![val5_33.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_33.jpg)\n\n This is actually one iteration before the one I used. Only a minor change was made to it, and it\u0027s blatantly obvious in the next shot.\n\n![val5_34.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_34.jpg)\n\n I added a few side-tanks to the middle transfer stage! This thing is a true pain to get into orbit; don\u0027t try it at home, kids!\n\n![val5_35.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_35.jpg)\n\n Once it\u0027s all stable-like, Bob Kerman is off to the Mun in his mini-booster!\n\n![val5_36.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_36.jpg)\n\n The trip was absolutely routine. I can\u0027t think of anything to say about it.\n\n![val5_37.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_37.jpg)\n\n Since my ships have no RCS, I had to dock with rockets. Which I did no problem, because I am just that good.\n\n![val5_38.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_38.jpg)\n\n A quick hop, skip and jump later, and Bob\u0027s off to Minmus.\n\n![val5_39.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_39.jpg)\n\n Again, totally routine. I\u0027ve landed there probably over a hundred times by now.\n\n![val5_40.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_40.jpg)\n\n Then it\u0027s back to Minmus orbit to steal as much fuel as possible from that little booster and hop back down to low Kerbin orbit. The booster stage can stay around Minmus, its remaining fuel is entirely unnecessary for this mission.\n\n![val5_41.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_41.jpg)\n\n I love aerobraking. It\u0027s such a fun challenge, and the new aerodynamic model makes it very easy to control how much speed you bleed off each pass.\n\n![val5_42.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_42.jpg)\n\n Okay, let\u0027s get this show on the road. Time to get to the meat and potatoes of this mission!\n\n![val5_43.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_43.jpg)\n\n Off to Duna! The launch stage engine (which was again \u0022procured\u0022 via contracts ahead of the tech tree) gets about the first 300m/s of the burn done, but the rest is good old-fashioned slow burning.\n\n![val5_44.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_44.jpg)\n\n Arrival is punctuated by a quick aerocapture... where a few solar panels, two batteries, and a landing leg blow up. I decided to keep that capture anyway, because you know what? I\u0027m more than good enough to keep going after a trivial loss like that!\n\n![val5_45.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_45.jpg)\n\n Landing on Duna can be interesting. Parachutes work better than you\u0027d think, but set their deployment altitude to 1500 if you want them to be at peak effectiveness!\n\n![val5_46.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_46.jpg)\n\n The plaque says it all, really.\n\n![val5_01.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_01.jpg)\n\n From there, it was back to Duna orbit (running on fumes by the time I docked with the transfer stage!), refuel, and off to Ike!\n\n![val5_02.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_02.jpg)\n\n Ike was swiftly liked.\n\n![val5_03.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_03.jpg)\n\n I just wanted to say that this was one damn good aerobraking. Have I mentioned yet how much I love 1.0 aerodynamics?\n\n![val5_04.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_04.jpg)\n\n And with that, it\u0027s off we go to Eve!\n\n![val5_05.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_05.jpg)\n\n The first transfer stage was spent on the way, and the second got a bit of use, but no worries; we\u0027ve got plenty of fuel to spare. Also, two more solar panels blew up during Eve capture. Acceptable losses.\n\n![val5_06.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_06.jpg)\n\n Gilly is silly, and so easy to reach and land on. Bob wouldn\u0027t even deign to look at the camera, he was so insulted at how easy that was.\n\n![val5_07.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_07.jpg)\n\n Back to low Eve orbit. Why low Eve orbit, you ask? Because Eve\u0027s gravity well is so massive that the last thing you want to do is not take advantage of it on the way out of the system!\n\n![val5_08.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_08.jpg)\n\n Eve\u0027s atmosphere has a very narrow scale height, so it took 5 (!) passes to get down to a 145x145 orbit. But it was worth the effort, and there was no time crunch to speak of.\n\n![val5_09.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_09.jpg)\n\n At last, back to Kerbin!\n\n![val5_10.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_10.jpg)\n\n The transfer stage ran out mid-flight from Eve, but that\u0027s fine. I also had to do some course correction on the way home, which was also fine.\n\n![val5_11.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_11.jpg)\n\n Now there\u0027s a welcome sight after so long...\n\n![val5_12.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_12.jpg)\n\n Aerocapture almost managed to break something, but came just short. I had to burn to finish the capture, but that\u0027s fine; it let me put my orbit almost perfectly at a typical Mun return height, which I know how to handle very easily.\n\n![val5_13.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_13.jpg)\n\n May as well burn off that fuel while we can, it\u0027s not gonna do anyone any good at this point!\n\n![val5_14.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_14.jpg)\n\n It\u0027s smooth sailing from here. I didn\u0027t even need that heatshield!\n\n![val5_15.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_15.jpg)\n\n Splashdown! Bob Kerman is home.\n\n![val5_16.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_16.jpg)\n\n And he brought a veritable bounty with him! Overall that massive trip was worth 8785 science or so, nothing to sneeze at.\n\n![val5_17.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/val5_17.jpg)\n\n And there you have it! Bob Kerman, level 5.
