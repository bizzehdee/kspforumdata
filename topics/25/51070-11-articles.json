It only gets worse as the tanks drain. This makes even non-aerobatic maneuvering extremely difficult. For example, trying to yaw the plane results in heavy roll, and pitching the plane results in yaw. It\u0027s just not stable with the current mass and lift distribution.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe proper way to pitch-balance a plane is to give a control surface (canard or elevator) one degree of nose-pitch-up, \u003Cstrong\u003Ethen\u003C/strong\u003E line up the plane\u0027s CoM and CoG and tune it for neutral handling on takeoff. That way the plane is self-stabilizing - the control surface\u0027s extra angle of attack is the thing holding the nose up. If you get too much angle of attack (\u0026gt;20 degrees) and are about to loop, the control surface will lose lift first and (hopefully) let the nose fall back to neutral.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe yaw-roll coupling comes from wings that flex up \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihedral_(aircraft)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E(dihedral)\u003C/a\u003E or from swept wings. With KSP\u0027s lift model, wings only make lift from the airflow perpendicular to them. Try it with some of the square Wing Connector boards - rotate them 90 degrees and they will not produce any lift in forward flight. So if you sweep wings back, then yawing your plane will make a lift imbalance - the wing that\u0027s now more perpendicular to the airstream will make more lift. The plane will roll \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_yaw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eopposite to the direction of yaw\u003C/a\u003E... very destabilizing!
