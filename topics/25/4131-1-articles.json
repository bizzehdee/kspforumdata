In both cases, the burn would start the instant that the centre of the Mun\\\u0027s disk is on the horizon, and would use only 33% throttle. All of this is critical because the starting fuel mass, throttle setting, starting altitude and TMI burn location affect the rate of acceleration and the resulting trajectory\\\u0027s orientation relative to the Mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=4575.0;attach=7710;image\u0022 alt=\u0022index.php?action=dlattach;topic=4575.0;attach=7710;image\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you were to nail the 89.4 second burn, you\\\u0027d expect to end up in a 153.3 km x 13550 km orbit that would set you up for a 240 km high Munar periapsis once you transitioned into the Mun\\\u0027s SOI. Your return trajectory would intercept Kerbin\\\u0027s atmosphere (I\\\u0027m defining the atmospheric boundary somewhat arbitrarily as 48 km) with an angle of 21 degrees below the horizon. If you keep your heading centred in the prograde recticle throughout the TMI burn, your post TMI burn speed should be 2971.5 m/s at an altitude of 159.1 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilar precision flying the 89.3 second burn would find you in a 153.3 km x 13280 km orbit, set up for a 189 km high Munar periapsis. In this case though, your return trajectory would only take you within 112 km of Kerbin. MECO would be at 2970.2 m/s. That\\\u0027s a difference of only 1.3 m/s between the two cases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve used the numerical model that I used for these calculations to plan four different missions (my Kerballo 8, 10 and 11, plus a mission to geo-synchronous orbit directly over the KSC), and I\\\u0027ve found it to be accurate. The main limitation is my flying ability. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone wants to try flying these trajectories, I\\\u0027d recommend setting your throttle to 33% before activating the TMI stage. That way you get the throttle setting you need just by hitting the space bar. I\\\u0027d also recommend retarding the throttle at 2965 m/s in the 89.3 second burn case and at 2966 m/s in the 89.4 second burn case. By the time you get the throttle down, you\\\u0027ll be within a m/s or two of the intended speed. I usually trim my orbit post-TMI burn using the RCS. It usually doesn\\\u0027t require more than a couple of m/s delta V to achieve the correct apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ll try flying these profiles myself too, but I probably won\\\u0027t have time for a couple of weeks.

Not only because the Mun and Kerbin\\\u0027s gravity do slightly affect the spacecraft whether it is inside or outside the the Munar SOI (the SOI only defines the region where one body\\\u0027s gravity dominates), but also because there\\\u0027s a notable inconsitency in the Mun\\\u0027s orbital speed in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is an equation that calculates the speed of a satellite of significant mass orbiting its parent body in the restricted circular three body case.

I\\\u0027ve found that you end up in a slightly different location when orbits are propagated normally vs. when warping on rails. I have a sneaking suspicion that there\\\u0027s a numerical imprecision bug in KSP or one of its supporting libraries because large orbits seem to \u0027grow\u0027 slightly while propagating in 1x or 2x warp. A tiny imprecision the forces acting on the spacecraft could explain this. As I understand it, no forces act on the spacecraft while warping at 5x or above. But I digress once again... The fact of the matter is that the game\\\u0027s physics are only so precise, there is a slight difference if you use warp or not, so I stuck to one option: That of not using warp. It worked out and my Kerbals made it home after making a lap of the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are my screen shots:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LytLQh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022LytLQh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nsjTnh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nsjTnh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rMbIUh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rMbIUh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I\\\u0027d scream too!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9QUyFh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229QUyFh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOutbound:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rYpC1h.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rYpC1h.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMunar flyby:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jQnv0h.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jQnv0h.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReturn:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sTYWSh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sTYWSh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPredicted as 278.5 km at TMI\u002B 5:34 (actual 288.19 km at TMI\u002B5:30) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZFHdj.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ZFHdj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbol, Kerbin, Mun\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HGLuh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HGLuh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPredicted at TMI\u002B 11:23 (actual at TMI\u002B11:24)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XW2WE.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022XW2WE.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9n05Oh.png\u0022 alt=\u00229n05Oh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETaking inspiration from F.
