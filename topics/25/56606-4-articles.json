With less then full throttle the plane drops out of the sky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut even takeoff was non-trivial with the Gnat. The front landing gear was so much higher than the rear that the plane was at 10* AoA while taxiing. This caused serious instability as the plane accelerated, which lead to a roll over crash every time. The only way to manage takeoff was to constantly pitch up, which provided an even down force that somehow stabilized the plane until it got to the end of the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll update this post as I test more planes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-27T02:52:38Z\u0022 title=\u002212/27/2013 02:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by XolotlLoki\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T01:39:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022XolotlLoki\u0022 data-cite=\u0022XolotlLoki\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENow that I\u0027ve posted my entry, I\u0027m starting to review the others, beginning with the leaders. \u003Cp\u003EThe link for the #1 entry does not work, so I cannot test that: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4z...it?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4z...it?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E (probably a copypasta problem with the ...).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe link for #2 did work, and I was able to open the .craft file.

The numerical scoring gives a very different experience from the BSC challenges; it\u0027s easier to optimize for the win, though at the risk of losing the intangible attributes. That\u0027s why I\u0027m focusing on simple takeoff/manuever/landing tests. Basically, I takeoff, do some form of cuban-8 to get back to the runway, then land. Then I do it again, but run the engine in rocket mode to drain the oxidizer and most of the fuel before landing. I do the full tank landing with full throttle, but try to do the empty tank landing with no throttle. This simulates both a launch abort and also a return from orbit, which are the only real use cases for SSTO landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the fixed link, I was able to test the current #1, goobd0g\u0027s StarFighter. Though similar to The Gnat in basic structure, it was a much more pleasant plane to fly. The front gear height differential was very modest, only giving about 3* up attitude on the runway. This allowed a normal takeoff, though the front placement of the rear gear allowed over-rotation and tailstrike if you are careless. I even managed a powered landing with full fuel tanks, in spite of the 15* up attitude necessary to maintain level flight. I was unable, however, to land unpowered with empty tanks. There just isn\u0027t enough lift in the wings. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, StarFighter is an excellent implemetation of the mini-wing design, and well deserves its first place.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tntristan12","CreatedById":7005,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T07:46:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/62953-Crew-to-Orbit-Transfer-Shuttle-%28COTS%29-Mk-IV-d4-M\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s my entry!\u003C/a\u003E 91 parts; 33.15 tonnes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Derp.

The large delta wing and widely spaced gear made takeoff and powered landing relatively easy, and there wasn\u0027t too much runway AoA (maybe 3*). However, the lack of a tailfin (and hence yaw control) made unpowered landing difficult, and I was unable to do the last second corrections necessary to land on the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EXR-5SB was actually very pleasant to fly. The only real problem was the wide wings and narrowly spaced gear, which caused several wing strikes during powered landing. It used the same V-tail as my Fly, which provides a good balance of low part count and aerodynamic control. It did have a somewhat large runway AoA (like 8*), but this didn\u0027t interfere with takeoff or landing; it allowed takeoff rotation before the end of the runway, which is not common.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext I tried to download Slugywug\u0027s Minimal SSTO, but the link 404\u0027d. Darren9\u0027s gRape\u0027r downloaded, but it didn\u0027t include a cockpit or a remote pod, so no way to control it. I skipped Col_Jessep\u0027s second entry, and went on to Xeldrak\u0027s CRAP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECRAP was a very good mini-wing design. The X-tail was a nice touch, and gave a surprising amount of lift, which most mini-wing designs lack utterly. This allowed full-tank powered landing with only 1/3 throttle, which no other mini-wing could do. However, the X-tail had one major drawback; the lower two fins were dangerously close to the ground, and broke off in almost all of my landing attempts. This was made worse by the excellent roll control they provided, which made it difficult to stay exactly roll-neutral during landing approach. And when I did manage a perfect touchdown (after 5 tries), applying the brakes made the plane front-flip and crash. Still not sure why that happened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI skipped ABalazs\u0027 second plane, and SkyRender\u0027s RCS-free plane. I did test Hodo\u0027s X-152A and Liowen\u0027s Tadpole MK1R. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EX-152A was in many respects a nice plane. However, the large canard caused unstable pitch control which frequently made the plane fly backwards. This was somewhat mitigated by the CoM/CoL, which allowed a relatively easy switch back to prograde. But it rendered my flight plan untenable, and I was forced to actually turn around to get to the runway, not use some kind of cuban-8. Though the powered yaw control was excellent, I still crashed trying to get on the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETadpole was a very large plane for this challenge. It flew very well with tanks full; I managed a clean powered landing with both 1/2 and 1/3 throttle.

There was no ladder, so I tried going from the front via the intake, and from the side via the gear bay, but no luck either way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow exactly did you test your plane?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EYep, it\u0027s quite a pain getting a Kerbal to a command seat only vehicle in the recent KSP\u0027s. Launch a one man pod from the SPH, EVA the Kerbal and walk (hold shift to run) him off the side of the runway (must go off the edge down the slope to the flat ground), go to command center and recover the pod (not the Kerbal). Launch the gRape\u0027r from SPH (I saved it with landing gear retracted, for me it launches with the gear up and the seat is low enough to enter from the side, you may need to set the landing gear to raised in the SPH - I\u0027m not sure), switch to the Kerbal, run back to the ship, hop on, put the gear down and go. I only launched/flew it twice, the first time it had no battery and an RTG won\u0027t directly power reaction wheels so I failed leaving the atmoshere. The second launch (with battery added) I made the necessary orbit for the challenge, the 10 to 20 units of fuel it should have left is enough to catch the atmosphere and effect a landing. It wasn\u0027t necessary to demonstrate a successful landing for the challenge, CoM is roughly in the center of the single fuel can IIRC so if it can take off it can land?
