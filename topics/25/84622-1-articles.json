I\u0027m 100% sure that this challenge is doable, because I\u0027ve done it before--with only 3 parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOver the years, inhabitants of Earth have been watching the Kerbals with envious eyes. They have seen strange, beautiful, elegant, and gigantic aircraft enter orbit and return, all in one piece. With the development of SSTOs, space travel, once enjoyed only by a select few, is now cheap enough to be within reach of middle-class Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarthlings have watched long enough. It\u0027s not their fault that their planet is 10 times bigger, they say. They want their own SSTO--one that can reach orbit around their own planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERules\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou must install the Realism Overhaul and all of its required mods. Your plane must reach a stable orbit around Earth, but it doesn\u0027t have to return. I don\u0027t care if your craft actually looks like a plane or not. As long as it can reach orbit and come back in one stage, it\u0027s good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMods\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERequired: Realism Overhaul and all its required mods (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84689\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84689\u003C/a\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOptional: any mod listed as \u0022Very Highly Recommended\u0022 and \u0022Recommended\u0022 on the Realism Overhaul thread\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EForbidden: all other mods\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHeavy Lifter Scoreboard\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe need a behemoth to haul heavy loads into orbit!
