With that number we can work out a point per ton value for each engine, with higher values being worse (since our final payload score will be divide by it).

From a meta-game perspective the Mainsail in particular is almost twice as good as the skipper in terms of its theoretical maximum score. The bodies are also biased but not nearly as much. Ignoring the atmosphere (which is more of a piloting and planning challenge) and going with a mathematically \u0027perfect\u0027 craft the two stand out bodies for best score are Tylo and Eve. Half of the remaining bodies are roughly equal and a second group (Bop, Vall, Dres, Ike, Mun) are about 10% less effective then the main group for maximum scoring, though most are relatively easy to land on. The only body that seems specifically bad for scoring is Laythe. Now unlike the engines, where the best engine was about 60 times better then the worst, Tylo is only about twice as effective as Laythe, making it a much tighter field.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway I wasn\u0027t going to travel far and I made some quick calculations to come up with the weight I wanted to put on a single mailsail to land on Kerbin. I didn\u0027t quite max out the weight since I\u0027m flying without any mods and so a little margin of error was needed. I went through 3 designs and surprisingly getting a landing at the correct speed was pretty easy flying by the math (resulting in a successful orbit to ground flight on the first attempt). The hard part was building landing legs that didn\u0027t immediately tip over the ship after it touched down. Since even the large landing gear isn\u0027t big enough to reach past a mailsail I had to extend them with girders. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first design didn\u0027t bother with real lander legs at all, I just used those Modular Girder Adapters to give the girders \u0027feet\u0027 to rest on. This design never even left the ground as the whole structure would constantly wiggle on the launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second design replaced the feet with proper landing gear and the first few low altitude flight tests worked fairly well - the powered landing went well almost everytime (the problems came when I forgot a step) but the lander would tip over, and weighing over 100 tons, smash into the ground and explode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third design changed the fuel tank placement in order to drastically lower the landers center of gravity. I replaced fuel tanks in the center with smaller T800 tanks attached to each of the lander leg girders. This design was fairly robust though even with 12 landing legs in total they struggled to hold up the weight of the ship and sunk into the ground. Retracting the legs while on the ground was impossible, since as soon as the weight of the craft was shifted it would break off whichever leg was unfortunate enough to be on the side it was tilted to, usually resulting in a complete collapse and lots of explosions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting it up into orbit was the next challenge. I build lean ships so an orbiter that weighed about 150 tons was out of my league. After a few attempts I just stuck a big booster under it and hooks up fuel lines so that the orbiters own tanks could get it up. I added a docking port to the top so that it could be refueled back to its original mass in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/92nCYzN.png\u0022 alt=\u002292nCYzN.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gbQWONn.png\u0022 alt=\u0022gbQWONn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship on the left is one of the refuelers, these where all deorbited before landing. The four T800 tanks that have solar panels on the lander are fuel for deorbiting, and get ejected after even though they\u0027ll still be more then half full. That\u0027s because their mass is not accounted for in the landing calculations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter fueling the tanks are locked so that only the deorbit tanks can be used. We make a little burn to line up a nice grassy landing site. We should come down somewhere between the coast on the left and those mountains after the atmosphere slows us down. The extra weight is ejected and final landing prep is made: Fuel tanks needed for the landing are unlocked (we will burn from the center tanks only), engine is locked and thrust set, alignment is made for a vertical touchdown. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Sb0NH5v.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Sb0NH5v.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jHStTM5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jHStTM5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next critical point in the landing will be made from the cockpit view.

With drop tanks that don\u0027t count for scoring in any way fuel efficiency isn\u0027t necessary. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso even though radial engines are listed as \u0022with greater difficulty\u0022 it\u0027s not all that difficult to just use one, placed below the craft in a way that ensures a centered thrust aimed straight down, like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that design and the current scoring it would be possible to land slightly over 70 tons (two full orange tanks) on M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn with a single Mk55 radial engine, getting a final score around 20. Even if you\u0027re forced to use several radial engines the way they\u0027re scored now (at least the Mk55) would simply mean you add more mass onto the craft and get it down for a higher score. Two Mk55 engines could land roughly 146 tons on M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, scoring 21.9 or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also agree with what\u0027s been mentioned about locations with atmospheres (and aerodynamic parts at that).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see. I\u0027ll change the engine score of radial mounts to be identical to their node-connected counterparts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven so, I\u0027ll reiterate that I\u0027ll revise the world scores.

After some low altitude testing to see that the design worked I put on a big booster (and it wasn\u0027t enough to get into stable orbit, so I attached some solid boosters for the second attempt) and managed a landing on the first attempt. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELithobraking (controlled or uncontrolled) is against the spirit of the challenge in the same way wing-assistance in atmospheres is; Johnno presumed correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven so, my plan was to also give a number to solid rocket motors which also counted into your Engine Score (which would do you a disservice if you staged them before landing.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to edit the OP now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E___________________________________________________________________________________________\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou guys\u0027 critiquing the game balance is of great help!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plan is to have a curve of difficulty so that one can actually choose, rather than mathematically identify the ideal, of what they want to land on. For example, why I chose to make Laythe and Kerbin the same for the gravity multiplier is that Kerbin is easier to access, but Laythe now awards a higher score proportional to its gravity and atmospheric difficulty. Tylo has also been boosted a bunch because if its special challenges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn all honesty I sort of made this challenge to see if a non-cheating screenshot could come into existence of someone landing on Tylo using an Ion engine to land a large orange tank \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-14T04:01:14Z\u0022 title=\u002211/14/2013 04:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Blue\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blaster","CreatedById":69150,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-16T17:04:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Blue\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Blue\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E... \u003Cp\u003EIn all honesty I sort of made this challenge to see if a non-cheating screenshot could come into existence of someone landing on Tylo using an Ion engine to land a large orange tank \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf someone can manage to do that, they win KSP, hands down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-16T18:37:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Blaster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Blaster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf someone can manage to do that, they win KSP, hands down.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, mathmatically an ion engine just can\u0027t land on Tylo, the ion engine\u0027s mass alone is far too much for it to overcome Tylo\u0027s gravity.

There are only 2 good ways to post a new high score. The first is with a Mk.55 Radial on Dres, Eeeloo or Ike which has a very small chance of being able to break the record. The second is a landing on Tylo for which there are a handful of competitive options, though it will really be about who does the skipper (which is probably the best balance for points and reasonable weight) and then the mainsail which will have to be heavier then my Kerbin lander. Once the mainsail has been done properly on Tylo that pretty much finishes it - to post anything higher you would need to build a Gilly lander in the 2500 ton range just to inch by the Tylo score.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-16T20:50:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dave Kerbin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dave Kerbin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUnfortunately I don\u0027t think there is a lot of room for competitive entries. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is why I haven\u0027t bothered with any more entries.
