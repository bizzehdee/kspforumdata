But by the same token, I want the nature of the challenge to be understood.\n\nLet me start with the premise, and then we could come up with a short and unambiguous set of rules that best fit that premise.\n\nThis is an anti-grav race. Meaning, you must rely on the anti-gravity repulsors to keep from crashing. \n\nThe big heavy repulsors that stick out, on its own shock absorbers, for extra challenge. (And a modicum more power and durability--but mainly the challenge.)\n\nSpeed is only a consideration once we\u0027ve established you aren\u0027t staying aloft longer than you can help it. \n\nYes, it\u0027s hard to keep a craft like this hovering against ground when you\u0027re approaching Mach 3. That\u0027s part of the challenge too.\n\nThat having been said....\n\nI\u0027m still leaning toward keeping the rule as currently stated--two control surfaces with 0.5 lift or lower \u002B two AIRBRAKES. It\u0027s straightforward, and it\u0027s in the spirit that control surfaces should be used for control and steering, not outright lift. I recognize that it will make particular ship designs more challenging, but in a way, that\u0027s part of the point.\n\nI really need a strict, unambiguous rule to ensure you\u0027re not under-utilizing the repulsors. I know radar altitude AKA surface altitude has been proposed, but you need mods, or otherwise use the IVA view and tolerate the cockpit radar altimeter (which still needs to be fixed, ahem.) Right now the best I can suggest is to keep the craft within a box with the cones marking off its corners vertically, and ask that you not over-rely on jet thrust to keep you aloft.\n\nSince collision with the cones would otherwise be hazardous to both craft and crew, I\u0027d say clipping through them should be a disqualification.\n\nAll mods are allowed. I\u0027m requiring stock jet engines. Beyond that it\u0027s specific kinds of engines and thrusters I\u0027m allowing or disallowing. Beyond that, I really don\u0027t want to be a rules lawyer here. I want less rules, but I also need to establish the parameters of the race enough that the spirit is understood and respected.\n\nAnd yes, I will create a new thread for the new race. I just wanted to start sussing out the new race\u0027s rules here, with the old race fresh, to better figure out how to get the challenge right."},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T02:19:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I really need a strict, unambiguous rule to ensure you\u0027re not under-utilizing the repulsors.
