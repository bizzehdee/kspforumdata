There is a twist! You have to do them at the same time. For example, you could go with the Jool-5 challenge and... um... the grand tour challenge. Like that guy did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are just 2 rules:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) you must follow the rules set by all of the challenges you chose\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Have fun\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you should say which challenges you chose and (optional) links.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScoring is simple - whoever does the most challenges at the same time!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeaderboard:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: If one of the challenges contradicts the other (again, take the Jool-5 challenge and some sort of kerbin exploration challenge) and you somehow still manage to complete it, the challenges will count as 2 each (Jool-5 \u002B KEC = 4 points). But if one says \u0027All stock\u0027 and the other(s) says \u0027(mod name) required\u0027, that would equal 0 points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this seems like a good challenge.
