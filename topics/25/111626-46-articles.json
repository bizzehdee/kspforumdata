Thanks [@JacobJHC](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/152333-jacobjhc/) for stepping up and many thanks to [@sdj64](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/100819-sdj64/) for all his hard work, I only had time to enter this challenge once at level 1 but have been a lurker looking at many of the excellent entries so really glad to hear it will go on.  [@JacobJHC](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/152333-jacobjhc/) I\u0027ve just been playing around with the Kerbalism mod and thinking what an excellent extra layer of challenge it be to do the Jool 5 with life support etc, be great if we could have a new level of Jool 5 challenge at some point that requires the use of a ife support mod.\n\u003E \n\nI have tried doing a jool 5 in kerbalism, but my kerbal always dies from radiation before even reaching jool. I think that in order to do it, hyperbolic transfer orbits would be required.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-02T23:30:38Z\u0022 title=\u002203/02/2018 11:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 2, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by zeta function**"},{"CreatedByName":"GRS","CreatedById":179502,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-03T01:15:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, zeta function said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E But my kerbal always dies from radiation before even reaching jool.\n\u003E \n\nI think this is related to jool emitting some radiations that killed your kerbals, and seems to be wider than its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"zeta function","CreatedById":178370,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-04T19:57:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 3/2/2018 at 8:15 PM, GRS said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I think this is related to jool emitting some radiations that killed your kerbals, and seems to be wider than its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\n\u003E \n\nI think it is actually from solar storms, although that could contribute.

Your liberal use of seats allowed you to have a very lightweight Level 3\u002B2 solution - 5 Kerbals with 2 landing on each moon!  I think the crew also appreciated the very *warm* cabins on the journey to Jool.  I liked the pancake riding at the end too.  I liked the gifs, but I would have enjoyed seeing some landings!\n\nThanks for an excellent entry.
