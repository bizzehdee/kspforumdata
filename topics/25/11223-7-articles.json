Sigh...\n\nWell in a sense it was a very stable design, probably not very much so for high-speed, but the design itself was remarkably stable and easy to fly. It can\u0027t break orbit due to the non-symetrical nature of the airframe and configuration. Once you hit vacuum, the plane is unable to balance center of thrust with center of gravity for some reason."},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-22T23:46:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 1st Post! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E ![screenshot5dc.png](http://img806.imageshack.us/img806/599/screenshot5dc.png)\n\u003E \u003E ![screenshot4abb.png](http://img715.imageshack.us/img715/9169/screenshot4abb.png)![screenshot2ky.png](http://img155.imageshack.us/img155/7331/screenshot2ky.png)![screenshot3zs.png](http://img59.imageshack.us/img59/1601/screenshot3zs.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E It has lots of lift and will roll very well, but it does not want to pitch up.\n\nOV-10 Bronco?
