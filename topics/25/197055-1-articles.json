With that out of the way, let\u0027s get started;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is (as of now) just a feasibility study, but I want to be able to build a\u00A0methalox fueled airbreathing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E in Real Solar System and Realism OverHaul.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo orbit Earth a velocity of 7.8 Kmps and an DeltaV of almost 9000 m/s is required.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will assume a 100 tons total mass for the total vehicle, as it is a nice round number.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want the air-breathing mode of the engines( \u0027jet\u0027 mode ) to get me up to around 3500 m/s or Mach 10.5. I assume this is realistic because scramjets have already been built that can operate at Mach 9 or whereabouts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will assume a (averaged over the entire burn)Specific Impulse of 2200\u00A0sec for the Airbreathing engine mode. This is considerably higher than the 1500-1800 which is quoted as the max for kerosene fueled ram and scramjets... but using Methane gives us some performance boost.( this assumption may or may not be realistic... you are free to critique me on this)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext, The specific impulse of the Closed-cycle (rocket mode) is assumed to be 380 sec... which is well within the realms of reality for a methalox engine (Perhaps I could up this number, Please give me some info. about the vacuum performance of methalox engines.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E(at Takeoff, in jet mode) is assumed to be 0.4. This is reasonable as Airbreathing jets have a very low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E. The total thrust in airbreathing mode is 392 kN. I will be using two engines, so each engine actually produces 196 kN.Throughout the Airbreathing phase, I will assume an avg. Acceleration of around 1.75\u00A0m/s^2. Even though the vehicle gets lighter, the engines also lose \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E as they go faster, as well as the effects of drag; so I figure 1.75\u00A0m/s^2\u00A0is reasonable.(Again it\u0027s open to critique.)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAccelerating at a constant 1.75\u00A0m/s^2 ( again this is a gross over-simplification), it takes around 2000 seconds for the vehicle to reach 3500 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn these 2000 sec, the engines produce an avg 392 kN of thrust.. and consume around 35 tons of methane as propellant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now we are going at 3500 m/s, around 30 kms up, and weigh around 65 tons, we need around 5000 m/s more at this point to get into orbit. Before we calculate the payload this thing can haul into orbit.. we need some more calculations- such as the vehicles dry and wet mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow Air-Breathing Engines- at best- have a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of around 8... I will assume 7 for the ones I\u0027m using... this makes their weight around 5.7 tonnes. At minimum, the entire empty vehicle must weight around 5 tonnes(without engines), and this is assuming that the vehicle is practically one big fuel tank. So the empty weight of the vehicle is at minimum 11 tons. So can we even get into orbit without any payload at all? Using these numbers and inputting them into the Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation, along with a specific impulse of 380 s, we get a total \u0027rocket\u0027 mode DeltaV of around 6500 m/s... this is way more than the 5000 m/s we need... so again doing some maths with the Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation reveals that we can take almost 5 tons into LEO. This may not sound like much, but it is a payload fraction of 5 %, which is the same as a high performance staged rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what do you guys and gals think of my analysis? I\u0027ve tried to be as reasonable and as conservative as possible... Anyways do you think such a vehicle is possible to build in KSP-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E and/or real-life??\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-09-22T16:19:27Z\u0022 title=\u002209/22/2020 04:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 22, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by DA299\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
