KermaJet has found in testing that the RAPIER engine will dismount from the fuselage on hard landings. Simply reinforcing the engine with strut bracing fixes the issue. KermaJet has also modified the landing gear configuration, to prevent flipping on braking, and to ease taxiing, and slightly rebalanced the RCS thrusters, to reduce translation rolling. KermaJet suggests to flight assist software programmers to find a way to actively balance RCS movements using throttled outputs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/55294379/KermaJet/KR100C/kr100c.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kr100c.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/55294379/KermaJet/KR100C/kr100c-2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kr100c-2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/55294379/KermaJet/KR100C/KR100C.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDownload\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cruzan","CreatedById":79256,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-25T23:57:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Blaster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Blaster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhile the KR100 did not make it to the finalists, KermaJet thanks the judges for at least considering the vehicle.\u003Cp\u003EIn light of this, KermaJet is releasing the KR100C - a modified version of the KR100, with the issues addressed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYa I was surprised not to see you make the finals since you scored 2nd on my sheet!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll have to test out your new design when I get a chance.
