The first working antennae have received alien signals from Laythe! Strong consensus is that an extra-kerbol civilization has established an outpost on Jool\u0027s innermost satellite. Now whether they are trying to order take-out or contact their home is left up to debate, but there is a push for volunteers to organize a mission to Laythe to make first contact. Jeb is disqualified as Bob has him tied up in the janitor\u0027s closet. Thanks, Bob.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe need a craft worthy to make the journey to Laythe and return on its own power, but it must look completely harmless and friendly to the beings as possible. So, thinking \u0027What Wouldn\u0027t Jeb Do?\u0027 is a good first start. Our experts agree that curves and nothing sharp or looking remotely unsafe is the way to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease submit your designs with launch stage and how it would appear upon landing upon Laythe within the week in the cardboard box labelled \u0027First Contact submissions.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EJeb here: Screw that noise. Any civilization that can land in our system is worthy of a grand show of respect and power. If you feel that sharp corners and pointy bits are the way to go, and have a willingness to land with exposed nuclear cores and solid rocket boosters, then submit your entry to the other box labelled: \u0027Welcome to our world, space cadet!\u0027 I will put in an extra word with the mission commander who will pilot the craft, himself.
