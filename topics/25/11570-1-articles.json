Your challenge is to build the longest lasting, or fastest vehicle you can, without using rockets, jet engines, RCS, or carts. \n\nYou can use any mods you like. Just nothing that uses fuels of any kind. It\\\u0027s a kind of glitch challenge. \n\nYou may be thinking, \u0027This is impossible\u0027, but it\\\u0027s not. I achieved 1,452m/s using just fins and landing gear. (I also pulled 72.5G\\\u0027s during that flight). You can also use the damned robotics mod to create a vehicle that rolls on itself. (using rotators in place of wheels is cheap. dont do that.)\n\n\u003E ![2rw8e88.png](http://i49.tinypic.com/2rw8e88.png)\n\nVideo would be great, but not required.

Carts are useless on the water, and would provide no propulsion as a result. If it\\\u0027s to get to something other than the water such as the M\u00C3\u00BCn... Well, for now, keep it on Kerbin.
