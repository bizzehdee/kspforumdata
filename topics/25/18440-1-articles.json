To keep a level playing field the payload has been selected for you, one that can\u0027t be tampered with; A Kerbal!! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe aim is to achieve the greatest horizontal distance. You can use what ever parts except for custom home made parts. The Kerbal must be thrown by the movement of the arm, not directly propelled by rockets. However using rockets to move the arm is definitely allowed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is one I did as proof of concept, it has a max range of 363.4m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bqRTtl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bqRTtl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/9KlZlXwQppQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThere is a vid of it too\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are several categories for the challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeginner:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECatapult can be secured to the ground using launch clamps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntermediate:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECatapult must be free standing/moveable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdvanced:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECatapult must be moved and aimed so that the payload hits one of the buildings at the space centre (while still attempting to achieve greatest distance).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 4th category can be combined with any of the other three;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMedievalGenius;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe catapult fires using only potential energy, no rockets/thrusters/(things that would scare medieval folk).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe range is the value shown on screen of the distance to the catapult when viewed from the payload.
