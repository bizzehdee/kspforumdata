In order for the space centre to prove that space is safe they have given Jed a challenge **using only 1 big orange tank of fuel take as many kerbals to space as possible in the one launch,**. this public event will show the public that space is safe after the 1.0 update and that they can now continue missions again.\n\n**Rules**\n\n.you can only use 1 orange tank of fuel, the tank doesn\u0027t have to be completely full\n\n.You can use a maximum of 5 engines \n\n.you can\u0027t use any rcs\n\n.You can\u0027t cheat (hyper edit, de bugmenu , infiniglide)\n\n.
