I have no mods, that mess with AGs so there is not much i can do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoreover about the wing setup. I thought i should go with a proven design much like Ferrams Thunderbolt, i think the name is. This works very well balance wise since it allows me to mount the side tanks right next to the main fuselage. It also makes the wing placement painless since i can shift them forward and backward where i would face problem due to the angled Sp\u002B parts if they were center mounted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo i flew the \u003Cstrong\u003EKerbodyne Migration\u003C/strong\u003E. I like the name, very fitting. It certainly fulfills the promise that it is a very fast plane. The rapiers actually provide enough power to get into space already. True to the Kerbal way, a set of aerospikes have been added. I wonder though if it wasn\u0027t better to replace at least a pair of rapiers with turbo jets. This would presumably give you better atmospheric performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, you get into space very quickly if you survive. My takeoff experience wasn\u0027t very pleasant. The Migration is very unstable indeed. Only between mach 2 and mach 4 it felt really comfortable. Landing, again was a bit hairy since i could not get rid of some side slip. I though it would veer off on the runway and explode but it didn\u0027t and behave well after ground contact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany of my Sp\u002B designs are also quite unstable in yaw. Perhaps it is due to the general \u0022flatness\u0022 of the Sp\u002B fuselage parts. Might be worth a try to see how the Migration behaves with the large delta wing pieces as vertical stabilizers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see we have different tastes regarding aesthetic. I think the dozen canard surfaces look terrible together. There are no larger all-moving wing pieces in SP\u002B so it is hard to blame you ... but still ... (i find the forward swept canards the worst offenders). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn last thing, in comparison to the Skathi: The skathi appeared to be much more stable during reentry at high angles of attack. I don\u0027t remember it rolling violently as soon as it enters a severe stall like the Migration does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, i\u0027m not super impressed by it. I think if it just behaved better at low speed it would be nice passenger and possibly transport plane which i could like.

The thing that was wrong on the old upload was that several of the forward surfaces were set to affect yaw when they should not have been; this had a dramatically negative impact on stability in all axes. If you\u0027ve got a version that is tuned as it should be, the only control surfaces affecting yaw will be the rudders. The outermost rear horizontal surfaces are ailerons set for roll only, pretty much everything else is set to work as an elevon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen working and flown as intended, it should be able to maintain a stable hands-off 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 climb within about twenty seconds of leaving the runway. I think the flight demonstration I provided with my entry show that it has adequate stability when set up as designed. My mention of roll instability just meant that you typically needed to level the wings before setting your trim just after takeoff; once you\u0027ve done that, it should fly straight and level from then on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is intended to be flown with SAS on at all times, and it\u0027s not designed to take extreme angles of attack during reentry. Use the spoilers and intakes to enhance drag in the upper atmosphere, get down to ~21,000m as fast as you can without burning up, and hold that altitude until you\u0027re down to about Mach 2. The nose should stay within 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 of prograde the whole way, and by the time you\u0027re getting heating effects you should be below a 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 angle of attack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere definitely appears to be something screwy going on with the action groups; the Aerospikes are certainly set to action group one on all of my versions.
