I rather like how it handles, and it has a reasonable amount of power and usability. As a first attempt, I was rather pleased. Yes, I am pleased with my Longfellow. lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then my fondness for excess and absurdity got the better of me. The original Longfellow has a body of just five mk2 fuselages. I got bored and created a monstrosity that uses (assuming I counted right) \u003Cstrong\u003Etwenty-eight\u003C/strong\u003E mk2 fuselages! After many, many tweaks, I have made it capable of not immediately exploding upon hitting the end of the runway.

Using no fewer than twenty-eight mk2 fuselages, all connected in one unbroken line, create a flyable spaceplane that still manages to maintain its serpentine look.
