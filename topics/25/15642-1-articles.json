You have to counter about 9km/s in retroburn after reaching solar orbit. It is extremely unrealistically impossible to fly toward the sun due to the limited physics of the game right now, you are forced into orbit so this is a fair fight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScreenshot your nearest encounter with the sun.
