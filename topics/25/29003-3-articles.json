All 3 sections of the LKO rocket are recoverable, the first 2 outer tanks drop off around 10,000m and use parachutes to land back at KSC, within 500m of the launch pad. They land on their engines and are ready for immediate reuse. The first center stage comes off and lands in the ocean east of KSC, also reusable. The third stage puts the payload into a circular orbit around 75km and with good timing will deorbit and land in the ocean just east of KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1160.photobucket.com/user/TheBobWiley/media/Duna%20Permanent%20Outpost%20Mission/Lifter1_zpscf858bd6.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1160.photobucket.com/albums/q498/TheBobWiley/Duna%20Permanent%20Outpost%20Mission/Lifter1_zpscf858bd6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Lifter1_zpscf858bd6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1160.photobucket.com/user/TheBobWiley/media/Duna%20Permanent%20Outpost%20Mission/Lifter2_zpsb8196b76.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1160.photobucket.com/albums/q498/TheBobWiley/Duna%20Permanent%20Outpost%20Mission/Lifter2_zpsb8196b76.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Lifter2_zpsb8196b76.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only part that would be considered \u0022burnt up\u0022 is the payload fairings and the 2.5 extended payload decoupler, it doubles as a heat shield on reentry and never passes 700c.

Each IPT has approximately 4900 m/s of Dv in a vacuum, hopefully this should allow for the 19.31 ton IPT\u0027s to tug the 19.71 ton IPSH\u0027s to duna and back before refueling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third craft which has yet to be fully built is the Crew and Service Vehicle (CSV) which is used to ferry the crew to the IPSH\u0027s while they are in orbit around kerbin, they also carry the fuel needed to refuel the IPT\u0027s. If weight permits they will also carry the fuel needed to fill the IPSH outboard containers, used not only for radiation absorption, but are used to refuel the Duna Descent/Ascent Vehicle (DDAV) that shuttles the crew between Duna and the IPSH\u0027s. Most likely a dedicated refueling vehicle will be developed to refuel the IPSH outboard tanks. The final part of the mission profile calls for a Duna Exploration Vehicle (DEV) that has yet to be developed. These vehicles will take a one way trip to Duna ahead of the IPSH\u0027s, along with the DDAV, and will set up a mobile base for when the kerbals arrive at a later window. I included a sketch of the mission profile, and I am currently looking at 6 launches (not including the undeveloped DEV\u0027s) that will form a 3 part journey to Duna. Each LKO rocket is fully recoverable and can launch a payload of roughly 19.7 tons, this allows me to launch every 29.55 (30) days. I have a theoretical mission value of 1200 (4 kerbals long term on Duna) and mission efficiency of 10.15. This number will decrease as I develop the DEV\u0027s and add their launches into the equation. I may even launch more IPSH\u0027s in order to get more kerbals to Duna before the 500 days and try to increase my score.

Kerbin-Duna transfers will be done in two parts with the use of nuclear powered boost tugs, and an unsuccessful insertion burn should be safely recovered from.

Loss of non-critical vehicles at Duna will not seriously affect the mission, with major vehicles being replaced as soon as possible (hopefully within the next launch vehicle). Loss of a critical vehicle however may put the entire mission in jeopardy, and therefore will result in a replacement being launched at the next possible launch opportunity and then being propelled to Duna on a non-optimal trajectory by the Duna boost tug 1 that will remain in Kerbin orbit in case of such a situation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, the mission is planned to be both safe and productive, with a very low chance of overall failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnto the vehicles themselves:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunches will be performed by the as yet unchristened single use, 3.5 stage, 15 ton launcher AL015t:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.majhost.com/gallery/vidboi/KerbalSpaceMania/Duna-Direct/screenshot26.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot26.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough it\u0027s far from the efficient launch vehicle I wanted something that could fairly reliably heft payload into a 100km orbit and be fairly interesting at the same time (hence the over the top staging).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase 1 comprises of two parts: the first being a light nuclear tug with mapping satellites and a rover-skycrane combo used to decide on an optimal landing site for the main base:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.majhost.com/gallery/vidboi/KerbalSpaceMania/Duna-Direct/screenshot28.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot28.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand the second part being a refuelling station for Duna orbit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.majhost.com/gallery/vidboi/KerbalSpaceMania/Duna-Direct/screenshot29.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot29.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese two launches will be docked together and travel to Duna as one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase 2 starts with the launch of a fuel station of the same design of that launched in phase 1.

Kermichev produced and perfected a carrier rocket with reusable boosters, the UR-180. The outer boosters cross-feed to the inner core and parachute to splashdown. The carrier rocket lifts a 18t payload to 100km LKO with just enough dV left over to deorbit itself, or the same 18t payload plus the Blok-T upper stage for about 500 m/s dV for on-orbit assembly. The base UR-180 is 57% reusable, the UR-180 \u002B Blok-T is 53%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(The design is meant to emulate the real world UR-500, itself the basis for Russia\u0027s \u0022Proton\u0022, and the intended follow-up UR-700, both of which really used [or would have used] crossfeed between outer \u0026amp; inner boosters, as well as poorly remembered images of upper stages. I thought I was doing Blok-D, it turned out closer to Fregat. In any case I\u0027m actually quite proud of the UR-180, it\u0027s the best working and best looking I\u0027ve ever made.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get the resources to build the rocket he is so proud of, Kermichev found his already ambitious promise to get three kerbonauts to Duna in the first launch window had suddenly expanded to SIX. That meant finding a way to launch an atomic tug, an ISRU plant, and two habitats, all on just three rockets. The atomic tug and ISRU lander would have to be on a single rocket. That went beyond the lift mass for the UR-180, so the atomic tug would have to coast to the edge of the atmosphere before completing its own burn into orbit. That required a stronger but less efficient engine to complete the burn before it fell back to Kerbin. That consumed so much fuel that, while it was left with enough to make the burn for Minimus, it would swing right past without enough fuel to make orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorse yet, the State Space Committee\u0027s own teams keep revising the landers. Combining the roles of transit habitat, lander, surface habitat, ascent vehicle, and return transit habitat, they have more than doubled in mass, and each one now weighs 17.5 tons with mostly empty fuel tanks, just barely within the limits of the carrier rocket. In simulations, the ISRU lander\u0027s engines turned out to be dangerously underpowered, underfueled, and too unstable for the sort of precise landing required to ensure the landing site is both kethane-rich and cliff-poor. Fixing this only worsens the mass problems of launching it with the atomic tug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the only thing that did go right was the production of an inflatable heat shield. Simulations showed there really isn\u0027t a need to protect the landers themselves, but a shield is essential for the complex\u0027s initial aerocapture into Duna orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it\u0027s been a rough couple of weeks at Kermichev, but let me tell you, it\u0027s been even worse at Kerbolyov. The continent is littered with the wreckage of his 9t and 20t 1.5STO (drop-engine) prototypes. They worked quite well on their own, but once complicated by kethane mining equipment, they tended to be nose-heavy on reentry, which makes for a very unstable tail-landing rocket. One partial success became a very nice deep sea research station, dubbed Single Stage To Ocean. The curling match to decide where the rocket would refuel ended without a clear result once it became evident the State Space Committee would go with Kermichev\u0027s rocket, and Kerbolyov has turned its attention to winning the production of the lander modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWesterners may have read the article in Antiquing Week \u0026amp; Space Technology accusing the Kermunists of self-delusion or even outright lying about their productivity and efficiency estimates for their Duna mission plans.
