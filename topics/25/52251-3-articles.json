Experiences:\u003Cp\u003E1, I put my Mothership into a parking orbit between Laythe and Vall, and used a Moon-orbit Module to bring the Landing Module down to orbit and back to the Mothership.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChanging orbit for Laythe intercept is about 300m/s, braking to orbit and getting back to the Mothership is 2 x 500m/s, landing is very cheap (parachutes), getting back works with jets and after 7100m with rockets, but you need a bigger rocket this way too. About \u002B1500-2000m/s back to orbit! And it\u0027s better to go straight up with the Jets because the atmosphere will brake you back soon under ~10000 m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy rocket fuel was not enough for orbit so I almost gave up the mission here. The most what I was able to achieve is a long falling-back path with apoapsis at around 56\u0027000m. But after a lot of reloading and learning the right timing, I brought my Moon-orbital Module into a 50\u0027000 m (falling-down) path, I quickly catch the Lander Module and went back into orbit... it was VERY, VERY HARD! Took me a lot of time to save Jebediah and the mission!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2, the Jet engines was a good idea, they gave me \u002B330 m/s until 7100m. But you need to cut them and separate before that or they will spin you at 7300m\u002B! And before launch you have to assign the Jet engines and the main rocket engines to Action Groups and so you can turn on/off them quickly and at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3, The Moon-orbit Module is very useful and uses Nuclear Engines and an ASAS what gives it a lot of torque, so RCS can be held for dockings only. This way you don\u0027t have to move the whole Mothership to orbit and back to other moons and can save you a lot of fuel/weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4, Changing the Mothership layout with the little Space Tug is big fun because this main ship doesn\u0027t have so much parts (about 300-350) and there\u0027s no lag! But docking with huge orange tanks is a slow and painful thing.
