It used to have an opaque windscreen, but I got rid of it early in the design process, opting for the thin sideguards instead. They double as backup vertical stabilizers in case someone manages to score hits on the normal one (which is unlikely, considering that 7.62 mm requires more than one hit, and all of my test runs showed nothing could get an accurate hit on anything remotely agile except with spray and pray, basically because if a fighter is maneuvering at 10 G, it can dodge bullets easily. )\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-06T08:09:10Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2015 08:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pds314**"},{"CreatedByName":"tetryds","CreatedById":50204,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T07:58:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Wait, important!
