You could get the same using DD to dampen with normal pitch control at high Q, I guess. It is confusing. You can use pitch, the AoA slider, and the spoiler slider for the same goals. Especially with DD I think the boarder between what sliders achieve are blurred. Testing is not easy as the rest of the plane must be adapted to changed amounts of pitch authority - and then you compare apples with pears.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI built another test plane (K-202) purely for understanding more about the general question if front-facing control surfaces are better used for pitch authority (like canards) or for AoA, or if there is an advantage of using two for this and two for that. That plane doesn\u0027t like those surfaces to be used as spoilers (stalls until you dampen everything using DD, then it doesn\u0027t corner well anymore), but it achieves superb slow cornering performance with AoA.

If there is low pressure, it will use more deflection on the pitch angles for the leading edge slats. And I really limited those slats control angle input to around 2-3deg at most. I had messed with them before in my RO install back last year. I had a very successful twin engine delta wing design that used slats for landing and take off to keep the speeds low.
