Who can build the ultimate weapon of war snack and science transfer device?\n\nWe shall see.\n\n***Categories of Submission***\n\nThere are four divisions that users may participate in. Each has its own scoreboard.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![Replica_catapult.jpg](https://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTrIAoiF-B5JSQBm_083m1ld-udzz5k8FrHiLxKcohbxueUopRvZQ:upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Replica_catapult.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E This division relies on some form of tension mechanism, like an arm that may be bent back. Go wild!\n\u003E \n\u003E RULES:\n\u003E \n\u003E 1 - The arm may not be assisted when throwing by any means besides its own tendency to return to it\u0027s original position.\n\u003E \n\u003E Other than that, it\u0027s home free. For example: A fuel tank is mounted on the end of the arm, which bends it down, and then released, which causes it to spring back up.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![trebuchet.jpg](https://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcStXu1l7FIwBnjuyhaONuEx44coTnXDnn8Pwd6DU6MvMkBSRqdlTw:www.wired.com/images_blogs/wiredscience/2010/11/trebuchet.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Devices submitted here must rely on gravity to swing the payload.\n\u003E \n\u003E RULES:\n\u003E \n\u003E 1 - The arm may not be assisted when throwing by any means besides the force of gravity.\n\u003E \n\u003E Example: Large fuel tank brings arm around, payload released on maximum swing.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![125900810618012954600601197_Centrifugal.jpg](https://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS9ibvrx9HruGP2sP-fXxbibZj6B2WgDA1Y7UVrFHahLnnyXiyR:netstorage.discovery.com/feeds/brightcove/asset-stills/sci/125900810618012954600601197_Centrifugal.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E One of the most amusing and dangerous divisions, things that spin go here.\n\u003E \n\u003E RULES:\n\u003E \n\u003E 1 - There are no rules! (Besides the general ones listed below) The arm may be powered by anything you want.\n\u003E \n\u003E NOTES:\n\u003E \n\u003E - The machine must remain stationary while firing. (It can\u0027t just spin in a circle on the runway, some part of it has to move)\n\u003E \n\u003E Example: Reaction wheel tower on plane wheels with the payload mounted on an arm, spins and releases for distance.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![jpeg](https://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRW3q6UT-SVAbut6tzJmP6jBECUFVbEGvP8d2yJ9qRrCdtcOvFz:delaware.newszap.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls%3FSTREAMOID%3D_0HtM2SHlHlLBquD%24m%24oMc%24daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYuLClSU%24KJoFZsHKjXevL8GWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF%249l%244uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-%26CONTENTTYPE%3Dimage/jpeg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Fire the Mass Relay! Use your engines to shoot the payload as far as possible.\n\u003E \n\u003E RULES:\n\u003E \n\u003E 1 - You may not clip nozzles on engines, however, clipping other parts of engines and having many nozzles are allowed (And recommended!)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n***Submission Guidelines:***\n\nScreenshots of:\n\n-Craft on Runway prior to firing.\n\n-Craft during and after firing.\n\n-Maximum height achieved for payload\n\n-Moment-Of-Impact for payload (Hit Esc to pause if you need to)\n\n-To qualify for any of the movement bonuses, screenshots of the craft doing the task are required. (Moving, swimming, flying)\n\n***General Rules:***\n\n-Catapults (Or whatever you want to call your machine) must remain stationary while firing.\n\n-Use of infiniglide or physics exploits is explicitly prohibited.\n\n-Catapults shall be fired from the runway on Kerbin.\n\n-For entry to be scored, after or before firing you must switch to the payload. The payload will be destroyed\\*, and the distance shown to the catapult still on the runway is needed.\n\n-Catapults must use the \n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![T01oFn8.png](http://i.imgur.com/T01oFn8.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E [Catapult Payload Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fk2ycnnnzsw8ll3/Catapult%20Payload.craft?dl=0)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n-Catapults must release payloads to the East.\n\n-STOCK ONLY. No massive Big Bertha engines firing your thing out of the solar system. (Thanks, Darren9.)\n\n-No debug menu, either.\n\n\\* - Most likely, barring luck or glitches.\n\n***Scoring:***\n\n*Over the Moat:* 1 point per meter payload travels. (Ground Distance Covered)\n\n*Clear the Walls:* 1 point per meter of height payload achieves. (Highest Altitude Achieved)\n\n**Bonus Points:**\n\n*Environmentalist:* 100 extra points for re-usability. \\*\n\n*Mobile Forces:* 20 points for mobility, 0.25 extra points for each m/s of speed achieved on level ground.\n\n*Nava-pult:* 20 points for amphibious capability, 0.5 extra points for each m/s of speed achieved.\n\n*Airstrike:* 20 points for flight capability, 1 extra point per 500 meters above sea level achieved under engine power. \\*\\*\n\n\\* - Can catapult re-load itself for another firing? Does not need to actually fire more than once: The payload may be attached by a decoupler and still qualify for this award.\n\n\\*\\* - Limited to the edge of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. (For a total of 140 extra points)\n\n***Good Luck!***\n\nMy own submissions are coming soon. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![4ZGc7je.png](http://i.imgur.com/4ZGc7je.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***Leaderboards:***\n\n*\u0022Air\u0022 Cannon Division:*\n\n1st - Deutherius [Design](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113063-The-Chunkin-Challenge-Haul-Out-your-Trebuchets%21?p=1786603\u0026viewfull=1#post1786603) Total: 3195.
