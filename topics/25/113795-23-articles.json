I just gave it a quick try, and it didn\u0027t seem to help my landing much, though. I thought it might try lowering the plane\u0027s attitude on the ground, but that didn\u0027t help either. I\u0027ll need to give it another try later when I have time.\n\n\u003E This looks good! It reminds me of the older Russian MIGs!\n\nYeah, I\u0027m a sucker for those old MiGs. Those old Soviet planes always seem to be one part rugged simplicity, one part elegant efficiency, and one part borderline insanity. Perfect for KSP!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E *WHAT?* ^mind^\u003Csub\u003E\u003Csup\u003Eblown\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/sub\u003E How did I not know about this?\n\u003E As for those fins, hmm...

I also wanted to improve stability in level flight and on the ground, but it\u0027s entirely possible that the new tailplane is the actual cause of improvement and I can delete the dorsal fins. Actually, a large number of the design elements of the plane are down to my attempts to make it easier to land. Drooping nose, wide landing gear and hence wing geometry... I can\u0027t complain, because the alterations have always resulted in a better plane, but I do hope I work out how to land it eventually..."}]}
