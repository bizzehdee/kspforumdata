It looks like it still took an oscar b or round 8 tucked away somewhere to make it home, though, judging by the parts count and before-and-after weights. Not complaining, just observing. I\u0027ve seen some diagrams of military jets\u0027 fuel systems and it\u0027s impressive how they\u0027ll tuck away fuel anywhere they have a few gallons worth of void space in the airframe.

I resorted to a nearly identical method while developing my high speed single engine entry when I ran into some landing gear instability before briefly setting it vertically on the runway for take off to preserve parts count.
