With the rise of spaceplanes and C7 Aerospace in the space exploration market, Rockomax has seen the lowest stock prices in years! The board of directors had hoped the new R.A.P.I.E.R. engine designed in conjoint with C7 Aerospace would help boost their revenue. Unfortunately, due to it\u0027s less-than-stellar performance, Rockomax has found that many customers prefer the Turbojet/Aerospike combo - both C7 engines, of course. Rockomax needs something to boost their sales, and like everything else they do, they\u0027re thinking of something big.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is where you come in. Rockomax has provided KSC with a massive amount of funding for one of the most ambitious missions yet attempted by kerbalkind -- land a kerbal on another planet. But there\u0027s a catch.

Vall requires powered landing, but using other planets and moons in the system makes achieving orbit very easy to do with much less delta V than is required for Moho since Moho is all alone. Pol, Bop, and Vall should all be within 100 points of each other. I would swap out the Moho points for the Vall points. Also, landing on every moon in the Jool system is worth more than Eeloo, so what\u0027s the point in going to Eeloo?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaythe\u0027s score, along with all the other moons of Jool, come from the fact that it takes ~2000 m/s to intercept Jool, plus some dV to intercept them once you hit Joolean orbit. I may have overestimated the amount of dV it will take to intercept them, however. As for Moho\u0027s score, it\u0027s already higher than Laythe and Vall\u0027s score for landing. Returning is a bit different. Laythe is much tougher to take off from due to the atmosphere and the gravity, but looking at it again, Vall definitely shouldn\u0027t have such a high return value. I\u0027ll look into adjusting the point values.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for Eeloo, if I\u0027m not mistaken it takes more dV to intercept and land on all the moons of Jool than it does to get to Eeloo, making it a more difficult challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, I looked at and adjusted the scores of the planets. The biggest change is that Jool\u0027s moons are mostly worth a lot less now. I seem to have tacked on an extra 250 points (~2500 m/s) to most of the return scores for the moons for reason I cannot even fathom. I assume a ~3000m/s return burn \u002B however much it costs to liftoff the planet. Some of the other scores are also adjusted.
