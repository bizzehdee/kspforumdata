Brake and full throttle engines until a whiplash gets 95 kn\u002B. At the end of the runway don\u0027t pull up too hard or the back end will hit the grass. Not splashing in the water takes a large AOA 15 degrees at least DONT HIT THE WATER lol. Accelerate level till 400 and move LF forward to center the COM (you can tell by how much up force is on the tail fins). Tip up to 15 degrees until 10 km and then follow propagrade. Things will get hot and can explode don\u0027t be afraid to back off the throttle if it is over 1100m/s below 10 km. Air breathers die at about 22-23 km and 1350ish m/s Switch to LF OX the moment your not accelerating. This thing is a tank do lose to much upward momentum by waiting until it is too late. 57.605/129.86 44.36% and all i have to do is add airbrakes and possibly a parachute ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) (i didn\u0027t for the purpose of the challenge)\n\u003E \n\u003E My first successful try made it with 100 LF and 67 OX left but I screwed up the screen shots :/\n\u003E \n\u003E How do you upload a craft file?\n\nThat is awesome. \n\nIf you want to flip the decoupler, use the a or d key then attach it to the end of a rapier, attach your cargo, detach and then you should be able to attach it to the front of the cargo bay. \n\nMy latest effort (which has not quite obtained orbit yet) has been adjusting down from 50% Payload Fraction, now sadly i am already under your fraction, but I am still hopeful of beating Slugy\u0027s yet for second place.\n\n![60WktD7.png](http://i.imgur.com/60WktD7.png)She is very light, 88t at start for 37.4t of cargo, i am balancing LF and O at the moment, plenty of performance, she rips through the power barrier without much more than a slight dip in AOA at about 7000m.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-29T14:28:42Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2015 02:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by selfish\\_meme**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T16:14:36Z","Content":"Beautiful craft what is the assent profile?

I can\u0027t post many pictures at the moment so I\u0027m asking for a volunteer to verify my entry. It\u0027s a very easy and simple ascent: set SAS to prograde at launch time and leave it at that. When the navball switches to orbit (at ~35km altitude), toggle it back to surface mode. Aim for an apoapsis of at least 73km. [Craft files](http://ksp.schnobs.de/stuff/srfprograde.zip). The first vessel carries slightly more fuel and should be good for a 80\u002Bkm circular orbit.

By now it\u0027s pushing 1000m/s and I shallow it again to 7\u0027 as the thrust has reached max and I want to go as fast as possible. From there I let it go by itself, top speed around 1348m/s on air at about 22-23k, pitch has increased to about 20\u0027, taking your hint, switch to closed and wait for apoapsis, instead of pitching up further. This attempt was just shy of orbit by a couple of hundred m/s at 39.5% PF. I\u0027m sure a better pilot could do better. I am adding toroidal tanks in the bay to top up the LF to try and achieve orbit at this fraction, which may be replaced by a 100 soon. Then I am going to up the fraction again.\n\n[Craft](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8-nkDP75eETODVHelVGWEV4d1U)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
