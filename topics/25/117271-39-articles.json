These will trip radar systems placed at each site, and alert the planes they are teamed with. They will scramble and head towards the rockets, which will be destroyed, staged below 25% original mass, or run out of power, at which point the inbound planes lose interest in the rockets and engage each other.\n\nI\u0027ve been so busy I haven\u0027t even touched my KSP PC in weeks, however.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-26T17:38:34Z\u0022 title=\u002209/26/2015 05:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by colmo**"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceplaneAddict","CreatedById":149322,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T17:47:09Z","Content":"If a tourney is still happening, then eat this: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B588M8xKv0QKMWgwZkxLSWliMnM/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B588M8xKv0QKMWgwZkxLSWliMnM/view?usp=sharing).\n\nThe K-35."},{"CreatedByName":"gag09","CreatedById":57494,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-29T13:37:00Z","Content":"An unlimited tourney could be fun.\n\n![screenshot322wnsqs.png](http://abload.de/img/screenshot322wnsqs.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-29T16:15:57Z\u0022 title=\u002209/29/2015 04:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by gag09**"},{"CreatedByName":"gag09","CreatedById":57494,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-29T21:02:09Z","Content":"Also where did creative go?"},{"CreatedByName":"CreativeCombat","CreatedById":112338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-30T14:58:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Also where did creative go?\n\nSchool started back up again and I haven\u0027t had much time for anything.
