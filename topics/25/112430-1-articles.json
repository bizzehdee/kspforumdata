A challenge to see who can get the best launch of a payload, simply by flying past it as shown in [this screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/I8WWnP9.png).\n\nThe key to achieving a launch is to fly very fast, and very close to the payload. 600\u002B m/s and less than 50 meters seems to be a good base-point.\n\n**THE RULES**\n\n1: Payload consists of one(1) unmanned [**Mobile Processing Lab MPL-LG-2**](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Mobile_Processing_Lab_MPL-LG-2), sitting stationary on the launchpad. No other parts may be attached.\n\n2: You can use any design you can come up with, the only requirement is that you launch the lab without coming into contact with it.\n\n3: Please follow the spirit of the challenge, without attempting to use unrelated exploits.\n\n**MODS**\n\n1: For the stock scoreboard, you can use any mods which do not modify stock parts, add new parts, or change KSP physics.\n\n2: For the modded scoreboard, you can use any public mods, just list what you used.\n\n**SCORING**\n\nThere will be two scoreboards: Highest Altitude and Highest Speed (in surface mode). To substantiate your score, switch vessels using the [ and ] keys. As soon as the lab lifts off, it will allow you to switch. Then take a screenshot as quickly as possible for highest speed, or at the highest point for highest altitude. You can score on both scoreboards with the same launch, but only the numbers shown in your screenshots will be recorded.\n\nPlease also include screenshots of your craft, the closer to the launchpad the better. Liberal use of F5 and F9 helps to get screenshots of both your craft, and the pod\u0027s stats.\n\n**SCOREBOARDS**\n\n*HIGHEST ALTITUDE - STOCK*\n\n- LittleBlueGaming: 82 m\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n*HIGHEST VELOCITY - STOCK*\n\n- LittleBlueGaming: 98.1 m/s\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n*HIGHEST ALTITUDE - MODDED*\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n*HIGHEST VELOCITY - MODDED*\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n**MY ENTRY**\n\nI\u0027ll post my more serious attempt later, but this will do for now.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
