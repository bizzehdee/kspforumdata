Don\\\u0027t go too fast with the launch vehicle, it can reach 60 m/s but it collapses very easily at that speed.\n\n2. Watch out when you adjust the hinges on the plane for takeoff, right is good, left is bad.\n\n3. That booster is there to keep the plane moving while the jet engine warms up, make sure the throttle is at max when you launch.\n\n4. There\\\u0027s a chance the booster will knock your engine off when you decouple, be careful, you can make an unpowered landing though.\n\nAnd that\\\u0027s it hope you all enjoyed it, and have fun using it!"},{"CreatedByName":"SasquatchM","CreatedById":11888,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-23T04:46:48Z","Content":"Well, here is an even more overdone launcher.
