To just toss a spitball at the wall, what do you think about - after you\u0027ve completed the challenge - allowing a certain number of building upgrades (I think 3 or 4 total), one of them must be R\u0026D and the others (2 or 3 of them) can be any you so choose. Then, you have to complete the tech tree (Up to the 500 cost nodes) without upgrading anything else.\n\u003E 3 (in addition to R\u0026D)is an interesting number. Do you want maneuver nodes? Then you can\u0027t have \u003E30 parts AND \u003E18 tons. Do you want decent ships? Then no maneuver nodes for you!\n\u003E \n\u003E You could call it the ... I don\u0027t know ... Bronze Age Challenge. Or the Hunter Gatherer Challenge. Or something.\n\u003E \n\u003E As I said, just spitballing.\n\u003E \n\u003E Oh, and the sub-title to episode 3 is \u0022Space Is Hard.\u0022\n\nIntresting although I could easily work withen the part limit with a higher weight limit. You can loft a decent amount of fuel on just a few parts when you can use the biger tanks/engiens. Can always send up smaller partheavy modules (science/power packages) on a dedicated launch to link up with the drive sections. Personaly I think I could max out the rest of the tree just upgradeing the RND although it would take a long time. The bigest issue is the number of launches it would take to send craft anywhere considering max payload is only 2-3 tons with t1 buildings. Could link things togeather with JR ports if you send up a truss wired up with fuel lines to hang fuel tanks off of and were creative with locking/unlocking tanks to keep things balanced.\n\nI think my picks in order of priority would be RnD, Launchpad (weight limit up), Tracking center (patched conics). a 4th would be a tossup between more parts, manuver nodes, or a second RnD. I can live with 30 part limits if I can put a large enough tank under what I need to send up. I can live without manuver nodes, they nice but extra Dv can cover for that with patched conics. I can even live with astronaut complex alowing for Eva\u0027s by being clever and sticking an external command seat in a utility bay and moveing the kerbal pre launch. a 3rd RnD is intresting just for the final tier of parts opening up extra options.\n\nif I had just 1 RnD unlock and nothing else I\u0027d probably grab comand seats ASAP and load bob into a service bay and send him biome hoping on minmus. Send up a couple of fuel pods(resorce transfer ftw) for the maned probe ship to refuel off of and you could unlock a good chunk of the remaining tech tree in a single pass. He can grab and reset experiments from inside his gheto command pod."},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T22:47:13Z","Content":"merendel,\n\n I was thinking about the same, but my first priority after R\u0026D would be the astronaut complex. Soil samples and EVA reports are worth a lot of science. Since the Kerbin system itself contains all the science necessary to unlock everything, patched conics are really just a luxury IMO.\n\n The mass limit would be a headache for manned exploration of the Mun and Minmus. My next priority would be to eliminate that with a pad upgrade, but I could still get it done within the 18t weight limit if I just had to (would get grindy).\n\n After that, it\u0027s pretty much gravy. I\u0027d pick the tracking station for patched conics and target tracking just because it\u0027d make everything so much easier. \n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-15T22:59:20Z\u0022 title=\u002207/15/2015 10:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GoSlash27**"},{"CreatedByName":"Moesly_Armlis","CreatedById":112247,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T00:44:45Z","Content":"I really like the idea of going further but the cave man thing should stay constant. That means no upgrades.\n\nThe only thing is that when the vehicle goes to the launchpad it is full of liquid fuel which usually takes the majority of the weight.\n\nTransferring fuel could solve this issue but them the R\u0026D needs upgrading.\n\nIn my rough reasoning a caveman should be able to get all the points to complete the tech tree without the need for upgrades.\n\nBesides its only 15730 SP (13\\*160\u002B12\\*300\u002B11\\*550\u002B4\\*1000).\n\nA craft assembled on the launchpad and then filled with fuel would make some interesting vessels with caveman flight characteristics.\n\nI tested this out the other night and it was not that hard to fly and very entertaining to watch.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
