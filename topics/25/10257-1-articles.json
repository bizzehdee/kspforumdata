Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to get the supplied research station as close to the KSC Kerbolith as possible.\n\nEDITED TO ADD (D\\\u0027OH! Almost forgot!): You must head straight up on SRBs (or vectored toward the Kerbolith). When they cut out, drop them, and get yourself there!\n\nParts Required:\n\n- [li]NovaSilisko\\\u0027s Solar Panel (Part of the BACE Construction Co. pack -- since Kerbal rockets end up putting out a lot of fire \u0026 debris pollution, KSC wants this station to be as green as possible, once in place)[/li]  \n[li]MechJeb[/li]  \n[li]Tiberon\\\u0027s NovaPunch RCS fuel tanks[/li]\n\nIf you can do it without the MechJeb, extra points!\n\nSince this is a distance test, the winner will be based on the *lowest* score. Non-use of MechJeb will subtract 25 points from your total score. Points are based on distance (1 meter per point).\n\nExample \u0026 Baseline reference:\n\nWhen I first conceived of this challenge, I was using a different engine with slightly higher thrust (220, instead of the stock part in the current design, which is 200). With the use of MechJeb, I was able to land within 112.6 meters of the Kerbolith, so I\\\u0027d have scored 112.6 points. I have NOT been able to get closer than 450 meters with the current design.\n\nTop Five Challengers:\n\n[list type=decimal]\n\n[li][/li]\n\n[li][/li]\n\n[li][/li]\n\n[li][/li]\n\n[li][/li]"},{"CreatedByName":"wired2thenet","CreatedById":18275,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-07T00:10:44Z","Content":"Oh, and there should be enough fuel for 2-4 \u0027hops\u0027 to get you closer ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) Each hop, however, will at \u002B10 to your score."},{"CreatedByName":"Riplash","CreatedById":24040,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-07T00:23:57Z","Content":"What\\\u0027s a Kerbolith?"},{"CreatedByName":"wired2thenet","CreatedById":18275,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-07T00:30:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What\\\u0027s a Kerbolith?\n\n[http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=9585.0](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=9585.0)\n\nThere\\\u0027s a number of them on Kerbin (called Kerboliths), and a number of them on the Mun (known as Munoliths).\n\nI just managed to get within 39.1 meters of the target (MechJeb \u002B1 hop)"},{"CreatedByName":"dylan1234","CreatedById":22381,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-09T06:56:48Z","Content":"do you get extra points subtracted if you go near the kerbolith in a geostanairy orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"wired2thenet","CreatedById":18275,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-09T09:42:08Z","Content":"Seeing as it is a difficult challenge with the supplied rocket and doing it withOUT going into orbit, I\\\u0027ll give -10 points to anyone who can get closer even if they go into orbit first.\n\nI\\\u0027ve been attempting this challenge about 20x now, and only about 4 or 5 have been successful without going into orbit first.
