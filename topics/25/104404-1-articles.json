The problem is, the Mobile Crane I\u0027ve designed to move the pieces of the puzzle around is very oddly shaped, and my rudimentary construction skills are making it incredibly hard to get into Orbit.\n\n![mdeT4Q8.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/mdeT4Q8.jpg)\n\nThis is the actual crane, and as you can see, it not the most aerodynamic object. My challenge/plea to you guys is to create a stable launch vehicle that can get it to the Mun\n\nHeres the download link; [http://www./download/24na4nx1iv7a4rc/Heavy_Lift_RC.craft](http://www./download/24na4nx1iv7a4rc/Heavy_Lift_RC.craft)\n\nYoull need Kerbal Attachment System, Kerbal Foundries, and Mechjeb for the download to work\n\nThanks!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-18T22:36:12Z\u0022 title=\u002204/18/2015 10:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Morzaniant**"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T05:41:49Z","Content":"Do you use FAR?

If you use FAR, I can promise it will not work. I also strongly suggest you get [Kerbal Joint Reinforcement](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55657) (I use KJR, you might need to add more struts if you don\u0027t. I did add quite a few anyway.) and the [Stock Bugfix Mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97285) before you try to use that thing. Once you\u0027ve landed, you\u0027ll need to throttle up and quickly stage off the landing assembly. It\u0027ll fly off on it\u0027s own and crash somewhere. I had ~450 dV left over when I landed, if you find you need a little more, just add some boosters to the outer mainsail stacks. Also: Add some solar panels, and go real easy on the brakes once you\u0027re on the Mun. \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
