The objective is to build an aircraft to fly around Kerbin, and collect biome-science. Distinctions will be awarded for particularly cool/useful types of designs, and should be your goal for this challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Rules:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimple. Build a manned plane, blimp, or helicopter (or other weird contraption- but NO ROCKETS, it should be held up by aerodynamic lift or buoyancy...) to fly around Kerbin. The craft should be able to take off and land around Kerbin, and be *primarily* constructed out of one piece (detachable landers/rovers, etc. and drop-tanks are allowable, provided they can be re-attached to the main craft). The emphasis on this challenge is on utility and efficiency, rather than raw speed/performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft should be designed for extended use- so \u003Cstrong\u003Ethere should be a way to refuel it.\u003C/strong\u003E That means either a docking port or a KAS port or something like that somewhere on the vessel. It should be reasonably accessible, although I won\u0027t make you demonstrate refueling unless it doesn\u0027t look like the refueling port can actually be accessed...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll mods are allowed that use *realistic technology*. I particularly recommend checking out the FAR, Firespitter, and KSP-Interstellar mods for this challenge. Note that no fusion/antimatter reactors or DT-Vista engines may be used from KSP-Interstellar (I don\u0027t count those are \u0022realistic\u0022), nor any type of fusion or antimatter engine/reactor from any other mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current list of distinctions will probably be expanded in the future, so check back from time to time if you want to complete this challenge again for new distinctions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease post screenshots throughout your flight. Make sure to capture any events that might be deemed significant (such as landing, takeoff, detachment of a cargo, etc.). Overall, the more screenshot coverage the better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EDisctinctions:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWho needs fuel?\u003C/strong\u003E Build a craft that never requires refueling. NO INFINIGLIDERS OR EXPLOITS. This generally means some sort of electric-propeller design, a KSP-Interstellar thermal turbojet design (nuclear reactor fuel, due to its *extremely* slow consumption rate, won\u0027t DQ an entry), or a craft that can create new fuel from the atmosphere (as with a KSP-Interstellar or Karbonite Atmospheric Scoop). No craft with drills or requiring them to be splashed down in the ocean will be counted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWatch out for the canopy Goose!\u003C/strong\u003E Build a craft that has some form of ejection-seat or other emergency-escape system.

Kerbal Attachment System (with grabbable radial chutes), and EVA parachute mods work equally well for this. Demonstrate the system in action. *Hint* this will be easier if your plane is at high altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETime to drive!\u003C/strong\u003E Build a craft with a detachable rover.

The cargo does not have to be re-attachable, but must be useful (no single-use empty drop-tanks as \u0022cargo\u0022 please...) The craft MUST NOT LAND to drop off its cargo. Flight Manager for Reusable Stages will help IMMENSELY with high-altitude drops, as both the plane and cargo must survive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECargo Plane-\u003C/strong\u003E Develop a PLANE that can carry at least 10 tons of cargo at a time, and safely deploy it either by para-drop or on the ground.

Must be re-attachable after the main plane has landed, or capable of flying back to the main plane while it is in the air and re-docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWe can take this thing to orbit!\u003C/strong\u003E Your craft also doubles as a spaceplane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAtmospheric Specialty-\u003C/strong\u003E Your aircraft CANNOT fly to orbit on its own, and relies entirely on air-breathing engines or propellers (no RAPIER/SABRE!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThis thing works on Duna-\u003C/strong\u003E Your aircraft is also capable of flying/landing and taking-off on Duna (HINT: if an aircraft can achieve level flight at over 12,000 meters without use of oxygen-breathing engines, it will generally also work on Duna.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDuna Outpost Support Craft-\u003C/strong\u003E Your aircraft is capable of moving \u003Cstrong\u003Euseful\u003C/strong\u003E cargo around on Duna (fuel, machinery, etc.) \u003Cstrong\u003EKerbals\u003C/strong\u003E are considered useless cargo!

Drop-tanks MUST be used with Deadly Re-entry, to prevent players from dropping tanks that would normally burn up on sub-orbital trajectories, and MUST be reusable as normal. I *highly* recommend utilizing KSP-Interstellar Thermal Turbojets and a Microwave Beamed Power infrastructure for this distinction (fusion/antimatter reactors are banned, and fission reactors are too heavy).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKerbin\u0027s Every Nook and Cranny-\u003C/strong\u003E Build a craft that is capable of landing and taking off on every TRADITIONAL (non-building) biome on Kerbin. This includes water biomes- although the craft may propel itself to land before taking off again. To earn this distinction, you must land and take off from: a standard biome (like Grasslands), one of Kerbin\u0027s mountain ranges, the polar ice caps (difficult as they are COMPLETELY flat, and far away from the KSC), and at least one lake, river, or ocean. Craft must be able to return to the KSC intact from all of these biomes (so if your fuel-burning jet/helicopter can only take off from a mountain when almost completely out of fuel, and has no way to create fuel from the atmosphere, no Distinction for you.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESSTOL/VTOL-\u003C/strong\u003E Your aircraft is \u0022Super-Short Take-Off and Landing\u0022 or \u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022 capable. SSTOL\u0027s must be able to take off within 3 craft-lengths of their starting-point, on level ground, to qualify. VTOL\u0027s take off vertically, obviously. Each is a separate distinction- and VTOL replaces SSTOL as the superior distinction. *HINT* mostly only ultralight propeller planes will be able to achieve SSTOL. Otherwise, try and build a VTOL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERapid Landing Approach\u003C/strong\u003E Your craft has the capability to rapidly line up a landing-approach and safely land by EITHER diverting more than 50% of its normal forwards-thrust retrograde for an extended period of time (HINT: Firespitter propellers have the capability to reverse thrust-direction), firing more than 100% of its normal forwards thrust retrograde just before or after landing (i.e. retro-rockets), or deploying \u0022drag chutes\u0022 (RealChutes mod helps with this- parachutes won\u0027t auto-cut on landing). Retro-rockets and drag chutes must be demonstrated on high-speed landings of over 120 m/s or half maximum cruising velocity at 4000 meters, whichever is lower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESuccessful Entries:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98808-The-Utility-Aircraft-Challenge?p=1522582\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1522582\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVigelius\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E- Cargo Plane, Atmospheric Specialty\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98808-The-Utility-Aircraft-Challenge?p=1531738\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1531738\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELaie\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E- \u0022We can take this thing to orbit!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98808-The-Utility-Aircraft-Challenge?p=1531618\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1531618\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVoculus\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E- VTOL, Landing Pod, \u0022Time to drive!\u0022, Atmospheric Specialty\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98808-The-Utility-Aircraft-Challenge?p=1537906\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1537906\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGloriousWater\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E- \u0022Watch out for the canopy Goose!\u0022, Atmospheric Specialty\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EP.S.\u003C/strong\u003E Have fun with this challenge!

Now I have fought and been defeated by it again:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/Bb3WH\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/Bb3WH\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least that proves I can fly another plane into my beast and it will be thoroughly unconcerned!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other news, I\u0027ve made an attempt to pick up more achievements:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/vY0L7\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/vY0L7\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a big TTNeverunload user, which works great when the skydiver is in the air but seems to cut out the moment he touches the ground and causes the plane to vanish. Fortunately I have a quicksave to hand; this will just have to serve as a proof of capability. I suspect you may have guessed what is coming next...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I guess you were going for \u0022Time to bail out!\u0022?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, your plane can\u0027t disappear for that distinction though (obviously, that wouldn\u0027t be useful for actual operations around Kerbin- say to para-drop Kerbals to hook up a surface base: something I\u0027ve actually used para-crop planes for before...) So you need to try different mods, or drop the Kerbal while gliding low\u002Bslow, and only deploy the parachute really close to the ground (or have the plane circle around while the Kerbal falls within loading-distance...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid you try using Flight Manager for Reusable Stages to get around your plane disappearing? It\u0027s an excellent system when dropping cargo- and my guess is that it work with dropping Kerbals as well...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-13T01:54:18Z\u0022 title=\u002211/13/2014 01:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
