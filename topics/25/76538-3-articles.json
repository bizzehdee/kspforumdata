As you can see in the cropped image here, all four of the tug robots are connected with a stack decoupler, I flipped those upside down so the left over part stays attached to the center portion rather than the tug. The upper docking port is underneath that so it is not visible until the unit is decoupled. Each unit gets detached one at a time by hitting space. Once a unit is detached you will want to switch to it and turn on the SAS and RCS and stop it from drifting or else it will slowly drift backward away from the main ship. On these modules I went with surface PVs and batteries to avoid having an excess of parts sticking off of the sides such as retractable PVs which enables the tugs to get in close and attach to other parts. I will also note that the two tugs that have a liquid fuel engine also have two chutes on them to enable returning small parts and even capsules holding kerbals safely to the surface but I have not tested that so would recommend quick save and try to aim for water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso don\u0027t forget to activate the engine while throttled down or else you will take off once you turn it on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EaztgUk.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EaztgUk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"manni01","CreatedById":109903,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-09T10:12:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022advil\u0022 data-cite=\u0022advil\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Emanni01: Completely separate from the competition I love that your tug somewhat resembles an R2 unit \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Or maybe I\u0027m just seeing what I want to see.. the fact that you were able to incorporate all different sizes of docking ports puts you ahead of the rest of us because rather than purpose build, this tug can just go up and grab onto whatever it needs to.

If I was planning an orbital station at Duna for example I would need more fuel to get one of these guys there but it would get the job done once there.

This does not include docking a non standard item to a space station core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I don\u0027t, however, see why you complain. Redesigning to have a standard port is no big thing. just do it. It doesn\u0027t matter to me if you have all three sizes or just one on the end item. See my flying gold plated pig if you want to see and omnibus tug with all 4 docks/grapers. ;-) \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/xrrwjs2sdmd2xc7/FP%20Tug.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/xrrwjs2sdmd2xc7/FP%20Tug.zip\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/zz2cbzxbwz3njhg/FP%20Tug.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/zz2cbzxbwz3njhg/FP%20Tug.zip\u003C/a\u003EBe inventive.
