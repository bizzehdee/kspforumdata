So, my thoughts going the way they do, I tried to use the moon to slingshot into a Very High Kerbin Orbit (which I will refer to as VHKO). There\\\u0027s a funny little thing that happens with high apoapsides - the higher they are, the less ? - v they take to make the same change in the altitude of the periapsis. While in Munar orbit, I burned to about 4.5 million meters. About 2 million meters out, I left the Mun\\\u0027s SOI, and was in a VHKO; right on the border between orbiting Kerbol and Kerbin (both the map view and the camera were spazzing out) It may be a bug, but that\\\u0027s a lagrangian point right there. Even with a tiny burn (.1 m/s of ? - v) it stopped. I don\\\u0027t remember what the Apoapside was but with only 30 m/s of ? - v, my periapsis had gone from 1.2 million meters to 0. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo while there may be no active langrangian points in the game, there are still bugs like this, which can be exploited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4m0n","CreatedById":5404,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-23T22:34:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ydoow\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ydoow\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo perhaps the best approach would be to put yourself at an equal orbit with the Mun, and just be ahead of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis way your orbital periods are very similar, and if it starts catching up to you, all you have to do is speed up\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I\\\u0027m playing among the SoIs right now and found out that strategy to be the best...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is my current attempt so far:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SPgWW.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SPgWW.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/F08wK.png\u0022 alt=\u0022F08wK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UGqR2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022UGqR2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XqgG4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XqgG4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ltaYL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ltaYL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JxvT3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022JxvT3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still have a lot of fuel and 2 full RCS tanks...
