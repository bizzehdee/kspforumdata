He is currently beeing kept on a small island near the sout pole. Rescue him as soon as possible, we cannot allow our competitors to learn about his new project, the Infinite Improbability Drive!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003ERules\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the island, there are several hostile targets as indicated on the map shown below. You can destroy or evade them with any method you like as long as you stick to the restrictions detailed below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hMryHyl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022hMryHyl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGeneral rules\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - To win, you need to return Professor Wernher von Kerman to KSC grounds alive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - The island offers no natural hiding obstacles. If you are detected, the mission fails immediately. If a kerbal or a vessel on the island enters an illuminated area, you will be detected. To prevent detection, you must do the mission during night-time, stay out of artificially lit zones and you may not use any parts that emit light (with engine exhaust and plane gears beeing the only exception). Prohibited parts include minor light sources like battery lights, ladder lights and ramjet intakes. During EVA, the lights must stay off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - If you want to jump right into the action, the scenario comes with a SPH vehicle \u0022Infiltrator Plane\u0022 that is capable of solving the mission with minimal destruction. \u003Cstrong\u003ESPOILER ALERT\u003C/strong\u003E, do not look at the vessel if you want to figure out how to solve the task for yourself!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Radar Tower\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - The radar has a range of 25km and immediately detects anything that is larger than a big orange fuel tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - You can avert detection with bigger vessels by staying below 100m altitude. If you destroy the tower, you must free the prisoner within 45 minutes or the mission fails due to missing routine reports from the tower to the prison.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Patrol Cars \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - The patrols detect anything within a distance of 1000m after 10 seconds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - The cars patrol within 10km distance of the prison. To emulate this, the mission fails if you stay in the patrolled area longer than 30 minutes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Every patrol you destroy adds 15 minutes to the time you are allowed to stay in the patrolled area. If you destroy all three, the patrol clock stops entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Prison Complex\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - The prison detects anything within a distance of 1000m that is 4m above ground level and weighs more than 0.2t, assuming that a kerbal weighs 0.05t. So, to prevent detection, any heavy vehicles should be as flat as possible (no ladder towers), and anything that is higher or flies should be extremely lightweight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - The prison has an outer wall. Only a kerbal infiltrator in EVA may pass the wall, anything else will be detected immediately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - You may not destroy any part of the prison walls/gates/towers or anything inside it until after you have freed the hostage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - The hostage is in the big tower within the inner walls. To free him, you need to reach the doors of the command pod without stepping into the lights, and without stepping on metal plates with pressure sensors (solar panels). Then, switch to the prison complex and activate EVA mode for the scientist. Now get out ASAP. You now have 20 minutes to leave the island (remember, the patrol clock is still ticking, and if you have not destroyed the radar tower you should stay out of its detection range as well).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - To win, return the professor to the KSC alive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EAchievements\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -\u003Cstrong\u003ERecon Duty\u003C/strong\u003E - launch a manned or unmanned mission to explore the prison and its surroundings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -\u003Cstrong\u003EInfiltrator\u003C/strong\u003E - reach the professor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -\u003Cstrong\u003EA winner is you\u003C/strong\u003E - win the scenario\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -\u003Cstrong\u003EMultipurpose Vehicle\u003C/strong\u003E - win the challenge with one launch without prior recon (and without looking at the included infiltrator plane).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -\u003Cstrong\u003ENight Stalker\u003C/strong\u003E - leave the radar tower and all three patrol cars intact\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -\u003Cstrong\u003EExplosions for Jeb\u003C/strong\u003E - destroy at least one patrol or the radar tower\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -\u003Cstrong\u003EDestruction Expert\u003C/strong\u003E - destroy all cars and the radar tower\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -\u003Cstrong\u003ERetialation Strike\u003C/strong\u003E - destroy the prison complex after leaving with the professor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -\u003Cstrong\u003EWheels on Fire\u003C/strong\u003E - reach a land speed of 150m/s or more\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -\u003Cstrong\u003EWater Runner\u003C/strong\u003E - use a boat, and reach a water speed of 100m/s or more \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -\u003Cstrong\u003EPermadeath Specialist\u003C/strong\u003E - Win the challenge without quickloading/restarting the flight or resetting the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ETechnical Stuff\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * I recommend using Kerbal Alarm clock to track the countdowns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * This is a scenario, download \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/9w0on6r85s971b5/IcyPrison.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis zip \u003C/a\u003Einto your saves/scenarios folder and unpack it using \u0022unpack here\u0022.
