Though impossible with conventional engines, with propellers it might be possible. Such a craft would need to have:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-At least 4km/s of delta v (a mass fraction of at least 3.2, assuming an aerospike was used)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-A propeller that could get the craft to an altitude of at least 25km on Eve (about 8km on Kerbin), preferably going\u00A0100-200m/s at maximum height\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis seems on the very edge of possibility, but i\u0027ve seen people do some incredible things with stock propellers, so i\u0027m holding out hope that it can be done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m working on it too (no pictures yet). The best i\u0027ve been able to do while getting a mass fraction close to the target is 80m/s in level flight, while an optimal plane would probably have an airspeed close to 250.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood luck and Godspeed. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-10T18:01:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been working on this as well. A couple of things to consider:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nFor optimal drag characteristics, your prop should be able to deploy between a minimum and maximum pitch so you can light up your engines while you\u0027re still in-atmo.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe Dart has only 6.3% better \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E than the Skipper, but the Skipper has 20% better \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E and gimbaling, so the Skipper (perhaps paired with a couple of LV-Ns) might be a better option for main propulsion. The Rhino beats both, but it may be too big for your purposes, depending on the size of your propeller.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf possible, your propeller should use a bearing mechanism that can be reattached in orbit, so you don\u0027t warp and lose it, and so that it can be refueled and sent back down for another trip. A pair of small docking ports might work if you fire a pair of Spiders to push the ports back together.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fourfa","CreatedById":151713,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-10T21:21:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe shielded docking port and Claw have both been used to re-dock stock bearing mechanisms, without having to translate the rotor\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
