I propose a challenge: get into an orbit that will take your spacecraft ***through*** the arch. It doesn\\\u0027t necessarily have to be stable, but be moving at orbital velocity when you pass through it.\n\nEasy? NO! I have serious doubts that anyone is going to do this, but whoever does deserves a shiny medal.\n\nScreenshots are required; preferably multiple of the event. Make sure you\\\u0027ve got your speed indicator in view. Videos would be even better.\n\nSo now that I have you all thinking I\\\u0027m crazy, please go prove me wrong. Have fun! ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"FishyFishy13","CreatedById":21494,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-21T03:09:43Z","Content":"It\\\u0027s not impossible, i did it with.my rocket and allot of rcs.

I tried this, got into an orbit close to the arch, and then gave up and landed. Then my landing legs sank into the sand and exploded."},{"CreatedByName":"r_rolo1","CreatedById":26192,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-21T19:42:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Pics?\n\n[http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=12368.0\\\u0027](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=12368.0%5C)\n\n This is one of the 3 or 4 threads that popped about it yesterday ( I also happened to discover one before seeing it posted ). So far there were two discovered, both:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Both are in the Mun side that faces Kerbin between the equator and 15\u00C2\u00BAN and both are in the ridges of craters. Also both are oriented W-E ( meaning that any orbit will have to come from north or south to pass through them ) and both are pretty visible from orbits up to 100 km if you are really looking ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nAnyway, I\\\u0027ve tried and it ended in tears ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif) The only good thing is that their basis is pretty high terrain so in theory it should be possible for someone with a steadier hand than mine ( or a joystick ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) )"}]}
