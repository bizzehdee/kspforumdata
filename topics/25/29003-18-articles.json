The surface team exhausted their surface supplies on day 711 and ascended to the Phase B Kerbin return craft in Duna orbit. During their short stay in Duna orbit while awaiting their Kerbin return window, the Ike landing mission earned no points in the challenge, but was successful all the same.

This second attempt at this challenge was intended to have a much higher score for Kerbals on Duna, but issues with how docking-port crossfeed (didn\u0027t) work meant that a second landing team was not feasible. Then, complications with the 0.21 -\u0026gt; 0.22 update caused the loss of the Duna return craft, requiring another one be sent out to Duna as a replacement. These problems caused the \u0027Mission Execution\u0027 score to be just \u00271\u0027, but did earn scores of \u00272\u0027 for both \u0027Crew Safety\u0027 and \u0027Mission Robustness\u0027, since everyone made it back despite losing two spacecraft and one rover. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, this was a good rehearsal for the mission profile of returning crews to Kerbin using different spacecraft which got them there and doing precise inter-planetary orbital insertions.
