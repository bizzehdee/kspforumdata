Now I\u0027ve realised what\u0027s going on it can be solved on that particular Far10C by moving the rear landing gears closer together and the center air-brake back and down slightly. That has the effect of sealing what was a hollow box at both ends so it becomes solid and back to the expected 0.21 wave drag.\n\nAs for the low AoA and generally terrible handling it just met the G requirements so I posted it.

I don\u0027t know why, but the Flanker just... *feels* stumpy, but it\u0027s a lot of fun. I thought your landing gear arrangements felt a touch odd, though. Really wide, and low in the back, which I guess works alright. Of your planes, my favourites to fly are the Rafale and the trainer, both of which will do what you tell them to. I can see the trainer being an absolute terror in a dogfight.\n\nI noticed some built-in inefficiencies in the Rafale, so I\u0027m giving it a major makeover. It\u0027s not really going to be a repro by the time I\u0027m done with it. So far, I\u0027ve widened the body to make full use of the air intakes and their ducting, as well as leveled the nacelles with the fuselage and wings, while also removing that oddly placed intake on the tailplane. This dropped the wave drag from 1.31 to 1.2. It still feels a little sluggish, but I think some area ruling might be able to help out here.\n\nOf curiosity, what did you use to colour your planes?\n\nMagically, aerodynamics are working like they used to again, even though... nothing should have changed significantly, so I\u0027m totally baffled. All of the planes, yours and mine, seem to be flying as we designed them, ridiculous AoA values and all.\n\nUpdate: So, I pitted the Spite against the Rafale, guns only, and it won three fights undefeated... so I pitted it against 2 Rafales at the goading of my friend, and... it was surprisingly even. The Rafale duo won 3 of 5 fights, and lost 2. I\u0027m going to have to pit the Spite against the Flanker next.\n\nFurther update: The Flanker is scary maneuverable, but I couldn\u0027t exactly call it even, because the precoolers kept ripping themselves off due to aerodynamic stresses, for some reason. Might want to look into that.\n\nFurther further update: The USAF fighter is amazing. It\u0027s ability to maneuver at just about any speed is ridiculous... It\u0027s been beating the Spite about 70% of the time in guns only duels.\n\nOn another note, my aerodynamics started acting wonky again, which is weird, because it occurred within the same session of play, causing the Spite to start stalling at around 17\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, rather than around 25\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. I haven\u0027t figured out any methods of reproducing it, so I can\u0027t really even bring it to ferram4\u0027s attention and expect a result.\n\nHmm... I thought random asymmetric stalls were fixed... I think I\u0027m just going to hope for the wing overhaul coming soon.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-12T07:20:12Z\u0022 title=\u002209/12/2015 07:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheHengeProphet**"},{"CreatedByName":"CrisK","CreatedById":133945,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T15:26:17Z","Content":"@TheHengeProphet, Thanks! I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m happy that you took the time to fly all of my planes!\n\nI changed the landing gear setup from the previous setup so that I can land in remote areas and perform short landings on aircraft carriers in Kerbinside and the Martime pack.\n\nIf you want to make the Rafale feel less sluggish, just increase the control percentage on the canards to 6 or 8. The AI pilot does not fly the Rafale well - I would expect it to loose to your Spite 100% of the time.\n\nI used [Kerbpaint](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/50008-0-23-KerbPaint-Paint-layering-for-parts-%28September-23rd%29-%28Same-Old-Still-Works!%29) to color the crafts.\n\nThe Flanker and USAF are extremely maneuverable at any speed, and they rarely stall. As a result, both make good AI drones. I snuck a probe into each of their bodies so they should be setup to act as drones. Unfortunately, the Flanker is a bit fragile. I\u0027m aware of that problem - it\u0027s because I removed the front and rear struts for aesthetic reasons. If you add them back (strut the precoolers together, then strut the precoolers to the main body in the front and back) its durability becomes unrealistically good. However, this adds 8 more parts and looks bad.\n\nThe Flanker is a bit stumpy. The tail needs to be extended by 1/3rd and the intake/precooler/engines need to be moved back. However, there\u0027s no stock part that looks good as an extended tail section. I used the structural tubes from Infernal Robotics rework and they look great in this role, but I\u0027d like to keep the mod requirement for each craft to a minimum.\n\nThe USAF is as close to perfect as I can get performance-wise. It\u0027s also very light on parts.\n\nThat weird stall bug has something to do with B9 wings. Ferram and I exchanged a number of posts about it, and he concluded that it was a B9 wings quirk. I agree - I haven\u0027t been able to replicate the bug with stock wings."},{"CreatedByName":"TheHengeProphet","CreatedById":14895,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T18:40:12Z","Content":"Except it\u0027s been happening with my Spite, primarily, which only uses stock wings, so... maybe I should strip it down again and send it to him, because some time mid-flight it started stalling the leading-edge wing parts, wherein I could not previously get it to stall at all. I\u0027ll have to strip it down and see if it continues to do it on a completely stock model.\n\nThe asymmetric stalling happens glaringly obviously on my Black Mamba and Devil Ray planes, which heavily use B9 PWings, which explains a lot... Ugh.\n\nOh, so... soon I\u0027ll upload my updated Rafale, of which the AI uses much better than previously (apparently). Also, when I\u0027ve been having the planes dogfight, I\u0027ve been using full thrust on the engines, because it get almost boring watching the low-power dogfights.\n\nOkay, turns out it was that the delta wings have their attachment point rather far back and were flexing due to aerodynamic stress, causing them to exceed stall angle, but in a strange and unpredictable manner. Struts fixed it. I was also able to get back the mass gained from the struts by lowering the mass on the trailing wing body, so the plane still weighs only 9.2t, and for now, I\u0027m keeping it there out of spite of rule 9.\n\nThanks for linking to Kerbpaint!\n\nWell, I can\u0027t get Kerbpaint to work with any reasonable functionality at all, so... oh well.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-12T21:27:15Z\u0022 title=\u002209/12/2015 09:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheHengeProphet**"},{"CreatedByName":"NotAnAimbot","CreatedById":151034,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T20:17:19Z","Content":"Hi guys, trying to rebuild my fighter jet inventory after I had to uninstall Windows.\n\nAlthough I\u0027m getting better at setting the controls\u0027 sensitivity as to not rip my planes apart when turning, does anyone know how to make a plane even sturdier?

I\u0027ll add them tomorrow.\n\nFirst: \u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201C\u00C3\u0192\u00C5\u201C can be spelled as AeOeUe. It\u0027s Luftjaeger or Luftj\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A4ger. Allthough seriously, you\u0027d usually just say J\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A4ger.\n\n2. Most importand thing is to increase wing mass/strength if you want a robust plane.\n\nYou can also clip struts so you can\u0027t see them. Often enough a must when using B9PW due to too much flex.\n\nCoM and CoL aren\u0027t as importand anymore. FAR analysis tools (the pretty graphs and scary looking numbers) are importand.\n\nAlso: green line is your cross section, yellow basicly how good/bad you area ruled. Blue is pressure coefficient, allthough I am not sure in what way that matters, because I have no clue.\n\nKeep in mind that using fairings as nose section usually leads to severe overheating problems at high speeds.\n\nAnd if you do the top speed shots, open FAR flight data. That shows whether you\u0027re able to keep that speed using your engine power."},{"CreatedByName":"TheHengeProphet","CreatedById":14895,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-13T09:19:59Z","Content":"Probably best to keep the FAR flight data open in general, unless you are starved for screen real estate due to low resolution.
