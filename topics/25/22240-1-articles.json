The densities in KSP are a little bit higher with the same gravity as it\u0027s real-life counterpart. That would explain how the Kerbals evolved so short and stubby. lol Kerbol itself, being a \u0022red dwarf\u0022 of sorts is significantly smaller than what it should be compared to Sol. That means the Neptune equivalent in KSP would orbit at around 395 ot 400 billion meters accounting for eccentricity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
