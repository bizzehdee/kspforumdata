It can be decreased slightly if you launch directly into rendezvous orbit. Then there is another mission that would be insane past Mun or Minmus, and it is completely based upon how much delta-v and accelleration the ship has. Brachistrone transfers are essentially point-and-click orbits. You keep accelerating halfway, then turn the other was any slow down. The transfer time is based upon how quickly your rocket accelerates and if it has to shutdown its engine partway to conserve Delta-V.\n\nIt would be really cool to see someone do an Eve flyby or orbit without using the map view. They\u0027d probably need DistantObjectEnhancement so they could see it from a distance. Several people have gone to Mun and Minmus without map view, take Abyssal Lurker\u0027s example for his Old School series. (By now, THAT series is really old school, but you get the picture. No map view. Each are done in 0.14 and 0.15 respectively, but are simulating 0.8.)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/9sezyLhMaUg?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/MLpU1FoG20k?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T14:47:19Z","Content":"No visual enhancement necessary. Use kerbol to find your phase angle reference then it is just some math, geometry and transfer window tables to hit eloo. It would be the most boring video ever launch into a 71x71 get the high noon point visually. an hour doing math to calculate orbit and time to burn and amount to burn. No idea how to do adjustment burns so I would probably just quick save and reload until I hit it first try."}]}
