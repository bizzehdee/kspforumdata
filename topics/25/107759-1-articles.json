On its 2 year birthday, no less. The goal here is simple: get as high as absolutely possible in 30 seconds. Run didn\u0027t go so well? Rocket didn\u0027t perform as expected? Well, you only spent 30 seconds flying it! Just go back and try again.\n\nMinimize drag, maximize speed. The idea is brilliantly easy- the execution may very well push both your engineering skills and your computer to the limits. \n\nRULES:\n\n1. This is a **stock** challenge. No mods may be used, with the exception of Kerbal Engineer Redux or mods that are purely aesthetic (eg, Universe Replacer). Mechjeb or similar mods *may* be used to autostage and pilot your ship. The cheats menu may not be used at any time. If you use any of the above mods, say so in your entry.\n\n2. Your rocket **must fit entirely within the VAB** when in launch configuration. This means I need to see a screenshot of it in the VAB with all parts clearly visible. Yes, this means you can lift your rocket up to the top with launch clamps.\n\n3. I\u0027ll be using the honors system here, since it\u0027s essentially impossible to check, but *please* **use the default aerodynamics settings** as of 1.0.2. This is to ensure a level playing field for all.\n\n4. The **resources tab should be visible** at all times during flight. Mechjeb or KER dV windows are also acceptable.\n\n5. I need **3** screenshots at the very minimum- in the VAB, on the pad, and at T\u002B30 seconds with the F3 menu visible. Videos are welcome.\n\n6. **Only minor clipping** will be tolerated. If you have a question about whether it\u0027s too much, it probably is. If you\u0027d really like my opinion, show me the rocket before you make a submission. Normally I\u0027m a fan of clipping, but since aerodynamics are such an important part of this challenge, I really need to limit it.\n\nCLIPPING IS ACCEPTABLE IF IT:\n\n-adds engines to an otherwise empty fuel tank\n\n-is a natural result of radial mounting (ie minor)\n\nCLIPPING IS UNACCEPTABLE IF IT:\n\n-adds engines inside engines or fuel tanks inside fuel tanks\n\n-adds more mass to a volume than it could normally hold\n\n-allows a part to function in a way that it does not normally function (doing this without clipping is OK)\n\n-allows the user to in any way circumvent atmospheric drag or heating that would normally be associated with the addition of a part\n\nEssentially, avoid anything other than engines inside empty fuel tanks.The ultimate decision as to whether clipping is acceptable or not is up to me. Keep it low or risk your entry being invalidated.\n\nOtherwise, anything goes. If you have a question about a rule, or think one should be added/removed/tweaked, *post* ***BEFORE*** *you make your submission* if you want me to count it! If your results are in question, I may ask for a craft file to test your ship with. If your results aren\u0027t reproducible, or you\u0027re unwilling or unable to submit the craft file, your entry will not be added to the OP.\n\nAnyone who breaks 70K in altitude may feel free to add this badge to their signature:\n\n![BptBeAs.png](http://i.imgur.com/BptBeAs.png)\n\nAlternatively, there\u0027s a \u0022clean\u0022 version:\n\n![HdmEvXe.png](http://i.imgur.com/HdmEvXe.png)\n\nNow, grab your boosters and go to ludicrous speeds!\n\nWINNERS CHARTS\n\n1.[juzeris](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119669-Stock-The-30-Second-Altitude-Challenge-Revived-for-1-0%21?p=1926384\u0026viewfull=1#post1926384): 73,337m\n\n2.[obi\\_juan](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119669-Stock-The-30-Second-Altitude-Challenge-Revived-for-1-0%21?p=1924423\u0026viewfull=1#post1924423): 60,316m\n\n3.[totalitor](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119669-Stock-The-30-Second-Altitude-Challenge-Revived-for-1-0%21?p=1951176\u0026viewfull=1#post1951176): 59,622m\n\n4.rc dude: 46,392m\n\n5.cryogen: 46,055m\n\n6.Kelderek: 45,370m\n\n7.totalitor: 40,931m\n\n8.cybersol: 40,307m\n\n9.JO3: 38,688m\n\n10.Squiggsy: 33,700m\n\nWORLD FIRSTS\n\nMore of these will be added as needed!\n\nFirst to break 30K **(1km/s average!)**:gm537\n\nFirst to break 40K:cybersol\n\nFirst to break 50K:juzeris\n\nFirst to break 60K**(2km/s average!)**:juzeris\n\nFirst to break 70K:juzeris\n\nFirst to break 75K:You?\n\nFirst to break 80K:Is this possible?\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nAn example entry:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
