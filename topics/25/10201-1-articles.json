Really complicated ships are effected much more.\n\nThe last kerbol mission I was on the kraken was quite bad, but this is because I was attempting to reverse the direction of my orbit to smack into kerbin at 18,000m/s (I didn\\\u0027t make it, not enough delta V), so needless to say my ship was quite large. However, I was still able to control my ship, mainly by exploiting what I call the time warp ASAS. If you jump to x5 warp for a second all your ships rotatiion and stuff stops, making it a lot easier when your controls are absolutely totalled by the kraken (At one point left arrow pulled me up, right arrow pulled me left, down pulled me right, and nothing pulled me down.)"},{"CreatedByName":"kacperrutka26","CreatedById":18849,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-15T18:09:54Z","Content":"It\\\u0027s not Kerbol, it\\\u0027s the sun.
