EVA construction is allowed to reconfigure your ship (you can even use docking ports for this purpose), but you can use only the actual parts of your ship. Once you left a part behind (over 1km distance), that part can\u0027t be used for the rest of the mission.\u00A0 There must be at least one kerbal onboard, which should be able to plant a flag at each landing and climb back into the vessel. The kerbal has to survive the final landing on Kerbin together with the command pod (or chair or whatever), no landing with the personal parachute.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think, this could be an interesting challenge, with a wide range of different approaches and strategies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThe ranking\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe major score is the number of the visited celestial bodies. Because each celestial body counts only once, and no \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E is allowed, it doesn\u0027t make sense to land anywhere more than once, except Kerbin. The mission starts and ends on Kerbin, but it counts only for the scoring, if you land there during the mission, between landing on two other celestial bodies. To get onto the leaderboard, you have to achieve at least 3 points. I think, the simplest tour would be Mun-Minmus-Gilly or Mun-Minmus-Ike, but if you want more points.... I\u0027m curious, which combinations will be favored.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the major score is the same, the order depends on the highest ranked body visited, if it\u0027s the same, then the second highest, and so on. The ranking of the celestial bodies are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEve--Kerbin--Tylo--Laythe--Duna--Moho--Vall--Eeloo--Mun--Dres--Ike--Bop--Minmus--Pol--Gilly\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf there\u0027s still a draw, that contender gets an advantage, who managed to land at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E at the end. There\u0027s no precision landing necessary. If your vessel (or a part of it) is still capable to transport your kerbal to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, that counts too, but it doesn\u0027t count, if the kerbal just swim or walk by itself to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf there\u0027s still a draw, the final ranking will be decided on the lower launch mass (without launch clamps).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStock and DLC parts and of course visual mods are allowed.
