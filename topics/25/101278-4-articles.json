Anyway, I have a question, are you working on any new payloads/subassemblies that I can help with? I\u0027m very unoriginal when I don\u0027t have a goal, but if you need help with something, I definitely would be able to help! Also, when\u0027s your next video going up, because the STS-4 video is so good!\n\nEdit: I think I am #5 on the leaderboards for highest orange fuel tank. My orbit was 202,483/202,442 which beats out totalitor, who is the current #5. Just letting you know, I know it\u0027s only 1k difference, so it doesn\u0027t really matter to me, but it would be pretty sick. Also, in that album ([http://imgur.com/gallery/q93Wp/new](http://imgur.com/gallery/q93Wp/new)) I get all the tier one (one star) badges except for commander, and I haven\u0027t been given them yet.

Maybe it\u0027s bugged? Weird. The shuttle should fly easy without having to adjust fuel amounts for any cargo (although cargo of 10-20 tons will require filling the central External Tank tank. If you do adjust fuel, leave the boosters alone except when lifting off with the STS Fuel Pod cargo (in which case filling the boosters is required if you hope to make it to orbit). Have you see the videos that show how to adjust fuel?

I think I\u0027m going to use it more often now that I have it.\n\nSecondly: My entry to this challenge. Took three shuttles before we had a successful completion. \n\nInexorable got creamed in orbit when I separated from the main booster tank and didn\u0027t really think before doing any sort of manoeuvring leading to a collision between orbiter and booster tank, RUD swiftly followed, but the crew capsule was still intact! And it probably had the best launch profile of my two exoatmospheric attempts. Was on course for a 230[ish] AP with only around 130dv to circularize on the OMS.\n\nImplaccable (inadvertently misspelt), was looking good. Until during booster separation and staging for their parachutes... When I got back to Implacable, I hit space bar again and staged my booster tank, I was in that staging blood lust fury frenzy zone. I wasn\u0027t even going to attempt the abort portion so I didn\u0027t read the rules for that. I got it back in one piece onto KSC Island, but I did dump the fuel tank by decoupling and rolling her inverted to throw the damn thing out, not realising I could use its contents to return. I guess I\u0027ll have to revisit this and then get it above 300km for the Commander bage.\n\nThird time\u0027s the charm with Indefatigable. Fuel Pod delivered to 211,489m x 211,589m orbit in Kerbin. It actually got closer than that, but I only have a screen shot of it with the 100m error. Returned to KSC Island - overshot so had to fly a downwind and a baseintofinal approach.\n\nSo as I understand it, I have met all requirements for Maiden Mission and have a valid entry for Fuel Pod delivery completing Mission Specialist and Pilot I. \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I tried it in stock KSP, and it remained nicely balanced all the way to delivering the fuel pod to a perfectly circular 150x150 orbit. I ditched the tank with fuel to spare, so could easily have gone higher. I like the way the fuel tank empties from the bottom and the boosters empty from the top - keeping everything nicely balanced. Why didn\u0027t I think of that?\n\nReentry and landing was also a breeze. I was a bit short of the runway, but as I still had half my monoprop left I used that to push me through.
