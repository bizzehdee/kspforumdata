I\\\u0027m about to drop a lander in the middle of the surface base that has 4 MKRPs (Munar Krew Recovery Pods) on it, which are designed to use linear RCS to fly one Kerbal to the station and then deorbit itself.

It uses the Truss from the damned robotics pack and the airbrake mod to emulate the parachute like part on the pod. When the brakes are deployed they apply enough drag to properly orient the craft but they are definitely not enough to save the pod. Applying upward rcs thrust at about 3000m leads to a safe touchdown. Due to the mod parts and number of thrusters used it might not qualify for the challenge, but I had fun with it and thought you guys might too.
