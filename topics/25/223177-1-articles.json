I have the following self-imposed Rules\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-\u00A0 \u00A0NO mods. I\u0027m using the full KSP1 updates including Breaking ground and Making history.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-\u00A0 As Green as possible. Not leaving descent stages etc on the surface of visited bodies\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-\u00A0 Doing things as quickly as possible in game time. This makes it particularly interesting as I\u0027m making ships that have high Delta V to do interplanetary missions so I can get there as quickly as possible without having to time-warp for days/weeks/months/years to get to optimum launch windows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-\u00A0 I\u0027m allowing myself to test craft on a sandbox game before committing in the career.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-\u00A0 I\u0027m regularly saving and I do allow myself the luxury of reverting back to an old save if I lose some Kerbins, The fact that I have lost a week of realtime progress is the punishment for my neglect (So far I have only had to do so once).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far I\u0027m up to day 120ish and I\u0027ve made a lot of progress. Tech tree is maxed out, Fueling facilities on the Mun and Minimus, Interplanetary ships on the way to Moho, Eve and Duna and the next interplanetary launch will be to Dres.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow the challenge that I\u0027ve set for myself is the Holy Grail, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFuel is not a problem. I have refineries (The Eve interplanetary mission includes a refinery for Gilly) so I can burn fuel as required.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe trick is getting to the Eve surface, and back, without discarding stages which is a hard task.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe obvious answer is an Eve \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E. It is possible, people have done it, but it\u0027s a very hard craft to get right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way I\u0027m planning to get around it is to build an Eve Single Stage to Suborbital, and then \u0022catch\u0022 the craft as it nears the Apoapsis\u00A0 with another craft that is in Orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat makes it hard is that the orbital Velocity at LEO is 3,200 m/s. The capture craft needs to do a rendezvous\u00A0burn to match the lander, where the difference in speed will be massive, and then do an orbital burn. All this has to happen in minutes whilst the lander is above Eve atmosphere. The difference in velocity is huge, which makes for a huge capture ship. Assuming Zero orbital velocity of the lander at Apoapsis you over 6K Delta V.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA ship with 6K Delta V is easy enough. Liquid fuel and lots of Nerv\u0027s. But this wont work as you simply can\u0027t burn fuel quickly enough to get enough velocity change in the timeframe of minutes. So it has to be a Conventional rocket. But this has the problem of the tyranny\u00A0 of the rocket equation whereby you just can\u0027t get 6K and have a fast enough burn to to the catch. The obvious answer is to discard stages but anything discarded will end up in a suborbital trajectory over Eve, which defeats the point of the exercise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now I\u0027m working on a lander craft that is as optimised as\u00A0 possible to get as close to orbit as possible. So far I have managed over 1K orbital velocity with the Apoapsis at 110km. My target is 2K, If I can get that then a \u0022catcher\u0022 with a starting Delta V of 3K should be able to do it. and this should be achievable.....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWIsh me luck, If I can do It I\u0027ll post a mission report with Photo\u0027s etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-22T21:26:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey said it couldn\u0027t be done!

This has been a \u0022head scratcher\u0022 for me. With this kind of mission there is the potential of having to \u0022loiter\u0022 at altitude whilst the catch-net craft gets into the right position before the final run to sub-orbital for the catch. the idea of burning energy reserves whilst waiting is pretty unappealing\u00A0 as this means more batteries, more mass etc for the sake of having wiggle-room before the final run. I did a lot of experiments with solar cells, working out the balance required to maintain\u00A0 positive power whilst doing so. I wasn\u0027t to concerned about them burning up on re-entry as I could position them in a \u0022safe\u0022 place. The obvious problem is drag and mass. Also solar cells work better the higher into the atmosphere you get. Which makes balancing tricky as you don\u0027t need as many solar cells to Loiter but getting to altitude in the first place either takes a long time or more batteries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI gave your suggestion re fuel cells some thought and tried that. Using fuel cells, the mass cost of the extra fuel is more than offset by the savings that are made\u00A0 by not having solar cells, and no drag from the solar cells is a bonus! Also less problems with energy management as they have a consistent output (as compared to Solar cells). In short it looks as though the best outcome for me will be a craft with Fuel cells.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve managed to get craft into a solid Suborbital, and managed a simulated catch. But I want to optimise it and do a full \u0022beginning to end\u0022 run before posting pics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-02-01T00:00:23Z\u0022 title=\u002202/01/2024 12:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Feb 1\u0022\u003EFebruary 1\u003C/time\u003E by Tony Swallow\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
