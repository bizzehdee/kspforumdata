Why is that?\n\u003E \n\nWhen the forum upgrade happened it broke all the links and I haven\u0027t gone through and fixed them, sorry.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 19 hours ago, DBowman said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I had been working on a Jool 5 [Apollo Style](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/109123-the-apollo-applications-program-10-edition/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=2195495) for the Apollo Applications Challenge ( recreate milestone Apollo missions, then go on to projected missions, and beyond - more fun that it might sound ). If you are using Apollo launchers the natural way to do it is to throw landers at Jool and then (irl after you know the landers are there...) throw 3 guys in \u0027a can\u0027 to do Moons of Jool Orbit Rendezvous - but that would fall outside the \u0027one big ship in Kerbin orbit to launch\u0027 part of this challenge.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Is it an artificial constraint to impose the \u0027one launch from Kerbin\u0027? Especially since you can send a second fuel only craft... Actually at what point can the ship drop landers? I mean there is deltaV benefit in not lugging landers around so they are (may be depending on design) better off doing individual moon encounters - so they can undock in Jool SOI? out of Kerbin SOI? The \u0027one ship Jool transfer burn\u0027 thing sounds a bit artificial given you almost always at least throw parts away that are specialised for particular moons. Don\u0027t get me wrong it\u0027s a great fun classic challenge exactly as it stands - but since you invited comment this is what occurs to me.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Also do you have a separate ranking for life supported attempts?\n\u003E \n\nYou can separate your ship once you\u0027re in Jool\u0027s SOI, as the rules stand now.  The one ship rule prevents multiple unrelated single-moon missions but there might be better ways.  Possibly \u0022All Kerbals on the mission must fly together while in the Sun\u0027s SOI.\u0022.  But putting together a giant mothership is very much part of the spirit of the challenge so I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s such a good idea to change.\n\nIt would have been a greater risk for Apollo if they sent the LM unmanned to the moon first, by that logic it might be a good idea to bring your landers with you on the way there.  It doesn\u0027t even seem that difficult with your setup so far, but you might need more fuel for your transfer stage and to get around the Jool system.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7 hours ago, Empyrean said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hi sdj64! Thankyou very much for your curation of this challenge. I\u0027ve been working on a plan for what might be considered a level above Jebediah\u0027s level, whereby I have to have one Kerbal on each moon simultaneously. It requires quite a payload (because the landers can\u0027t be reused), and quite a few transfers, but I\u0027ve had great fun designing it so far.

I think it is time for the challenge to change too.\n\u003E \n\nCool, one point for, one against.  Because the challenge has so much history every small change will make some people disappointed.  But I think that with the label for ISRU there is still some separation between ISRU and non-ISRU entries.  The change was to encourage different kinds of ISRU entries, and I think if you look back to 1.0, most of the entries were actually more complex than the ones that brought their fuel with them.  I did not intend to take away the motivation to avoid ISRU, I hope that most challengers realize that and there will continue to be a mix of entries with and without.  Remember that you\u0027re not competing against the other entries, but alongside them, so be creative and go your own way!\n\nAlso, I don\u0027t think that ISRU would allow an even lighter low mass challenger, given the weight of the unit itself and that you can\u0027t manufacture Xenon it would not be much of an advantage.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 17 hours ago, Derpiderp said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I did the Mission in the 1.1 prerealese.

It\u0027s one of Nerteas, and all it contains (if I recall correctly) is two command pods (an alternate 2.5m module and a 3.75m module) and two low-profile 3.75m engines (comparable to an upscaled Terrier, if you will).\n\u003E 2. How rigid are the rules regarding mods? The core of the mothership is a space station I have in KEO, which (because it wasn\u0027t originally designed for Jool-5) has eight (?) Near Future Electrical batteries on it, each containing 800 charge. I can\u0027t really see it being a balance issue at all, and I\u0027d be happy to block off electrical flow (the ship gets plenty of power from its forty-odd Gigantor panels, even at Jool), but I wanted to check anyway.\n\u003E 3. Does anyone remember the tonnage record for Jool-5? The largest I\u0027m aware of was Kidonia, which was around 800 tonnes on departure. Does anyone know of any larger missions?
