The (badmouth) AA-gun keep blowing me out of the skies when the craft load in. If I set the load in where i\u0027m not in range of the AA-guns it becomes a slideshow with one frame a second (feels like it) \u003Cp\u003EWith all the lag that is from the parts in memory why the HECK are all the AA-guns and Anti-Missile Laser set to 1, and the missiles 10 for seeking targets? I\u0027d expect them to be 20 or more on the AML\u0027s and AA and 30-40 on the missiles I\u0027ve never used them below those marks as they start to get overpowered. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMight have to just bite the bullet and just use stock and BDarmory and see how much extra lag my mods are causing. I\u0027ve tried ATM Aggressive just now and it was still lagging hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would try just stock and BD then.
