ISRU use is permitted (and encouraged).\n\nRules:\n\n1. \\*The craft may not lose any parts in flight, no decoupling or explosions allowed.\n\n2. The craft must lift off horizontally provided the body has an atmosphere.\n\n3. The craft must land horizontally provided the body has an amospheric preassure greater than 0.4 (i.e. Eve, Kerbin, Laythe).\n\n3. The craft must return to Kerbin and land successfully.\n\n4. The trip must be done without the aid of other vessels (No fuel transfers from other ships or refuelling stations, no connecting up to a mothership and flying to another body).\n\n5. Mining and refining ore is encouraged, but not required.\n\n6. Stock parts only.\n\n7. No you can\u0027t use the cheat menu, there\u0027s a reason it\u0027s called the cheat menu.\n\n\\*Resource scanning may be accomplished separately or you may detach a probe from your vessel (which must be recovered before returning to Kerbin). The total mass left in orbit must be under 2.5t.\n\nCraft will be scored by bodies successfully visited, 1 point for each.

It\u0027s within the spirit of the challenge. Mostly the rule was to prevent detaching a small lander and leaving the main craft in orbit.\n\nEdit: updated the rules, added a restriction that mass left in orbit must be under 2.5t (which should be more than enough for a medium sized probe).
