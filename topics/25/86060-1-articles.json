Its goal will be to simulate the developing of aircraft throughout the 20th and 21st century and beyond. We will start with little propeller pusher biplanes like Orville and Wilbur did, and slowly pass trough all the periods of our 20th century and face the future with 21st century aircraft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are the rules to the challenge:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Aircraft must be as cheap and simple as possible, except when you are trying to build things like this:\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupolev_ANT-20\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupolev_ANT-20\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Aircraft parts cannot be more modern than the era they are in ex: When we will start, use propeller engines, not jet engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) All mods are allowed. MechJeb won\u0027t help you fly a plane, and HyperEdit won\u0027t get it in the air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) All entries must have pictures or a video showing the aircraft in action. Multiple images are preferred\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Users can post contests or contracts in this thread. A contest can be something like an endurance flight or a race, and a contract can be a military one or a civil one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave fun, and let the journey begin...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-04T15:10:19Z\u0022 title=\u002210/04/2014 03:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MCA\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Krosulhah","CreatedById":83946,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-04T14:59:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBy the 21st century (Which is the one we\u0027re in currently), Nearly all planes are jets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re thinking of the 20th century.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MCA","CreatedById":113138,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-04T15:08:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDammit just saw that!
