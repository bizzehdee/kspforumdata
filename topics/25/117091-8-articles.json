I think you may have a problem where FAR isn\u0027t registering some parts and thus not creating lift. I have seen this before with some installs if it isnt installed correctly or there was an error in the install.\n\nHodo, the planes in question are from my pack in my sig, just with some modifications made so they should work for this comp and and with FAR. The chaanges made have been to the engines to make them regulation, and severly reducing weight with the wings, and assigning proper controls again because FAR defaults to the, every control surface does everything thing, that i quite personally hate and takes time to reset(By the time i have forgotten a few). Also FAR should register wings made out of lots of small parts right?"},{"CreatedByName":"TUKE","CreatedById":119239,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T23:54:30Z","Content":"Do the proc wings give better left than wings made of stock parts?

Because a fair few of the pics provided have had proc wings in them.\n\nNo, FAR uses their parameters just like it does with stock wings.\n\nAnd yes FAR accepts a big wing made out of small pieces.\n\nThe main difference is that Pwings are a lot more convenient, easier to tweak, look better and can have many more different shapes without clipping them too much.\n\nYour stock airplanes probably don\u0027t fly on FAR because you used the wrong principles to build them.\n\n\u0022The great rule of thumb\u0022 here is placing the main wings so that their lift is aligned with the center of mass, then add the tailplane and ensure stability.\n\nAfter that just fly it and tweak stuff until it\u0027s right."},{"CreatedByName":"TUKE","CreatedById":119239,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T00:21:00Z","Content":"Ok, but at the moment with FAR i only get one or two reloads before my game crashes, and i have deleted most of the mods (I copied my directory somewhere else then added FAR to the copy).
