It\u0027s the first time humans have flown on a completely new capsule and vehicle since \u003Cem\u003EShenzou\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ein 2003, so it\u0027s right to be a little excited. In the past few weeks I have been nerding out on the design of Crew Dragon as well as the particulars of the designs of Soyuz, Mercury, Apollo, Orion, and the rest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt gave me an idea for a fun challenge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPick any crew capsule that has actually been built (note, it does not actually have to have flown with crew; for example, Dream Chaser or Orion) and try to build it in stock KSP using command seats rather than actual capsules. No capsule parts are permitted. Go nuts on part count; try your best to replicate dimensions, propellant tank placement, thruster configuration, seat placement, chute design, and more. The only limitation is that you cannot make it LARGER than the real thing; for example, you can use 5m parts for Orion or 1.87m parts for Mercury, but you couldn\u0027t use 3.75m parts for Gemini or 5m parts for Crew Dragon.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf possible, have a functioning abort system. Demonstrate it if you can. Feel free to mess around with gravity or other settings if you need to, but kudos if you don\u0027t!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
