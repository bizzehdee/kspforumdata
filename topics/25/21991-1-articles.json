Launch, do the gravity turn, but don\u0027t circularize the orbit, then if you burn long enough, you should end up orbiting the sun, and if you exit orbit, the orientation ball\u0027s green circles should flick slightly a lot. Then hopefully you have made a good orbit around the sun, so then you just push the orbit slightly very elliptical, by burning a good few minutes, and then you might intersect Duna or Jool some year! Then just retro burn till you look good, and do the normal landing procedures. I would bring a parachute as well, because most of the planets have some kind of atmosphere, and you do have a cockpit atmosphere reader.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
