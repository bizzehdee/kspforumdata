A calculation error resulted in all fuel being consumed just prior to acheiving orbit. With no burn fuel, the ship began an uncontrollable glide decent back to Kearth, right into the center of the Karcific Ocean. :-X\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Kerbals young and old watched as brave commander Gregger Kerman glided the experimental craft in an attempt to perform a never thought possible water landing. Without any experience or training, the crew had only instinct to rely upon. At the last moment, all RCS rockets fired in a lift and braking maneuver while Gregger flared up in an attempt to stall forward speed and decent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plane struck hard in a firey collision as the outer orbital rockets broke free and residual fuel detonated. The rear tail immediately snapped off with collision with the water and the landing gears sheared away. Engine turbines shattered. The front came down with enough force to shatter the nose. But the crew was alive, shaken but okay. The design of the plane, remained water tight and boyant with the now empty fuel tanks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe following image was taken by the rescue helicopter. We can see the crew is calm and relaxed through the onboard camera. Desiring further studies into the possible necessities of further water landings, the KSA challenges designers to come up with and perform crafts capable of saving the crew in the event of a water landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i529.photobucket.com/albums/dd332/KwKiller/Kerbal%20Space%20Command/screenshot18.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot18.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGuidlines and rules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
