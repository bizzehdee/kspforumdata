I\u0027m fairly certain I wouldn\u0027t be able to lug one of those off of Laythe, not with any design I\u0027ve ever created. Thanks though!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe flight plan was just a straight burn from Kerbin to Jool, using the 7 nuclear engines that the first stages are able to deposit into orbit. No slingshots or anything fancy, just conserving momentum from my orbit and using it to assist with reaching escape velocity. Those nuclear engines are heavy, and 7 may seem like overkill to a lot of people, but they\u0027re critical during the Kerbin ascent stages as well. I keep those puppies firing from the moment of launch until their columns start to detach ten minutes later, and they only operate at low fuel efficiency for the first 10 seconds or so. I realize the trip to Jool could\u0027ve been done with just 1, but it would\u0027ve put me to sleep moving that much payload with a single engine, and a rocket with a sleeping pilot isn\u0027t worth anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use some last minute tweaking to directly intercept Laythe. I\u0027m going pretty fast relative to Laythe at this point, so I aerobrake around 21,000m above its surface and then circularize around 80,000m. There are still two stacks of fuel tanks (unassociated with the lander) left at this point, so there\u0027s a decent amount of fuel to maneuver onto a path that gives you the landing site you\u0027re looking for. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding involves deploying two of the smaller class of parachutes. Those keep the craft upright and slow it down considerably, but it\u0027s still a powered landing, with 4 jet engiens and the one nuclear still engaged. I\u0027d disable the nuclear at this point if that were an option, since the jet engines would be sufficient on their own, and would use much less fuel. Still, there\u0027s fuel to spare for the trip home, too, so after the landing you can actually buzz around the atmosphere quite a bit before heading up to around 10km and kicking in the two aerospikes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing that gets back into orbit is generally the capsule, 1 tank, and the nuclear engine. If you choose to skip flying around inside the atmosphere, you may also have about 400 extra fuel and the two aerospikes, but you won\u0027t need them. Getting home was just another straight burn, setting up my position around Laythe so that I\u0027ll be thrown away from Jool in the direction of Laythe\u0027s orbit around it, and waiting for Laythe\u0027s position around Jool to reach a point where I\u0027ll be thrown from Jool in the opposite direction of Jool\u0027s orbit. This path took me straight home with about a third of a tank to spare, allowing me to do some final adjustments and land pretty much right at the space center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will say that getting back from Jool is very time sensitive as to Kerbin\u0027s location in the solar system. You can head out and realize you\u0027ve missed your window for an intercept by about six months. For this, I lowered my apoapsis and eventually found a point where I could achieve a rendezvous with very little additional fuel expended.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Androsynth","CreatedById":7150,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-01T11:35:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThinking about it now, it would make more sense to circularize at a much higher altitude above Laythe.

What I (didn\u0027t calculate) found is that if you leave the moon while it is past orbital alignment between jool and kerbin kerbin in a retrograde path, it will have a higher apo/peri ratio. This will cut you closer to jool. When you hit peri, Give it full burn for maximum apo motion. No number, not even sure if I am 100% correct since I have only done by feel, but burning at peri does have a maximum effect on apo. If you leave laythe pro or retro, either way you will have a similar apo. If your orbit is more eliptical, it should be easier to increase your apo at peri.

The extra weight it adds is just part of doing business in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I\u0027m not sold on the SRBs, I just threw them on there out of frustration with other landers failing to make orbit. Since they are the first to go on takeoff, it doesnt matter how heavy they are, but something is needed to get everything out of the atmosphere quickly. I might experiment with more aerospikes, or more (bigger) SRBs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe adapers are mostly for looks, but they also shift the centre of thrust down a bit. Also part of the \u0022wide stance\u0022 requirement I guess. As for the extra weight, its nothing compared to the fuel weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other members of my colony are happily orbiting Laythe right now. They were not as successful at launch as this one, and so they will bide their time before attempting landings as they are very low on fuel in the interplanetary stage, and takeoff pretty much requires almost no fuel use on landing (parachutes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERunning three missions at a time really keeps you on your toes tho, since by the time you get orbiting around Jool with one, the others may have been crashed or ejected into deep space days ago.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"etchasketch","CreatedById":26241,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-02T05:19:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere is the craft file:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/open?id=0Bymod7ge4lGYM1dJRDJaeTlrY2M\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://docs.google.com/open?id=0Bymod7ge4lGYM1dJRDJaeTlrY2M\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI changed the first stage to use less parts (30 less at 282) but it\u0027s still pretty volatile.
