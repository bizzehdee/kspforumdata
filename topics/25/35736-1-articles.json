Phase 1 is set to test just that. We have the first of the guard stations in orbit around EVE. Eventually we will have multiple guard stations in orbit using rotations of guard officers and wardens. The first station is in polar orbit in order to source out the most appropriate location for the cell blocks. Each guard station can hold 4 guards plus 1 warden and has a docking port in order to facilitate shift changes. The stations themselves have no propulsion in order to prevent a hijacking / hostage situation. Everything on Eve is designed for safety. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TS53uSo.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TS53uSo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second part of Phase 1 is to drop a Prison Unit on the face of Eve to test sustainability as well as security. It is a self-contained prison cell that can house 2 prisoners at once (technically 4 at a time, however for security concerns, we will only allow 1 per cell, 2 per unit). Each unit has locking bars on doors, so that each prisoner can be securely locked inside the unit for transfer to Eve as well as lockdown at night. None of the on-Eve units have any propulsion of any kind. They are dropped in place using detachable side-boosters which jettison off miles away and destroyed, leaving no debris. Plus, each prisoner is only allotted minimal survival gear, meaning a walk across Eve is extremely deadly for more than a few moments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qVxl317.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qVxl317.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gVB46NH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022gVB46NH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur business model is such: Prisoners on Eve will live out the remainders of their days in modest comfort. Each will have all the trappings of daily life. Prisoners are to remain in their cell blocks throughout the majority of the day, with short exercise trips daily. Each outing on Eve\u0027s surface is automated, with doors from one block opening allowing those who wish to move freely on the surface wearing their safety gear. After a certain amount of time, reminder bells alert them to return to their bunk. The doors automatically shut, and anyone left outside will shortly run out of oxygen. Prison cells are staggered so that no more than one cell block is open at any time with enough time between excursions to safely ensure no prisoner can survive the wait between openings. Maintenance can be scheduled through guard stations above. Each prisoner is responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the cell blocks. Should one unit fail beyond repair, and empty cell block will be dropped and those prisoners instructed to move to the new habitat. Nothing that is sent to Eve will ever return. This is a one way trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnd of Phase 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E((Edit))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is our landing mechanism. The side boosters have about 1/3 fuel remaining, or about as much fuel in the bottom pod.
