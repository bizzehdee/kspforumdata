So here\u0027s my challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a moderately heavy space tug that is going to be making it\u0027s way to Duna and hopefully well beyond in time. It weighs 82.02 tonnes and is made from all stock parts. The challenge is to take this into a 100Km stable orbit around Kerbin without tapping in to any of the fuel reserves of the tug and without adding any modded parts. If you complete the challenge and are happy to upload the file of the finished spacecraft I would also really appreciate the opportunity to deconstruct your work and see what I could be doing better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI apologize if this seems like a bit of a pathetic challenge to many of you more experienced players but hopefully there\u0027s someone who can find a bit of fun from it too.

You need to add more struts to make it stable...I didn\u0027t do that, i did exactly what you asked. Got it into a stable orbit with all the tanks still full.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly Mod I used was Mechjeb for the delta v stats. Didn\u0027t use it for ascent.

I\u0027ve spent a good number of hours trying a variety of different builds using MJ to assess delta v too but never found a sweet spot. Seems I was looking at things the wrong way and trying to downsize my vessel to compensate for the weight. No wonder mine kept collapsing on itself. You\u0027ve given me a lot of food for though in my design techniques.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I realized after testing a number of builds that the majority of the fuel tanks were not supported as well as I hoped. I didn\u0027t consider the kind of force it would be subject to when being pushed to orbit by another rocket and had only tested the tug on it\u0027s own before so I do apologize for leaving you with a horribly wobbly payload. I\u0027m extremely impressed that you managed to get it to hold together under the thrust of 7 mainsails without adding any additional support to it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Elsig","CreatedById":62731,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T01:08:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re welcome.

After adding some struts to the top section too it managed to get there with 220 delta V left so it\u0027s more than capable. Hopefully the tug and lander will be capable too since they have a combined Delta V of around 9000.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just had to search for a site for the first time to upload that craft actually.
