Naturally, a speed record is already out of the question for me. The attempt is below:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/Vcul5)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Results:\n\u003E \n\u003E Mission time: 9 hours 30 minutes 18 seconds\n\u003E \n\u003E Highest altitude achieved: 4,424m\n\u003E \n\u003E Highest G force: 7 Gs\n\u003E \n\u003E Number of circumnavigations: 1\n\u003E \n\u003E So, I did make it. Just. I only had 126 units of fuel left from my 4080 I began with, and honestly, midway through the flight I thought I\u0027d be landing on less. It didn\u0027t set any records at all, and will likely remain in last place for the amount of time it took to circumnavigate until someone else tries to circumnavigate on just basic jet engines. As such I will not nominate it for either challenge category.\n\u003E \n\u003E The flight was definitely somewhat of a tough one. I constantly had to cut back on the throttle throughout the flight to conserve fuel. There were more than a few moments where I thought I wouldn\u0027t have enough fuel to make it. I knew I was cutting it close. I also had to adjust my control surfaces several times (deactivated 2 of my 4 ailerons for less erratic rolling, disabled pitch and roll on my rudders in flight), and occasionally had to go over my cruising altitude range (stupid mountains). I eventually learned to have my aircraft pitch slightly downward on 4x time acceleration and then wait until the curve of the planet made me increase in altitude again, and then repeat the process. This made the flight far less painful then it could\u0027ve been.\n\u003E \n\u003E I think the most impressive part of my statistics was the fact that I never surpassed 4,500m in altitude. The larger mountains on Kerbin are higher than how high I flew that plane. Although I might not have claim to the fastest circumnavigation or the most circumnavigations, I most certainly have the lowest aerial circumnavigation, which is an achievement in itself.\n\u003E \n\u003E Anyways, I do kind of have to post the entire F3 log. Now, if you noticed in the F3 log at the end of my massive picture chain, my jet engines were slightly damaging the vertical stabilizers throughout the first 2 hours and 45 minutes of flight, creating a very long list of \u0022this piece damaged by jet engine\u0022 messages. I did my best to record the entire thing in am ingur album (I might have accidentally skipped a few somewhere, it was hard to keep track of which messages I had already covered. If any were skipped, the amount of time skipped should be just a few seconds)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E [Javascript is disabled.
