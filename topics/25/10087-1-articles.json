We may be able to boil away the ocean if we had enough time and Sunbeam lasers, but loiter time is the enemy!\n\nThe obvious answer is a vehicle that can travel on land and propel itself through water at a reasonable speed, while carrying a laser system to the target.\n\n**Goal:** Build an amphibious vehicle that can travel on land and on water safely, while being able to travel no less than 15 km from the shore!\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n- At least one Sunbeam laser system, to be used to eliminate floating debris on site. You must be able to operate the laser without many obstructions [rotating the vehicle is allowed!].\n\n- Land and water travel. How you solve this is up to you!\n\n- Range of 15 km or more!\n\n**Restrictions:** No Gravitsapas or other \u0027cheat\u0027 parts. All entries will be judged as they come. Usage of any mod pack is allowed, as long as it\\\u0027s balanced well!\n\n**This is possible! I have a prototype ship that is able to drive somewhat safely on land and float in the water -- moving through the water is another thing entirely.**"},{"CreatedByName":"Emilio","CreatedById":12359,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-02T12:44:20Z","Content":"I\\\u0027ll maybe give a go at it.
