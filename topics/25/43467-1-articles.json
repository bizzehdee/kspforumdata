Hit the lowest point, it could even be one meter above the surface, so long as you don\u0027t hit the ground. The trick is to find the point you can safely orbit Mun 100 meters above its sea level point without hitting nearby peaks. That, of course, requires an elliptical orbit. Find the right one and that orbit will be stable. Wrong and your ship will go splat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReminds me of a you Tube video where someone set up a hoop on a moon and not only flew through it repeatably while in orbit, he also found a stable intercept from a planet that allowed him to go from the planet, through the hoop on the moon, back to loop around the planet, back to the hoop on the moon, etc... until calculation errors finally caught up with the orbit causing his probe to go splat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a circular orbit, it would have to be above the highest point on Mun. So long as you are just above the highest point, it could be as little as one meter, you have succeeded in the mission. The trick is in the photograph to prove what you have accomplished.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-22T12:14:08Z\u0022 title=\u002208/22/2013 12:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by SRV Ron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-22T12:50:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis has been done at least twice before:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/10211-Lowest-Munar-Orbit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/10211-Lowest-Munar-Orbit\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/37525-Chicken-With-The-Mun\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/37525-Chicken-With-The-Mun\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
