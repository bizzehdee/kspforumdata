The wretched Kermunists have successfully launched a spy satellite into orbit of our peaceful Kerbin, with the obvious intention of stealing our precious snack-manufacturing data. In light of such events, the Society of Foreign Space Affairs has come to an unavoidable conclusion: the satellite must be dealt with. But as to how, well, they\u0027re just Kerbals. Not rocket scientists, like you. They\u0027ve given you the challenge of figuring out what to do with the thing. Here\u0027s your intel:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/w0Rpvod.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022w0Rpvod.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mission is of vital importance.

It\u0027s in a LKO of 70km, so getting to it isn\u0027t the challenge. The challenge is to do it in a creative, fun, and unique way. Oh, and be fast. Fast is important. In fact, your score is based mainly on your speed: from liftoff to time of disabling is your score.

I tried as soon as I docked and couldn\u0027t retract them. The only way in completely stock would be to use an action group (since action groups seem to reset when you dock/quicksave/load), but you had no action groups on the satellite.

However, there was in both cases an apsis that was still within the 69-71 km range; I could use some clarification there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI either case, it wasn\u0027t nearly as good as Johnno\u0027s run.

I\u0027d agree with your disable time, as you split the satellite into multiple pieces (the ion engine, which then exploded, and the rest of the satellite). I have a feeling a sensitive spy satellite would not sustain an impact of that violence. You also got it on a weird orbital trajectory, so that\u0027s a definite kill. Added to the leaderboards at a rather far 2nd.

Sorry, just had to get that out of the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the video! Was great watching the entire process. I never really thought about it, but you\u0027re right: putting it in such a low orbit could certainly make things challenging. The music was also lovely, you\u0027re pretty good at editing. Unfortunately, as you stated in your video, I can\u0027t add this to the leaderboards, as you were using at least 1 mod (KAS), and that heat shield... but it didn\u0027t help too much, did it? Hehe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHOWEVER, if I DID count it, I\u0027d call your time disabling 1:02:57, as that first hit appears to have put it on an out-of-LKO-trajectory, considering your next encounter with it was at 65K, well within the atmosphere. With your guesstimate of 60 meters range, that\u0027s -1 minute for tactical strike, -30 seconds for bringing jeb up and back down, and -1 minute for the Chariot of Fire, that\u0027d put you at 1:00:27 by my count. Well behind the other contestants, but your \u0022Master of Marvel\u0022 achievement is easily a negative infinity seconds, putting you at the lead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood thing I can\u0027t add you to the list, eh?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
