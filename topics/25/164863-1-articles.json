I was starting a new career\u00A0with the Unmanned before Manned, which makes you start with probes. I took the orbit contract and made a rocket with a Rovemate as it\u0027s\u00A0base. I decided I could use it as a satellite too so I didn\u0027t include a parachute. Once I finally got into orbit I saw a contract that said \u0022Return From Orbit\u0022. Realizing the mistake I just made, I came up with an idea. I decoupled everything else and landed the Rovemate alone, which is shaped like a brick, like a wing from orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe challenge is...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEasy Mode: Land\u00A0with no parachutes. (engines and wings allowed)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHard Mode: Land with nothing but the probe (this includes batteries and solar panels)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImpossible Mode: You can use wings, but have to land from Orbit of Eve\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuper Mode: Impress Me\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-28T19:58:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI got this odd little craft down from Eve orbit as a glider with no heat shield or parachutes.
