I do the drop at cruising speed and about 200m above terrain, then I send the plane vertical at full thrust. Handily, it goes into a tail stall at about just shy of the limit of physics range and hangs there, while I switch to the probe and watch it drop. The Sheer Mountain drop (I love that mountain, I am going to send a Kerbal up there one day in a squirrel suit) to the North of KSC I had to do twice because the first one fell short of the peak and rolled back about 15km.
