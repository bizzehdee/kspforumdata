A compilation of the lowest drag parts [only necessary], enough fuel, and perfect balancing as well as flying, can make the RAPIER achieve a maximum speed of 2197.5 m/s. This assumes more than perfect piloting, as well as finding a way to make it take off and get up there. It would also be super hard because the whole thing would be incredibly sensitive to applied lift forces, and a single millionth of a degree off will cause the whole thing to flop around like a crazy floppy thing.\n\nEDIT: This is also assuming optimal ascent path that equates to a distance slightly less than the required distance, but the times would balance out. And I guess overheating is an issue, but you can exploit the cooling properties of those necessary parts we talked about earlier. Those really need to be fixed.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-11T19:50:45Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2015 07:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Xannari Ferrows**"},{"CreatedByName":"nicky4096","CreatedById":128125,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T19:49:55Z","Content":"interesting!"},{"CreatedByName":"MunGazer","CreatedById":141954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T20:03:04Z","Content":"Assuming a sidereal rotational velocity of 174.53 m/s would simply be subtracted from that average speed to give a better figure for the average speed required in a retrograde circumnavigation, (2,126.2894440540055759476435758237) - (174.53) = 1,951.7594440540055759476435758237 m/s. Again, this is the \u0022average\u0022 speed; the actual cruising speeds needed to compensate for acceleration, deceleration and other things would be even higher.\n\nEdit: just now saw your replies. Yeah, I guess our figures are very close xannari for what *average* speeds would be needed; the major difference I suppose is just that you\u0027re looking at a slightly larger circle to account for altitude, which makes sense because that\u0027s where you spend the majority of your flight. But time spent accelerating and decelerating will likely push the top speed seen in a limit approaching craft significantly above our average speed figures.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E can you explain how you calculated it? :3\n\nNot sure if you were asking me or xannari, but my calculation was (circumference of kerbin in meters / time in seconds of a hypothetical navigation ) = average speed in meters per second for circumnav.\n\nHowever, xannari\u0027s approach for looking at the circumference at a given altitude is more accurate, since of course no one will be doing mach 6 at sea level. My figures were just purposely being extremely conservative, at the limits based on known data and the simplest, non adjusted geometry.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-11T19:55:28Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2015 07:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MunGazer**"},{"CreatedByName":"nicky4096","CreatedById":128125,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T20:16:52Z","Content":"anyway, while not a record, i managed 39:30 in a 1 engine plane and will try to improve that.\n\ni was managing what would have been 39:15 landings but the wheelbase is to narrow so it kept tipping over and getting destroyed...\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
