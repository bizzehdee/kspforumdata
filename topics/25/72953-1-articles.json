However even the modded category has some restrictions. You are fair to use most balanced mods like for example b9, also nav helpers like Mechjeb or physics enhancers like ferram. (people with only optical enhancers like Kerb-paint can still send in for the non-mod-sections) However some mods would make this far too easy. For example anything involving lighter-than-air-flight (zeppelins/balloons) is banned. You may also not use some \u0022magically\u0022 powerful and yet efficient thrusters or jet engines that somehow work in Jools atmosphere. In general you are not allowed to use any mod-parts that would make it possible to exit Eve with an ssto. Everything else should be fair.
