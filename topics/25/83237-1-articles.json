Challenge!!!","CreatedByName":"wraith257","CreatedById":119908,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-29T01:25:19Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"wraith257","CreatedById":119908,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-29T01:25:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehello everyone\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E today as of posting, i managed to successfully pull off a ice bucket style challenge in kerbol space program. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand it was actually pretty difficult and took a few days of frustration, so i wondered what all kinds of creativity would \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis spark with other people. so i challenge you guys, to come up with creative ways to kill kerbals. this was inspired by \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe ALS ice bucket challenge \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis is a freestyle challenge so no scoring system, just creativity. videos will be judged and given a 1 out of 10 performance rating based on creativity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E most interesting videos will be posted here with the top 5 challenges earning the bragging rights. they will be judged on the bases of most interesting \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Escenarios and style. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003Eexample:\u003C/strong\u003E i managed to perform my video at the kerbol space center with a rocket powered bucket launched of the the launch pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E and i targeted a kerbol on top of the VAB. the bucket of which. i felt like, was a very creative addition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Escoring:\u003C/strong\u003E scoring has been changed a bit. i will now accept other peoples score suggestions up to 4 \u002B mine, and i will average them for the final score. i felt it might be unfair to just have one judge, even if this challenge is just for fun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ebasic judging rules: \u003C/strong\u003Eyou can not give a perfect 10 for every one that you like. keep scores realistic. a 6 is actual not a terrible score but 7 and up are where anyone who did well would like to be, and 9 and 10 are reserved for only the most extravagant. scoring is to be based on creativity in things like: method of deployment, locations, accuracy of most successful shot, and the effort it looks like it took to make it happen. please not that trolls will be ignored. no 0s will be accepted nor will scores below 3 be accepted unless the entry was a troll response to begin with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eexample score:\u003C/strong\u003E uninteresting location due to ease of access. actual bucket with large amount of objects and lots of explosions with a good camera angle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E= moderate score of 7.0/10\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei would have have also scored my self higher but i had issues at the polar ice caps, and i didn\u0027t feel like going all the way to another planet because this already \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etook 3 days to come up with a good shot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut for those of you that are willing to go the extra mile. you could earn your self a top 5 location by going out to interesting locations like space or other planets/moons/astroids\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand then again bonus points for style and camera angles, particularly with creative solutions to dropping vast amounts of things on kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epictures will also be accepted but will be kept in a second category.

I\u0027m new to the forums so I figured I would go ahead and do one of these challenges. For this one I threw together a plane that is capable of very high speeds and used a bomb bay as the bucket. Then I flew Jeb up to the northern ice cap for the challenge. I used monoprop tanks as the \u0022ice\u0022. \u003Cp\u003EHere are the pics... \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/hOjqC\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/hOjqC\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeres the video...\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/MJ8V13T98ug?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you like it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Every interesting set up. i like the use of the jet as a bomber and it was done at a cliff side at the caps. very nice entry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Escore 7.8/10\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso im reposting this score due to some internet issues from earlier. scoreing was modified\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"O-Doc","CreatedById":95453,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-30T02:46:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cmdr.

There\u0027s a really good reason why ALSA isn\u0027t giving money to \u0027natural\u0027 cures. Regarding the 27% spent on research: ALS imposes a very substantial burden on patients and caregivers. In the final stages, it requires 24-hour per day care, a bunch of expensive equipment: motorized chairs (and a vehicle that can transport them), eye-tracking software, lifts and hoists, hospital bed, machines to help the patient cough, machines to attempt to maintain some muscle tone, breathing assists, special equipment for the bathroom, etc etc. Needless to say, both the nursing care and the equipment are costs that most patients cannot afford (Medicare does fast-track ALS patients so can cover some of these costs). The ALSA helps offset these costs for patients and their families, and that\u0027s what they\u0027ve spent most of their donations on in the past.
