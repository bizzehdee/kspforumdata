So you can choose to have a gatecrasher listing or complete the K-Prize mission as a successful mission, which supercedes a gatecrasher and grants you the right to expunge your record. I will wait on your decision. The minimal K-Prize mission is to take off to orbit and land safely."},{"CreatedByName":"TheProfessor2112","CreatedById":194908,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-27T01:41:48Z","Content":"[@boolybooly](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/6572-boolybooly/) Thought I read the rules pretty thoroughly but I guess I missed one crucial part ![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif \u0022:rolleyes:\u0022).

More specifically, would I be correct to assume that if you\u0027re flying a stock craft in a save with mods installed (I have a station I want to dock with that has mod parts, for example), but none of the installed mods change stock parts or affect how it flies (like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E does for example), then the mission can qualify?\n\nI could switch to my clean install and spend the time to sandbox up a demo station to run the mission there, but I\u0027d rather just use my existing career game.\n\nAnd am I right to assume that even Atmosphere Autopilot\u0027s fly-by-wire mode, which is basically what \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E wishes it could be when it grows up, is not allowed for the stock challenge? Or is that actually okay to use?\n\nAlso, just to clarify, while rule 1.B says \u0022Crew transfers are permitted,\u0022 does bringing passengers or tourists to a space station counts as payload delivery for the \u0022Utilitarial Commendation?\u0022 The mass of those comfy cabins is basically payload after all! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022) (I could probably squeeze in a fairing with a tiny relay satellite on the tail though...)\n\nHere\u0027s what I\u0027m planning to use, by the way (Edit: updated the screenshot to show current version, click for a few more. Also, craft file).\n\nSpoiler\n\nFor years now I\u0027ve been occasionally trying to build working passenger transport SSTOs, without needing to unlock the whole dang tech tree first. It never worked out well. But now, I\u0027ve FINALLY come up with one that I can actually fly and land intact on the runway! It has a \u0022payload\u0022 capacity of ~~11~~ **13** Kerbals (counting the pilot) and makes it into orbit with an average of about 800 delta-V to spare for rendezvous, rescues, docking, crew transfers, returning science experiments to Kerbin, etc. On top of that it doesn\u0027t use any tech over 160, and \u003Cu\u003Eonly two\u003C/u\u003E aviation-specific tech nodes! So I didn\u0027t have to sink a lot of science into aircraft tech just to easily shuffle crew and bring science home.\n\n[![Prometheus v3 Passenger Transport](https://i.imgur.com/vEslb8q.png)](https://imgur.com/a/HWRsORz)\n\nUpdated: I just rearranged a bunch of parts, removed 400 units of fuel, and added another cabin, bringing the passenger count up to an even dozen... and still made orbit with 740m/s despite a decidedly *non-excellent* job of manual flying (to make sure it was still stable enough, etc). Made it home just fine too -- quicksaved and deorbited twice, hit the runway (gently) each time. I want to do a proper job of video recording on an actual mission though, not just test flights, to demo what it\u0027s really good for.\n\nI think the ship looks even cooler now, and I updated the screenshot and added a few more to the imgur album if you click on it. ~~Also, here\u0027s the craft file.~~ (Update: Scroll down to my next post, open the video on youtube, and look in the description for up-to-date craft file posts on KerbalX!)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-02-08T17:30:22Z\u0022 title=\u002202/08/2019 05:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 8, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Tallinu**\n  \nCraft updated"},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-06T20:50:53Z","Content":"[@Tallinu](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57810-tallinu/) yes, you are right, as long as the mods dont alter craft physics from stock then its fine.

The craft goes exactly where I tell it to and stays rock-steady in other respects.\n\nI finally got the kinks worked out of the OBS I installed (mainly an irritating hiss in my microphone input line) and got the mission recorded last night, along with a bit of description and commentary. I didn\u0027t expect the resulting video to be basically an hour long, although part of that is that KSP ran noticeably slower while recording, but it\u0027s done and the latest minor revision of the craft landed intact once again, despite a mishap at the end which nearly led to a crash for the utterly silly (***silly,*** *I say!*) reason that my velocity readout never switched back to Surface mode automatically, so I thought I was going far faster than I actually was and kept trying to slow down unnecessarily!\n\nHere\u0027s a link to the video: \n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/tdwancq6iBM?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022459\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nWhich apparently the forum automatically embeds! Alrighty then.\n\nIt\u0027s unfortunate that you can\u0027t simply count passenger cabins, particularly those which are required to allow the vessel to contain the number of Kerbals occupying it during the ascent or descent phase, as payload mass -- it uses more delta-V to keep such dead-weight attached for the return trip than it would to drop it off in orbit, after all! And detaching components that make up more than a third of the main body of the vehicle isn\u0027t exactly *something you can do* with a spaceplane, and have it remain *stable*... or even *intact*. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)\n\nBut I believe this qualifies for utilitarian credit despite that ruling, thanks to the relay satellite \u0022payload\u0022 (which weighs less than 10% of what those passenger cabins weigh, LOL ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)). And it turns out that little thing could actually prove quite useful, since despite its size the satellite actually has enough delta-V to transfer itself to either moon and take up a decent high orbit, and the RA-2 antenna can provide 100% signal strength even from Minmus to a level 1 tracking station.\n\nThere are links in the description of the video to KerbalX pages with both craft files, for the basic version and the one with the relay payload. I actually rebalanced the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thruster positions on the latter in order to compensate for the slightly heavier fairing base left behind after dropping off the satellite.
