Two Saturn V ELV (Saturn V with 4 SRBs on first stage) were launched to the uncrewed MORL and then it was flown back to low orbit. Unsure what this station will be used for currently, but its in orbit with fully refueled tanks and full life support. \n\nWith permanent stations in place around Kerbin and plans for a station around the Mun, there is a need to get large crews to and from space. The Big Gemini scaled up the proven technology in the Gemini program to large crews, making it a perfect Space Taxi to and from low orbit. With a \u0027kicker\u0027 stage, can also serve Mun and Minmus excursion.\n\nThis update also introduces the Big Gemini Orbiting Research Laboratory (ORL), a single-launch solution for a Kerbin orbiting lab. In this mission, a nearly-full refueler left over from the MORL refit was used to boost the station to Munar orbit instead of around Kerbin. The station currently has 6 crew aboard with 77 days of supplies and will be the first part of a permanent Munar orbiting lab.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Two modified Saturn V\u0027s used to refuel and restock the MORL in high Kerbin orbit. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E [Javascript is disabled.

If the wheel part is totally eclipsed it just gets buried under the surface and is then useless.\n\u003E \n\u003E To counter-act this I use a ground pylon (KIS part) attached to the ground and put the rover base part placed on top. (if you attach it on top the root part will become impossible to remove later). I was able to build the rover without problems so long as I had the mode up high enough that the wheels didn\u0027t touch the ground (look ma, no springs!). It was a perfectly serviceable rover - though having landed on a slope made it hard to estimate how far it could go and come back (if back was up-hill). I do plan to change future versions to include an Oscar B and a fuel cell.\n\u003E \n\u003E I know that when I get to semi - permanent bases and eve/duna missions - solar will be part of the equation.\n\u003E \n\u003E Edit- update: Also. I did a concept test for my Apollo 13 mission (not the real flight yet because I\u0027m not ready with the set pieces and props and such - just wanted to see if an idea I had would work and look good enough). So here is the Apollo 13 teaser.\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/ypa0CB7.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ypa0CB7.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Mission Control set piece for use in Apollo 12 and 13 mission reports (\u0022test flight\u0022 - the desks need to be shorter by a bit if I ever have people sit down.)\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/6gf1Ypll.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/6gf1Ypll.jpg)\n\nAh, I was thinking clipping in the editor. I\u0027ve heard of it in the KIS forums (I think), which made me want to avoid surface construction of vehicles as much as possible. Which makes me worried about parts replacement for broken MOLAB-class rovers when it\u0027s time for them to deploy. I think I\u0027m gonna need a wheel jack to properly install a medium-sized wheel.

Currently I\u0027m crashing out every half an hour or so (though not while building) which is pretty frustrating but KSP doesn\u0027t take that long to load up thanks to 1.0.\n\nI haven\u0027t posted anything here for a while because I am pushed for time and want to make my next mission really awesome. I\u0027m going to Duna in a big way. So far I\u0027ve completed six launches of around 20! I\u0027ve christened this mission the Ares program:\n\n![I4eWPPJ.png](http://i.imgur.com/I4eWPPJ.png)\n\nWith just 55 days to go until the optimal transfer window to Duna arrives (on which date the crew will depart), the KSC team have been working overtime to get the massive amount of infrastructure for Duna surface operations launched. Old technologies have been revamped to endure the long voyage to Duna and back. A new CSM mkII is rolled out to be launched on the Saturn IB Advanced. This new CSM is smaller, lighter, requiring less fuel due to the limited operations it will perform in LKO. It is also equipped with solar panels for long endurance flights instead of the traditional fuel cells. Most notable of the upgrades, however, is the Saturn V MLV 140, a vast super-heavy launch vehicle made by strapping four 3.75m LFBs to the side of a Saturn V rocket:\n\n![UuXJpwU.png](http://i.imgur.com/UuXJpwU.png)\n\n*Katuki photographs Sean Kerman inspecting the newly-arrived Saturn V 140 rocket.*\n\nThe 140 part of the name denotes the configuration. 1 = there is one standard Saturn V core. 4 = there are four liquid-fuel boosters. 0 = there are zero solid-fuel boosters. Future planned configurations include the Saturn V 300 and Saturn V 144.\n\nSo far the 140 has flown four times and proven reliable, performing perfectly even when an aerodynamic event destroyed the nose-cone of one of the boosters.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n\n**2 x Duna Transfer Vehicle** constructed in orbit - completed, named DTV-1 *Kennedy* and DTV-2 *Von Braun* - Each vessel required two launches, one for the habitat module (capable of carrying six kerbals) and one Saturn 140 launch carrying a modified S-IVB propulsion stage. \n\n**3 x MOLAB Duna** launches - 2/3 completed. The MOLAB Duna Rover has a docking port to connect to the base. The Saturn 140 is able to propel them directly to Duna at a suboptimal transfer so they will be ready by the time the crew arrives. The rovers are vital to the mission as the base modules will not all be in one place (to save framerate) so kerbals will need to drive between them. \n\n**5 x Ares Base Module** launches. Again using Saturn 140s, these will go direct to Duna. Each carries two base modules. These can be driven around and docked together to form a permanent outpost. Modules include: Cupola, Habitat, Life Support, Cargo, Airlock and Rover Dock. \n\n**2 x Duna Science Outpost** Launches. These two science labs will be landed at strategic locations around Duna. The crew will drive to them to perform science experiments during their stay on the surface. \n\n**2 x Ares Crew Landers**. These two stage landers are too heavy to go direct, so will require a small S-IVB stage to be docked to them in orbit, giving 4 total launches for them. They will arrive at Duna before the crew do. \n\n**2 x Saturn IB Advanced** launches take total of 6 crew to orbit, 3 in DTV-1 and 3 in DTV-2. They will depart Kerbin at the same time and arrive at Duna in close succession. Should anything go wrong, one could rendezvous with the other and have enough supplies to support a double crew and return them home. \n\nI have images for the launches I have completed but will not add them until the whole mission is complete.\n\nProgress is slow at the moment because I\u0027m limiting myself to an hour of KSP a day at most with exams coming up, and some of that time is spent working on stuff for the next release of the Endurance mod, so I haven\u0027t got much done other than construction this week."}]}
