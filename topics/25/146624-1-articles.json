But I\u0027m going to try one more time. This will test bolth your engineering and your piloting. As you have probably already guessed, the challenge is to land a stock seaplane on the water at the fastest speed possible with no parts destroyed or falling off. No cheats, I need screenshots or it didn\u0027t happen, and some way to prove that no parts were lost. It has to be 100 percent stock, no exceptions. The speed the plane was going at the moment your plane touched the water\u00A0\u00A0is your score. Let me know if I missed anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
