Similarily I want to encourage people to also build medium sized designs to achieve maybe not the top spots but at least respectable scores in the mid to high mid range. And of course more flavoured points.\n\nSome sub-challenges I\u0027ve thought up:\n\n- Battleduck: \u002B20pts if the Bomber can safely land on and take off from water, with full payload\n\n- Worldwide coverage: \u002B20pts if the Bomber can perform a full circumnavigation around Kerbin\u0027s equator, without refueling, full payload required (for the whole trip)\n\n- That\u0027s no moon... Not anymore: \u002B80pts if the Bomber can enter and survive the battlefield of the Space Age and deliver the minimum x6 FLT400s onto the surface of the Mun. Refueling in *Kerbin* orbit is allowed. The bombs must be dropped from an altitude no lower than 10km (so achieving orbit is not necessary)\n\n- One hundred convincing arguments: \u002B20pts extra for carrying at least 100 bombs (this time, the x6 required bombs are included in the count)\n\n- Where Eagles Dare: \u002B30pts if the Bomber can land on top of the VAB\n\nI will also add a definition of full payload as I realize it could be a bit confusing as to what constitutes the \u0027maximum\u0027 payload of a craft when in practice more bombs can be attached anywhere in the hangar:\n\nThe **full payload** is the payload the entrant claims to be the maximum FLT400 bomb loadout (the base requirement included), and this is also used to calculate the \u0027more BOOM\u0027 score. The number of bombs may not be reduced from this maximum loadout in any of the sub-challenges where a \u0027full payload\u0027 is required.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-23T06:42:14Z\u0022 title=\u002203/23/2015 06:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Aanker**"},{"CreatedByName":"The Mechanic","CreatedById":119038,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T19:48:47Z","Content":"@wossname I like what you did there no that flying wing. Placing the cargo bays at an angle allows the craft to be considerably more compact.\n\n@Aanker For \u0022Worldwide Coverage\u0022 you might like to specify that the circumnavigation takes place within the atmosphere unless you want to count SSTO into that sub-challenge.\n\nSince you are now including space challenges...are rockets (jet-rocket hybrid SSTO? Nuclear engines?) allowed? It may be an idea to make something like bonus and penalty for the LV-N. Like a penalty for maintaining the LV-N but also a bonus that gives you some extra points so that you can use one or maybe two while still having some more points.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E **LV-N special maintenance**: -20 pts per LV-N\n\u003E \n\u003E **Going nuclear**: \u002B 30 pts.\n\u003E \n\u003E Just an idea though.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nWith those new sub-challenges you introduced I maybe try my hand on a new entry. Considering that I don\u0027t get anything nice done with the Mk.3 fuselage system (it feels just awkward when placing wings and stuff, especially on those adapters) I\u0027ll have to settle on doing something really fancy based on the Mk.2 system.\n\nAlso, how about making a separate scoreboard for modded entries, of course with the requirement that the mods are somewhat grounded in the stock system, if you get what I mean? SXT, KAX and the Mk.4 fuselage system for example contain some nice stock-alike plane parts. I just wanted to throw that idea into the room.\n\nNow, while I\u0027m at mods: Is it okay for a VTOL-ing entry to use something like [Vertical Velocity Control](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/50736)? It doesn\u0027t help if the craft is unbalanced but it is really helpful for landing and hovering with VTOL crafts because you don\u0027t have to fight against the throttle while trying not to crash ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif). It does have some problems with jets but works well enough for flight assistance.\n\nI\u0027m asking this because you don\u0027t mention non-part mods in your challenge.
