First, if your dry CoM is any significant distance away from your wet CoM, you\u0027ll want to set the thrusters on that centre axis closer to your dry CoM (this assumes you\u0027ll be closer to empty than full when in orbit). The neat thing about this setup is that you don\u0027t have to worry about thrusters on the fuselage obstructing hatches or docking ports.\n\nOne other feature is that the docking port has been set as the root part so you can dock properly using the navball and \u0027set as target\u0027 \u002B \u0027control from here\u0027 and not have to use visual docking or a camera/alignment mod.
