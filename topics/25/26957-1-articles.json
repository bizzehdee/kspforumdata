Well no, not really. You see the POD is going to be hurtling down the runway at 5m/s!!! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:0.0:\u0022\u003E Yes you heard me 5m/s!!

Of course you managed to do this well before the POD even got close to leaving the runway. At no point did any part of the Sherpa touch the ground or come close to scratching the paintwork, and when you dropped the POD off on the podium you did it so lightly that the dust itself wasn\u0027t disturbed.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uKSY6SD.png\u0022 alt=\u0022uKSY6SD.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETHE SILVER CUPCAKE\u003C/strong\u003E - You managed to rescue the POD before it slipped off the runway, but the docking maneuver was pretty iffy, and you accidental bashed against the side of the POD while trying to dock. Although you got the POD onto the Podium the touchdown was pretty rough and some bits seem to have fallen off it, still you did all this without touching down.

Keep it on at all times it\u0027ll make life so much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Use the Jets and Rockets in combination, using the jets alone will have you fighting the throttle lag of the engines, using both will give you silky smooth altitude control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Press 3 to activate the docking light, it\u0027ll help you guide the two ports together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Don\u0027t over correct! Keep your movements small and give the ship a chance to settle after each maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Practice, Practice, Practice!

Well, when I made the challenge I wanted to create a level playing field where everyone uses the same ship, a bit like stock car racing I guess where it\u0027s down to the driver not the car. While it would be great to have everyone design they\u0027re own VTOL\u0027s they\u0027ll not the easiest things to build as you yourself can probably appreciate. I was a bit surprised you found the handling so bad, as it something I pay special attention to when I design my drop ships, and like the rest of my creations I spent a long time balancing it in orbit to make sure the COM doesn\u0027t shift with the fuel load.

Little did I know that KSP has good joystick support too and the joystick comes with a utility for mapping axes and assigning commands to its many (12, plus 8 direction hat stick) buttons.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-03T22:45:23Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2013 10:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by localSol\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WILL.I.AM K.","CreatedById":57197,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-04T03:22:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI applaud you like that guy on the B9 thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"madspy","CreatedById":24257,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-04T06:26:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just ordered that Logitech Extreme 3D Pro.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt looks really good\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
