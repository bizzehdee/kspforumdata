What I found was that as long as the craft stayed within 15 degrees or so of prograde, the gigantor panel could be dragged along like so and would not break. \n\nSo I couple that large panel with a decent sized battery bank, and I end up in a scenario where I launch the craft and reach cruising speed on battery, then extend the panel to recharge. If I need to maneuver any more than trim, I fold the panel again to protect it.
