Just a few things I noticed:\n\n- I don\u0027t think pre-coolers are actually allowed, you\u0027ll have to check with tetryds but I think they were classed under rocket-grade parts. Should be a simple fix though.\n- By default your cockpit torque is on and the Scan Interval for Bd Armory\u0027s Weapon Manager is set to 60. Also, your Steer Factor is set to 14, despite the fact that the pilot can easily handle 20.\n- Quite a few of your control surface (predominantly in the tail) are not actually connected to the wing, they\u0027re connected to the wing\u0027s trailing edge. This can cause big problems with regards to airflow. Also, the trailing edge of your main wing is very jagged. With B9 wings I would suggest removing the trailing edge on any wing you intend to have control surfaces on, and then using control surface parts (even if they aren\u0027t active) to completely conceal the trailing edge. This leads to a cleaner air flow, and a sleeker look.\n- Your CoM and CoL are in roughly the right place at the moment, and the AoA graph is pretty good. However...\n- In my opinion, you have far too much wing - currently you have a wing area of 57.7m/sq. When you consider that the Ta 152, which was specifically designed with a big wing due to the altitude it was expected to perform at, you have almost 3x as much wing surface. Having very low wing loading can be useful, as it generally gives better climb performance and can increase turn-rate. However you have to strike a balance, currently the size of your wing is heavily restricting the roll rate of the aircraft, and if the aircraft were able to pull a higher AoA in flight it would also induce more drag. I would suggest trimming the wing surface area down a little, especially the tailplane, which is far too large. However, wing size is all a personal preference, and it also depends on what your intended role for the aircraft is. Having such a large wing surface can be good if you want to climb at the start of the battle - you aren\u0027t set up for that currently, but maybe run some tests? Generally BD AI favours highly mobile aircraft, but I have had some success wing aircraft designed to climb at then kill the enemy before the opponent can manoeuvre enough to offset the energy advantage.\n- Your control surfaces are very small and have little motion in them. These two factors are the main cause of the relatively low agility. In a simple test, I doubled the length of the control surfaces and doubled their degrees of movement, and even under such large changes the aircraft still would only stall when BD AI did something ridiculous, and doing so meant that in a banked turn the aircraft could reach an AoA of around 10 degrees, instead of the 4 that the design pulls as standard. Now, you don\u0027t actually want the control surfaces as big or as moveable as I had made them, as it means that you end up with a lot of drag when turning, but if the wing size was reduced a little then you could set the size and movement of the control surfaces to only a little higher and still get much higher manoeuvrability.\n\nSorry for the wall of text - trying to tweak designs gets me a little excited about all of the options. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) Hope some of this helps, but feel free to ignore me - I\u0027m no aeronautical engineer.\n\nJust a few pictures of my new monoplane design. I\u0027m holding off on entering it just yet, because I want to wait for the new weapon pack and may as well wait until the contest is re-run, but I\u0027m so proud of her sleek lines and she\u0027s so much fun to fly that I figured I\u0027d show her off. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
