This challenge is the single biggest reason I keep reading these forums. Great work!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s become fairly obvious that using cockpits in the payload, and using payload as structure, are really \u0022unfair\u0022 advantages in multistage designs. I humbly suggest either \n\u003E \n\u003E - separating the categories, with practical, reusable single-piece SSTOs in one and exotic unrestricted multistage designs in the other.\n\u003E \n\u003E or\n\u003E \n\u003E - adding additional restrictions to all spaceplane designs (i.e. must be able to achieve orbit with the payload missing).\n\nI think as long as being multistage means you\u0027re inherently throwing away parts (since spent stage recovery is impossible without mods), I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a big problem that you\u0027re making clever use of the payload as structure. It would be a much more complicated and difficult to adjudicate challenge that considered how many tons or what cost was recoverable. \n\nConsidering the cockpit as \u0022payload\u0022 is more of a thorny issue, because in my mind, \u0022payload\u0022 implies some degree of arbitrary-ness, where you can specify a size, shape and mass of the payload, but not that the front 1/5th of the payload must be a particular cockpit, or else the launch doesn\u0027t work. \n\nIf the cockpit counts, why bother separating the engines from the front half of the \u0022payload?\u0022 It\u0027s all mass in orbit. \n\nI don\u0027t have any great suggestions, but thankfully this group doesn\u0027t seem too inclined to rules-lawyering. As a spectator, I\u0027d be perfectly happy seeing a short note next to any entry that might have a counterintuitive idea of payload. \n\nI\u0027m still going to read all about more than the current winning entry, because the intermediate ones are often a lot more approachable and instructive than the ones where I couldn\u0027t fly the right profile even if I understood it. The new drag and mach dynamics are still mostly a mystery to me, and it\u0027s often easier to figure out what\u0027s going on with the less clever or optimized entries."},{"CreatedByName":"tseitsei","CreatedById":139058,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-06T10:40:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Added another great entry of yours to the leaderboard, tewpie.\n\u003E You raise an interesting point.

Whether or not they are in the rankings, it\u0027s also nice to have every accepted attempt linked from the first post. Maybe check out how the [Goddard Problem Challenge](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php?t=128509) has an \u0022attic\u0022.\n\nAs for reusability of planes, I like seeing both kinds of designs, but it\u0027s also interesting to see which ones are at least semi-practical, so it would be nice to tag SSTO designs that can\u0027t reasonably be recovered (maybe as \u0022SSTO\\*\u0022) if there are too many. But, I\u0027m definitely against requiring enough fuel for landing as part of the scoring flight - minimizing that sounds like a very boring game of 69km aerobraking passes.\n\nFor defining \u0022reusability\u0022, I think being able to \\*land\\* from orbit without a payload more closely tracks practicallity - an exposed payload design could still be useful for stocking fuel depots or with payload fairings, and I\u0027d certainly expect them to fly less well without a payload, but as long as they don\u0027t disintigrate or incinerate on reentry it could still be used. Reusability with only refueling is too strict for planes - recovering and rebuilding is easy on Kerbin, and jets hardly work anywhere else.\n\nI don\u0027t know about rockets, maybe SSTO and multi-stage are more interesting as separate challenges there. Strict \u0022SSTO\u0022 might track practical goals better too - refuel from a depot and fly the whole thing elsewhere, or recover in one big piece."},{"CreatedByName":"Right","CreatedById":80269,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-07T21:49:00Z","Content":"I\u0027m happy with one entry per category per person.\n\nOne cheatery thing I\u0027ve had success with is using aerodynamically shielded struts in the payload.

I think you summed it up nicely in an earlier post...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The idea is that your test payload could be conceivably replaced with another and still have the ascent work.\n\nI see the merit of taking this to the extreme and disqualifying payloads with cockpits, nose cones, or structure... but in reality 90%\u002B of payloads will have these things, so I think there is also merit to not going that far.
