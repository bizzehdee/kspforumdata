I don\u0027t see asymmetric flameout as a positive virtue to teach new players, but neither do I see it as an inherent negative - rather I see it as a means to an end. Asymmetric flameout is the penalty for multiple jets but multiple jets allow you to carry more into space or get there quicker. So, if your design does functionally nothing more than a competing design without asymmetric flameout then yes I\u0027ll view your design more negatively than the one without this penalty.

In fact, I suspect when paired with additional airbreathers to increase atmospheric thrust, or perhaps just enough wings and fuel to climb slow enough, you can do very efficient designs by saving on engine weight (think on how much a standard turbojet and T45 weight together, and consider a RAPIER is pretty much just that, only one whole mT lighter and with only 25kN and 10s less isp in rocket mode).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Xeldrak\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Xeldrak\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, I like to think that it is more than just a popularity contest.
