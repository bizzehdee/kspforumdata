My successful landings there used some onion-staging, built around a pair of LV-T30 engines (and smaller engines on the radial boosters). It works pretty well, as long as you pay attention and actually drop the radial tanks at the right times. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaythe on the other hand, I love the fact that it has oxygen in its atmosphere.

Thoughts about the Jool-5 Challenge:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI liked it. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s ambitious, but not overly so, and I think that most players who\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve made it successfully to another planet and back should eventually be able to complete it. It gives people an incentive to explore more of the Kerbol sytem. Thanks go to Ziv for coming up with the idea in the first place, and for creating the nifty graphic for putting in people\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s signature lines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EII. Observations about the KSP program and mods:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 1. MechJeb is five parts helpful, one part infuriating. While it was great at maneuver planning and performed very well on Laythe, Vall, and Tylo, it screwed up (or tried to screw up) landings on Pol, Bop, and Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 2. KW Rocketry is great. The tanks and engines are just a little better than stock, which gives designs using KW parts a bit of an edge without seeming horribly overpowered. This trip reinforced my admiration for the Vesta engine, which performed very well. Its high TWR, low weight, and Isp of 400 is one of the primary reasons my lander had so much delta V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 3. Poles and/or high altitude EVAs can be glitchy. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m still not sure what happened on Pol, but I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m pretty sure the \u0022anomaly\u0022 I was investigating on Bop was a graphic glitch at the north pole where the textures come together. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be staying at least 10 degrees away from all poles in the future, and will limit EVAs to more reasonable altitudes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 4. Even though LV-Ns are the most fuel-efficient thing around, the KR-2L on the tanker stage is still a heck of an engine. Vacuum Isp of 380 and 2500kN of thrust in a single 6.5 ton part is hard to beat, especially if part count is a concern. I figure I can get the tanker stage down to about 15 to 17 parts, as long as it retains the KR-2L. If I switch to LV-Ns, the part count for that stage will jump up to at least 40.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 5. Detailed textures on parts are great. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d like to offer a big thank you to those part designers who include rivets, paint, and other visual cues on their rocket parts. Having these cues and reference points in the VAB makes rocket assembly easier and more accurate. This is especially important when it comes to attaching struts, which can induce wobble or rotation if not placed evenly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 6. Orbital height really matters. As I noted in one of the photos, the delta V for orbital capture around a moon without an atmosphere is greatly reduced if the orbit is higher up. The tanker stage saved a lot of fuel by parking in a 1,000 km orbit around Tylo instead of a 100 km orbit as originally planned. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIII. Critique of the ship design:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 1. The Explorer\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s design had a lot of fat. Without radically changing the design, I think I can cut out about 5 or 6 tons from the lander, and 6 to 8 tons from the Explorer mothership. Part of these changes involving going from 8 LV-Ns on the mothership down to either 6 or 4, and removing two Vestas and shortening the side stacks a bit on the lander. The lander in particular was overpowered, being able to hang on to the two extra empty side stacks while ascending from Tylo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 2. Refueling those three monster lifter stacks while in orbit around Kerbin was overkill. \u003Cem\u003E[but it sure looked cool. - Ed.]\u003C/em\u003E With a lighter lander, mothership, and tanker stage, and a slightly modified lifter, I think that a revised Explorer should be able to make orbit with a single mostly full center lifter stack. That single stack can then handle the majority of the interplanetary transfer duties without any refueling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 3. I should convert the tanker stage to use LV-Ns, probably eight of them. If I do, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll likely need some supplemental regular engines to complete the initial transfer burn to Jool in a single orbit, which is a non-negotiable mission requirement as far as I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m concerned. Initial thought is to put on 2.5 m side drop tanks tanks with Vestas or some other efficient engine attached, then drop those engines once the initial burn to Jool is complete and/or the side tanks are empty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 4. The side drop tanks on the Explorer mothership were too big, and need to be either reduced in size or eliminated. With conversion of the tanker stage to LV-Ns, it makes more sense to have the fuel stay in that stage as long as possible for more efficient transport.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 5. I brought along way too much monopropellant. At the end of the trip, both the tanker stage in orbit around Tylo and the Explorer mothership back at Kerbin had over 2/3 of their monoprop left. Although the part count will increase slightly, I should put in a few of the .75 ton cylindrical tanks and ditch the 3.4 ton inline tank in the Explorer. The lander should switch from the .55 ton inline tank to one or two of the small spherical tanks. Only the tanker stage will retain the big inline tank with 750 units of RCS fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 6. If I want to reuse ships, I need to use more docking ports instead of decouplers. The Explorer\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s main drive section is still perfectly useable, but there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s no way to re-attach a command capsule to a decoupler that I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m aware of. I haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t used KAS all that much yet - if it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s possible for Kerbals on EVA to remove the decoupler from the drive section and put on a 2.5m docking port instead, the ship may yet come back to life. Otherwise, it will lie dead in its parking orbit for the foreseeable future. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 7. I need to put one or two more reaction wheels on the tanker stage, and/or use the RCS thrusters more. Watching the ship slowly turn was majestic in a Stanley Kubrick sort of way, but it added a lot of unnecessary real-life time to the journey. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 8. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve decided that any future journeys of more than a month\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s duration must carry along at least one Hitchhiker container for additional living space. I think even the stoutest Kerbal would go a little stir crazy after being cooped up in a 3-person command pod for more than a year.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 9. Science was lacking on the lander. No material bays or goo canisters made it down to the surface of any of the moons; only massless detection gear was attached to the lander. If I do something like this again, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll try to make some modular science packages docked radially around the mothership that can be pulled off by the lander, taken down to each moon in turn, and then re-attached to the mothership.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIV. Evaluation of myself:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 1. I used MechJeb too much. This is my first career save with MechJeb installed, and I leaned on it too heavily. It took some of the fun out, and I spent more time than I anticipated just watching the screen as MJ did its thing. For future landings, I might let it go so far as to do the initial de-orbit burn, but then I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll turn it off and take the lander in manually. For docking, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll probably let MJ get the initial orientation correct with the lander perpendicular to the target docking port (which I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m not great at), then do the approach and translation myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 2. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m developing a grudging respect for LV-Ns, and will use them more in the future, but I still don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t like them. They\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re heavy, awkward, and weak. Ships using them tend to have much higher part counts, which increases lag. Transfer burns can take a really long time, and may need to broken up into multiple orbits (which I hate). And I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t like the engine sound, which is coarser and raspier to my ear. (I also dislike the sound of the 48-7S, but that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a different topic.) All of those negatives are offset (barely) by their phenomenal Isp of 800. I also feel like I have to impose some real-life limitations on their future use that many other players do - no atmospheric operation, no staging where they drop into an inhabited atmosphere, etc. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m thinking that once I get KAS figured out I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m going to go back to Vall to retrieve the two drop tanks in orbit, which each have an LV-N attached, and de-orbit them into the crushing depths of Jool\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s gravity well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 3. I need to trust the aerobrake calculator more. Twice I added a bit of additional height as a safety margin for aerobrake maneuvers, and both ended up not being orbital captures. If I add a \u0022safety margin\u0022 for aerobraking in the future, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s going to be only a few hundred meters of periapsis height.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 4. I need to be smarter about fuel use. The lander headed down to both Laythe and Vall with full tanks, and ended up burning more fuel just to bring the unused fuel up into orbit again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 5. Shifting around fuel manually is only interesting the first few times you do it. After that, it becomes a chore. I need to try out TAC or some other fuel management mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 6. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve concluded that I cannot keep track of multiple ships in hyperbolic orbits while performing planetary operations. If I ever launch multiple ships again during a single transfer window, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m going to wait until all ships are in stable orbits at the target location before doing anything. Starting the Explorer\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s mission with trips down to the surface and plotting transfers to other moons while the other two ships were still inbound ended up being a bit of a disaster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 7. Kerbal Alarm Clock is great, so long as I remember to use it EVERY TIME. Forgetting to activate it a few times led to undesired results, especially with the two follow-on ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 8. The roleplaying aspects just sort of manifested themselves as I was writing captions for the photo albums. The Kerbals started to develop distinct personalities, especially Wilman. This turned into an unexpected outlet for creativity, and ended up being fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 9. I liked my over-the-top acronym for the space organization launching the rocket (KABOOM), and I may use more acronyms on future reports and/or career saves. Next on the list is the National Association for Development of Impressive Rockets, or NADIR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 10. I spent too much time flying this mission and writing up the mission report over the last week. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s time to put the game down for a while and spend more time with the family. When I do pick it up again, if I try another big challenge (such as the kethane variant of this challenge) it will be stretched over a much longer real-life timeframe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kookoo_gr","CreatedById":57720,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-05T10:42:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cmdr.
