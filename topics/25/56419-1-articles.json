Furthermore, there\u0027s no reason people can\u0027t simply post their screenshots in a response to your post. For one, it will ensure that people know that you intend to be a fair judge who keeps everything above the board (not that we\u0027d have any reason to suspect you, of course, but that extra effort helps...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d finally recommend that you take a look at our official \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24898-Challenge-Submission-Guide\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EChallenge Submission Guide\u003C/a\u003E and ensure that your challenge is within those guidelines.

The only point in which this one is different from those I have seen is that the vehicle can leave the runway but has to survive braking. So far it was either stopping while still on the runway, or don\u0027t care what happens next. Not a substantial difference IMO.
