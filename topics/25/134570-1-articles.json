I have created the mav useing phoneix industry mav like acent vehicle, Phoneix industry small sat (for satelite and surveyor), hullcam vds (for imaging mission site)\u00A0hermes mod (i forget what it\u0027s called), phoneix industry rover or another ares like rover, habitat mod, mechjeb, hyperedit, tac life support, kas, kis, shadow \u00A0works orion, and laztek spacex launch vehicle for the\u00A0mission.\u00A0i will post it when my mission is\u00A0done. I will put hermes in leo, mav in duna, rover near the hab, hab on duna near the mav. This is not creating the martian but make a ares mission like launch, dock with hermes, hermes go to duna, mdv land on duna, crew do some experiment, crew launch from the mav, crew dock with hemes, hermes get back to earth, return vehicle dock with hermes, and crew get back to earth (the launch and return vehicle are MPCV Orion from shadow works orion mod. That is my my mission plan. So i challenge you to make ares lkke mission using any mod you like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-20T04:52:52Z\u0022 title=\u002203/20/2016 04:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by EL4M\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
