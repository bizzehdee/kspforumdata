Usually they need to have some kind of restrictions or they quickly become nonsensical. There is no limit if you are allowed to reach maximum speed outside of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. If it has to be done inside Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere then it gets interesting. If you restrict to airbreathing engines then you top out at 2100 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nytr013","CreatedById":196432,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-08T03:05:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223569366\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022183135\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221553636223\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157695\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sevenperforce\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/26/2019 at 4:37 PM, sevenperforce said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey crop up periodically.
