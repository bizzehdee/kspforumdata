I went with a traditional rocket style look. This thing flies perfectly straight and is very nimble in space without any RCS. The RCS components are on the lander which is tucked away inside a fairing. Once at Mun, the bottom half of the rocket ejects downward and reveals the lander. The lander is capable of landing on its own and achieving orbit again with the assistance of the RCS thrusters. It also has the ability to dock with the top piece which acts as a deorbit and landing engine. Once the fuel is depleted, you just undock it and use the lander\u0027s regular engines to finish the landing. Capable of slowing down for a landing at high velocities. 400 m/s at 4000 meter altitude safe limit for Mun high speed landing. Once done on Mun, the player doesn\u0027t have to redock with the command ship. You have the option to space walk and then the command ship will take you home. Comes equipped with emergency parachutes. The first set of parachutes deploy and remain attached down to 800 meters and then you eject them and deploy the second set. The second set of parachutes finishes the landing. Only 3 action groups. If a new player doesn\u0027t want to dock, they can instead get rid of the lander and use the deorbit engine to deorbit the main command module and land it instead. So this ship can scale with the skill of the player that\u0027s flying it. Good for docking practice in orbit too. It can be used in many different ways for landings and has more than enough fuel to get the job done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload the Atlas V here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-vTRL2n8wvzSThLQWFWaDctNFU/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-vTRL2n8wvzSThLQWFWaDctNFU/edit?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/901013347854769886/6FE56426BD2A8A78750098ECA49CFF77119CCE5B/\u0022 alt=\u00226FE56426BD2A8A78750098ECA49CFF77119CCE5B\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWatch a first try test run to Mun and back to Kerban.

So with light payloads I like to go about 1/4 thrust and with heavy payloads I usually go about 3/4 thrust. That way the engines use less fuel at the higher altitude and you can easily achieve orbit. At the end of the drop tanks, there\u0027s regular asparagus staging, but because you\u0027re already going at 3/4 - 1/4 thrust, the engine flameout doesn\u0027t cause sudden huge deceleration or potential structural failures. So when you\u0027re at orbital altitude, you still have the maximum thrust that you started out with, but you run it at a much lower throttle. Alternatively, you could put different smaller engines on the sides of the big ones, and just shutdown all of the mainstall engines with an action group and then switch over to the more efficient engines. Any left over fuel can be used to escape the Kerban SOI very quickly or transferred to different engines depending what\u0027s on the payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the method in practice. This is my Leviathan super max payload lifter on the bottom attached to a 144 ton payload. I\u0027m working on improving this model some by lightening the inner engines and separating the orange tanks into two stacks of grey tanks so that way you can drop two grey\u0027s at a time and loose the excess weight quicker as you accelerate. I used the same method to lift a payload of 700 tons into orbit. If I had lost thrust at any time, it wouldn\u0027t have worked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to try it for yourself, you can download the Leviathan lifer here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-vTRL2n8wvzQkEtUTBCNHpIMW8/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-vTRL2n8wvzQkEtUTBCNHpIMW8/edit?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll you have to do is watch the fuel gauges on one orange tank at a time so you know to eject it.
