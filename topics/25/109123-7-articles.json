Particularly for newcomers interested in additional inspiration for their Apollo beyond 17, it could be useful (nothing on \u0022beyond Earth SOI\u0022 missions, e.g., the fly-bys, but more than 40 lunar Apollos, and Skylab missions where ATM came *later*, and cargo deliveries expanded Skylab space (just like they do on ISS, at least until it\u0027s time to toss out the trash and clear the way for a new shipment). At the very least, it\u0027s an interesting read on what could have been. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n[http://www.wired.com/2014/10/dreamingadifferentapollo/](http://www.wired.com/2014/10/dreamingadifferentapollo/)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-03T19:28:10Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2015 07:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by B-STRK**"},{"CreatedByName":"loch.ness","CreatedById":101329,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T09:00:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E loch.ness: 13.
