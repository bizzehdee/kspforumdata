At best, the Muses wink at me from across the ballroom while slow-dancing and ultimately going home with somebody else. Thus, I phrased this challenge in the practical terms you see. To truly own Duna, you have to be able to maneuver about the majority of its surface, which is the endless dune fields at 2000-4000m elevation. So, whether you want to visit all the anomalies in 1 mission from a central base, or have multiple colonies scattered about the planet that need linking with commuter flights, or imagine yourself harvesting sandworm spice out in the trackless desert, you have to be able to fly on Duna. Sure, you can get anywhere on Duna eventually with a rover, but that\u0027s boring and attracts sandworms \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. Suborbital rocketry is too expensive in fuel. That leaves aircraft as the only viable means of on-Duna transportation over long distances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically, if you\u0027re just going to Duna 1 time to plant a flag, you have no need of aircraft there. But if you want to live there, you can\u0027t do without them. Thus, I view this challenge as mostly for those who have a practical need for long-term, long-range mobility on Duna. That\u0027s definitely a niche market. Inexperienced players are happy enough to plant a flag and leave. Experienced players are more interested in Laythe than boring, inhospitable Duna. But somewhere in between are those who feel that a real, planet-conquering colony on Duna is necessary prior to going further from home.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-24T05:03:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DaMichel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DaMichel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlready had made a fix for myself so the control surfaces would work properly.

And the tanker isn\u0027t disposable either- it will be continuing on to Duna separately as well, to provide additional fuel for the colonists. I could just as easily have set up a couple refueling depots in deep space between Kerbin and Duna, or have fast-forwarded to a good transfer window with the Raven in Minmus orbit if I didn\u0027t have other missions going on. So I would ask you to reconsider that judgment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, simply copying the craft alone wouldn\u0027t be a viable option- as it required a refueling in both low Kerbin orbit and Minmus orbit (and would even with a proper transfer window). I simply don\u0027t have the real-life time to design and launch the additional fuel tankers or fuel depots in a separate save, as well as re-perform the ascent to orbit and transfer\u002Bcapture to Minmus in a separate save that would be required to have a good transfer window. If I was going to do it in a separate save, I\u0027d need to have copied the entire save file BEFORE I left Minmus (the save file is now both updated and quicksaved past that point) and terminated all the other flights...
