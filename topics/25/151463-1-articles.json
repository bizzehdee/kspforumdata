I don\u0027t care from where you get the science or the tech, just so long as you have it for the challenge. Also, the reason why cheapness is the tiebreaker is so that career games have a chance. But, like I said, it doesn\u0027t matter from where you get the tech, so long as you have it, and take a screenshot of the tech tree when you head out. Also, as is detailed in the rules, all techs leading up to, and including, advanced exploration will not count against you in scoring, but all others subtract 10 points, which encourages you to divert as little from that path as possible (as was stated in my attempt, I had already researched 10 other techs, which loses me 100 points before I was off the ground.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
