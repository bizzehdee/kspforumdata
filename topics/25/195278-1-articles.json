Landing at each Mun biome yields 552 points (ignoring the effects of leveled Scientists); so also one can skip visiting 4 Mun biomes (probably Poles, Polar Lowlands, Polar Crater, and Highland Craters). The remaining 100 points can be spent on not using the Infrared Telescope. The trickiest part of the challenge, I think, would be finding all the biomes without using SCANSat mapping parts, though they don\u0027t actually yield science unless you Analyze the scan when it\u0027s completed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zanie420","CreatedById":172601,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-15T14:31:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223820776\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022195278\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221594785356\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022101649\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022problemecium\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, problemecium said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn imgur album would work.
