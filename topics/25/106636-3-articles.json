The diameter of Kerbin is 3,769,911m. Your distance is showing 3,939,677. That distance is very consistent with one circumnavigation. Kerbin rotates in the direction you were travelling meaning, the distance would be even further than 3,700km. In 2 hours, it rotates 628km. So, somewhere around 4,300km would be a reasonable distance. I could buy the 3,900 if it were one, but how did you get two circumnavigations? I\u0027m not saying you didn\u0027t mind you. I\u0027ve already seen some strange numbers coming from these flights. It just doesn\u0027t make sense though. Now if you managed an average of say 1,100m/s over 2 hours that would be 7,900km which does make sense for 2 circumnavigations. I\u0027m just curious why the F3 is showing something very different.\n\u003E The time for the speed you were travelling, that sounds about right. That F3 screen has me breaking out the calculator tho. Did you perhaps F5/F9?\n\nNo quicksaves, im not sure where the error is coming from, while i topped out at 1238m/s flying, cruise speed was somewhere around 1200 or so, maybe it just has to do with how the distance is calculated, because if it just calculates furthest you were from starting point to staring point, then it would come out looking like 1 navigation. Idk\n\n*the one thing im not sure of is what award i get with this, to me it seems like its fast enough to compete with the speedsters as well as qualifying for the double navigation.* Edit: i just read the rules, ill definately be passing on flying for two hours in a row again so im going with the grand navigator. besides, i think i can make a craft that does one navigation with turbos at 1300\n\nOut of curiosity, does anyone want me to upload the craft?\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Beautiful ship, and nicely done.\n\u003E Sure, I\u0027ll answer your question of how I tilted the engines on my craft while they were attached to connecting points:\n\u003E \n\u003E First, ensure that both your engines have been placed in symmetry mode and/or you have symmetry mode turned on. Symmetry mode can be turned on via the panel in the bottom left corner of your screen in the spaceplane hangar. The reason for this is that you want every little change you make to one side to be identical on the other. You may have already known this, but I mentioned it just in case. Also ensure that your angle snap mode, which is indicated right next to the symmetry mode, is set to either angle snap or smooth mode for your purposes. For fine tuned 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 or less angle changes, you\u0027ll want angle snap off and smooth mode on instead (indicated by a circle with a dot inside).\n\u003E \n\u003E Second, you should know that the \u00221\u0022 key by default will put you into part Place mode, \u00222\u0022 into Offset mode, \u00223\u0022 into Rotate mode, and \u00224\u0022 into Root mode. Press \u00223\u0022 to go into rotate mode, or of course simply click that option which is displayed at the top left of your SPH view. Then, select either the engine itself, or whatever assembly it is attached to if you want to, for instance, like on my Sojourn 2, rotate both the engine and the precooler it is on. Now, you should see a brightly colored set of circles pop up which represents your axes of rotation. Carefully put your pointer directly on the axis indicator circle you want to rotate on, click and hold, and move your mouse to rotate it. Press \u00221\u0022 once you\u0027re done to go back into normal place mode. Now, sometimes shifting angles can cause gaps on one side of the connection. To remedy this, go into Offset mode (\u00222\u0022). Select the corresponding axis to translate the part on, and drag it until everything looks right. If ever during this process, you change an angle or offset, and you don\u0027t like the results, you can press LCtrl \u002B z to undo the action.\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m guessing the trouble you were having with part rotation is that you were doing all your rotation in place mode using the Shift \u002B letter keys, and as a result, those place mode-angled parts determined the angle of all the rest of the parts that got attached.\n\u003E \n\u003E Here\u0027s a good link to quickly reference the VAB/SPH commands:\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Key_bindings](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Key_bindings)\n\nThanks for the help, i was away from KSP for about a year and a lot of stuff has changed, i made use of it in my prototype and im currently testing it to see if i can squeeze a bit more airflow, alt and speed out of it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T07:48:05Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 07:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by imthebait**"},{"CreatedByName":"Deutherius","CreatedById":125381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T13:22:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m confused.

On that note, there is a deeper technical aspect of all this that I haven\u0027t been able to find knowledge on with a modest amount of searching. That is, a technique for optimizing ascent profile in the context of maximizing circumnavigation speed (disregarding fuel consumption) without using mods - I think it would be fun and interesting to learn an objective, systematic approach to it. Now, if it involves second order differential equations, I\u0027m toast and I\u0027ll go back to my Ricky Bobby method of trial and error. Anyway, even if the solution is a very fine tuned curve, I could extrapolate from points along that to serve as a general guide to manually fly to my sub 30 km cruising altitude.\n\nDescent is also a consideration when flying manually. My gut tells me this would be a lot more simple, sort of like late braking in race car driving. However, it could use a systematic approach also - again, focusing purely on speed toward mission completion.\n\nI\u0027m making a wild guess here that it will be based on desired cruising altitude, thrust, mass, and... coefficient of drag? Add in heat, and it gets even more complex.\n\nDoes anyone have any good links or suggestions regarding this? If not, I just might do my own scientific experiments to give at least place holder solutions and post my results here on my findings as long as that\u0027s ok with Fengist.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T03:17:23Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 03:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MunGazer**"},{"CreatedByName":"imthebait","CreatedById":58460,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T03:35:09Z","Content":"I haven\u0027t looked too hard for anything, and I\u0027m away from home for a day, but if I find anything I\u0027ll let you know, the biggest challenge I\u0027ve been having is I hit 1000 m/s on the way up at around 10k but if I don\u0027t take off the throttle a bit, I\u0027ll cruise straight into the stratosphere past 40k alt or more"},{"CreatedByName":"Xeldrak","CreatedById":57228,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T17:22:54Z","Content":"\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I am playing in 1.0, though...\n\nI\u0027m not by any means an \u0022expert\u0022 on the subject matter, but I\u0027ve carefully considered your question and I\u0027ll try to at least throw you a bone here.\n\n\u0022Aerodynamic heating is greatest at high speed and in the lower atmosphere where the density is greater.\u0022\n\nThat\u0027s from a wikipedia article on aerodynamic heating. Generally, this effect seems to be somewhat reflected in ksp\u0027s physics. However, the scale at which it occurs is probably significantly different than irl. So, basically in ksp you can count on much higher heat going 700 m/s at 1,000 meters altitude than going 700 m/s at 10,000 meters altitude with the other variables being practically the same.\n\nAnd if I\u0027m not mistaken, the rate at which you slow down the air flowing over your craft due to its shape will have a significant effect on how much energy, and thus heat, is transferred to your craft. In other words, slip a very low drag object through the air (such as a patriot missile) and it will generate much less heat at the leading edges than, say, a one meter wide potato shaped rock, or, more relevantly, a craft with a very bluntly shaped nose cone, like a candy corn. You can verify this with high speed test rockets using extremely long, pointy procedural nose cone fairings versus ones that are very short and more steeply angled. Sometimes that alone can mean the difference between exploding or not.\n\nOther than that, considering other limitations, it\u0027s just about controlling your airspeed and knowing your limits at any given altitude. You often can\u0027t just punch the throttle to max and expect to be ok at lower altitudes with even the pointiest low drag aircraft. Watching your aerodynamic FX in external view is a handy way to keep a guage of the situation in the stock game. For mach 2\u002B you\u0027ll want to get some pretty high altitude to be heat safe (of course there are exceptions).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-14T02:43:10Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2015 02:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MunGazer**"},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T03:16:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E QQ: In the rules, does \u0022Jeb\u0022 stand for \u0022MechJeb\u0022?

Parts connected radially will generate a lot of heat, even if you clip them inside another part. For all practical purposes, they\u0027re deflecting air just as much as the forward linear part.\n\nTherefore, any any part you have sticking out front better be pointy or be able to take and deflect a lot of heat. Try this for a test. Make a plane with the Mk2 pod and no nose cone. Fly it and see when it blows up. Then, put a cone on it.\n\nIf you want to get crazy and try some of the things I did, stick an I-beam out the front of your aircraft or, a pointy antenna that\u0027s extended and compare results. I\u0027ve hit over 2,000m/s at sea level and back to landing without blowing up."},{"CreatedByName":"GROOV3ST3R","CreatedById":27590,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T21:22:59Z","Content":"I\u0027m having an issue where a single engine isn\u0027t getting me up to speed quick enough - I\u0027m trying to compensate by adding lots of lift to improve my angle of attack but it\u0027s still painfully slow :S But it is a one-of-a-kind craft (more on that later).

I keep struggling past 260m/s but inevitably hit a wall and start slowing down AND losing altitude. I fear my craft got too complicated for it\u0027s own good and I might need to redesign with less of everything.\n\u003E Weight it a huge compromising issue - it carries a lot of fuel, several passengers and stowed away engines that are used for vertical take off (landing doesn\u0027t work quite as well though).\n\u003E \n\u003E [https://scontent-lhr.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfa1/t31.0-8/11020515_938855299468104_8200893310675606959_o.jpg](https://scontent-lhr.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfa1/t31.0-8/11020515_938855299468104_8200893310675606959_o.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E [https://scontent-lhr.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xta1/t31.0-8/11255851_938855332801434_5505110100812162153_o.jpg](https://scontent-lhr.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xta1/t31.0-8/11255851_938855332801434_5505110100812162153_o.jpg)\n\nAt any rate that\u0027s a really cool concept. I love the cargo bay mounted vertical take off engine that\u0027s really cool.\n\nGetting more information about your plane and looking at the pictures, I\u0027ll offer some suggestions. In the worst case scenario, a major re-design could be in order. However, you could retain the core concepts and envisioned capabilities. Some ideas:\n\n1. How much fuel do you really need for a circumnav in that? You can estimate this by taking your fuel consumption rate shown in the resource panel (i.e. 0.40), which is how much liquidfuel per second you\u0027re burning, multiply it by (kerbin \u0027 s circumference in meters / average speed in m/s). So, if your fuel consumption at cruising alt was 0.20, and you knew it would take you roughly 4,800 seconds at 800 m/s, then 4800x0.20 = 960 fuel.\n\n2. What\u0027s your center of mass to center of lift relationship? Perhaps the potential overall lift you\u0027re making can\u0027t quite do its thing because you simply don\u0027t have the pitch authority to pick the nose up and create more lift (and of course more drag, which could be problematic) during your ascent phase in lower atmosphere. Generally, moving your center of lift closer toward the front of your craft and/or your center of mass will help you when it comes to picking your nose up. Often, you can adjust this simply by playing around with fuel levels in the hangar and fuel location. Be careful with canards. While they help pick the nose up, they also produce a lot of drag when fully deflected, so it\u0027s a catch 22. That\u0027s why I ended up using small delta wings with small control surfaces on my craft in lieu of canards.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-15T22:57:47Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2015 10:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MunGazer**"},{"CreatedByName":"imthebait","CreatedById":58460,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T03:08:38Z","Content":"I\u0027m back, now I know this is breaking the rules which is why I\u0027m asking, but is it possible that we could use robotics on this?

This, coupled with the MK2-to-engine connector at the back, presented a bit of a dilemma - bay with the vertical engines wasn\u0027t perfectly centred in the craft and so centre of gravity has an annoying tendency to shift as it depletes. Interestingly enough, running on the main engine the craft uses fuel from one tank at a time and using supports, it uses all fuel tanks simultaneously (because of \u0027\u0027radial\u0027\u0027 mounts as opposed to a stack). I did however had to extend the craft with 2 extra cores for that little bit extra reaction wheel power to control it when hovering. Their weight alone helped balance it a bit.\n\u003E I also placed 4 strategic RCS tanks in the bay and decided to use it as ballast - with the tail of the plane being filled constantly with RCS fuel and middle tanks always being 50% empty for minute corrections to my COG.\n\u003E \n\u003E And to shift all of that mass, I had to use 4 engines in the bay, 2 mounted to the bay and 2 mounted to the inside walls of the bay and then \u0027\u0027offset\u0027\u0027 to merge with the original engines. This allowed me to have 4 engines in a space of two without any no-clip hacks - think of it as a \u0027\u0027turbo-turbo engine\u0027\u0027 ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E HOWEVER.... as I was building up my wings - the sweeping straight lines you can see cutting across the delta are the original wings as they were with no extensions - I noticed my COG was very high on the craft. I can only assume it was to do with my engines and the relatively low mounted wings.\n\u003E \n\u003E So now, my centre of lift sits in front and below the COG.. which coupled with fore and aft canards, makes the craft VERY pitch-happy - if you overdo it by just a tiny bit, you will be sent into an unrecoverable flatspin. You then HAVE to use the supporting engines and suddenly the craft flies PERFECTLY and even recovers on it\u0027s own....\n\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s about the thick of it.\n\u003E \n\u003E To answer 1: 0.50 to 0.40 is my cruise consumption - once I get to a cruising speed and altitude. The problem is, a single engine doesn\u0027t have the power to push this jet very fast so the climb rate is usually always below 100m/s. I think I will need to convert to a dual jet just to improve my overall speed and climb. I am carrying something like 1900 units of fuel so I could probably afford to sacrifice some efficiency for another engine and double my thrust. My main concern was airflow - the more air there is to breathe, the more power a single jet can make. But I have yet to reach an operational ceiling with this craft ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E 2: As I mentioned before, it\u0027s fairly high, with COL being in front and below. I managed to align it with rear canards so that it\u0027s directly under the COG but mass is still swinging my plane out of control if I\u0027m not extremely careful. Angle of attack seems very reasonable though, I circumnavigated at 20 degrees before the new model was introduced, now it\u0027s almost flat - but the lack of speed kills it as I get higher and have to increase my drag to maintain altitude. This is why I wanted more wings, so I can carry my weight with me.\n\u003E \n\u003E I could remove the front canards and tweak the rear ones to make my pitch less violent - as my canards are barely angled during a cruise. (problem is it cruises at 260m/s at 13km....) Ideally my COL and COG would be aligned on the central axis, with the lift a little in front but I\u0027ll take anything with this plane :3\n\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t want to play with fuel levels anymore ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) it\u0027s very complicated, especially with the weird way my plane uses fuel in the first place which makes it almost impossible to keep balanced in anything else other than 0 and 1.\n\u003E \n\u003E Well, I\u0027ll make some tweaks to it, see if I can make it fly right. My main concern is and always was airflow - that was the biggest limiting factor of the previous meta.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nEDIT:\n\nChanges were made!\n\nI retained my VTOL AND made it flyable with some fairly minor tweaks! I also kept relative balance of the craft while adding a 2nd engine. Overall, it worked out pretty well.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E My 2 main issues were:\n\u003E \n\u003E - lack of power\n\u003E \n\u003E - violent pitch instability\n\u003E \n\u003E Issue #1 was resolved by doubling up on my main engines. I initially thought this would spread the air between them pretty thing but that doesn\u0027t seem to be the case and my thrust is now double - which is perfectly adequate. It is however a little too thirsty right now.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![11108840_939516362735331_2106480379731084964_n.jpg?oh=ac2d22895894af47f2abc811e5939c08\u0026oe=55FE6F32](https://scontent-lhr.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xat1/v/t1.0-9/11108840_939516362735331_2106480379731084964_n.jpg?oh=ac2d22895894af47f2abc811e5939c08\u0026oe=55FE6F32)\n\u003E \n\u003E Adding a 2nd engine meant the tail was now a lot heavier so I had to drop my oxidizer ballast. In addition to that, I brought the nacelles down a bit, rotated them towards the inside of the plane while I kept the intakes facing the right way with some minor offset work. Nacelles are no longer used to carry fuel around - which might change if I decide I need more fuel for the challenge. However that will require some more balance work :S\n\u003E \n\u003E ![11130178_939516342735333_333023962479284252_n.jpg?oh=4ba283d69d0f419e7cae566c7a6af054\u0026oe=55CE04A3](https://scontent-lhr.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xtp1/v/t1.0-9/11130178_939516342735333_333023962479284252_n.jpg?oh=4ba283d69d0f419e7cae566c7a6af054\u0026oe=55CE04A3)\n\u003E \n\u003E Issue #2 was brought to a manageable level with several smaller tweaks. Trailing edge of my wing was tilted down for extra lift in the old design - this was no longer necessary and I replaced it with a flatter and bigger piece.\n\u003E \n\u003E After some testing, involving a metric ton of backflips and even some frontflips (!!), I added canards back in but mounted them dead level, with no trim preference. Doubled up canards at the back for even more force with less deflection.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![11295536_939516359401998_81015477336919371_n.jpg?oh=a8e2a9f3a0fb7c2a3c696d6551f00984\u0026oe=56019797](https://scontent-lhr.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xta1/v/t1.0-9/11295536_939516359401998_81015477336919371_n.jpg?oh=a8e2a9f3a0fb7c2a3c696d6551f00984\u0026oe=56019797)\n\u003E \n\u003E The biggest issue here was that the nose of the plane had a tendency to rise no matter what I did. So to combat that, I mounted simple fins to the nose of the craft and angled them down so they create a little bit of drag and try to pull the nose down. This counter balanced the violent tendency to nose-up a lot but it wasn\u0027t perfect until I added more canards to manage my pitch better.\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s still a bit hit-and-miss however. It\u0027s a very difficult craft to fly - climb too quickly and you will get stuck at high altitude and low speed. Too flat and you waste fuel to excess drag at low altitudes. Too violent and you will lose 30%\u002B of your speed with a chance to flip and lose all control of the craft. Too high and too slow and your engines don\u0027t have enough air to breathe and thrust drops - and you have to get crazy angles of attack.\n\u003E \n\u003E Get it JUST right and it will get close to 1000m/s - at which point you fry the fins that manage your passive stability and control becomes a lot more difficult than it was.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![11233524_939516382735329_4905472903728319736_n.jpg?oh=4cbd66a357e3cb8b175ebe385b1618a0\u0026oe=56022A99](https://scontent-lhr.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/11233524_939516382735329_4905472903728319736_n.jpg?oh=4cbd66a357e3cb8b175ebe385b1618a0\u0026oe=56022A99)\n\u003E \n\u003E Lots of lift helps keep a flatter AoA while climbing and accelerating.
