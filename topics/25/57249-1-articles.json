These bases need to be able to service craft and kerbals that pass through on their missions. You just need to pick an base LZ and an orbit for a space station and start setting up your constructions wherever you want. These bases and stations need to be able to house kerbals, refuel craft, have sustainable power, have backup ships, have crew transfer systems, and anything else that would improve the operational performance of your base of operations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to do the challenge: Pick the planet or moon you want to build on. Then select what that base or station will be used for (the more the better). Then send out your constructions and show their usefulness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo win this challenge, you should have bases and stations that can service and be used for a variety of tasks on every planet and moon. However, just tackling one is good enough. I\u0027ll use my current Duna Command Center and Gagarin Station as an example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Duna Command Center and Gagarin Station can be used for: Rover missions, orbital refueling, crew transfer, crew housing, ship storage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImprovements would be: satellite storage, rover storage, planetside refueling, Duna SSTO landing strip, ship hangar, science gear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of these things serve a purpose and would make the base and station more efficient. When you max out the efficiency of a base or station, then you\u0027re done and can move on to the next planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Duna base would be a good mid way point between the Kerbin planet and a transfer out to Jool, so having bases and stations out in the Jool system would be my next move.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou move up on the leaderboards based on how much your base or station can do, and how many planets or moons you have them on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis challenge is an engineering challenge mainly, so you are free to use mods of your choice, just no use of the debug menu. Doing this in career mode earns you a career mode tag next to your name. For submissions, just post the launch vehicle and the final result on the planet or moon, then tell us what it can be used for. Also tell us what mods you used if any and if it\u0027s in career mode or not. Examples are below, minus the launch vehicles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ELeaderboards:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E1. 700NitroXpress - 2 bases, 3 stations (Duna, Kerbin)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGagarin Station (Crew transfer, crew storage, ship storage, orbital refueling)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5bc800S.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00225bc800S.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBig H.O.S.S.
