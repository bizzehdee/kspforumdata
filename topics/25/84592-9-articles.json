Take off and landing is easy, the vessel is VERY stable both weighted and unweighted. The trick to orbiting cheaply is to eject on the jets alone. However they\u0027re not balanced at higher altitudes. The vessel will handle inevitable burnouts and misaligned thrust gracefully, but you need to pilot the ejection properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(1) Launch at a 45 degree angle (watch your tail end on take off, it\u0027s low) Up to about 20km. Engage SAS for the full trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) As needed flatten out to keep one engine from going into burnout. Try to hold a vertical speed of 40-80m/s through ~30km while building horizontal speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(3) At this point you\u0027ll loose one of your engines (burnout), the other engine is then the dominant one, cut back on the thrust limiter on the dominant engine until the second one re-engages. The plane will bobble slightly but SAS should handle it gracefully so don\u0027t sweat it (the vessel is capable of flying on a single engine, either one).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(4) Now just keep dropping your thrust limiter on the dominant engine to keep the other engaged. Around 35k you might find you\u0027re dropping into negative vertical speed. That\u0027s ok, try not to let it drop too much (10-20m/s max), once you pick up speed you\u0027ll be able to climb again, ideally don\u0027t drop into negative, but don\u0027t sweat it if you do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(5) Around 38k you\u0027ll end up dropping your dominant engine down to 0 thrust limiter and climb the rest of the way on the other single jet. Keep climbing at around 5-20m/s or so. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(6) You\u0027ll loose the second engine to burnout somewhere over 40k, at this point you should have an apoapis of over 100,000m. If you still have a negative periapsis you climbed too fast, try again and hold your vertical speed down until you pick up speed in the 30-40k region. Don\u0027t try a high incline ejection, the goal is to fly it straight until you\u0027re going fast enough to eject (at the point that your apoapis exceeds 100k you won\u0027t be able to hold the vertical speed down and will likely be pointing the nose slightly downward to keep from climbing too quickly!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(7) The moment you loose both jets immediately move to a 45 degree climbing glide. You\u0027ll see your vertical speed increase while you loose some apoapis height. Your apoapis shouldn\u0027t drop much more than about 80,000m, if you\u0027re a really slick pilot you can probably hold 100,000 apoapis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(8) At your apoapis engage the tiny jet engines and circularize for ~40d/v (you should be pulling up a periapsis of around 35,000m to 70,000m)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you\u0027re free to do docking maneuvers. Note that all fuel tanks but the liquid and the last liquid/oxidizer tank are disabled, so if you need more than about 100d/v for maneuvers you\u0027ll need to unlock tanks. If you\u0027re planning on docking with something, take off when your target is exactly a 90 degrees before KSC to meet it efficiently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding is smooth, without any autopilot burn retrograde on the opposite side of kerbin to KSC, bring a periapsis down to about 35,000 above KSC and glide in. Keep the nose up to keep vertical speed down to around -80m/s, this will drop you in at about 20,000m just in front of KSC. Bring along 20 units of liquid fuel for some minor correcting burns as you glide in (burn around 25,000m to keep up altitude and speed if you\u0027re short). If you overshoot KSC you should be able to flip over and pull a hard nose dive to come into KSC from the east, the craft is well enough balanced to handle this maneuver (~10g\u0027s not sure how it\u0027ll play out in Near/Far).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAction groups:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(1) Disengage/Engage Jet engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) Engage/Disengage small liquid\u002Boxidizer engines (meant only for small burns, circularization and docking)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-16T20:44:35Z\u0022 title=\u002211/16/2014 08:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by davidparks21\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kcs123","CreatedById":127158,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-15T18:57:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@davidparks21, your links are private, can\u0027t be downloaded for other peoples.

This affects lift and drag. Placing them seems to be where people mess up (I\u0027m guilty too). For NEAR/FAR spoilers you don\u0027t want them on the trailing edge of the wing, you really want them in front of the flap ON the top of the wing. Check \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoiler_%28aeronautics%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ewikipedia\u003C/a\u003E for real life pictures/examples.

The easiest way to do this is have them extend horizontally, often i see them placed in strange places which do not create proper symmetry and end up altering lift. I did a horizontal deployment on my B9 entry from the double tail in this thread. You can do it with NEAR/FAR by creating spoilers without symmetry and changing one side to be negative deployment. If you check the exchange thread in my sig you can see the Harrier does this.
