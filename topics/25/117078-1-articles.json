It basicly had a layout like this front to back. Jetengine\u003Efueltank\u003Edecoupler\u003Elandingcan\u003Edecoupler\u003Ecockpit \n\nThe plan for it was I would fly it to antarctica hoping to then over the arctic, decouple everything, Dropping the cockpit, lander can, and back in seprate pieces.\n\nThe front and back would serve as useless. although, there were parachutes on everything.\n\nThe lander can would drop with parachutes, and land and start a small colony.\n\nSo, since i couldn\u0027t make it, or even, Get off the runway for that matter, i wanted to see if someone could Scott Manley it.\n\nFor proof that you did it, take a screenshot of the lander can, and a screenshot of the plane in flight.\n\nThe rules are simple.\n\nDon\u0027t go into space.\n\nUse any mods nessacary that can help you \u0022Drop the lander can\u0022\n\nThe lander can must be dropped in a way like a bomb is\n\nYou can do it like:\n\nThe way I explained\n\nout of a cargo bay\n\ndropping it from the underside like a bomb with parachutes.\n\nBest of luck!![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T17:52:38Z","Content":"You want an aircraft that drops a can of Kerbals, and the rest of the vehicle is expendable?"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T17:59:12Z","Content":"Too easy I could build it in my sleep.
