The challenge is design a craft that is better suited for the tutorial.\n\nUse stock parts.\n\nIt should be easily piloted by someone new to KSP, so a reasonable amount of reaction wheels and RCS would be a good thing.\n\nIt should set a \u0027fair\u0027 level of difficultly for the tutorial.\n\nIt must be possible to complete the tutorial with the craft within a reasonable timeframe! (No ultrahigh dV Xenon craft)"}]}
