Its in the game, hasnt been patched and its almost impossible not to use it so IMHO its perfectly OK to use it and allowance has been made for the advantage it brings by creating a separate honours list for this version. In fact I would encourage players to understand and exploit it to the fullness of their ability because in v17 it will be gone so we may as well have some fun with it while it is here. I dont think the fuel use and thrust to mass ratios of rockets are properly balanced for 100% throttle anyway in v16 and will need rebalancing when the bug is removed so really its not as if the bug is breaking an otherwise realistic computer model IMHO, meanwhile I have made some weird ships fly exploiting this bug.

It strikes me that a total relaunch would give the opportunity to change some of the rules such as allowing mods as a default and simply giving kudos for stock as opposed to the stock only restriction. Also it would allow the redefining of rules to include payload drop and refuel missions etc which would be fine IMHO. I dont use mods so it would be better if someone who knows mods did that.
