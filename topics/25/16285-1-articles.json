This may not sound like much, but I took a few screens and I think they speak for themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the challenge is this - build something to launch your Kerbal as far as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERules - vehicle must be mostly stationary on the launch pad (bails from already airborne craft will not count.) Participants must be able to prove distance and that it wasn\u0027t a bailout from something already airborne (thus my own screenshots do not count, although they were actually the result of a catastrophic failure on the launch pad.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, happy catapulting!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PrIyo.png\u0022 alt=\u0022PrIyo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XxrdL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022XxrdL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
