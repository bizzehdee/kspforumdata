You will need to use landing legs, struts, metal trusses. Whatever floats your boat. Just don\u0027t use the CLAW! All you need to enter is the Screenshot of you launching your contraption, rendevousing with the asteroid in question, and you capturing the asteroid ( a picture of the debug menu will be required in these screenshots) There\u0027s only 2 rules: #1; No debug menu cheats, #2; no use of the claw that was added in( 0.23.5 . You begin with 100 points.(it used to be 50, but it was too small). Whoever gets the highest score with a succesfully captured asteroid will win. Scores will be determined by: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA) how many parts were in your capture craft? Less is better. For example; a capture craft with 500 parts (you\u0027d need quite a beefy PC) would mean -50 points from your points that you begin with. Every 10 parts = -1 point. Ship parts are counted when the entire launch stage is jettesoned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E how big was the asteroid, and possibly, how many?

A captured asteroid = an asteroid in a orbit lower than the Mun. Time is measured in time since launch, AKA: Mission time.
