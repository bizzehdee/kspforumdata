All my planes shutdown completely and spin out of control at around 20,000m...\n\nI usually go with two ram air intakes for every turbojet on-board. Even at that you really need to be cooking by the time you hit 20k (1.1kps at least). Even then I find it helps to throttle back to 70% or so to reduce the strain on the intakes. You\u0027ve got to keep an eye on your intake air and listen to your engines. If they start to spool-down on thier own with intake air below 0.1 shut them down, throttle back up, and finish the insertion on the rocket motors. \n\nFlying these is as much about technique as it is design.

Sure close but due to floating point precision being inaccurate not even the computer will be a 100% accurate for you so its just a wast of time and effort.\n\nI make sure to get an interception first then I burn. After that I leave kerbins orbit and once I am 1/3 to 2/3 on the way to Duna I adjust my vector so I get close enough to Duna but also make sure I intercept at the equator. This usually dont cost more then 13-70m/s of delta V. Then when I intercept Duna I make final adjustment and it will cost very little to. Thats the way I do it with my Falcon X Jumbo or any other craft. Witha good intercept of Duna 11.5Km altitude works well most of the time for arobreaking.\n\nAlso Time warping slower especially when ever your about to intercept a planet will reduce the floating point errors and your Pe will end up closer to the predicted vector.\n\nThe thing that annoys me with the current engine and intake setup in KSP is that its even more unrealistic then intake abuse to some extent. First off a jet engine is not 1m long its at least 5-6 times as long. Second is the fact that you dont use ram air intakes for a jet engine. You use a nosecone or similar for high speed craft or a intact duct that will reduce the incoming air to subsonic speeds for it to work with the Jet engine. So raimair makes 0 sense because a jet has its own compressor and it requires subsonic speeds. Even sens they added intakes they used no known logic behind it at all. Also the fact that engines are limited to intake air with some bucket system rather then Temperature and altitude makes even less sens. Real jets at Mach 3 have problems with temperature first of all but also the fact that they need intakes that reduces the airspeed to a working subsonic speed so ramair makes no sens.\n\nSo what we actually need is proper intakes that are altitude limited first of all that would make intake abuse well not working at all. Sure if you had on intake for two engines you could get a less well preforming craft but once your at say 2x intakes per engine there is no more gain to be had. Could also differ from intakes to intakes. Would be smaller once where two equals one big etc.\n\nThen we would need a precooler to even make efficient SSTO spaceplanes realistic. Thats whats needed IRL and thats whats being tested for the Skylon. Part exist in KSP as fare as I am concerned but it has 0 use atm.\n\nI would like to see that jet engines overheat and either explodes or shuts down when exceeding mach 3 for longer periods. Going past this would require t his precooler part that would be 1m long at least and 1-2 tons sens its the heaviest part of a precooled jet engine.\n\nWhen I use intake abuse I use it because KSP stock wont allow for efficient SSTO spaceplanes the way they the once under development IRL would work.\n\nIntakes atm are unrealistic and counter productive.\n\nAt least when I stack 10 of them in a row with cubes and have a jet behind it I get a total size at least closer to a real jet engine and I have to make room for that.\n\nSo intake abuse might be more efficient but if you just dont stack intakes on the same intake giving the same volume as one it still requires some added engineering and the howl power plant requires more space.\n\nI was also much against intake abuse before I gave it a closer examination but the fact that the way intakes works now is at least as unrealistic as intake abuse if not even more and I dont realy see why one should not use it if one can get more work done with less engines etc. Only real problem with intake abuse is the big part count that comes with it and the fact that engines dont overheat at high speeds due to the 1000C intake air on would have at mach 5.5.\n\nBut I have no problems with people not wanting to use intake abuse. I didn\u0027t either and I still dont like it but I dont like the stock idea of intakes either. Its like they say, its crap either way because both are just as unrealistic.\n\nWe can just hope for more realistic intakes and precoolers in the final stage of the game. If not Im probably going mods by then to solve that problem.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-20T01:13:23Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2013 01:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by pa1983**"},{"CreatedByName":"carazvan","CreatedById":73074,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-20T03:06:55Z","Content":"**Presentation**\n\n3 stock SSTOs for your enjoyment all weighing in about 7t (weight on runway) with 3 different propulsions to complement the turbojet:\n\nFlea (Ion), Fly (RCS), Mosquito (fuel)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

People have been asking me for a video of how I build my crafts so I decided to make one sens I wanted to try some stuff out for future crafts. Its not my best craft so its more experimental.\n\nI went with a low profile slim wing with closely mounted engine nacelles. This allows the wing to support it self with out the help of the fuselage or external struts and that was a must to accommodated the cargo hold or it would just collapse on it self from previous experience. The closely mounted engine nacelles allows fuel to be stored in them with out adding stress on the wings and the low profile wing in combination with the closely mounted engine nacelles allows for landing wheels to be placed optimally to take stress of the fuselage and wings. The Cockpit is mounted with a 10 degree down tilt to allow for IVA take of and landings and overall easier IVA flight. A probe core is mounted at the default angle to allow for a proper vector when doing burns in space.\n\nIt also has stock cargo bay doors that can open and close. Not my idea so I wont take credit for that. But they do help stiffening the fuselage when close.\n\nThe cargo bay is relatively long and can hold more jumbo tanks then the craft can carry but the intended cargo tends to be a lot longer VS weight then a few jumbo tanks so I wanted a long cargo bay, as long as posible. Benchmark payload was 63 tons and thats its max with out any further optimization to the craft. The craft is 99 ton dry weight so its not a light one due to a lot of I beams, many are cosmetic but most are structural. Further optimization with less esthetics\u0027s could reduce tonnage and increase payload capacity with 16 tons at least.\n\nBut I think its sufficient to lift my Explorer version 2 or a equally capable version of it sens it was about 58 tons. But a real mission has not been undertaken yet.\n\nI call here the Falcon XII Skymaster Transport (didn\u0027t come up with anything better, names are not my thing)\n\n![wyr.png](http://img593.imageshack.us/img593/8554/wyr.png)\n\nHere is two videos, part 1 covers construction and part 2 is the test flight.\n\n[http://youtu.be/4epfP6F7AF8](https://youtu.be/4epfP6F7AF8)\n\n[http://youtu.be/NEKtKB76udA](https://youtu.be/NEKtKB76udA)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-22T13:29:36Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2013 01:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by pa1983**"},{"CreatedByName":"Lazer Cut","CreatedById":70258,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-23T03:42:42Z","Content":"That\u0027s a slick looking transport. Holy damn, you gotta be the god of SSTO\u0027s! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nHope you don\u0027t mind if I try to incorporate some of your design elements into my own. I\u0027ll make sure to credit you with any uploads tough. \n\nFrom a design perspective, I can easily see you tackle the situation very differently from me. Personally I just end up with a mk2 fuselage and tanks on the sides with engines behind, then cover it with wings and lift surfaces as well as making the wings themselves. Then I tweak it until I got an engine configuration that can take off, and provide enough delta-v to where I want to go. I guess this is the method most people do, and I would say it\u0027s a good method for small to mid sized SSTO\u0027s, but after that I\u0027m not so sure anymore.\n\nAnd regarding our discussion about intakes and jets, yes I do see your point, and my opinion on intake \u0027abuse\u0027 has been changed. I\u0027m tired of trying to tweak with so much to avoid it, especially since it isn\u0027t even realistic. I hope that in the future versions of the game they will add in Ram and Scram jet types, since those are the only type of engines that would be suitable to use on SSTO\u0027s for high altitude supersonic speeds. The fact that most of those jet\u0027s can\u0027t function without air being \u0027rammed\u0027(hence the name) into them, is an interesting challenge I would very much like to try out."},{"CreatedByName":"pa1983","CreatedById":58328,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-23T07:31:36Z","Content":"If I recall, scram jets are pretty inefficient and requires high speed just to fire up. Those small once tested now are fired from a rocket stage so they fail as a ssto there already.\n\nSimple reason why the saber engine for the skylon is a jet engine/rocket engine hybrid is because it has its own compressor and in effect is self sustaining once spooled up like any other jet engine, and its efficient despite its precooler.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-23T07:33:43Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2013 07:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by pa1983**"},{"CreatedByName":"Cinocal","CreatedById":54959,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-23T15:59:29Z","Content":"I appreciate you making the build video.
