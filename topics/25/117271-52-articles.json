The canards at the front look okay because they seem to be placed above and below each other as opposed to inside each other, which is completely fine.  The delta wings that are clipped into each other are not okay because it makes the plane thinner, and thus harder to hit, without losing the lift it would if the wings were smaller.  If they were offset out to the side until the inner edges of their wings were touching, but not merged into each other, that would be okay.  If you can\u0027t offset them out that far, then either use the rotate-offset-rotate glitch to increase your offset range or attach the wings to struts, and the struts to whatever the wings were attached to originally in order to increase the offset range as was done in days of yore.  The wing strakes being clipped into the delta wings is not acceptable because it makes the plane a smaller target while also moving the CoL back and increasing total lift by means of the wing strake.  If the strake was offset down relative to the cockpit a little way and the delta wing offset up so they\u0027re not clipped into each other it would be okay.  \n\nI like the way you\u0027ve used wings to contain the fuel instead of a fuselage.  That\u0027s a neat idea and I think it\u0027ll give this plane an edge in combat since that will give it a much better lift to mass ratio than its opponents, making it lighter, faster, and more maneuverable. \n\nAs to your second statement, it took on average ~10 minutes to film each match in the previous tournament I held.  It\u0027s going to take even longer without missiles because now planes can\u0027t just obliterate each other immediately after takeoff.  It took an additional ~20 minutes to get each plane into position and oriented correctly, though it won\u0027t take as long in the new tournament since most of it won\u0027t be held at the north pole, and I only had to do that once for each match because of quicksaving.  That means each match in the new tournament is going to take one to one and a half hours to do, and if this was a best of nine it would take twice that time, not accounting for technical difficulties.  Therefore, it\u0027s not that I wouldn\u0027t prefer there to be more rounds, it\u0027s that I personally as a tournament host am unwilling to do more than five rounds per match, at least until I get faster at it and better at filming.

Also the strakes are slid back into those wings a bit, again just for practical reasons and not in a way that gives any significant combat advantage.\n\nIf the plane is completely unclipped (which has the side effect of making it look like seriously messed up and be completely unflyable) it\u0027s really not that much bigger than it is now, and the total area of parts concealed is really not that big. IMO it\u0027s nowhere near to becoming an unfair advantage, especially since it\u0027s still quite a big plane compared to much of the submissions. It doesn\u0027t seem by any means hard to hit when an enemy gets a good angle on it, and is usually destroyed in the process - any unfair advantage it may have is more than made up for by the disadvantage it has in being a very low part plane where any hit is usually a vital part destroyed, unlike in a high part count plane like the Anduril that can lose parts with little ill effect.\n\nIf you\u0027re still sure it\u0027s an unfair design, I\u0027ve been working on some replacements, without much success so far:\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Ojbdk/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nRe-engined light attack plane (the delta winged single engined one), decent all-round but just a bit behind the Anduril and El Quicko (my current main benchmark planes for testing) in terms of maneuverability and acceleration, although benefitting from a significantly smaller planform than both, which didn\u0027t actually seem to help it a huge amount - if a plane could get behind it, it could kill it.\n\nModified HNC (reverse sweep and vertical engines)- again, the Anduril and El Quicko had the edge in maneuverability and acceleration and managed to completely outclass it.\n\nF-8 Red Kite (big reverse swept wing one)- very maneuverable but had wing strength issues and lacked the TWR to keep up, was quite easily taken down."},{"CreatedByName":"GDJ","CreatedById":58462,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-10T20:04:44Z","Content":"**SHUBADUB**\n\n[![screenshot4_4.png](http://i40.photobucket.com/albums/e216/Max_Payne_0001/screenshot4_4.png)](http://s40.photobucket.com/user/Max_Payne_0001/media/screenshot4_4.png.html)  \n\nHere\u0027s my submission.

My huge fighter-bomber (with a slower turn rate, larger turning radius and larger size) was initially losing 80% of its fights against your manta when equipped with a single GAU-8 (not surprising). But when I instead put three hidden vulcans side by side, my aircraft began winning ~40% of the fights. The spread and RoF of the three vulcans countered your fighter\u0027s increased maneuverability.\n\nYour plane has an excellent design, however! It is very stable and accurate when firing, unlike a lot of fighters I\u0027ve tested that are twitchy.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-20T19:22:01Z\u0022 title=\u002201/20/2016 07:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by drtricky**"},{"CreatedByName":"DoctorDavinci","CreatedById":150019,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-20T20:50:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, drtricky said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I tried your manta V (1) against my huge 40-ton fighter-bomber, and I probably shouldn\u0027t be telling you this, but you should add more guns to your aircraft.\n\u003E \n\nI refer you to the rules for the current tournament posted on page 51 of this thread (one page behind this one)"},{"CreatedByName":"drtricky","CreatedById":154647,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-20T21:30:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 54 minutes ago, DoctorDavinci said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I refer you to the rules for the current tournament posted on page 51 of this thread (one page behind this one)\n\u003E \n\nOops.
