I had to edit the persistent file to increase the patched conics limit. The horrible part about this is mentalizing and warping to a point where 2 (or in my case 3) different transfer windows line up. First, the optimal Laythe\u003ETylo angle to prograde, then the optimal Tylo\u003EKerbin angle to prograde. Its less difficult with a circular orbit, but also less efficient. My low laythe orbit was achieved with only a jet engine, and maybe 5 dV of rocket fuel. This grants you a respectably high apoapsis, but then you need to sync a 3rd transfer window to burn at the Laythe periapsis.\n\nHowever, getting to Kerbin from a low Laythe circular orbit ~60k with only 700dV sounds beyond reach. As I think you suggested, it could be possible orbiting Jool for several years getting several carefully plotted gravity assists from the moons. Sounds like a real headache lol.

[...]However, getting to Kerbin from a low Laythe circular orbit ~60k with only 700dV sounds beyond reach.\n\nLow Laythe -\u003E Tylo encounter should be like 500m/s. Tylo is heavy and you can get in really close; I think it should be possible to return to Kerbin on the gravity assist alone, needing perhaps another 50m/s for course corrections. You need to get it just right after all.\n\nThen again, Laythe is just as heavy and appears to be smaller; may well be that you can get just as close to the center of gravity as with Tylo. Leaving Laythe so that you make two orbits while Laythe makes three before you meet again will be easy (and should pose no risk from Vall); question is, how much of a kick will it give you.
