Be careful, because you\u0027ll need to get away again and make a trip to Gilly. Land there too, then head off to Kerbin again. On your way back land on the Mun, then return to Kerbin. You have two launches, as you may need to refuel your spacecraft and you\u0027ll need to have a refueling station somewhere. Your spacecraft can be 2 parts, one to land on Moho, Gilly and the Mun and one to get you back later. But that\u0027s up to you.

Don\u0027t use any Mods, refueling twice. You need to have a manned mission, and return ALL these Kerbals home safely. You NEED to land IN one of these giand and very deep holes on Moho, you also NEED to land on Gilly and Mun. You are allowed to have a spacecraft, that can release and dock a lander, so you can actually land there, but you NEED to land on these three celestrial bodies... Any more questions? Oh, and yes, You\u0027ve got 3 launches to prepare this mission and are to use only the stuff you have launched with these three launches."},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T19:36:38Z","Content":"1 more thing, where\u0027s your attempt to show this is possible."},{"CreatedByName":"vincentschob","CreatedById":118273,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T20:30:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 1 more thing, where\u0027s your attempt to show this is possible.\n\nWorking on it.
