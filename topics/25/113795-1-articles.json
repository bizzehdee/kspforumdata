This means that you have to reach certain targets in order to be successful and that there are points for any design which exceeds those targets.\n\nAll entries must be with nuFAR and no physics breaking parts are allowed. Also it\u0027s worth noting that this challenge was not set for any other reason than to see if the KSP community has the skills to build something which is on the cutting edge of aerodynamic knowledge. The newest version of FAR makes this task equal in conceptual difficulty to it\u0027s real life counterpart, yet as always as simple as LEGO to build.\n\n**Rules**\n\n1) No space grade parts are permitted, that means no RCS and no bell nozzle rockets and no SAS (other than the cockpit)\n\n2) All designs will have either 1 engine or 2 engines of the same type, mixed power plants or ones with more engines than 2 are considered space grade and are therefore disallowed.\n\n3) clipping engines into one another is absolutely forbidden\n\n4) All engines used if modded must first have approval from myself (AJE will be tested soon)\n\n5) The \u0022Panther\u0022 jet engine is the only acceptable stock jet engine, settings may be tweaked for it as needed.\n\n6) The aircraft must be able to pull 9g\u0027s of pitch acceleration at subsonic speed below 5000m, and it must be able to pull 6 g\u0027s of pitch acceleration at supersonic speed above 10,000m\n\n7) The aircraft must reach a maximum speed of at least mach 1.2 below 5000m and have a top speed above 10,000m of mach 2.0 at least.\n\n8) With external stores the speeds specified by 7 must be minimally impacted, so including weapons the speed below 5000m should not be less than mach 1 and above 10,000m no less than mach 1.8 with external stores.\n\n9) The aircraft must not weigh less than 10 tons at takeoff with a full combat load.\n\n10) The aircraft must make use of BD armoury and 6 munitions must be stored at minimum either under the wings or beneath the fuselage, a radar dome must be included.\n\n11) Addendum to 8: No weapons may face rearwards, No external store (weapon or fuel) may be mounted above the wing or at any angle such that if two missiles were launched in quick succession that they might impact each other on deployment. \n\n12) All missiles will have a delay time and jettisoning speed so that they don\u0027t cause damage to the craft.\n\n13) A forward firing gun 20mm or greater in bore must be included\n\n14) Countermeasures, flare and chaff must be included.\n\n15) An air brake should be included, along with flaps and possibly leading edge flaps.\n\n16) The aircraft must demonstrate that it can takeoff and land in a suitably nominal way, below a speed of 150m/s and do both within the span of the runway.\n\n17) A BD armoury weapons manager module must be included.\n\n**Optional:**\n\n18) Should an AA/AAQ-28 Targeting pod be mounted, an ECM (Electronic Counter Measures) pod must also be mounted, along with Air to Ground missiles or laser guided bombs. The targeting pod indicates anti ground capability and as a result suitable weapons and defences must be able to be carried along with it. For that flight only, this need not be included on every flight of your anti ground capable aircraft.\n\n19) Rule 14 does not mean that this equipment is necessary for any other part of the challenge. Only the Targeting and the ECM pod are somewhat heavy, and have a drag penalty and need some space set aside. A craft with anti-ground ability needs to carry all this as a package when sent on an anti-ground mission.\n\n20) Should HARM missiles be mounted an ECM pod must be mounted, this is only mission specific like rule 18\n\n**Allowed Mods**\n\n-Ferram Aerospace Research (latest edition required)\n\n-BD armoury (required)\n\n-B9 procedural wings\n\n-Adjustable Landing Gear\n\n-AJE (awaiting testing)\n\n-Infernal Robotics\n\n-3rd Party Cockpits\n\n**Legacy Scoreboard**\n\n**Basic Jet (hardcore mode) Leaderboard:**\n\n-FourGreenFields 43.27 points with the P-12 Flying Pencil\n\n-FourGreenFields 13.8 points with the Heluan HA-300\n\n**Turbo Jet Leaderboard:**\n\n-FourGreenFields 138.25 points with the P-13 Shrike\n\n-tetryds 118.26 points with the SE-37\n\n-Gamer025 118 points\n\n-Hodo 48 points with the XF-149B Jinete\n\n-Gnullbegg 44 points with the GAD M-21A (reporting name goatsucker)\n\n-Skyentist 21 points with the Rogue Light fighter\n\n**BD Armoury Leaderboards:**\n\nTurbo Jet:\n\n-FourGreenFields (third entry) 140.8 points with the P-17 Harrier\n\n-Darren9 (Second entry) 104 points with the FAR 4\n\n-Halsfury 88.75 points with the F-32 Hurricane II [http://www./download/sp4dvat4yhf7c9g/F-32_Hurricane_II_Multirole.craft](http://www./download/sp4dvat4yhf7c9g/F-32_Hurricane_II_Multirole.craft)\n\n-Darren9 75 points with the (K)raptor\n\n-TheHengeProphet 74.82 points with the MRF-1B3S Adder\n\n-Hodo 68 points with the XF-150A\n\n-Darth Lazarus and Halsfury Co. 62.28 points for the F/A-18J Super Hornet\n\nBasic Jet:\n\n-FourGreenFields 46.1 points with the P-18 Firecrown\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-15T04:47:25Z\u0022 title=\u002211/15/2015 04:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Halsfury**"},{"CreatedByName":"TMasterson5","CreatedById":144591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T06:39:56Z","Content":"Hey just a few suggestions:\n\nYou should consider making weapons mandatory considering it is a fighter aircraft and a real life fighter has to deal with the added weight and aerodynamics of carrying weapons\n\nYou should also consider allowing turbojets as real life fighter jets use the most advanced jet engines available and that would be turbojets in KSP. \n\nYou should also also consider allowing certain mods that most of that build fighters on a regular basis use.(Firespitter, QuizTech Aero, Kerbal Engineer Redux, etc...)\n\nJust a few friendly suggestions.

Many designs ended in the most kerbal way possible. Many test pilots were stretched out upon the earth as I figured my way about completing my own challenge.\n\nI think I got a good result though.\n\n![uQxDWf7.png](http://i.imgur.com/uQxDWf7.png)\n\nIt uses turbojets because flames! which are thrust limited by half, it still has mad performance.\n\nI initially built this design with basic jets but they gave me ceaseless trouble, then while tinkering I thought; why not see if this thing has any potential? The new engines were mounted and they produced a serious improvement not only in thrust but also in area ruling. Before this point anything I tried just failed to cut down the wave drag.\n\nI figured that based on my experience, if you need a turbojet for the design to work, it need only be thrust limited to 50% so you can\u0027t just crash through the sound barrier regardless of how good your design is.\n\nIt still needs a separate leaderboard, since when the turbojet gets going at high mach the thrust output increases, consequently it has a range of super cruise speeds depending on how much fuel one feels like spending. Mach 1.9 is just about the limit for cruise which for a turbojet is 1/3rd throttle on a 50% nerfed jet. ![:0.0:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif)\n\n![005xntS.png](http://i.imgur.com/005xntS.png)\n\nTop speed was also determined by how crazy Jeb feels, mach 3.1 on a mediocre day\n\n![V3l5guC.png](http://i.imgur.com/V3l5guC.png)\n\nI found that the design has a TWR of greater than 1 but only at speeds which are already high, so it was difficult to measure accurately.\n\nThe craft is pictured here pulling 10 g\u0027s at mach 1.7 and can pull more instantaneously in some situations. pulling more than 9 g\u0027s is worth 5 points\n\n![qedjOPc.png](http://i.imgur.com/qedjOPc.png)\n\nFinally the most serious test, landing, it\u0027s absolutely mandatory (for obvious reasons)\n\n![pQ1p0mr.png](http://i.imgur.com/pQ1p0mr.png)\n\nThe breakdown so far.\n\n-22 points for a top speed of mach 3.1 somewhat north of the 10km altitude target, so maybe I need to redo this test. I got 1.1 mach over mach 2 for this so each 0.1 is worth 2 so 11x2=22\n\n-9 points for mach 1.9 top cruise speed, each 0.1 mach being worth 1 point over mach 1.0\n\n-TWR of 1 or greater is possible, though it needs a run up to get those jets working. 1 point\n\n-5 points for 10g turn\n\n-Range is about 45 minutes without drop tanks (which have yet to be designed so I\u0027m not finished the challenge) 0 points awarded for range bonus and no drop tanks to score.\n\n-Can this craft super cruise with external stores? I bet it can, but as of yet 0 points\n\n-Super manoeuvrability remains an issue, though the craft is very manoeuvrable by traditional standards, it still can\u0027t do anything that cool. 0 points there\n\nInterim Final Tally: 37 hard won points\n\nI predict that there will be a lot more turbo jet entries...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-24T03:42:45Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2015 03:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Halsfury**"},{"CreatedByName":"t3hJimmer","CreatedById":145943,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T03:53:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E -Aircraft must have a top speed of mach 2 at minimum at 10,000ft (full throttle).\n\nIs this even possible with basic jets?"},{"CreatedByName":"Halsfury","CreatedById":54576,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T04:00:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Is this even possible with basic jets?\n\nYes it is possible with basic jets in FAR. One needs to area rule the aircraft to the point where there\u0027s very little wave resistance to the craft. We\u0027re talking wave drag area less than 1.0m^2\n\nIf the aircraft in question is able to get to around mach 1.22 under 1000m then it will break mach 2 at 10,000m\n\nIt is easier to take the turbojets, even as they have been nerfed by challenge rules, they can tolerate larger wave drag areas. My design has a wave drag area of 1.08m^2 for instance, this would be unacceptable for a basic jet powered craft which would need something like 0.6m^2 wave drag area\n\nIn fact I\u0027ll even concede that maybe the rules should be purely turbojet based, but I think there should be a basic jet hardcore mode.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-24T04:37:26Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2015 04:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Halsfury**"},{"CreatedByName":"Amram","CreatedById":8067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T05:54:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Is this even possible with basic jets?\n\nI\u0027ve gotten above 2.1 on a wheasely\u0027s in Ferri.
