Just wondering... are you developing a shuttle that can go two-way, or are you refueling at both points? Mine needed fuel at both the Munar surface and from the Munar station to be effective. \n\nIn my playthrough, refueling on the surface turned out to be more gee-whiz than real value, as manually piloting the craft to a precision landing was thirsty work. More efficient landings and a lighter shuttle would reduce the amount of fuel that has to be flown out to munar orbit. That said, a large detachable lander that can refuel storage tanks on the surface then ferry them to orbit should be a workable solution to a closed loop munar shuttle. \n\nHappy landings!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-15T17:04:47Z\u0022 title=\u002206/15/2015 05:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Death Engineering**"},{"CreatedByName":"loch.ness","CreatedById":101329,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T01:14:16Z","Content":"I saved that ship design for Minmus in the future - it will work fine there. I\u0027ve been working on a different design for Mun use.\n\nThe goal is being able to land close to the base, drop off the crew, lift off again and make it back to the station for refueling. If I can get the working, step 2 is to make a cargo lander which can haul Life Support supplies to the Mun base and bring Ore/fuel back up from it.\n\nI was aiming for a Star Trek runabout look. It didn\u0027t quite work out that way though. \n\nNeither of these ships would work with where my current Mun infrastructure is. They\u0027d require a larger Mun station with fuel processing and storing areas or just expanded fuel storage on Munlab and a new docking module with Ore processing happening on the surface (I haven\u0027t decided on that yet).\n\nThe Kerbin SOI goals are to have: A single large and permanently crewed station in LKO which is regularly visited by Apollo CSMs and shuttles to top off fuel and Supplies. A Munar tug to take crew and such out to the Mun/Minmas stations. A Mun station which serves as a fuel depot and base platform for Munar operations. A Mun base for ground based research and mining. A Minmas station and base similar to the Munar ones.\n\nRight now I\u0027m slowly working on the pieces while MOLAB is exploring the twin craters (because I need breaks between driving. Its only made 35 km so far, hit its target.

I was away from KSP while playing a PBEM game in Combat Mission. Now that it\u0027s finished, I will be returning to the AAP Challenge.\n\nMy PM-2 and PM-3 Missions are underway, and with a successful completion will finally allow me to finish the goals of the Apollo 7 Mission.\n\nPM-2 is an LKO test of my Mk1 Munar Landing Module.\n\nPM-3 will recover the crew from PM-2, and practice rendezvous maneuver with the MLM. It will also test the CSM on an extended spaceflight, and collect data on fuel cell efficiency.\n\nWork on the S-5 Rocket will soon continue as well."},{"CreatedByName":"benjee10","CreatedById":84110,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T18:09:35Z","Content":"Well, my exams are finally over, so I can get back to this! \n\nAfter 22 launches, all the elements of my grand Duna mission are on their way at last!\n\nHere\u0027s a breakdown of the launch manifest:\n\n2x DTV habitats\n\n4x S-IVB propulsion modules\n\n3x crew launches (1 capsule test flight)\n\n2x Ares Lander launches\n\n3x Duna MOLAB launces\n\n5x Base modules launches (2x base modules in each launch)\n\n1x Duna Science Outpost\n\n1x Backup Fuel Module\n\n1x Backup Cargo Module\n\nBang on time, the two Duna Transfer Vehicles (*Kennedy* \u0026 *Von Braun*) performed burns to escape Kerbin and put them on course for an encounter with Duna.\n\nHere\u0027s how the mission will play out:\n\nOnce all the presupply modules are in orbit around Duna, they will begin to descend to the surface, one by one. First will be the MOLAB vehicles. These are landing only on parachutes and are in many ways the most vital parts of the mission, as they will be used to drive between the various different craft, which will be scattered over several kilometers. It is for this reason that three have been sent. The mission can still succeed if only one rover makes it down to the surface intact, albeit in a reduced capacity. \n\nThe five base landers will be next to descent. The S-IVB stages will perform a burn to place them within the atmosphere and then decouple. Aeroshells protect the landers during reentry. The top half of the fairing then detaches, allowing drogue chutes to deploy. The lower fairing segment then detaches. Four \u0027Badger\u0027 engines (the same ones used on the Saturn IB first stage) then perform the final descent. The base modules deploy from their landing frames and perform system checks. If all is well, they begin to drive towards each other and dock to form the base. \n\nThe Duna Science Outpost (DSO) will then descend, followed by the Backup Cargo Module (BCM). \n\nFinally, the crew rendezvous with the landers in orbit, transferring over to them. The landers use a 3.75m descent stage with five LEM engines attached to it. The crew will attempt to land near a MOLAB unit. Each of the two three-kerbal crews will then drive to the base and rendezvous there, beginning performing their surface tasks, such as driving over to points of interest and the DSO The crew will also perform any repairs necessary to be base and hook up any disconnected modules with pipes and cables. \n\nAfter their extended surface stay, the crew will return to their landers and lift off into low Duna orbit. The lander ascent stage is a modified CSM-II, lacking parachutes and with a LEM descent engine. They are SRB assisted. The crew rendezvous with their DTVs and perform the Duna-Kerbin transfer burn, returning to Kerbin and splashing down in the CSMs they launched in. \n\nThe mission is obviously fraught with risks, and as such has several abort modes:\n\n**Phase 1 Abort**\n\nThis is a failure during liftoff of either crew vehicle. The LES fires and the crew splash down safely. In the event that one crew is unable to be relaunched in time, the other crew will still launch and the second DTV will transfer to Duna empty to provide a rescue vessel. \n\n**Phase 2 Abort**\n\nShould there be a failure of one o the DTVs during transfer to or from Duna, the second DTV will expend fuel to rendezvous with it and refill from the other\u0027s tanks. Crew will transfer over to the rescue vehicle and complete the mission, but only one crew will be able to perform surface operations. Both landers will be landed as a safety precaution. \n\n**Phase 3 Abort**\n\nIf none of the MOLABs are able to reach the surface intact, the crew landings will still take place, but lacking the ability to drive to the base site the crew will return to orbit after three days on the surface. It is not considered possible to land near the base itself due to the risk of damage (*and the lag from the part count*)\n\n**Phase 4 Abort**\n\nIf the base life support systems or any major base component fail to reach the surface, the crew will drive the MOLAB units over to the BCM, where emergency life support units will be attached and cargo fitted. If the base is usable enough these will be used to repair the base. If not, the crew will rendezvous at the DSO, equipping it will extra life support and hooking the three rovers together for extra living space. The surface stay will be shortened considerably. \n\n**Phase 5 Abort**\n\nThis is perhaps the most dangerous abort of all. Should one of the crew landers be unable to reach orbit on liftoff, the crew are equipped with emergency parachutes which should be sufficient to save them even in Duna\u0027s thin atmosphere. One crewmember on the ground will drive a MOLAB over to them and collect them in it, bringing them back to the other lander. The other two crewmembers will drive to the base\u0027s cargo unit, taking from it three external command seats and additional life support containers. The two engineers will work to attach the seats to the outside of the lander and reduce weight wherever possible. The fairings between the descent and ascent stages will be jettisoned to provide space for the external seats. The lander will lift off using the descent stage to compensate for the fuel lost due to additional drag, although it is anticipated that not much fuel will remain in it. \n\nHopefully I won\u0027t have to do any of that... \n\nHere\u0027s the albums: \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
