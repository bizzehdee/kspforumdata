You start docking together space station modules, then try to rotate the whole thing to get more sunlight, stabilize with SAS... and the whole thing starts to wobble uncontrollably.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApparently, the bigger your station is, and the more reaction wheels it has, the higher the chances of wobbling and snapping apart due to excessive torque on the parts. Keeping your huge stations stable and in one piece is fun in career mode, but I wonder...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStations can wobble and snap apart - how small is the smallest station that can wobble and snap apart?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EYour goal: design a station that consistently undergoes a RTIDE (Rapid Torque-Initiated Disassembly Event) when exposed to \u003Cs\u003Eexcessive\u003C/s\u003E enough torque\u003C/span\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScoring: Designs will be ranked by two criteria (there will be two leaderboards): \u003Cstrong\u003Esmallest\u003C/strong\u003E end-to-end length, and \u003Cstrong\u003Elightest\u003C/strong\u003E weight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConstraints for the rule-savvy:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThe vessel must be a space station by KSP standards: It must have crewable parts, it must generate electric charge (solar panels), and it must have a command module or probe core.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNo engines must be active during the RTIDE (no tearing apart the station by firing rockets in opposite directions).
