Looking for some good estimates from all of you nerdy Kerbals (Nerdals?). Also challenge below:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimple challenge: get a spacecraft into an orbit over \u0022Kerbol\u0022 as low as possible to its surface. Minimum submission: a pic from assembly building showing total delta-v and TWR of each stage, a map pic from final orbit showing apoapsis, and a pic from final orbit showing the gorgeous sun horizon along with remaining delta-v. You can get a cheap and easy delta-v reading with the flight engineer chip from the Kerbal Engineer mod, available in the Spaceport. Feel free to show maths for delta-v and TWR if you don\u0027t feel like modding your client. I might also be willing to gather readings myself if you provide the craft file (emphasis on might!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScoring: 1,000,000 points base score for a successful sun orbit divided by the square root of the apoapsis in km - max score 100km apoapsis for scoring purposes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditional modifiers:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) added points for: lightweight science equipment \u002B50k, goo \u002B100k, materials bay \u002B150k, MPL \u002B500k, antenna \u002B50k/100k/150k (higher for more advanced antenna), solar panels \u002B50k/100k/150k for tiles/small pivotal/gigantor.

Once in orbit, The rocket motors were ejected from the lifting stage leaving only fuel tanks. Following this, a series of refueling missions were launched. The final of these contained no fuel, but contained the pilot, Jebediah Kerman. Once the pilot was on board and the rocket was refueled, a series of burns were performed to bring the rocket\u0027s orbit to the very edge of kerbin\u0027s influence before a final burn which would allow it to achieve escape velocity out of the sphere of influence. This burn continued for half an hour until the periapse of roughtly 100,000,000m. after two orbits, it was deemed safe to approach the sun at a lower altitude and the periapse was lowered to 3,000,000. Science was gathered at this altitude, and the solar satellite was assembled and deployed. At the following apoapse, a burn was initiated which brought the rocket into an encounter with kerbin. During this burn, the fuel in the outer stages was expended and those stages were ejected. The rocket then performed a series of course corrections and an aerobraking maneuver through Kerbin\u0027s Atmosphere. during aerobraking, the rocket sustained moderate damage. After establishing a 100,000m orbit around kerbin, a transport ship ferried up a probe containing communications equipment to the rocket. Jebediah kerman boarded this transport ship following the docking of the communications gear and transmission of science data. The transport ship then returned to Kerbin and was recovered.
