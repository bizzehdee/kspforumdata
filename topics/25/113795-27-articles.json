Just keep pulling the nose up until you\u0027re increasing thrust again, and you have braking on demand. You could try Q-dependent wing shaping with surfaces like I mentioned a while back, but that\u0027s a bit much for just landing.  \n\nStalling is a huge energy sink, whether you keep control or not. Highly swept wings don\u0027t really stall the same way as straight ones but even vortex lift runs out eventually, and vortex lift itself is not low-drag...[/QUOTE]  \n\nI think it\u0027s a matter of practice, but the tiny stock landing legs I\u0027m using probably don\u0027t help.

More-over, most Gen 5 fighters can\u0027t compete with proper Gen 4 or 4.5 aerobatic/dogfighting capabilities, to my knowledge. The fighters really don\u0027t have to look like an F-16, but it is a good standard for capabilities.  \n\nSo far, my best fighter\u0027s basic design is based on an aerodynamics experiment to test a prior glitch in FAR, which was roughly based on the F-16. However, it only really looks like one in passing and is much more like an F-20, I guess. That makes it a poor example, really; however, my old MRF-4 is still capable of achieving the applicable goals for qualification and looks nothing like an F-16.  \n\nI\u0027m happy to say that the Devil Ray is still viable with the engine swap, albeit slightly less aerodynamic with a wave drag area of about .4 now. It appears to have slightly better control capabilities, which is to be expected (still not the best dogfighter), but it is able to supercruise at roughly mach 2.01 when full. I\u0027ve been letting the plane fly on its own for the past half hour while I do other things, and it\u0027s range seems quite impressive. It seems to cap at about mach 2.88 with afterburners at high altitude, but have not tested its low altitude max speed. End of test result: Maximum ferry range is approximately 2000km.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-17T22:13:28Z\u0022 title=\u002211/17/2015 10:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheHengeProphet**"},{"CreatedByName":"Doke","CreatedById":149975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T15:17:41Z","Content":"2.8-ish seems to be the cap for most planes with that engine now.
