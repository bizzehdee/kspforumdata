I was wondering if you could add a new category that expands on the cost effectiveness them a bit. Seeing as the cost of building the spacecraft is no longer an issue for those on the leaderboard (and it is just a challenge of persistance and computer ability), the focus should be shifted to reducing the massive amounts still spent on fuel. In the new category people can be judged on how much they get into orbit for every mass of fuel used. To work this out you simply add up fuel mass (in the launcher) on launch, and take away what you have when the refuel rover docks. You then divide the score (according to the current system) by the mass of the total fuel used and viola, you have a new scoring system which favours the efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should be allowed to take away fuel that is left in the space station, because any spare fuel you don\u0027t use and leave there hasn\u0027t been actually used, and is sort of a payload even if it wasn\u0027t intended.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR: a new, parallel scoring system could work by the equation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#808080;\u0022\u003E[score on current sytem] \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800000;\u0022\u003E/ \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008080;\u0022\u003E( \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#808080;\u0022\u003E[total fuel mass used refueling] \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008000;\u0022\u003E- \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#808080;\u0022\u003E[total fuel mass on station NOT delivered inside a payload] \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008080;\u0022\u003E)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could also have another one again, but it just measures average payload mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t want to sound bossy, it\u0027s just an idea that occured to me when I was reading this thread.
