I tought about making a second video of another ascent with the same vessel just to prove it was possible but then again, anyone who had experience leaving Eve would see my design had more than enough D/V for that. Now that 0.21 is totally obsolete I\u0027ll share the craft file anyway. The nice thing about this video is that is the first video ever on youtube or foruns to be released showing an Eve ascent from a low altittude with the nerfed aerospikes!
