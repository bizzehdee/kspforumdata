Not your fault, I have a craft that can get it to where it needs to be, but I am tempted to take it apart, redesign it so it does the same mission, weighs the same, and is the same size, but is less parts and more functional. Currently without adding at least 4 radial engines to it for its landing, or just flat out dropping it on the planet. (the thought crossed my mind just to shoot it at the planet). I don\u0027t understand what it is to do, I have tested it, and all it does is fire that center part straightish down at the 18 ton fuel tank under it. Which for the most part destroys it. If I attempt to land it on Moho in its current state, without literally strapping a Kerbal to it and a command pod, it won\u0027t work in RemoteTech2. Right now as it stands this thing is 70 parts, I removed the I-beams and replaced them with 6 LT-2 landing legs. I may even be able to cut that down to 4 other landing legs but wanted to see what affect it had. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problems I am seeing for it in Remotetech2, is the 4 comms dishes you have on it I don\u0027t think have the range to reach Kerbin from Moho, on top of this there isn\u0027t enough battery power for it to be able to power all four of those comms devices for any length of time and still have power for the SAS and Probe core. As for adding a docking port to it and then just docking it to the main ship, that won\u0027t work either, same problem, it doesn\u0027t have the power to operate all the electrical systems AND communications with KSC. So later this weekend I am going to take it apart and redesign it so it works in RT2. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently as it stands it is 5 scaffolding high, with a 18 ton jumbo 2.5m fuel tank at the base and an assortment of SAS and other structural parts at the top. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt isn\u0027t like I can\u0027t find a SSTO in my fleet that can haul it to orbit. If it wasn\u0027t so long one of my 300 line SSTOs could haul it to orbit with ease. As it stands now I have to use the new SP-406 to get it into orbit.
