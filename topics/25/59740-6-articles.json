Also, I\u0027ve found that the stock air intake (the flat forward facing one) produces the least drag of all the intakes I\u0027ve tried.

Today alone we improved the top speed from 1,090 m/s to 1,205 m/s. Considering that I thought I was reaching the limit of what could be done when I hit 928 m/s, I think progress is still racing along pretty quick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings may pick up pace with the next patch too. Supposedly, they are working on improving connection points to allow for building more rigid aircraft/rockets. That could make large planes with a ton of engines stable enough to fly at the speeds needed for this challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-06T05:38:38Z\u0022 title=\u002202/06/2014 05:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Sevant\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
