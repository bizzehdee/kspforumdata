Landing the whole craft took many attempts because there are very few flat spots, and even with a flat spot to land, the lack of reaction wheels makes it exceedingly hard to keep from tipping over. I redistributed almost all the fuel to the \u0027legs\u0027 and even then it was very tricky. I blew a lot of fuel hovering for the absolute most gentle landing possible, because anything over about 1 m/s leads to bouncing and tipping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t expect a lot of gravity losses because you can get to orbital velocity quite fast, but you do have to include fuel for Rendezvous.
