There are some amazing designs here that accomplish much more difficult things than my SSTJ5. No matter how you look at it, 700kN of thrust at 4000s ISP is massively OP compared to any stock engines, poor TWR or no. But that\u0027s the thing with the mods I\u0027m using, they alleviate the rocket equation but add several extra layers of realism and challenge. Reentry heating and g-force limits, aerodynamic failures (as in your plane can get completely torn apart at high speeds), life support and managing many different fuels and heat. I found it a bit silly having a kerbal survive a straight-down laythe reentry at mach 15 completely unprotected in an external seat (not to mention sitting in said seat for years without food, oxygen, water or heating). To each his own. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the ion lander, looks like a butterfly or something. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E I was going to ask how would it even be possible to get any altitude with TWR\u0026lt;1, but come to think of it, I have seen it before in some of my VTOL prototypes. I thought it was the wings, but your lander doesn\u0027t seem to have any? Or did it have TWR\u0026gt;1 for a short time with battery power?

A seat can hold a Kerbal too, at only 0.05 tons (but I don\u0027t want to argue, it\u0027s fine). I might go ahead with some planet factory planets first, if I can get that mod working well enough.
