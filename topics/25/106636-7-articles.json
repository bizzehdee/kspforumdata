The KSC strip was 98 km out when the engines spooled down and I was about 20 km up, moving along at around 1100 m/s. Tried to glide it, but the nose started pitching wildly before finally rising 90 degree, killing all forward velocity, and leaving me fighting to try to point back to the prograde. Didn\u0027t happen. Best I could manage was getting a flat attitude as I plummeted seaward. Couldn\u0027t revert flight as I\u0027d saved when the fuel was critically low and reloaded to retry the descent approach under manual controls. Out of some fluke, that flat attitude was almost as good as a parachute, getting my downward velocity down to about 20 m/s, letting most of the craft survive. More than 7000 km flown and I splashed down less than 50 km short of the runway.\n\n![1TtXt9A.png](http://i.imgur.com/1TtXt9A.png)\n\nThe real kicker, though, was that when I went back to the SPH verify that the lift was what I though it should be, I realized I\u0027d left out about 1800 units of fuel prior to take off. Face meet palm. On the upside, I\u0027m virtually guaranteed to make it next time.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-22T16:42:57Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2015 04:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ExaltedDuck**\n  \ncleanup"},{"CreatedByName":"Pandemic","CreatedById":144101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T02:48:53Z","Content":"have to see if the update borked my plane....\n\nedit: ....!

My huge expedition circumnavigator that\u0027s playing titanic above would have made the three laps had I fueled it properly last night. Back in it now, I\u0027m cruising 50 m/s faster and 1000 m higher but I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll have enough fuel to make two full loops. Peak ascent consumption last night was around 12 units/second. today, it got up to 21. Cruising was around 4 for last night\u0027s run but stayed close to like 5. Maybe if I use a shallower climb and less than full throttle to get past 10000m then push harder above 15000m... dunno. Might not be a valid concept of a plane now.
