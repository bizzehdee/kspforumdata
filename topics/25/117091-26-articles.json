(MID POST SNEAK EDIT: Steady 50 degrees climb at 500 km/h doesn\u0027t seem like a normal behaviour for a WW2 plane[/endsneakedit]) Or maybe I\u0027m just really efficient at building speedy stuff in FAR. Will install AJE tomorrow and see how it performs with that.\n\nI thought you could use that one camera mod by BahamutoD to enhance the battles a bit. Not sure how to use it since I never did, but it sure makes Cupcake\u0027s videos amazing.

Was barely able to climb and my top speed was just over 520km/h at the sea level.\n\nThat\u0027s not the worst part though. It turns other engines into either post-war ones and/or scales them up to have realistic radius, so it\u0027s not possible to use them with stock fuel tanks anymore.\n\nTrying to figure out a 2 engine combo with 1700hp each like on the P-38. Seems like the Rolls-Royce turboprop is the only one I can use without the need of procedural tanks. That really sucks :/\n\nEDIT: Actually after flying for a while with Aerosports and AJE the handling doesn\u0027t seem that bad. I guess I could get used to it. Still would rather have 1700hp instead of 680hp per engine tho.\n\nEDIT2: The Rolls-Royce is OP even at 9% thrust for some reason.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-07T18:33:53Z\u0022 title=\u002209/07/2015 06:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Veeltch**"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-08T06:41:33Z","Content":"Using procedural tanks instead of stock gives you an advantage, so you should stick with that anyway.
