I\u0027m basing this challenge on KSP 0.19.1, but if there is a KSC2 on other versions of the game, then by all means please join up. Any differences in driving time and distance will be taken into account.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rules are simple: Build a land rover, drive to KSC2. Any path as long as it is on land (or crossing rivers) is allowed. This is challenge of construction and driving skill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-any mods are allowed. I don\u0027t care how it gets there, as long as it has wheels and drives on land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-any power source allowed. Jets, rockets, Ion drives, Solar, nuclear, or Jeb, Bill, and Bob pushing it with oars and their feet is allowed. The vehicle must have wheels to drive on land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-wings are allowed, ONLY IF THEY PROVIDE DOWNFORCE, NOT LIFT. No making your rover float a few metres off the ground. The wheels must contact with land. If your rover catches air going over a bump, then that\u0027s part of the challenge (making the Rover survive a jump is part of the challenge).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-any construction techniques are allowed. This is a challenge of skill and ingenuity. Show us what you can do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-ASAS and SAS allowed. Like I said, as long as it has wheels to drive on, what you do is allowed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Manned or unmanned rovers are allowed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-You can drive a premade car or motorbike from a mod if you like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing that is not allowed is something that can warp or alter time or game physics (like hyperedit or whatever-it\u0027s-called). You must drive the course with the stock time and physics the game comes with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, \u003Cem\u003EKeep it real!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOW, when you list your times, add what KSP version you are using, and anything like FAR or Mechjeb. You can use it, but this will be listed in your rover specs and they will be listed HERE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThis is not as easy as it looks. You have flat sections, rolling foothills, mountains, rivers, water hazards, rocks, boulders, and (in some versions) trees to navigate thru or around. Kerbal is not a smooth globe. It\u0027s a planet, with all the hazards it can provide. Your construction techniques are different than that of Rockets or Aircraft. Your construction will have to accommodate for that. A well built and driven rover will complete this challenge. A poorly build or driven one will fail, usually by breaking apart.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDaytime or night driving allowed of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECumulative mission times are counted (hit F3 for that).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou must post a pic of you leaving KSC1 from the runway, and at KSC2. You can post more to display your progress. Don\u0027t be ashamed if you don\u0027t succeed the first or second (or many more) times. I did this challenge in 10 hours mission time, but it took me 5 times to do it. Like I said, this is not as easy as it looks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe record if I recall correctly is 8 hours 26 minutes, but if you can do it in less or more than that\u0027s fine. The main challenge is completing the course, which is reward in itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink of it as the Paris-Dakar rally......on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck, and may the best driver prevail!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eps.
