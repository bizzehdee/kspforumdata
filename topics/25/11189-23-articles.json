Air-breathers are toggled with key 1, aerospikes are toggled with 2. It\u0027s unlikely to have enough fuel for a high orbit, so I tend to keep it circular at around 100K. Landing at KSC isn\u0027t difficult, although I would advise keeping it in orbit and waiting until daytime to land. You will have to glide most of the way in, although there should be enough aerospike fuel for the odd descent correction burn, and don\u0027t hesitate to put the jets back on if you need a little more control during runway approach (\u003C2000m).

I normally add two extra sets of landing struts so that it can land vertically, and then tip it over onto the main landing gear. It is possible to land on the engine exhausts, but not really smart.\n\nIf I am carrying cargo, normally I put either a rover in a dorsal mount and a satellite or science unit in a ventral Mount. It can take 6 small satellites with oscar tanks and ant engines, mounted above and below the fuselage. Possibly more in fact.\n\nLike so:\n\n![7F1FF64D1EAE21F4E3CF22054E702D7461DEE365](http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/576739577014367333/7F1FF64D1EAE21F4E3CF22054E702D7461DEE365/)\n\nIt\u0027ll go to 27k on its turbojets alone, and with careful throttle adjustment will reach 1900 m/s before starting the burn with the rockets. Normally I ascend as fast as possible to 22k with a 70 degree inclination. Then I flatten out and by the time I am in level flight it should be at 24k. At that point I start to speed up towards the 1900 m/s. Ideally I use about 250 units of liquid fuel in doing that, so there\u0027s a little more than 1100 left for the rockets.\n\nA circularised orbit is reachable with around 1000 units of oxidiser left, having used 300 or so to reach orbit and circularize.

It can be a tad heavy in the launch phase, and too much cargo towards the nose will mean it might require a touch of the rockets around 15k to come up sufficiently for the drag to be at good levels.

It\u0027s a SSTO plane to Laythe and back. Rear landing gears can be toggled to allow the rover wheels to touch the ground and drive the plane on electrical power, very handy when taxiing, especially on an alien world! The mission itself was pretty straightforward, get off Kerbin on jet power, switch to nuclear when out of atmosphere, circularize and shoot for Jool encounter. When in Jool SOI i lucked out and got a Laythe encounter straight away, so i took it, aerobraked and landed the plane.\n\nWhen landed I EVA\u0027d and planted a flag (of course) and then drove up the hill. When I found a nice spot for takeoff I turned the plane downhill and took off. Once out of atmosphere I played a bit with manouver nodes, and eventually I got a nice slingshot from Vall. The slingshot took me far away but that was ok, from the new apoapsis it was pretty easy to burn for Kerbin encounter. I aerobraked again at Kerbin, circularized, and burned for de-orbit for pinpoint landing at which point I was out of fuel but luckily the plane glides very well even when out of fuel so I did make it back to KSC safely.\n\nJeb about to embark on a great journey!\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/Bkjbhob.jpg\u0022\\]!\\[Bkjbhob.jpg\\](http://i.imgur.com/Bkjbhob.jpg)](%5Bimg)\n\nOn the beach.\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/9IaJ6cp.jpg\u0022\\]!\\[9IaJ6cp.jpg\\](http://i.imgur.com/9IaJ6cp.jpg)](%5Bimg)\n\nHoney I\u0027m home!\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/LSsgPGu.jpg\u0022\\]!\\[LSsgPGu.jpg\\](http://i.imgur.com/LSsgPGu.jpg)](%5Bimg)\n\n[more images can be found in the imgur album here.](http://imgur.com/a/ApyFQ#0) I know it is against the rules to lose any parts during the flight, but I thought I\u0027d submit this anyway since the parts were lost to a bug of some sort, they just went poof one by one when i was gliding towards the KSC on the final part of my flight. I did not hit ground or anything else, they just poofed. The plane went on flying so I finished the mission as planned. The landing itself was a smooth one."},{"CreatedByName":"BlazingAngel665","CreatedById":30182,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T20:44:29Z","Content":"The poofing issue is a bug that was supposedly fixed"}]}
