I did it, on accident, I basicly when doing a orbit earth mission,\n\nCreated a \u0022Kerbin escape\u0022 Node. And the big yellow death line. i was going to orbit the sun\n\n---=**3 SECONDS LATER=**--- My ship with it\u0027s rockets on is spinning out of control, and i\u0027ve boom, Created an orbit that goes farther out into space than eloo\u0027s orbit, and then comes back around the sun.\n\nThis is sort of a race, because it can be easily done.\n\nFirst one to post wins first, second post second, ect intill 5th place\n\n2 rules\n\nNo infinite fuel (HEY, I DIDN\u0027T SAY RCS, GO AHEAD)\n\nThe spin: Can\u0027t use manuever nodes. (I did it without maneuver nodes, i did it on acident, goodluck!)\n\n**Fine Print: We are not responsible for your kerbals crashing into eloo. A participation medal will be awarded if you acdiently crash into eloo.**"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T03:58:00Z","Content":"First! Do I win?\n\nSarcasm aside, the first to post wins doesn\u0027t seem very fair to me, and this is stupidly easy anyway. Also, there seems to be no winning criteria other than \u0027estabilish an orbit that goes beyond Eeloo but still orbits the sun\u0027.\n\nBoom! Do I win?\n\n[![screenshot9_zps7vteha5g.png](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v214/smjjames/screenshot9_zps7vteha5g.png)](http://smg.photobucket.com/user/smjjames/media/screenshot9_zps7vteha5g.png.html)\n\nYes it was a really long burn with a buttload of deltaV (along with a few breaks to let the craft cool off and then a warp to the SoI because impatient), but I\u0027m trying to make a point, or rather several points, here.\n\nAll I did was a straight up launch and just burn towards periapsis (with some radial burns thrown in though).\n\nLets go even further! With an orbital period of over half a million Kerbal years (over 170,000 Earth years).\n\n[![screenshot11_zps3t127dgr.png](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v214/smjjames/screenshot11_zps3t127dgr.png)](http://smg.photobucket.com/user/smjjames/media/screenshot11_zps3t127dgr.png.html)\n\nI am now done making my points.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-13T05:43:48Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2015 05:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by smjjames**"},{"CreatedByName":"Dcseal","CreatedById":148821,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T13:56:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E First!
