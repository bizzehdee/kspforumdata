Rather than let Jeb do all the designs you need to prove that spaceflight can be done on a budget!\n\n**The Challenge:**\n\nBuild and fly the most cost-efficient tanker possible to low Kerbin orbit within the specified budget caps.\n\nOxfam - **\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1**15,000\n\nBlue Collar - **\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1**35,000\n\nWhite Collar - **\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1**80,000\n\nJeeves, where is my collar? - **\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1**250,000\n\nLotto! - **\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1**unlimited\n\n**The Rules**\n\n- Stock parts only in KSP version 1.0.3\u002B\n\n- Wheaton\u0027s law applies.\n\n- No cfg editing, save editing, debug menu, or any other shenanigans.\n\n- No physics exploits, the vessel must be lifted by thrust and aerodynamic lift alone. Decoupler force is permitted between propulsive stages, multiple stacked decouplers are not.\n\n- Payload for this purpose shall be useable fuel (defined as a LF/O mix at a 9:11 ratio). Payload can be mounted in any which way you desire, but if you are not decoupling/undocking the payload, the fuel tank/s\u0027 contents must be transferred to something (a station, a ship, an empty fuel tank, an asteroid, Val\u0027s handbag) through docking/klaw connections.\n\n- LKO = stable orbit with a PE of at least 75km\n\n- The base of the lifter must be close to the pad surface, preferably touching it. No kilometer-high launch clamps please.\n\n- Please keep part clipping to a minimum. In particular, do not clip engines at all.\n\n- Images or video of your design is required for entry, showing launch cost (less any launch clamps), fuel delivered into stable orbit, and enough in between to show how your vessel works. \n\n- To be considered reusable the craft must be able to return to Kerbin and perform a survivable landing. We shall assume 100% recovery costs from anywhere on the planet. You may recover as much, or as little of the craft as you wish.\n\n- Staging SRB/Boosters: If you can land SRB/Booster stages and not lose the ability to switch back to the main vehicle using [ or ] then fair play to you ma\u0027am/sir for your dedication in penny pinching and you may include their cost in your recovered funds. If they cannot be landed before the main vehicle leaves physics range, then they\u0027re scrap ol\u0027 chum.\n\n - Craft files are encouraged so we can learn from each other\u0027s techniques and have a repository of proven \u0022economically viable\u0022 lifters.\n\nPermitted mods: Visual/immersion mods, informational mods, autopilot if that\u0027s your thing. This is primarily a design challenge.\n\nForbidden mods: Anything that modifies stock parts, adds new parts, or changes the game\u0027s physics in any way.\n\n**The Scoring:**\n\nNaturally will be separated into the budget caps and each entry shall be annotated as Disposable/Reusable \u0026 Rocket/Spaceplane, and with the delivery orbit\n\nScoring will be two-fold one for total useable fuel delivered (LF\u002BOx = Score), and for cost per unit of fuel delivered: (Launch Cost - Recovered Funds if applicable) / LF \u002B Ox) = **\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1xx/unit** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9\n\n**The Leaderboards:**\n\n**Oxfam -** **\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1****15,000**\n\n**Blue Collar - \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1** **35,000**\n\n**White Collar -** **\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1****80,000**\n\n[maccollo](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/125387-Stock-Budget-Cap-Challenge-1-02?p=2037580\u0026viewfull=1#post2037580) Expendable Rocket - Boosters Galore | 75x85km | 13,560 Fuel |Cost/Unit \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A15.633\n\n**Jeeves, where is my collar?

I honestly don\u0027t know if it\u0027s a spaceplane or a rocket, but it\u0027s fully reusable, and on the test flight delivered 820 units of fuel (9:11 LF\u002BO mix) to 75x75 LKO.\n\u003E It costs 13 742 at launch, 12 917 dry, and I [recovered 6 funds worth of fuel](http://i.imgur.com/EGadk29.png), so total flight cost is 819. So for all practical purposes delivered funds to LKO for 1 fund per unit of fuel including the cost of said fuel. For non-practical purposes, that\u0027s 0.99878 funds per unit.\n\u003E \n\u003E Craft file included for those interested: [http://kerbalx.com/juzeris/Oxfam-Missile.craft](http://kerbalx.com/juzeris/Oxfam-Missile.craft)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/c61EbLwECLg?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nCreative use of the claw, but not very scaleable.
