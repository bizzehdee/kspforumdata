I really appreciate it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, with that said, I present my new, and GREATLY improved, Thermal Turbojet design. Still in need of some optimization (this model takes the high-lift, low thrust approach instead, for ease of landing: but I think I took it a little too far- and am looking at adding a little more of both)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6Z4Mp97.png\u0022 alt=\u00226Z4Mp97.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ugDC6Xa.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ugDC6Xa.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the second picture says it all. Without using an ounce of conventional fuel (for that matter, without bothering to reduce the uranium loading this time), and with two Kerbals INSIDE a modern, high-tech Mk2 cockpit actually designed for use in spaceplanes; this Nuclear Thermal Turbojet design can stable cruise at nearly 27,000 meters on Kerbin (and with a little more optimization, and a reduction of the uranium loading, which is currently at 1 TON- a significant fraction of the craft\u0027s entire weight- certainly at least that). This craft should be able to fly indefinitely at over 11,200 meters on Duna (BEFORE accounting for reduced gravity) according to my calculations!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those wondering, yes that\u0027s a 2.5 meter Ram intake of sorts. Actually, to be precise, it\u0027s a 2.5 meter \u0022Atmospheric Intake\u0022 from KSP Interstellar, which produces only the IntakeAtmosphere resource instead of the IntakeAir resource- which can be collected on any planet with an atmosphere, and fed into thermal turbojets, which require no oxygen. The KSP Interstellar mod also modifies all the pre-existing intakes to produce this resource in addition to IntakeAir as well- though I found this encourages a mixed use of both resources for thermal turbojets, which can run on either resource, to obtain maximum efficiency from a design if you are using both types of intakes. This is what I did on my fighter-like design, primarily because I decided to use Engine Nacelles for the fuselage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor this design, I went with the Mk2 cockpit/fuselage system, which is heavier relative to its length- but provides increased surface area and a better shape to attach more wings. The cockpit also has the same mass-to-pilots ratio as a stock Mk2 cockpit- 1 ton per pilot- and a more powerful (but less energy efficient, and less powerful relative to mass) reaction wheel system. Technically, after testing this design, I see I would have probably been better off with the Mk1 cockpit and two stock Mk2 cockpits, if I could find a way to make it work. My primary insights/improvement over the three-engine fighter design were just to use a large atmosphere intakes instead of a smaller one and radial standard intakes, so I could get maximum efficiency out of the air intakes without using three engines (two running of IntakeAtm, one on IntakeAir- as the atmosphere scoops are more efficient as they aren\u0027t designed to inject oxygen into combustion chambers, and the design featured a hybrid of both intake types), and to use a longer fuselage so I could fit in a lot more wing area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe design works great, and takes off on a dime (literally within 25-50 meters or less on Kerbin\u0027s runway) on Kerbin. Its takeoff roll will be longer on Duna, of course, due to the thinner air- but it should still be more than capable of field use- rather than only working well between pre-built runways, like the fighter version probably would have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, the altitude conversion calculation to use:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake the max cruising altitude, divide it by the scale height of Kerbin (5000 meters).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERaise e (2.718) to the negative value of this power (2.718^-3.85714 in this case). You now have the fraction of Kerbin sea-level atmospheric pressure the craft can fly at (0.274112% in this case).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMultiply this number by 5- as Duna\u0027s atmosphere is 1/5th as thick as Kerbin\u0027s at sea level. You now have the fraction of Duna\u0027s sea level pressure this equates to (1.37056% in this case).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake the natural logarithm (\u0022ln\u0022 on a calculator) of this number (this yields -4.28995 in this case).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMultiply this number by the scale height of Duna (3000 meters) and remove the negative sign from the result. You now have the approximate maximum altitude the craft can fly at on Duna- BEFORE accounting for the reduced gravity levels on Duna (approximately 12,870 meters in this case).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-14T04:01:31Z\u0022 title=\u002211/14/2013 04:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T11:48:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAt long last, I think I\u0027ve developed the plane I\u0027m going to take around Duna.

The weight of the uranium was close to 50% of the weight of the tail end- so this was an entirely necessary change to allow light loading of the reactor: and even then she\u0027s still a bit of a nose-dragger once you reduce the uranium loading. With a 5% uranium load and the extra winglets, the Mk2 was born- and can perform quite impressively for an essentially unlimited-range aircraft...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Egret should be capable of flying at over 13,000 meters above \u0022sea level\u0022 on Duna- based on her maximum cruising altitude on Kerbin, even before the beneficial effects of Duna\u0027s reduced gravity levels are taken into account. What\u0027s more, she should be able to do so extremely quickly for a plane on Duna- at over 1,200 m/s (probably significantly faster, as the reduced gravity should allow higher flight, or nose angles closer to the horizon), the Egret should be able to circumnavigate Duna roughly once every 30 minutes. Actually, the minimum orbital speed for Duna at 42,000 meters is about 950 m/s according to the Wiki- so 1,200 m/s at 13,000 should greatly reduce the effects of gravity on the plane, allowing further increases in speed. As a result, the Egret might well be capable of flying at much higher altitudes than 13,000 meters- perhaps 20,000 meters or more- simply as the top speed will reach a very significant fraction of (and perhaps even exceed) what would be the orbital velocity, as it climbs, IF there were no atmosphere...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Craft file text:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Eship = \u0027Egret\u0027 Thermal Turbojet\u003Cbr\u003Eversion = 0.22.0\u003Cbr\u003Edescription = Max Cruising Altitude:  approx. 29,500 meters\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A8Max Landspeed:  1,201 m/s\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A8(5% UF6 load performance)\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A8\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A8\u0027The Egret\u0027 is a nuclear thermal turbojet aircraft capable of remarkable performance for a fuel-independent aircraft on Kerbin.

She\u0027s light and solidly-built enough to strap a couple a really big rocket in 2x symmetry without much of a problem- and her part count is reasonable enough for that too (the Egret has a LOT fewer parts than the D\u0027OH did...) Actually, my main focus right now has been building an orbital infrastructure so that when I go to Duna, I\u0027ll be going there in force- not just with a couple planes and a rocket. Think something Kethane Traveling Circus-style, only without the Kethane mod, as it\u0027s not yet Career Mode compatible (I do, however, have KSP Interstellar installed, and am strongly considering throwing in the HOME mod as well- though that might make it all a bit too easy...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually strongly recommend taking a look at my Mission Reports thread on my ongoing Career Mode game...

The correct figure is 3000 meters, not 5000 meters! (that\u0027s the scale height for Kerbin)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven this revelation, the new (re-calculated) maximum cruising altitude for the Egret on Duna is actually 12,870 meters before taking into account the lower gravity- not 13,000 meters. I got lucky on this one, because it just so happened that the two slopes intersect very near this point- otherwise I would have calculated a number that was really far off before, and looked like even more of a fool right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll update the calculation section in my earlier post to reflect the new numbers- otherwise people might end up using these numbers themselves, and abandoning perfectly good designs because they didn\u0027t think they could fly high enough, or alternatively, building planes that they think can fly on Duna- but just end up smashing into the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Oh, one last thing. IF this version of Thermal Turbojet works well on Duna, I\u0027ll be building an even higher-altitude version using a 2.5 meter fuselage. I can\u0027t do this just now because I haven\u0027t yet discovered the tech node for the super-giant sized B9 wings; but once I develop this tech tree node, I\u0027ll be designing a Duna Heavy Lifter using a Thermal Turbojet. As it just so happens, the 2.5 meter reactor is a little less than 6 times heavier than the 1.25 meter variant, but produces a thrust approximately 10 times as powerful as 1.25 meter with a Thermal Rocket Nozzle. Assuming the same ratios hold true for a Thermal Turbojet, I can expect a much higher altitude ceiling with a 2.5 meter reactor and Thermal Turbojet- assuming I can bring the wingload low enough. If not, I\u0027ll just slap on 2-4 of the 1.25 reactor-turbojet pairs to a 2.5 meter version (probably on the wings, though maybe also on the rear) and still obtain a probably moderately higher altitude ceiling than the Egret.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 2.5 meter design I speak of would be more of of a C-130 style heavy lifter than a medium-heavy scout plane like the Egret, however- so I don\u0027t expect it to land or takeoff on a dime (the wingload would be much heavier- relying more on speed for lift). Instead, it would be more useful for lifting heavy cargo loads from one permanent Duna base to another (assisted greatly by selection of flat sites, and placement of Extraterrestrial Launchpads Mod deployable runways- which are insanely heavy, and wouldn\u0027t be the very first things I bring to Duna- of course.) Getting something that heavy and with that much lift to Kerbin orbit would also be challenging- I\u0027d probably assemble it in-orbit or on Duna herself (with Extraterrestrial Launchpads infrastructure) rather than on Kerbin, since by that point the Egret (or a modified version thereof) would already have met this challenge\u0027s requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably most useful for hauling Kethane to a central refinery (since it\u0027d be a Nuclear Thermal Turbojet, it wouldn\u0027t burn any of the Kethane it\u0027d be transporting), once they release a version of the Kethane Pack that\u0027s Career Mode compatible... It could also be useful for Extraterrestial Launchpads mod \u0022Ore\u0022- which requires the Kethane Pack to work- as it utilizes Kethane Pack\u0027s resource placement and mining code for Ore (with permission, of course.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-14T11:02:45Z\u0022 title=\u002211/14/2013 11:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T04:14:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI salute your abstinence from HyperEdit.

IF something goes wrong, I see it as a challenge to try and fix it (like in my Mission Report thread- where already, I managed to strand two Kerbals in orbit in a spaceplane, and had to emergency EVA them to other ships in orbit- one more than 100 km away at the time the EVA was started).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, that said, I\u0027m generally not above F5/F9 when it comes to doing something stupid by accident, like staging a rocket when I didn\u0027t mean to; and I *WILL* revert a rocket as many times as necessary if it can\u0027t make it to orbit and survival looks unlikely, since I figure that any real space program would at least be equipped with some wind tunnels and aerospace engineers who understood all the calculations and mathematics behind designing a rocket that can actually fly- plus recovering all the debris is a pain sometimes. I\u0027ll even terminate debris to save on FPS and prevent collisions (a real space program could track debris, and has collision avoidance systems- much like hugely more advanced versions of what you see in some modern cars- to help detect and prevent such collisions)- though I\u0027ve designed a Scrapper/Recycler ship to cut down on that in my ongoing Career Mode save (actually my only save at the moment). But, like you applauded, HyperEdit is where I draw the line. I totally understand if you do it, but I just can\u0027t bring myself around to it.

Some aircraft- particularly those with very large, multi-part, Albatross-like wings, as that one has, are incapable of withstanding the G\u0027s of a rocket trip up. That being said, I\u0027m sure it can be done- if the part count doesn\u0027t kill the computer trying to run it first! That\u0027s basically my plan for bringing my planes to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of which, at this point I need some input from others. I\u0027ve developed four different models of thermal turbojet plane- all with very high altitude ceilings, and I need to decide which to try to bring to Duna first. In addition to the two models I presented before (\u0027The Egret\u0027 and the fighter-plane like one, which I decided to name \u0027The Firefly\u0027), I\u0027ve now developed:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027The Eagle\u0027- which is basically a stretched 3-wing version of the \u0027Egret\u0027, with a lighter (Mk1) fuselage, and 2 of the stock Mk2 Cockpits instead of 1 of the B9 Mk2\u0027s (more SAS force for the same mass and electricity consumption with the stock Mk2\u0027s- plus more usable length to attach wings). It has the highest altitude ceiling of all my designs- able to hold at about 32,800 meters on Kerbin. Its top speed is also the highest of all my designs- at 1,242 m/s near max altitude. It can also take off almost instantly on a flat surface (like the runway) on Kerbin- so it probably has a reasonable length takeoff roll on Duna too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fgev90i.png\u0022 alt=\u0022fgev90i.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yXCo58M.png\u0022 alt=\u0022yXCo58M.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, \u0027The Egret 2\u0027- which is basically a stretched version of the \u0027Egret\u0027, once again with 3 wings instead of 2- but a Mk2 fuselage and twin thermal turbojet engines instead of a single tubojet engine. It also has a slightly lower intake ratio, as it only has two additional 1.25 m intakes to feed its two engines- but it still is incapable of reaching a high enough height on Kerbin to stall (Duna might be another story though, due to the lower gravity). Surprisingly, the Egret doesn\u0027t seem to benefit from a higher top speed than the Egret: in fact, its top speed is slightly lower, at 1154 m/s instead of 1201 m/s- probably because of the heavy fueslage bicoupler for the engines (in KSP, drag is proportional to weight unless you have FAR installed- which institutes a more realistic, but much more CPU-intensive model based on cross-sectional area in the direction of movement).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENevertheless, it is a more powerful plane than any of my other models- and as such, might conceivably be able to haul more weight in cargo, say, if I swapped the 5 meter fuselage for a 5 meter fuel tank or 5 meter cargo bay (it has no use for fuel, so the fuel would be \u0027cargo\u0027), or if I loaded extra uranium in the reactors. Its sustainable altitude ceiling is also higher than the Egret or Firefly- at about 31,250 meters on Kerbin, as well as its top speed (I never got a firm number on the Egret, but it was somewhere between 1000 m/s and 1100 m/s). Finally, it can also take off very quickly on a flat surface at Kerbin sea level- due to its high thrust and low wingload- but so can all my other designs except the Firefly (which barely makes it off the runway)- but doesn\u0027t land quite as slowly as the original Egret or Eagle: as much of that super-short takeoff is due to very rapid acceleration from its twin engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HPf72vw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HPf72vw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WcAl3VO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022WcAl3VO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust to review the previous designs as well:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Firefly flies more quickly at the altitudes it *is* capable of reaching, due to its 3 engines and higher TWR than my other designs- and with high maneuverability and an altitude ceiling of 18,750 meters on Kerbin (that\u0027s about 6420 meters on Duna- similar to the D\u0027OH, but much faster-flying at that altitude- reaching a top speed of 384 m/s at that height on Kerbin) it should still be able to navigate Duna successfully. Its greatest weakness is its very high wingload- which means it relies on two XL radial parachutes to touch down successfully, and has a moderate chance of lawn-darting if they fully deploy before touchdown (I cut them first on Kerbin- but that wouldn\u0027t technically be sustainable for long-term operations on Duna- one of the challenge requirements- even if I only did it in emergencies.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Egret flies more slowly relative to its altitude than the Firefly, the Eagle, or the Egret 2. It has the second-lowest altitude ceiling of all my designs (about 27,500 meters), and the second slowest touchdown and liftoff speed (after the Eagle)- though all my designs except the Firefly can takeoff on very short cycles, they all touchdown at different speeds due to different reliance on lift vs their Thrust-Weight Ratio to liftoff. It is \u0022handier\u0022 than all my designs though- at is is less long and stretched out, and looks like it could take more of a beating in a rough landing without losing parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESummary:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0027The Firefly\u0027\u003C/strong\u003E: Long takeoff (even on Kerbin), highest speed relative to altitude, dangerous touchdown speed, altitude ceiling of 18,750 m, top speed of 384 m/s, lightest weight\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0027The Egret\u0027\u003C/strong\u003E: Short takeoff on Kerbin, slowest speed relative to altitude, second-slowest touchdown, altitude ceiling of 29,500 m, top speed of 1200 m/s, medium-weight\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0027The Egret 2\u0027\u003C/strong\u003E: Super-short takeoff, higher speed relative to altitude, second-fastest touchdown, altitude ceiling of 31,250m, top speed of 1154 m/s, medium-heavy weight\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0027The Eagle\u0027\u003C/strong\u003E: Shortest takeoff, higher speed relative to altitude, slowest touchdown, altitude ceiling of 32,800 m, top speed of 1242 m/s, lightweight\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOTHER NOTES:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- The Egret is the only design with no heat radiators. This is just one of the corners I cut on the design to save on weight (another is no parachutes- though none of my designs feature them except the Firefly). As such its nuclear reactor will overheat to the point of emergency shutdown when left inactive on the ground for too long- but can be manually reactivated after a bit of passive cooling by one of the pilots before takeoff, no harm done (this also technically greatly saves on the need for fuel reprocessing trips- as the reactor will only be operational when in the air, and there is no other way to shut it off besides allowing it to reach emergency overheat). Heat production is NOT a problem at all when the engine is running- as the very airflow that is used to generate the thrust also cools the engine- so there is absolutely no danger of the plane suddenly dropping out of the sky, unless it is allowed to enter an unpowered glide for too long- in which case the reactor WILL overheat. \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- The Egret and Firefly currently lack KAS attachment ports (the Eagle and Egret 2 have them). They can be slapped on the rocket before launch if necessary (I doubt it will change their performance much), or if this is allowed, manually attached and detached in the field- since the only time they need them is when they are getting their nuclear fuel reprocessed every once a game-year or so. If this is allowed under the challenge requirements, none of my designs would feature them- as it is far more efficient to just store an extra attachment port attached to the (stationary and safely landed) nuclear fuel reprocessing station, and reattach it to the nuclear turbojet whenever fuel reprocessing is needed, than it is to haul the (tiny bit of) extra weight, drag, and lag through the air on flight after flight when it\u0027s not actively needed.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- The Eagle and Firefly\u0027s cockpits both have lower impact tolerance than those of the Egret and Egret 2.

And stop insulting people. I\u0027ve come across your posts littering many of the forum threads I\u0027ve read, and they\u0027re almost always negative, they almost always put people down. The planes aren\u0027t supposed to be infiingliders (which is what you\u0027re describing), and they\u0027re not out to break speed records on Kerbin either (if they were, I would be using traditional turbojet engines). I\u0027ve designed MUCH more powerful planes that can fly on Kerbin before. But the point of this challenge is to fly on Duna, not Kerbin- and at that to do so reasonably sustainably (i.e., even if it can fly there, a rocket-powered plane would require frequent refueling- and so is a poor idea on Duna).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, @ the rest of you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, putting aside the smaller, lighter designs that can be strapped to the side of a rocket in 2x symmetry with relative ease, I decided to just go ahead and build a SSTDABK (Single Stage to Duna and Back to Kerbin) spaceplane for the job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, I decided to go with a 2.5 meter fuselage as the base- since I recently developed the tech node for the gigantic B9 mod wings, but found that they require at least a 2.5 meter fuselage to attach stably. A 2.5 meter fuselage allowed me to accommodate the heavier wings- which in turn meant I could support more cargo mass or crew capacity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I\u0027ve traditionally had problems with the weight of my LFO-powered spaceplane attempts, even on Kerbin. I only recently developed my first functional spaceplane (see my Mission Reports thread for images of it), and it is based on a Mk2 fuselage- which is basically just a wider version of a 1.25 meter fuselage that allows a little more room for wing attachments and is wide enough to accommodate two rear-mounted engines. Even the best designs are inherently limited by the low efficiencies of chemical rockets, and the stock NERVA designs are dangerous and unreliable thanks to the engines\u0027 tendency to overheat and explode when fired in-atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I\u0027d been playing around with NearFuture mod\u0027s Argon propulsion systems for a while, trying to find a good use for them. I find their high electrical power requirements require a very substantial mass in generation capacity to meet- and as the fuel is very light and low-density, and the engines using them have proportionally low thrust, this extra weight tends to greatly impact the efficiency of the designs and not leave much weight for payload. Thus, previously, I had only thought them useful for launching very, very lightweight probes into orbit using the VASMIR thrusters (which work comparatively well in-atmosphere), or as upper-stage transfer modules for still comparatively light payloads (due to the low mass of ArgonGas held by even the largest of the mod\u0027s argon tanks, it is difficult and unwieldy to get enough fuel mass into orbit to provide the necessary impulse for long-distance transport of heavier payloads, even with ArgonGas systems\u0027 amazing ISP values. Remember, total impulse = ISP * fuel mass.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, a spaceplane is supposed to be relatively lightweight, and does not suffer as much from carrying heavy masses anyways- as aerodynamic lift rather than thrust is the main thing used to counteract gravity. Plus, the larger ArgonGas tanks are so lightweight that they actually make reasonable fuselages in themselves in terms of their ration of mass to length and attachable surface area. So, I designed the spaceplane pictured here-which I currently am simply calling \u0022Advanced Spaceplane\u0022, but will come up with a better name for soon...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere she is shortly after taking off the runway:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TkBXzp1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TkBXzp1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe features a crew capacity of 7, two thermal turbojets, and 2 VASMIR Plasma Thrusters. The plasma thrusters burn argon, and work relatively well even at sea level (ISP= 250), but are intended for use in the upper atmosphere to push the plane into orbit, where their ISP exceeds 6400. I packed five of the largest ArgonGas tanks into the design- for a little over 1.74 total tons of fuel (still not much in absolute terms- but the Advanced Spaceplane is very light, so more than enough to at least carry the thing to Duna if I use the Mun for a gravity assist- maybe even enough for a return trip without refueling if I use Ike the same way.) What\u0027s more, and the main reason this design is efficient- the plan is already carrying two 1.25 meter nuclear reactors to power its thermal turbojets, so all I needed to do to provide electrical power for the plasma thrusters was to slap an electrical generator onto each.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, one thing that I absolutely have to point out about the design- you can\u0027t get something for nothing. The electrical generators don\u0027t spin up any further when the thermal turbojets are running (the reactors\u0027 power is used to provide thrust instead). However they *DO* keep any speed they were allowed to spin up while on the runway. And KSP Interstellar Mod\u0027s electrical generators keep that speed for a VERY long time (perhaps even indefinitely). Even if they do slowly spin down, like a real-life generator, it\u0027s easy enough for me to wait on the runway until they are fully spun-up, and THEN liftoff. The generators are capable of converting the stored mechanical energy built up on the runway into electrical energy as needed in flight- and providing more than enough electricity to make it to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, I have a spaceplane that, if allowed to spin up its generators for a bit of time on the runway (it only takes them a few minutes to fully spin up), is more than capable of making it to orbit. However, I didn\u0027t fully realize the generators wouldn\u0027t spin up in-flight on my first flight, and so didn\u0027t think to wait for a spin-up cycle on the runway. As a result, I only made it to about 32,000 meters (with a steadily increasing rate of climb) before my plasma thrusters cut out unexpectedly on my first flight. I was able to pull out of the resultant tailspin I entered into (I didn\u0027t react fast enough to pull the nose back down closer to the horizon, and the plane stalled at about 36,000 meters and started falling like a rock), but I needed to land to let the generators spin back up and try this all again...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Zd7oMEE.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Zd7oMEE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took nearly an hour for the plane to climb to its peak speed (a little over 465 m/s) at its maximum curising altitude (about 21,250 meters on Kerbin with turbojets only, 32% uranium, and a full fuel load of ArgonGas), so I haven\u0027t gotten in another full attempt yet. However the plane is spinning up on the runway as I speak (I reverted rather then go through the hassle of flying the rest of the way around Kerbin and landing the thing), so I should have a trip to Duna to report on relatively soon if all goes smoothly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, one last note on the design, if anybody is looking to utilize the design or engineer a better version of the thing (I\u0027ll post the text for the craft file if anyone wants it)- this model DOES feature a radiator, unlike the Egret- but it is a very small one, too small to dissipate the heat quite as fast as it generates when both the electrical generators and reactors are running. This means that it IS theoretically possible to overheat the reactors on the ground if one somehow kept the generators running for a really long time (they stop generating WasteHeat as soon as they are fully spun up though, and the radiators give off more heat the hotter the craft gets- so it is very difficult and would probably take something like several DAYS or WEEKS of continuous operation- i.e. don\u0027t try to power a Science Lab on the ground performing research with the plane for a long period of time via a KAS which in docking mode- as the reactors will probably eventually just overheat and shutdown, leaving the lab unpowered- though the emergency auto-shutdown heat levels of 95% max normally cause no damage to the plane, you have to somehow heat it even further to 100% to create an explosion.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know it\u0027s not much, and very technical, but I thought I\u0027d start off by presenting the plane and some of its technical challenges and advantages, so my next post (on my actual trip to Duna with it) won\u0027t be nearly as long.

Currently, the whole thing has a mass in excess of the fuselages that would replace it of about 4.2 tons- a solid 4 tons of which is in the engines (the ArgonGas being very light, and the tanks having an incredibly low dry mass when empty- to the point where I could save a lot of mass on my spaceplane by using empty ones as fuselages...) I MIGHT be able to achieve better results with a similar, or slightly heavier, escape package based on a stock NERVA engine- but wouldn\u0027t have any fuel left after reaching orbit, and would have to refuel (though I\u0027ll probably also do this with the Argon too- just to be sure I have enough fuel for the return trip). The NERVA engines also have the very worrisome problem of tending to overheat and explode if fired for too long in-atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption B: I abandon the single-stage to orbit part of the idea (and lose the potential points) and just try and strap the thing to a rocket. It has a lot of mass and lift for this though, so I doubt it would work on all but possibly the largest and most complex 5 meter rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption C: I make use of another feature of the KSP Interstellar mod, besides the nuclear thermal turbojet engines- and construct a microwave relay station in orbit of Kerbin to provide the spaceplane with extra electrical power during ascent. This would be sure to work, with a sufficiently powerful relay station- as the spaceplane did just barely have enough thrust to escape Kerbin already. Actually, this option has another even greater advantage- it would allow me to upgrade the spaceplane by replacing its Argon propulsion system with a hydrogen one- which is even lighter and generates a lot more thrust (147% more per engine, to be precise), but requires even more massive amounts of electricity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main advantage of the Hydrogen thrust system is the lighter weight, and thus improved in-atmosphere performance on Duna. The disadvantage of this system is that HydrogenGas\u0027 very low density allows me to pack even less Delta V into the spaceplane- not nearly enough to make it Duna and back without several refueling trips- likely one after reaching orbit, one in orbit of the Mun, one on the ground on Duna, and one in orbit of Duna before returning. But hey, the challenge requirements never specified that a SSTDABK plane had to make it all on one fill of fuel, did they? Besides, hydrogen is very light- meaning it would take VERY little energy for me to set up very high-volume depots of the stuff at all of these locations (enough to refuel the spaceplane two or three times each), with my existing lifter designs. The hydrogen propulsion idea would also require a much more massive microwave relay station (the existing spaceplane propelled into orbit by Argon would probably only need a relatively modest microwave relay station in orbit of Kerbin to provide it with the extra power to make it to orbit- though I\u0027ll probably over-engineer the station anyways, just to be safe). It might also very well require an additional such station in orbit of Duna- since the hydrogen engines are so power-hungry. The existing argon-powered spaceplane could could escape Duna just fine even without any help, on the other hand- and might still be able to receive a very small amount of additional power from the station in orbit of Kerbin during the transfer window to make a return trip there- if the transmission losses aren\u0027t too great over that distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce again, I need some input- about a good way to get the spaceplane to orbit- are there other options I haven\u0027t thought of? Right now, I\u0027m planning on going with Option C, the Orbital Construction mod, and my existing spacedock, to set up a massive solar power plant/ microwave relay in orbit of Kerbin- constructed partly out of recycled scrap metal from orbital debris, and partly out of additional RocketParts I\u0027d send up (which I guess would represent the actual solar panels in the station themselves). The spaceplane itself would be constructed on the ground on Kerbin, of course- but nowhere in the challenge requirements does it state that any space stations or fuel depots that support the mission (which is essentially what this is) need to be constructed on the ground or launched to Kerbin orbit in one piece- especially ones I won\u0027t ever even be docking with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe I should just abandon the whole spaceplane thing, and stick with my existing designs (the Egret 2 or Eagle)- which can fly a lot higher on Kerbin (and thus also on Duna) than the spaceplane anyways (which only can hold 21,250 meters on turbojet power alone on Kerbin with two VASMIR engines attached for escape, or a bit over 16,500 with four)- and in the case of the Eagle might even be able to perform suborbital hops based purely on its turbojet power on Duna, without any assistance (though the usefulness of this in returning the vessel to Kerbin- if I ever wished to do so- is highly questionable).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdvice is welcomed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-16T04:27:56Z\u0022 title=\u002211/16/2013 04:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"1D-1()T","CreatedById":75340,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-16T05:19:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf your space planes can make that 1200 m/s on Duna your apoapsis would be out of the atmosphere, so you could just pack some RCS to raise the periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-16T05:44:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@Northstar \u003C/strong\u003E Thanks for understanding.

Especially because, after some further thought, I\u0027ve decided that the \u0027Firefly\u0027 is pretty much a death-tap on Duna- due to its very high landing/takeoff speeds (it would be a good choice for somewhere with a thicker atmosphere, like Eve, however).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also not so sure I want to launch the original \u0027Egret\u0027 design, when both the \u0027Eagle\u0027 and \u0027Egret 2\u0027 are essentially improved versions of it that took some aspect of its ability to stay in the air- either its thrust system or its low wingload- and improved it, in both cases without adversely affecting the other parameter by much (the Eagle actually has a better TWR, as well as lower wingload. The Egret 2 has a much higher TWR, but mildly higher wingload).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m partial to using the Egret 2 for utilitarian purposes (read: transportation of cargo- probably by replacing the structural fuselage with a fuel tank or cargo bay of the same length), but the Eagle for passenger transport and \u0027winning\u0027 the challenge- since on Kerbin it outperforms all my other craft, especially the Advanced Spaceplane (if I can ever get it to orbit- my Microwave Relay Station is designed, and all I have to do is construct it at this point), in terms of turbojet-only altitude ceiling and thus Challenge Points; and due to its lower weight and nearly identical total lift, it\u0027s also a little bit easier to get to Duna than the Egret 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnless... Does a spaceplane get the \u0027bonus points\u0027 for a higher altitude ceiling during the portion of its ascent where it is still in aerodynamic flight, but is using all its engines? Normally, I\u0027d see the answer being NO, but the Advanced Spaceplane has such weak TWR, even with all engines active, that it essentially has to remain in aerodynamic (rather than ballistic) flight for 10-15 MINUTES with all engines active (yes, you read that right- the ArgonGas lasts a really long time...) before it reaches the point where its thrust is sufficient relative to gravity and drag to set the thing on a ballistic trajectory... It is capable of circumnavigating Duna several times with its ArgonGas engines active in addition to the Thermal Turbojets- provided it has enough electrical power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor this same reason, and the incredibly fuel-efficiency they provide, I will probably use the Plasma Thrusters as an additional boost just to boost climb rate or ensure I can safely climb over particularly tall mountain ranges on Duna... The generators are capable of recharging in-flight, if I deactivate the Plasma Thrusters and dial the thrust back down a tiny bit later on, so there\u0027s no worry that doing this too much would eventually lead to engine failure and the spaceplane dropping out of the sky...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-16T19:55:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne last thought Geschookpf- and I\u0027m breaking this into a separate post, so as to try not to break your train of thought:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe NearFuture mod engines are indeed very difficult to use properly on their own due to their very high electrical consumption and the inadequate solutions Nearfuture mod offers to power them (some slightly better solar panels, and some nuclear reactors that *slightly* exceed the stock solar panels in terms of EC/s per ton of mass- and Capacitors, which are the mod\u0027s best solution to the problem for a sufficiently large craft to use them properly).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever KSP Interstellar mod offers some excellent solutions for power energy-hungry engines like these: ranging from the nuclear reactors with a massive generation and storage potential relative to mass (but very high mass, and the requirement for UF6 fuel), to the Microwave Power Relay system, which is an actual technology that is being developed and is currently still in theory stages here on Earth (actually, all its technologies are- even the Alcubierre Warp Drive is a rel-life idea scientists have proposed and are debating the plausibility of), and is quite well-balanced in terms of gameplay as far as I can tell (wait until you see how big and bulky my Microwave Relay Station is- and how little power it transmits relative to its enormous size and mass).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing KSP Interstellar\u0027s technologies (the thermal turbojets and the Microwave Relay system), I found I am able to put the NearFuture mod\u0027s ArgonGas engines to good use- on a SSTDABK spaceplane at least (the whole system is overly complex and barely provides enough thrust to escape Kerbin, but is incredibly lightweight- which is an absolute necessity for the spaceplane to actually be able to FLY well on Duna with only the thermal turbojets active...)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-16T20:00:44Z\u0022 title=\u002211/16/2013 08:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-16T21:02:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E@ Northstar:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d still send everything you\u0027ve got.

No matter what you think from tests on Kerbin, you simply can\u0027t test landing on Duna at all because Kerbin has no ground high enough for the job. The highest point on Kerbin is only 6761m, well below the 16-17km needed to approximate the challenge\u0027s 2500m minimum Duna landing altitude. And landing safely is the hardest part of the Duna end of the project. It\u0027s not very difficult to combine sufficient wing with sufficient horsepower to take off and remain airborne, and maneuvering while in flight is more a matter of your own learning what you can and can\u0027t do than a design problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut safe landings on Duna are extremely difficult and you haven\u0027t tried one yet. Expect to botch your first few attempts, even with planes that can slow down enough to have a chance. You\u0027ll have learn how to set up and fly your approach which takes some practice, and you\u0027ll probably also have to tweak the design to provide more braking force and/or survive bouncing up and down sand dunes on all extremities without flipping over. So if you don\u0027t want to send a bunch of different designs, send multiple copies of the same design, and perhaps with a variety of slight modifications anticipating possible problems. That way, you can wreck a few planes during your learning process and still have something to try the challenge with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to spaceplanes, the challenge is to fly using aerodynamic lift. As long as the plane can do that without going into a thrust-induced ballistic trajectory, then it\u0027s OK. Challenge runs, however, have to be all aerodynamic. So divide its functions into separate flights. Land it the 1st time, then keep a tight leash on it so it stays an airplane when doing challenge flights to land again. Once you\u0027ve shown what it can do that way, then pile on full sail and leave Duna for bonus points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor challenge purposes, as long as the plane is actually being held up by aerodynamic lift instead on a ballistic, thrust-induced trajectory, then that counts for meeting the basic specs. If you can then throttle it up a bit more and leave Duna, that\u0027s a bonus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is, it\u0027s a blurry distinction between airplane and spaceplane with this particular model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhereas most spaceplanes reach orbit by pointing their nose steeply up, and raising their apoapsis above the atmosphere, that\u0027s not how this one works. Instead, at least in flight tests on Kerbin, it keeps gradually raising its altitude, and raising its periapsis instead- always near peak altitude- and keeping just barely enough thrust for the wings to keep it climbing very slowly. Its TWR is so low that it is incapable of reaching an actual ballistic trajectory- it can never climb much faster than 10-25 m/s. Technically, it\u0027s a super-high altitude plane with the plasma thrusters engaged: and simply is capable of flying at the very edge of the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENormal planes can\u0027t do this (at least in KSP *without* FAR installed- it is possible with a Blackbird-style plane with FAR installed as drag falls off in FAR at hypersonic speeds), as their jet engines start to lose thrust above a certain altitude, eventually being unable to cancel out drag and the component of lift slowing the plane down. But plasma thrusters don\u0027t- they work equally well at all altitudes, though their fuel (argon) consumption drops as they climb higher. They also don\u0027t heave nearly the kind of potential burn times that an argon-plane does (this thing could run its engines for something close to an hour at full thrust).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETechnically, it is always mostly aerodynamic lift holding it up (it has a very low wingload)- as relative gravity falls off the faster the plane flies, allowing the exponentially decreasing lift to still hold the plane up. That being said, it also has a minor component of its (very weak) thrust holding it up- as it always has its nose pointed well above the horizon in the uppermost atmosphere, very close to 45 degrees (to maximize lift, which hits a peak at a 45 degree angle of attack at a given speed). But as I said, the TWR is much, much less than 1 at almost all altitudes. Only in the last ten thousand meters or so of atmosphere, when its speed has climbed very high (and relative gravity is thus very low) is its effective ratio of thrust to gravity (TWR in its most literal sense- though many players use the term in change of thrust-to-mass ratio in stable orbits in space: where objects have mass, but no \u0022weight\u0022) actually high enough to enter a ballistic trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis, as you can see, kind of blurs the line between spaceplane and plane: at what point (other than where the atmosphere completely cuts out) do you consider a plane to truly be in space?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong tangent aside, I haven\u0027t developed a rocket to carry the Eagle to orbit yet- but I did construct a Microwave Power Station (I mixed up my terminology before: Microwave *RELAY* stations are for bouncing the energy to reach places the power station doesn\u0027t have a direct line of sight on. KSP Interstellar adds these too- although I don\u0027t have any constructed at the moment).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s an image. A couple design notes first though:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing on the very bottom is a Yawmaster Service Module. It\u0027s the lightest weight (measured in Dry Mass) possible way of holding a single Kerbal (inside- not on a lawnchair) in orbit, and also holds a tiny bit of LFO mix, Electricharge, and Monopropellant. It\u0027s technically unnecessary, but mostly for roleplaying \u0022maintenance\u0022 and crew storage in emergency purposes- such as if I manage to strand another one of my LFO-fueled spaceplanes in LKO. Above it is an inline heat-radiator: for dealing with WasteHeat produced by the solar panels. The thing on the top is the Microwave Power Transmitter- that\u0027s what beams the power down to my Advanced Spaceplane. It doesn\u0027t need to be facing the target to work correctly. Finally, the panels themselves are 8 \u0022Megalador Solar Panel Arrays\u0022 from the NearFuture mod- basically they\u0027re just like upscaled, slightly more mass-efficient, but even more fragile, stock Gigantor XL panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ncIiKf0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ncIiKf0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis thing produces 576 kW of energy and is capable of relaying something like up to 91% of that when directly overhead (when the Advanced Spaceplane is landed)- but falling off exponentially with distance to the spaceplane and distance through the atmosphere... So I over-estimated the transmission losses and greatly over-engineered the thing. That should be more than enough power to give my Advanced Spaceplane the extra push it needs to get to orbit on Argon- and maybe even enough to run a hydrogen propulsion system, though I have no intention of trying that yet, as, though it would improve performance; it would greatly increase the need for refueling stops on its round trip to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the launch window from Kerbin I am about to use- as you\u0027ll notice, the relay station is still well behind the plane on the horizon. It take a little more than one orbital period for the Spaceplane to reach maximum altitude from liftoff- so if I\u0027ve timed this right, it should have the maximum period of time after it starts its escape burn with a line-of-sight on the station... Duna is also very nearly to a good transfer window on the solar system map- which gives me a bit of time to refuel and get the spaceplane into a good orbit around the Mun (that way, I can store a large amount of energy in my Munar orbit, and won\u0027t need quite as much thrust to make the transfer), but not so much that my Kerbals will be waiting forever...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eZeESUN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022eZeESUN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m about to begin (after a quick shower, dinner, and an update to my Missions Reports thread) what should be, if all goes smoothly, my first challenge run.

It also moves position relative to the spaceplane very rapidly, leading to a very small window for the escape burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, I am going to need to figure out a way to move the station to a higher orbit- which has no docking ports, no KAS winches, and no KAS connector ports... I could manually attach a radial KAS connector port (the small radial connectors can be added and removed by Kerbals on EVA) as close to the center of gravity as possible, and attempt to tow it with a specialized tug- but I\u0027m more likely just to recycle the thing and build a new one after I move the entire Spacedock to a higher orbit...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the meantime, though, I made some design refinements to the Advanced Spaceplane that might very well allow it to escape Kerbin\u0027s gravity *without* an improved orbit for the Microwave Power Station (though I will still need the very limited assistance a low-orbit microwave power station can provide).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, before I present the new and improved Advanced Spaceplane Mk2, let me present another craft I\u0027ve been working on. I present, the \u0027Eagle Mk2\u0027:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere she is shortly after takeoff:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VpNLdDd.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VpNLdDd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here she is during the high altitude portion of that test flight:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, she didn\u0027t nearly reach peak altitude or speed (she reached about 27,000 meters and 1,080 m/s) though, as I left the game running unpaused for a bit to quickly use the toilet, and when I came back her angle of attack had climbed to a level she was incapable of controlling at that altitude. However given her *VERY LOW* angle of attack to gain both speed and altitude at the same time even at over 25,000 meters, I suspect she will easily shatter my height and speed records for the Eagle Mk1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHer biggest weakness is that she has very little control surface relative to her wing area- which means she can easily lose control if her angle of attack climbs too high in the lower part of here altitude range. And by \u0022lower\u0022, I mean anything below 30,000 meters (she can probably reach at least 40,000- on par with my best jet planes). And by \u0022high angle of attack\u0022, I mean anything over 18 degrees below 28,000 meters. As you can infer, I *MIGHT* need to make some control refinements before she\u0027s ready for Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, my main focus has been my spaceplane designs. Here is the Advanced Spaceplane Mk2 shortly off the runway:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Xa2tvJy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Xa2tvJy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here is the launch window I used. Bad timing as always- I\u0027m going to need to get this down to more of a science...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sUjkaR8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sUjkaR8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, about the Mk2:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main insight I had was that the engine weight was greatly decreasing the plane\u0027s performance, and was such a significant fraction of plane mass that a light, less powerful engine could actually IMPROVE the TWR- and as it so happened, I had one available that was both lighter and more powerful, but achieved much less ISP and required more electrical power... The Pulsed Inductive Plasma Thrusters XL, from NearFuture Mod, namely. They use ArgonGas, like the VASMIR engines, but weight less than half as much. They consume 10% more power per second though, and achieve only a bit better than 1/3 the ISP (around 2400 instead of 6400). However, I realized my escape burns were taking so long (10-15 minutes) that I could GREATLY reduce total power consumption with a more powerful burn- even if it was less efficient with the electricity. The engines I used were only slightly more powerful (9.70 kN instead of 9.60)- but their reduced weight (2.4 TONS of weight savings when using four of them) meant my entire craft was significantly lighter, and the TWR much better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy other insight was that I could still benefit a great deal form additional wing area. First, some tweaking with the Advanced Spaceplane, and then seeing how well the Eagle Mk2 performed with its additional wing area vs. the Eagle Mk1 (which was previously my lowest-wingload design yet), convinced me of the need to add additional wing area to the spaceplane. The additional wing area has three main benefits:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, by raising my altitude ceiling on turbojets, I raise both my max landspeed before activating my plasma thrusters, and the amount of amount of atmosphere I need to escape though. This means a shorter escape burn, allowing for more rapid power consumption during the burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, and this was not lost on me, then entire point of the spaceplane is to perform well on Duna. If more wing area raises altitude ceiling on Kerbin, it DEFINITELY will on Duna (where the lower gravity means the ideal winglaod is even less than on Kerbin). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird, it helps with touchdown velocity. The less wingload my plane has, the slower it can touch down on Duna. I had already previously thought about trying to add a third turbojet to the craft, but had decided against it for precisely this reason- even if it raised my altitude ceiling on Duna and Kerbin, it would definitely also raise my touchdown velocity by a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I added as much additional wing area to the craft as I could cram in. I even ignored matters of appearance and extended some trailing edges beyond the edge of my main wings, due to the inability of the editor to allow me to place additional trailing edges along certain points of the wing without them angling inwards at an inappropriate angle...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve currently had the Advanced Spaceplane Mk2 in a long cruise near max altitude while I wrote this, waiting for the Microwave Power Station to come into position. I\u0027ll be trying to escape Kerbin soon- and this time I think it will work. I have a good feeling about my new design. Here she is at a high cruising altitude (not quite max) by the way. The previous design MAXED at a bit over 16km without plasma thrusters:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gPCpcV3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022gPCpcV3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd as you might notice on the image, I see the Microwave Relay Receiver dish has just opened- which means my Microwave Power Station is sufficiently close to transmit, and it\u0027s past time (a good bit late, in fact) to begin my escape burn...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee you guys in orbit- on this attempt or the next (as I said, I should have started the escape burn BEFORE the station was overhead- so it might not make it this time around.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
