Normal mode:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUh oh. On a the launchpad, Jeb became hungry... but he had no snacks! KSC radioed back that he must complete the mission to land a Kerbal on the Mun before the Kerbiets! (Soviet parody.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObjectives : \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet Jeb on the Mun and back in less than 6 hours! He couldn\u0027t last any longer than that without a snack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERules :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Must have Jeb in the command pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. No SAS modules; Jeb couldn\u0027t pilot them! (Hey, no extra command pods, either.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Get some batteries on that thing. Jeb destroyed the RTG\u0027s and the solar panels when he was hungry! (Also. No more than 5000 units of it.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. No docking, how can you be so cruel to Jeb when he\u0027s suffering?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. At least get the pod home before 10 hours, or he\u0027ll die. After 6 hours, you have lost anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. No jet engines. Jeb hates them!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. No debug menu, dum dum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Do not kill Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoints :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. For every hour earlier you land him on the Mun and bring him back, you get an extra \u002B5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Use only Tier-0 parts. (Career mode) \u002B20.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Instead of a rocket... use a plane to get there and back! Rocket powered, obviously. \u002B10\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. What? Did you say SRB\u0027s only? \u002B50\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Use only ion engines. ( This is impossible, I know. ) \u002B9001\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Bring his best friends, Bill and Bob. \u002B5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Complete the mission \u002B10\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. For every Kerbal killed: -10\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. For every rule you break, -25. If you break number 7, you have lost the challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeaderboard :\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
