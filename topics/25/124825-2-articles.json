Some of the parts will probably begin to stretch and put stress on the attachment points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 200 kilometers, the gravity will be 9 G. It\u0027s important to remember that this thing isn\u0027t light. It masses in at 35.48 tonnes. While it is supported more evenly than it would be on the ground, it is still possible for the weights to sag or fall off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 150 kilometers, the gravity will be 16 G. Many planes would fall apart at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 120 kilometers, the gravity will be 25 G.

Total gravity is 400 G. Gravitomagnetic polarization should be quite evident here if the craft survives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 15 kilometers, gravitomagnetic sheer causes about 2.6 G of difference across the ends of the craft. It will be falling at \u0026gt; Mach 1 at sea level by this point, with just seconds before reaching the core.

It won\u0027t matter though, because 10000 G has easily turned the craft to pulp by this point, and even if it were intact, it\u0027s now 2.9 seconds from terminal impact.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-11T19:07:26Z\u0022 title=\u002211/11/2015 07:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pds314\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"antiquark","CreatedById":25542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T19:03:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pds314\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Pds314\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUnlikely that the ship will reach the singularity intact.

The actual gravity at that height is a formidable \u0026gt;700000 G. The speed of the craft, through water, mind you, is 8 KILOMETERS PER SECOND. I suspect it would simply melt at that point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReaching the singularity is probably not gonna happen except to individual debris items that exceed the density of water, in which case, yeah, they could well be thrown off into space at ludicrous speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething else that could happen with tick alignment though, is force exaggeration. Basically, once I start going above a certain speed, the instantaneous slowing from the water in one tick is enough to make me go backwards at a higher speed, and then forwards at an even higher speed, and then backwards and forwards and backwards so hard that every part is shot into deep space at a great multiple of the speed of light.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
