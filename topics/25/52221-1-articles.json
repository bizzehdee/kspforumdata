Within the atmosphere, you have more drag doing that, for the same reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to stay in a circular trajectory, you need a centripetal force that grows quadratically with your speed. Gravity is the one you normally rely on when orbiting -- but nothing says you can\u0027t add to it with a bit of rocket force. So if you thrust downwards, you can spin around at a higher speed. With infinite fuel and a mainsail, I was able to go around in about 6 minutes; you could do a bit better with infinite-fuel sepratrons or the 48-7S. I had a roughly equal amount of time in liftoff and landing; you could do a lot better here, I was on parachutes for almost two minutes. The flight path was basically to get up to about 65 km orbit, then full throttle pointing increasingly down as my speed went up. Eventually I was at pitch -90.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MajorThomas","CreatedById":94499,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-28T20:56:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe centripetal force-by-rocket idea is fantastic, 6 minutes?
