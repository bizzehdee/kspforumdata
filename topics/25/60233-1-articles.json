If you played Trackmania, this goes by the same rules. You have to go through the start, then through all checkpoints in any order and lastly through the finish to validate your time. Start, checkpoints and finish do not have an orientation, you can go through them in any direction. On the image, you can see the order I used for my own submission, but you can choose any other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Your score is the time it took you to get from start to finish, valid only if you get through all checkpoints in the process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Your airplane has to be intact until you pass the finish gate. You can crash after, but Jeb will not be happy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Use the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/49216\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Epersistent trails\u003C/a\u003E plugin to record your race. Use maximum precision. Stop recording a couple of seconds after you go through the finish gate. Don\u0027t forget to save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) One stage, stock parts, no FAR. (May change in future races.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) You can use your own jet-powered aircraft, but keep in mind that the gates are not very large. Jet-power only (no rockets, no RCS, no R.A.P.I.E.R.).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESubmission:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPost your persistent trail file (located in [...]\\Kerbal Space Program\\GameData\\PersistentTrails\\PluginData\\Tracks) and your craft file if you used your own. Optionally post timing screenshots if you can, if not I will compute your time myself. I will close submissions when no more new entries come in, after a decent amount of time (at least 1 month).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotes: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* In the save file, you will find an airplane, named Dart. This is the one I used for my own submission. It has a thrust limiter to make it go slowly and action group 1 to toggle the jet engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Each gate in ~190 parts, you may want to lower your graphics settings, though I did not encounter any significant lag during my tryouts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMy entry:\u003C/strong\u003E 01:27\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/w14h71r51dp774x/leafty%20-%20Proxy%20Call.trk\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPersistent trail file\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/mNcLUqN\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mNcLUqNl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mNcLUqNl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/C9ov46a\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/C9ov46al.png\u0022 alt=\u0022C9ov46al.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow I measured my time: I took control of the finish gate, put the camera near the start gate with the replay ghost just before it. I hit play and took a screenshot when the plane got through the start gate. I then recentered the camera on the finish gate and waited for the ghost to go through it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI crashed quite a few times before I was able to do it.
