I bassicly just bombed my whole savegame with tons of probes (27 to be exact, all of them around Kerbin) but no actual bases. And i am planning to make a second savegame where i am actually going to do something usefull. But before that, Have you actually replaced Kerbin with another planet? With multiple bases around it that act like cities? Or are you planning to do the same?! Please tell me. Maybe post pictures, so people can get inspiration. Maybe i will post some pictures too.
