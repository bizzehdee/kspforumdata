I\u0027m not going to bother to resubmit to that challenge because my design worked and performed exactly as I wanted it to and more than served it\u0027s purpose, regardless of the challenge rules. Above anything else, this challenge is about designing an aerial vehicle that\u0027s capable of doing more than just flying around in circles at warp speed. It\u0027s about creating something that is not only fun to fly, but has utility as well. The big goal is to take what you design and test here and have it hopefully, come in useful in other challenges. If you\u0027re satisfied that your design meets the challenge criteria, then I\u0027m satisfied. Go show me what it can do.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERather than being a VTOL challenge, which I\u0027m considering duplicating this into so that more choices are available, this is about Helicopters. Even modern helicopters tend to blur the distinction. We\u0027ve had one entry already that was essentially a lifting body once the rotors got it off the ground. My own entry flies like a rock when the rotors are shut off. Basically, I\u0027m looking for a helicopter. Does it take off and land vertically? Does it have rotors? Is it incapable of STOL?

You might have noticed that the Bell Jetranger has those two winglets on the back, in front of the tail rotor? They\u0027re there to control pitch and yaw, they offer no lifting capabilities on top of that. A famous TV example of a helicopter is Airwolf, described in the show as a supersonic lifting body with rotors. Now, there are two things wrong with the premise of a supersonic helicopter: the rotors can\u0027t handle the stress of supersonic flight (no material yet tried, not even carbon nanotube fibre, can handle supersonic rotation on top of an aircraft; even SCRAMjets have to slow the air down so the engine can breathe), and the Bell 222 (the airframe Airwolf was built on) is about as aerodynamic as a brick, so apart from the fairly impressive looking shape could not be described as a lifting body at any speed. Not to mention the fact that the pontoons on the actual aircraft had to be painted to make it look like it had inboard weapons and inline jets* because the props made for it in \u0022deployed\u0022 mode failed FAA inspections (the missile pod had a habit of falling off mid-flight), the closeups of the deployed pods had to be shot using a scale model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*I\u0027ve seen gas turbines that\u0027d probably have fit in the \u0022jet intakes\u0022 on Airwolf but I doubt they would have been able to deliver the thrust to weight ratio required to take a five thousand pound helicopter to the end of the runway before running out of fuel, never mind beyond the sound barrier at 70,000 feet!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, there\u0027s an idea for a sub-challenge: build a utility helicopter using the specific helicopter powerplants supplied in FS, to carry no less than two Kerbals to the island and back (so round trip range of ~65km?) while keeping the weight as low as possible.

The VTOL engines fortunately have a semi-automatic hover capability that can be set up with some work and a bunch of action groups, which make it easy to maintain altitude until you are stationary, so you can plop down the last 10 or so meters straight down. With that admittedly cheat-like function, I probably could land on that building. I did land on a mountaintop with a landing zone about twice its size at least, though I don\u0027t have a screenshot of that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can achieve both altitude points if you allow the use of its jets.

Once you get high enough and have some turbojets at their prime altitude, things like \u0022wings\u0022 or \u0022rotors\u0022 are merely shiny and unnecessary toys, admittedly, and you can just scream along the edges of the sky with a brick for all it matters, so long as said brick is pointed at the proper angle and has necessary torque to maintain that heading (my brick does with loads to spare, and is the only \u0022plane\u0022 I\u0027ve ever flown that can just pull a 90-degree turn at 20km cruise speeds and not give a crap about it).
