Dunno quite how that would work, or even if it would, since I\u0027ve never tried anything like that except for my airlaunch (which was a mid suborbital from 66km and straight up, landing my plane then back up to circularise the missile in orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MavisLenya","CreatedById":119656,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-25T14:01:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all I would like to say that it is possible to do it fully stock(i have done it but struggling with landing it back on kerbin) so no need for KAS or FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand secondly when i meant with glider was that the first craft will pull the second craft to orbit then decouple them then the second craft will use its rockets to go to the mun orbit and get back. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have nearly completed the challange and i would like other people to do it as well\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E..Mavis..\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
