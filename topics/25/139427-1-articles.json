So I am asking if anyone has made a sky hook in the game like on the Wikipedia page sky hooks. If it is possible I would like a challenge to see it done all mods are allowed but no cheats in the game from the debug console minimum required orbit is\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0for the low\u00A070\u002B km and 100km for the high.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xoknight","CreatedById":80283,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-10T05:22:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAir resistance would kick in once you hit the atmosphere at 69km (atmosphere ends at 69km, there\u0027s no air above that so jets don\u0027t work) and\u00A0it would also be impossible due to the air intakes not being able to intake enough air due to such thin atmosphere making keeping a stable orbit impossible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FungusForge","CreatedById":148313,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-10T05:54:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSadly, due to things, planets have a set atmosphere height.

A similar but scaled back concept of simply flinging kerbals to get places sounds fun and is absolutely in the realm of possibility.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScale\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs I understand, the biggest things you can build in KSP are on the order of 1km. Beyond that they tend to shake themselves apart from phantom forces. The recent 1.1 update has made things even more wiggly, so I suspect a 30km is too big. As I understand it, wiggles can be better managed using a mod called TWEAKSCALE to simply scale your structures bigger while using fewer parts. Less parts means less joints to wiggle. Also, I remember KSP\u0027s physics being limited to 2.25km, though I\u0027m not sure if that\u0027s been increased.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpinning up\u003Cbr\u003E\nKeeping things spinning can be a challenge due to KSP\u0027s \u0027feature\u0027 to stop rotations when on-rails time warping or changing focus to look at something else. It would need to be spun up each time you want to use it. KSP has also historically been very liberal about what direction you left your craft pointing, so manuevering might be an issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSmaller but still interesting?\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe can make long (100-200m) spinning structures with pods on the ends for transferring payloads (kerbals) between planets through the propellant-less art of flinging. I\u0027m imagining a momentum tether in low orbit around Ike. You could put a Kerbal inside, spin it up, tell the Kerbal to EVA and laugh as it transfers him/her to your intended destination. From a low (13km) Ike orbit (LIO), you could perform the following transfers: LIO to Duna reentry (130m/s), LIO to interplanetary 3:4 resonant orbit for gravity assist (250m/s I think?), LIO to vertical landing on Ike (340m/s), LIO to Kerbin reentry (500m/s). If this seems interesting, let me know and I can help you formalize it into a challenge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn any case, thanks for imagining a challenge! It can be hard to find the right balance between awesomeness and practicality. I\u0027ve had troubles with it, too! Keep enjoying kerbals, poking around the forums and asking questions- it gets easier pretty quick!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Buzz light fear","CreatedById":163921,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-10T12:28:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for your input I was just wondering if the idea was possible and I was thinking that the ship could be short as long as it scooped air from the upper reaches of the atmospher and to reduce the drag the thing would spin because one end would be moving slow like a wheel rolling over the ground and that end in the atmosphere would scoop air.
