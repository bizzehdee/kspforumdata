It would have been less draggy to orient them prograde-retrograde but this would have likely lead to asymmetric thrust due to how jet engines behave. In case there was any asymmetric thrust being generated during this flight, it was applied in the direction that least affects its flight. The wings have a 5 degree angle of incidence. The optimal would probably be lower but I was in a hurry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJunos were chosen because jets have the best EC/s to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E/s ratios. I believe the Goliath has a waaaay better ratio. The Juno is one of the worst jets.

Assuming it uses all of its fuel and the efficiency doesn\u0027t increase, that would be a mass fraction of 0.47485 and a range of 3770km, for a theoretical score of 1790.13.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI find it amusing that the propellers are producing a few times more thrust than the jets are while just running off of the jets alternators.
