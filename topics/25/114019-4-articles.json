Whatever works for you. For me, the badge is fun but trivial. I mostly look forward to the really cool rocket planes that will likely emerge. Now we may start to see craft that truly are \u0022hypersonic\u0022 (Mach 5.5 \u002B). \\*cue flight of the valkyries music\\* Will the fastest craft utilize the fringes of the atmosphere as an aerodynamic grappling hook to achieve tremendous speed during their sub orbital trajectories without slinging themselves into escape from kerbin while seeking the fastest return to KSC? Will they simply shove through the thin air for the sheer purpose of optimizing the shortness of the overall distance traveled, balancing this with speed? Will they use the upper air for a more efficient hybrid design that somehow makes use of the air for additional thrust? Will someone find a way to exit the atmosphere entirely and take advantage of the vacuum of space to mount an incredibly fast course in their journey back to KSC on the equatorial or polar geometric plane? Will they take advantage of the new propulsion liberties to get crazy down below 30 km altitude and pull off a feat there? I think the diversity of possibilities is great.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T22:16:56Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 10:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MunGazer**"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T22:24:30Z","Content":"We could either do both, or have a vote.

I went back and reviewed the rules again and although it may not have blatantly said no refueling (unless I missed it) I kind of figured it wouldn\u0027t qualify as an official entrant.

BUT, I forgot to throttle down and exploded spectacularly at about 16000 m altitude. Then I started making little adjustments (trying to add drogue chutes and/or airbrakes, looking into lower drag lifting surfaces, etc.) and somehow only managed to get myself to where I could hardly exceed 1680 and couldn\u0027t get my fuel consumption low enough to make it all the way. \n\nI still prefer to use mid-body intakes.
