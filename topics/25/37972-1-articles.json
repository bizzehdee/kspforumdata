Now, credit where it\u0027s due, my dad technically made an SSTO. That takes an hour to get into orbit. That\u0027s not what this is about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is about whether or not you can make a ship with this engine where I simply launch it with MechJeb, and then at 22,500 meters, I deploy any equipped solar panels. (Based on testing that\u0027s the lowest you can safely deploy panels at.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngine Download: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./?b30rgmuqdq4weks\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELinkzorz\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EList of Rules:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENo clever tricks like \u0022You have to stay at 8 m/s vertical speed until 5,000m and then increase to 20 m/s\u0022.
