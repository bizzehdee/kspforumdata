He built a \u0027walker\u0027 once and it\u0027s feet were just girders. It had a real hard time walking across the Mun. Nooooo traction.\n\nHere\u0027s what I can tell you. Certain parts have \u0027brakes\u0027 and not just wheels. Landing legs have brakes that are always \u0027on\u0027. Anything that has brakes will create the \u0027friction\u0027 you\u0027re looking for. Anything that doesn\u0027t have brakes, will tend to slide across the surface.\n\nI know this intimately from walker design. Which, is why all of my walkers have landing legs for toes.\n\nThough it\u0027ll significantly increase your part count, putting landing legs on the outside of your \u0027wheels\u0027 will give you what you seek. But take care. If you get the angle wrong and slam them down on the surface... they splode.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-14T20:43:40Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2015 08:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist**"},{"CreatedByName":"turkwinif","CreatedById":84592,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T01:37:33Z","Content":"I couldn\u0027t help but notice that Moho doesn\u0027t have its own \u0022Circumnavigator\u0022 flair yet.

I used the full suspension for my manual-controlled rides at the poles. And a flatter one for the plains. At 4X warp, the suspension system will generate its own bumps so you don\u0027t want it too high.\n\nAnother thing I found out is that if you activate SAS stabilisation on mechjeb\u0027s rover autopilot, it will brake to keep you aligned \u0026 under your target speed.
