The circumference of Kerbin is 3,769,911m. Your distance is showing 3,939,677. That distance is very consistent with one circumnavigation. Kerbin rotates in the direction you were travelling meaning, the distance would be even further than 3,700km. In 2 hours, it rotates 628km. So, somewhere around 4,300km would be a reasonable distance. I could buy the 3,900 if it were one, but how did you get two circumnavigations? I\u0027m not saying you didn\u0027t mind you. I\u0027ve already seen some strange numbers coming from these flights. It just doesn\u0027t make sense though. Now if you managed an average of say 1,100m/s over 2 hours that would be 7,900km which does make sense for 2 circumnavigations. I\u0027m just curious why the F3 is showing something very different.\n\u003E The time for the speed you were travelling, that sounds about right. That F3 screen has me breaking out the calculator tho. Did you perhaps F5/F9?\n\nI think i figured it out, if you take the distance of the flight taken as a circumference and get the radius, it comes out to 627019, which just so happens to be 27,000 meters above the surface of kerbin, even though i flew at 22,500m you could easily add some distance for variations in flight. pilot assistant had a tendency to be a few tenths of a degree off, which after two circumnavigations could add up. \n\nAnyways, just a thought.\n\nStill working on my entry for velocity circumnavigation."},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T21:42:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I think i figured it out, if you take the distance of the flight taken as a circumference and get the radius, it comes out to 627019, which just so happens to be 27,000 meters above the surface of kerbin, even though i flew at 22,500m you could easily add some distance for variations in flight. pilot assistant had a tendency to be a few tenths of a degree off, which after two circumnavigations could add up. \n\u003E Anyways, just a thought.\n\u003E \n\u003E Still working on my entry for velocity circumnavigation.\n\nCorrect. But you made 2 circumnavigations. So, you divide that by 2. Your first lap shows you traveled some 1,900km. If you take that as the circumference you\u0027ll get a radius of 300ish km.

You\u0027ve both been added to the leaderboard.\n\nAt the moment, I have no plans to do far or allow any other mods that change the physics of the game or add parts and there\u0027s a reason.\n\nThe circumnavigation challenges, both Flix\u0027s and mine, have the new pilot in mind. I recall when I first started trying to fly aircraft, it took me days just to get one to the end of the runway without crashing. Flix\u0027s challenge was one of the first ones I completed, though I wasn\u0027t even trying at the time. His challenge spoke to me because I didn\u0027t need anything that KSP didn\u0027t provide. It was a \u0027level playing field\u0027 that I could participate in, even for me, a new pilot. For challenges designed for both old players experimenting with new designs and new players creating their first global capable aircraft, keeping that \u0027playing field\u0027 level is something I consider important. While stock physics may still be boring to you FAR pilots, there are gobs of challenges out there for FAR, NEAR and loads of other physics mods. And you\u0027re free to start one using FAR if you wish.

Our trademark engine housing also ensures a smooth experience by directing noise away from the cockpit and helps keep the engines below melting point in flight. While we won\u0027t say it is a simple construction, it is almost completely organic and contains only minimal part clipping. We also included a handy parachute for more convenient parking. Oh, and it also has global range, with full circumnavigation times as low as **41:44**\n\nTo fly, the first tumbler switch toggles the engines, the third tumbler opens and closes the engine housing, and the tenth tumbler is for alternative parachute activation. As usual, we included extra tumblers for showing off, because nothing says \u0027pro\u0027 like flicking tumblers.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I\u0027ve been extremely tied up with Assetto Corsa. You know, the whole turbojet vs rapier thing is kind of seeming to me like it\u0027s turning into a Ford vs Chevy thing haha. Juz, I\u0027ve looked at some of your other stuff and just the sheer handle you have on these data tools is amazing. One of the reasons I\u0027ve only messed with stock is I haven\u0027t committed to learning those tools yet. The more I think about doing an in - depth analysis of what the optimum application specific ascent profile would be, the more I begin to think those tools will make the process much more painless. It could be sort of a compromise between the Ricky Bobby testing method and getting a math degree. Even when optimally piloted, I\u0027m certain my craft won\u0027t approach an average speed anywhere close to 1,573 m/s during a circumnav. At this point, I\u0027m interested not only in finding the best ascent and descent profiles in this context, but also an objective and thorough comparative analysis of rapier and turbojet engines. The question remains... given the \u0022most expertly designed craft and usage\u0022 for either engine, which of those two dream craft would perform better in this application? What about a hybrid? Thus far, I\u0027d lean toward the rapiers having the upper hand, but I still have a healthy respect for turbojet potential and haven\u0027t viewed it as being inferior before. I just didn\u0027t look hard enough for a good turbojet set up.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-27T00:52:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2015 12:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MunGazer**"},{"CreatedByName":"juzeris","CreatedById":139480,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T18:40:24Z","Content":"Well, to be fair, the turbojet was strictly better than the rapier before 1.0. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Things change, however, and since it is actually not a very hard question, let\u0027s try to answer which is better and when. Starting from the simpler aspects:\n\n- The Turbojet (1.8t) is slightly lighter than the Rapier (2.0t), but the difference is not very significant for atmospheric vessels, where drag dominates the speed equation and not mass. It might become more significant for a Nerva powered SSTO where the Rapier rocket mode is not used, not sure.\n- The Turbojet has an alternator (it generates electricity), while the Rapier does not.\n- The Rapier has a back stack mounting point, while the Turbojet does not. The uses are limited to shenanigans, because otherwise it would block the engine, but, personally, I often end up using it.\n- The Rapier seems to generate slightly less drag (1.299081 0.9353406) than the Turbojet (1.275294 0.9736242), I haven\u0027t tested this though, the data comes from [this post](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122595-Some-rough-test-results-with-different-nosecones?p=1966634\u0026viewfull=1#post1966634).\n- The Turbojet has a better fuel efficiency (Isp 8000) than the Rapier (Isp 6400) for a given thrust level. I calculate that as using 80% of the fuel a Rapier would use. Both jets are still very fuel efficient however. (Credit to Red Iron Crown for correcting this ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) )\n- The Turbojet uses a higher proportion of air to fuel (15:1 vs 12:1), this may or may not mean more intakes producing more drag for a given level of thrust, depending on your design.\n- I cannot really comment with any authority on the thermodynamics of the engines, the parameters seem fairly similar and they both appear to produce a similar level of heat for a given thrust level.\n- And, of course, most importantly, engine power - it is calculated as thrust\\*velocity coefficient\\*atmospheric coefficient, where thrust for the Turbojet is 180 and 140 for the Rapier. Of course, the coefficients are the interesting part. These are saved as curves in the .cfg files in your KSP directory, but for simplicity I\u0027ve rendered them into graphs below.\n\nLet\u0027s start with the atmospheric coefficient. The graph below shows the relation between the coefficient and atmospheric pressure. The relation is logarithmic, however I could not figure out how to make my graph logarithmic, so apologies. According to the wiki converting between pressure and altitude is not as straightforward as it used to be, but it [includes a handy table](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Kerbin#Atmosphere). From the graph we see the Turbojet has a better coefficient up until about 0.08, which, based on the table, is somewhere a bit below 15km altitude, and the Rapier stays significantly above the Turbojet the rest of the way.\n\nTurbojet is red, Rapier is green.\n\n\u003E ![J3bO6y6.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/J3bO6y6.jpg)\n\nNext up, the velocity coefficient. I\u0027ve scaled the graph to adjust for the Turbojet\u0027s higher thrust, it\u0027s easier to look at that way. The speed is in Mach, and I believe the conversion to m/s varies with altitude, but a general assumption of about 300m/s per Mach at 20-25km should hold. Here we see the Rapier overtakes the Turbojet at somewhere a bit below Mach 2.\n\nTurbojet is... grey? Rapier is green.\n\n\u003E ![mhapTTQ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/mhapTTQ.jpg)\n\n**Conclusion/tl;dr:** The Rapier appears to be strictly better in terms of performance when flying above 15km and over 600m/s, which should be most of the cases when you actually care about the engine type.\n\nThe turbojet has the benefit of being more fuel efficient, but you\u0027ll probably make up for the efficiency to some extent by going higher and faster where you need less thrust and the journey is shorter (by time).\n\nPlease let me know if I got something wrong somewhere. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nSources and tools: game files, the KSP curve tool by MuMech, Gimp, and a calculator.

I\u0027m sure many people will find it helpful, including myself, having all that information relevant to engineering the highest speed and altitude aircraft compiled into one place. I think one of the most important things you mentioned for me or for anyone to keep in mind is that drag dominates the speed equation more than mass in this context. Of course, there are several ways to do a circumnav and not everyone is trying to be the fastest, but for those that want to have lots of nifty extra features on their craft and be the fastest at the same time, or set a lofty air speed goal, one may have a lot of difficulty having his cake and eating it too, at least at some point anyway. Interestingly, when adding mass, that will at some point require more lift, which in turn will create more drag, etc. The cold, hard numbers are right there in the config and we can\u0027t design our own jet engines. Whoa.... how cool would that be? ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif). How about it, squad?
