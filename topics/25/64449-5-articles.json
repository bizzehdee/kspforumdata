So I designed my spaceplane on the aeris 3a, the most successful aeri in production. The Aeris 4A RedoNE is able to get to LKO and dock to 2 kinds of docking ports, since it has 2 of them. It is extremely stable, but at high altitude you need to pull up slightly or it won\u0027t go to space. Does not have front brake disabled because the center of mass is very fae back, thus not letting much weight on the front wheel. it is a very capable craft in and out of the atmosphere, but cant go to other places without refueling, because i felt it didn\u0027t need to go to minmus or the mun as a stock learning craft.

One problem the Aeris 4A has when docking is that its vertical stabilizer can get in the way, so my vertical stabilizers are placed on the wingtips where they should be less of an issue.

The landing gear are placed further back to protect the engine on takeoff. This means you have to be going faster to lift off the ground (120 m/s), but don\u0027t worry - you can still land very slowly (\u0026gt;40 m/s when empty, \u0026gt;75 m/s when full).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause this craft weighs just 10.5 tons (compared to 18.5 tons for the Aeris 4A), it only needs one jet engine to get it into orbit. That jet engine is powerful enough to allow you to climb vertically into orbit. If you want to go to Minmus and return, you need to climb at an angle to save on fuel, however. Having one jet engine prevents flat spins and even with two RAM air intakes, you can get a high apoapsis on the turbojet alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you run out of intake air, the Starlon uses two 47-RS engines to provide thrust.

A new pilot should be able to get it into orbit just fine. While it can do a return trip to Minmus, that\u0027s mainly for demonstration purposes only (to show how much fuel it has). I mean, if you can go to Minmus with it, then surely you can get into orbit with it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Aeris 4A\u0027s RCS thrusters are kind of placed in random locations and cause a lot of unwanted rotation when translating. I used the RCS Build Aid mod to place my RCS to ensure there was as little rotation as possible. Additionally, the docking port is placed right over the center of mass to make docking as easy as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of the center of mass, according to RCS Build Aid, the total shift between the wet and dry COM is only 0.02 meters! Practically nothing. Of course, that\u0027s assuming that all the monopropellant and fuel is used up. If the fuel is used up but the monopropellant remains, the COM shifts forward. If the monopropellant is used up and fuel remains, it shifts backward. Even in these circumstances, the shift isn\u0027t much and is not enough to render the craft unstable. The center of lift is always behind the COM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing to mention is the fuel lines.
