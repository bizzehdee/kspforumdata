They weigh a lot, produce a fair bit of power, but require refueling on average within a year in space depending on reactor load. Though I feel it would be too frowned upon, so it\u0027ll likely be some Gigantor panels on a cluster. Not that the core module needs a lot of power production, it just helps to always have power available when necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"700NitroXpress","CreatedById":90322,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T19:46:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EQuiana, the mods you have listed all look fine to me from what little I know about them.

It\u0027s going to be interesting to streamline and test it, as I have a few ideas how to narrow the profile down, but it essentially is a \u0027puller\u0027 type tug.

Then the central stack has a docking port going down, allowing it to mount a \u0027train\u0027 attachment behind it.
