I\u0027ll post below an album of one I flew with for about 2 hours real time, making around 4 hours at 2x time compression. I had ot take breaks. No wonder airlines use two pilots! I was going to go for a high aspect ratio wing but by mostly using the FAR static analysis , it ended up becoming something like an airliner hybrid. In retrospect I\u0027ll not put wings low for long distance planes especially if they have elevators way back, it was very maneuverable but hard to trim for long distance flight with adjusted elevator travel and FAR DCA at 66. I think FAR DCA and assists were doing a great job considering that this particular design had the trillion battery banks causing a lot of flexing wobble that needed struts to compensate compared to solid fuselage. Cool idea about kethane and other sources of energy, that\u0027s probably a good practical solution for long distance flight power backup if kethane is so lightweight. I liked the idea of that generator but never actually knew what to do with it until that suggestion. But solar-only makes it a different challenge being reliant on the sunlight only. Especially like I found out flying east! I was not chasing the sun and hoped my batteries would last. They didn\u0027t, I got about 66-75% of the way until I got into daylight, and at such a slow average speed of about 148 m/s, part of the suspense was waiting and hoping the sun would rise while I seemed to float along!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought I would look for a landmass around 15% energy to land and wait for daylight since I knew I wouldn\u0027t make it at about 1:50 in.

My plane could fly with TWR 0.21 (or maybe lower, I think VOID is not always accurate with these particular electric engines?) But I think the takeoff TWR would need to be higher. Big disadvantages from ion are low thrust and much higher energy consumption. I\u0027ll play with the kethoelectric generator and/or a nuclear generator but I doubt even that will help much. Who knows. Also not perpetual since xenon fuel is needed. The energy requirements for a ~0.114 TWR quick test I did with 13 normal ion engines are extremely high at more than 100 energy per second with a xenon-tank to ion engine ratio of 1:2.
