The most you could possibly get out of it is about 2000 km, but if you consume 900 units of fuel to get there, you\u0027d barely beat a helicopter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScoring for multple Kerbals:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you choose to bring multiple Kerbals, any dying or being accidentally stranded immedietely disqualifies that run.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach Kerbal adds 20% more to your score, E.G., a 2-passenger vehicle gets a score of 120% normal, and an 8-passenger vehicle, gets one 240% normal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy only 20%? because Kerbals only carpool or take mass transit 20% of the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is assumed that oxidized is cheap enough to get in mass quantity for basically free and in an environmentally friendly way, and therefore is of no concern (besides extra weight) to the fuel efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESubmissions should include a picture at launch with the resources tab open, a picture of vertical take-off occuring, a few pictures in flight, a picture mid-landing (remember, vertical landing, I will be highly skeptical if there is a jet trail behind you and you are moving at 45 m/s.) a picture landed with the resources tab open, and a picture of the flight statistics screen showing how far you flew over land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBonus points if you land somewhere impressive like on a mountain top!
