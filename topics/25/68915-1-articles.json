You need to land on the Mun with the new SLS styled parts for propulsion. No other forms of propulsion is allowed (RCS is allowed, but let\u0027s face it - you\u0027re only going to need it for control and that\u0027s all it\u0027s allowed for). Only one docking is allowed - whether it\u0027s a rescue mission or something that resembles the constellation mission. If you choose the second one, then a rescue mission is not allowed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESCORING:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-You\u0027ll start off with 5,000 points\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-You get 100 more points for every kerbal you bring\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Plating a flag will get you another 10 points\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Getting a cool screenshot will get you a judged amount of points (the cooler, the better)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-For every hour after launch, you loose 100 points\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-A rescue mission will add to your overall time\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-If you don\u0027t return, then for every kerbal that has to suffer, you loose 200 points\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Any cheats will cost you 100 points. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know it\u0027s not the best challenge ever, but I thought it would be \u0027Ok-ish\u0027. I have managed to get to the mun using only SLS parts, however I did not manage to return. I will put my own entry in when I\u0027ve managed to return.
