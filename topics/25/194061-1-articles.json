In securing the lowest bid, the administration have agreed with the private providers that all payloads must be constrained to no greater size than a CRG-04 (the small Mk2 cargo bay), though multiple, separate,\u00A0CRG-04 payloads may be launched in pursuit of a mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChallenge #1 Launcher\u00A0Bid\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are the\u00A0bidder, and your mission is to meet the particulars of the bid by designing and building a CRG-04 payload capable craft for the lowest ongoing cost.

Your mission cost will include recovery costs, so it is likely that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E designs will be efficient, but you should also confirm the largest dummy payload that you can carry, and which must be \u003Cstrong\u003Eat least 2.5T\u003C/strong\u003E (though\u00A0payloads higher than 3.5T\u00A0will net the executives a performance bonus, so they are applying some hints that you should do that if you can). While the bidding process calls for cheap payload-to-orbit submissions, Jeb is on the committee and doesn\u0027t want to be seen flying anything \u0022uncool\u0022 (his words, not mine), so see what you can do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChallenge #2 Payload Bid\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, and are trying to persuade the administration to sign off your mission.

You may take any number of CRG-04 payloads (each of which must\u00A0be assembled in orbit), and weight is not explicitly limited, but part offset is, as follows\u003C/strong\u003E: you can offset\u00A0but must not overlap any parts of significance (as defined by their mission-critical resource/functional usage - purely decorative parts may be offset freely) to any obvious degree (e.g. you could move a docking port *slightly\u0022 into its\u00A0connecting part, but not so much that the visible section of the port itself became\u00A0obscured). Being publicly funded cost is no object (!), and proposed missions will be presented by location, with the most prestigious\u00A0(and/or inventive) mission plans rising to the top of the list.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFull bids, combining challenge 1 and 2 are encouraged, but not required.
