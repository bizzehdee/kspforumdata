Will try to upload them shortly.\n\nHere\u0027s a rundown of my design\u0027s performance...\n\n- Meets all Basic Requirements\n\n(Remark: \u0022*The Bomber must be able to drop this payload safely, without any damage being inflicted on the airframe. Collisions between bombs, such that parts of the payload are destroyed during drop, should be avoided.*\u0022 -- I can drop 5 of my 6 internally stored bombs safely, but number 5 tends to explode against the rear edge of the cargo bay due to \u0022physics\u0022. No harm is done to the airframe of the bomber as per requirements. I beg the judges look upon me favourably in this regard. If this counts as a failure then I voluntarily disqualify my design.\n\n6 bombs internally stored, no other ordnance. This is a minimalist approach!\n\nBonus points:\n\n**Swift payback: 155m/s at 3000m altitude = 15.5 points**\n\n**Part maintenance: 120 parts = -2.4 points**\n\n**Gentle giant:** I\u0027m not sure about how to measure this but I\u0027 used the navball to get damn close to 5 degrees as far as I can tell. I\u0027ll try to show this in the screenshots. Potentially **\u002B20 points**\n\n**Engine maintenance: 4 turbojets = -16 points**\n\n**Service ceiling:** Hell yeah! this thing **burns red** at 12000 metres! **\u002B12 points**\n\nShortly after beginning to get seriously hot while hauling ^$$ at 18000, the ship gets highly unstable and performs an unscheduled dissassembly. Spectacular.\n\nAssuming my screenshots are acceptable, I calculate my score to be **29.1**. Feeble! But I had fun getting there.\n\nMy time for the bombing mission on the eastern peninsula was 35 minutes, but I can\u0027t prove that since I went EVA to prove the ladders worked - thus losing my flight time. Meh, wasn\u0027t competitive anyway.\n\nWill upload images when I work out how...\n\nThis challenge is hugely enjoyable. Highly challenging and very satisfying to complete, even if the end result isn\u0027t very competitive.\n\nI wonder if one could argue that a low starting weight could add a few points. My starting weight was 41,852KG all up with bombs and fuel.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-20T22:15:19Z\u0022 title=\u002203/20/2015 10:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by wossname**"},{"CreatedByName":"Ens Gijs","CreatedById":11410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T00:09:01Z","Content":"Ok, so it\u0027s not the most stable plane I\u0027ve ever made - had to shift fuel around and get it out of a couple of flat spins on the way back to HQ but she made it.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

The sale rep was unable to comment on actually how many FLT400 bombs the contraption can carry, but he heard someone put the amount at \u0022a lot\u0022, \u0022we got a bulk discount\u0022 and \u0022160\u0022. The number of engines is put at 9 times 5, however many that is, and the number of parts is \u0022less than one thousand, and maybe less than eight hundred\u0022.\n\nReporter Soiree Kerman managed to get hands on these photos from a test flight:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Made it just to test how far can it go in response to the 100 bombs challenge.\n\nAwesome looking craft everyone and thanks for the challenge, Aanker, looking at everyone\u0027s entries I wish my natural instinct wasn\u0027t \u0022let\u0027s just slap on some wings *somewhere*\u0022. Still a long way to go. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAlso, for dropped bombs hitting the airframe, the problem is the aircraft maintaining speed while the bombs are slowed down by the atmosphere, and the aircraft rams them. Personally, I solve it by having all the engines bound to an action group (1 and 2 in this craft) and turning them off (and letting the speed drop a bit) while bombing, cutting throttle does not work so well because jets take a while to spin down (action groups go around this somehow)."},{"CreatedByName":"gigaboom2","CreatedById":112218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T23:32:15Z","Content":"I wish that I could make a ship like that.

So the competition is still on. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThough right now I\u0027m planning to try to make something VTOL. Of all my attempts I have made only one airplane with jet-based take-off which successfully transitioned to horizontal flight (not counting jet-engine rockets), and that one didn\u0027t land successfully. So not sure how that\u0027ll go...\n\nEDIT: Also, considering there are no VTOL designs yet, I\u0027d think it might need some extra incentives, and it wouldn\u0027t even affect any of the previous entries. For example something like \u0022Advanced Flashy Technology: \u002B17/\u002B7 (instead of \u002B12/\u002B5) extra bomb bonus if a VTOL bomber can drop all of its payload while hovering mid-air on jet engines (less than 8 m/s surface speed before drop?).\u0022\n\nThis would amount to a bonus of \u002B40% and would be in line with \u002B30 points for normal VTOL on the first 6 bombs, though, if that feels too much, half that would probably make sense as well. I think a scaling bonus would make sense, as it\u0027s one of the two bonus objectives which require additional equipment in the design of the aircraft, thus essentially presenting a multiplier to the bomb weight. (The other being space bomber.)\n\nI\u0027m not sure if it should make an allowance for non-winged craft, but those probably wouldn\u0027t be \u0022bombers\u0022.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-23T02:12:11Z\u0022 title=\u002203/23/2015 02:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by juzeris**"}]}
