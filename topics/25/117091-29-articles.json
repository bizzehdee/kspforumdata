(just go easy on the amount of stuff you place).\n\nAt the very least, this will allow for battles on winter, or ocean, or wherever else! But bear in mind some flight characteristics can change slightly when flying at cold places.\n\nAnother idea that I had was actually making this a war, I thought about this before but it was impossible without Vessel Mover.\n\nIt resumes to battles around the globe where winning at a certain place \u0022conquers\u0022 it.\n\nSince we would have more frequent battles (thanks again, Vessel Mover), we could go wild with the possibilities of something like this.\n\nBut the most important part is that first of all I really need everybody to be able to build an airplane that is at least decent.\n\nThat is why I am going to pick up my old FAR tutorial project and continue it, I will make a video about how to build basic subsonic airplanes as soon as the next version of BAD-T drops, on the time you will have to build your airplanes.\n\nOf course I will give some extra time for those who will rely on my tutorials to do it.\n\nAnd no I am not a native english speaker, I did not finish such tutorials before exactly because of my accent, but now I will do it anyway.\n\nI may also make a few example craft for you to test against when building yours.\n\nAbout the final battle of the ongoing tournament, oh boy that is going to be amazing.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-09T03:59:46Z\u0022 title=\u002211/09/2015 03:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tetryds**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-09T10:02:50Z","Content":"I like all of those ideas but the use of AJE. The main problem with AJE is that the Aerosport is really underpowered with it and it changes the diameters of other engines, so it\u0027s not possible to use them with stock fuel tanks.
