TOURNAMENT:**\n\n[table=width: 650, align: center]\n\n[tr]\n\n[td]The tournament consists on 2x2 World War 2 themed airplane battles, the airplanes will fight against each other while being controlled by BDArmory\u0027s AI.\n\nThe airplanes do not have to be replicas nor resemble real aircraft, but the weapons and engines allowed will have similar performance to those from the second world war.\n\nEvery class will have it\u0027s own leaderboard, making this a three-in-one challenge.\n\nThe \u0022Hall of Fame\u0022 will be made to display the most unique airplane designs, as well as the top performing ones.\n\nEvery victory scores your airplane one point.\n\nAfter a certain amount of losses, your entry is eliminated.\n\nYou score per class, it is the highest achieved score on the class, be it ongoing or from an already eliminated craft.\n\nThe crafts will be spawned close to the KSC, their orientation varies.\n\nThe greater winner of each class will have a chance to compete on the next class with an engine boost, earning two extra points per victory per class distance (biplane pwns jet = 4 points).\n\nGoing to a higher class instantly puts your craft on the hall of fame, and losing on a higher tier does not eliminate the craft.\n\nAfter being the overall winner on the Jet class the airplane will be matched against three opponent jets.[/td]\n\n[/tr]\n\n[/table]\n\n**CLASSES:**\n\n[table=width: 650, align: center]\n\n[tr]\n\n[td]There will be three classes: Biplanes, Piston Monoplanes and Jets.\n\nEach class has it\u0027s own setup of weapons and engines.\n\n**Biplanes:**\n\nHave two main wings.\n\nAllowed engine(s): 1x A7 Aerosport @50.5% Max Thrust.\n\nAllowed weapon(s): ShKAS / Breda-SAFAT / M1917 Browning\n\nWeapon points: 10\n\nOpen cockpits.\n\nDifficulty: Hard\n\n**Piston Monoplanes:**\n\nHave one single main wing.\n\nAllowed engine(s): 2x A7 Aerosport @100% Max Thrust. / 1x D-25 Radial @80% Max Thrust / 1x PT100 Turboprop @36% Max Thrust\n\nAllowed weapon(s): ShKAS / Breda-SAFAT / Browning M2 / BerezinUBS / Hispanio-Suiza .404 / MauserMG151\n\nWeapon points: 30\n\nCockpit setup may vary.\n\nDifficulty: Medium\n\n**Jets:**\n\nCan have any wing setup.\n\nMinimum weight and size: 5m lenght, 4 tons, width and height are free.\n\nAllowed engine(s): 2x J85 GE-4 turbojet\n\nAllowed weapon(s): ShKAS / Breda-SAFAT / Hispanio-Suiza .404 / MauserMG151 / Browning M2 / BerezinUBS / Browning M3\n\nWeapon points: 40\n\nClosed cockpits\n\nDifficulty:

the **3 best out of 5 combats**.\n\nThe airplanes will take off facing north with a 60 degree angle from each other.\n\nThe combat starts when the teams of one side are changed.\n\nIn order to win, one team must destroy all enemy aircraft.\n\nIf for some reason the airplanes flee or land safely, the battle is run again.\n\nA disabled craft is not a destroyed craft, as long as it can fly it\u0027s golden.\n\n[/td]\n\n[/tr]\n\n[/table]\n\n**MODS:**\n\n[table=width: 650, align: center]\n\n[tr]\n\n[td]**The required mods are:**\n\n-

0.8.3)**\n\n- [AJE](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/70008) **(dev version 2.3, JETS ONLY, DO NOT USE WITH PROPELLERS)**\n\n- [Special challenge pack (ww2 weapons)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/f6786txy69zaj1w/BADTWeaponsPack.zip?dl=1)\n\n**The optional mods are:**\n\n- [Adjustable Landing Gears](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99660)\n\n- [Procedural parts](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106975)\n\n- [B9 Procedural wings](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104966)\n\n**The utility mods are:**\n\n- [Take

posting a valid download link on this thread and stating that it\u0027s a submission, or sending it to me via private message, pictures are welcome.\n\n- Every player can have up to one active vessel per class.\n\n- If one craft is eliminated from the tournament, the player will be allowed to submit another craft to that class.\n\n- Submitting the same craft again is allowed but not recommended, as long as it\u0027s not abused (if your design fails, deal with it, haha.).\n\n- You can resubmit your craft until it\u0027s announced that it is going to battle.\n\n**Craft:**\n\n- Your craft must fit the definitions of it\u0027s own class and contain no more than 80 parts.\n\n- Open cockpits must be *safe*, that means that the kerbal must not be too exposed nor sit on extreme parts of the craft.\n\n- Turrets are only allowed with a kerbal *comfortably* sited behind it (no kerbal hanging on a wing or something like that).\n\n- It must fly with FAR and be able to takeoff on it\u0027s own when using the AI.\n\n- The craft must contain at least one Kerbal pilot and both BDArmory\u0027s Weapons Manager and AI module, which can be clipped anywhere.\n\n- It must not contain rocket grade parts other than max 4 fixed radiators, which are only allowed on open cockpits. (Oscar-B and the shortest 1.25m tank are exceptions)\n\n- Scientific instruments are allowed for aesthetic purposes.\n\n- When present, the cockpit reaction wheels must be turned off.\n\n- Parts can be freely clipped, as long there is no abuse and no resource stacking. (fuel tank inside fuselage is ok, fuel tank inside fuel tank is not)\n\n- When FAR updates, you will have the chance to update the settings of the AI and control surfaces of the active airplanes you already submitted.[/td]\n\n[/tr]\n\n[/table]\n\n**LEADERBOARD:**\n\n[**BRACKETS**](http://challonge.com/BADT)\n\n[table=align: center][tr][td]**Competitor:**[/td][td]**Piston Monoplane:**[/td][/tr]\n\n[tr][td]nigelxw[/td][td]Delilah Mk2a[/td][/tr]\n\n[tr][td]Phearlock[/td][td]KF-Spike 5[/td][/tr]\n\n[tr][td]Gojira[/td][td]KZ-211Z[/td][/tr]\n\n[tr][td]Darren9[/td][td]Daz Mk5[/td][/tr]\n\n[tr][td]erasmusguy[/td][td]RasTech K4U[/td][/tr]\n\n[tr][td]Azimech[/td][td]Rotzooe3.2[/td][/tr]\n\n[tr][td]Jakokidda123[/td][td]F-82 Twin Mustang[/td][/tr]\n\n[tr][td]tetryds[/td][td]Maelstorm[/td][/tr]\n\n[tr][td]Kunight[/td][td]Sanka II V2[/td][/tr]\n\n[tr][td]VentZer0[/td][td]VZ-38[/td][/tr]\n\n[tr][td]TUKE[/td][td]Dukes L-19[/td][/tr]\n\n[tr][td]qromodynmc[/td][td]deithwen 1-a[/td][/tr]\n\n[tr][td]worir4[/td][td]Speegle MkI[/td][/tr]\n\n[tr][td]sal\\_vager[/td][td]The Manx[/td][/tr]\n\n[tr][td]Alphasus[/td][td]Piston Fighter[/td][/tr]\n\n[tr][td]QuesoExplosivo[/td][td]Stinger[/td][/tr][/table]\n\n**HALL OF FAME:**\n\n**BRING IT ON!**\n\n**VZ-38**\n\n\u0022Tanking is not only about taking punches on the face, it\u0027s an art.\u0022\n\n**SO CUTE!**\n\n**Delilah Mk.2a**\n\n\u0022Shooting around and looking good.\u0022\n\n**BADGE:**\n\nAdd this participation badge to your signature!\n\nNew badges will be made for accomplishments on the future.\n\n![Um7k5lL.png](http://i.imgur.com/Um7k5lL.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"PixelStory","CreatedById":141149,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T19:16:02Z","Content":"Ok, Biplane on the way! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nalso where is the \u0022Special Challenge Pack\u0022?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-28T19:18:25Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2015 07:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PixelStory**"},{"CreatedByName":"tetryds","CreatedById":50204,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T19:18:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Ok, Biplane on the way! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nI believe that the biplanes are the hardest, haha.\n\nKeep your weight low and you don\u0027t really need a lot of fuel, nor need to go too high.\n\n**I will be giving FAR advices on this thread.**"},{"CreatedByName":"PixelStory","CreatedById":141149,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T19:23:13Z","Content":"Great.

If you don\u0027t know, the angle of attack is the angle at which your wing is hitting the airflow. \n\nIf you have a 20 degree maximum angle of attack, that means if your wing is angled 20 degrees from the direction you are actually moving, you will enter a stall.\n\n![350px-StallFormation.svg.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/StallFormation.svg/350px-StallFormation.svg.png)\n\nYou need to reduce control authority so your plane doesn\u0027t stall during turns.
