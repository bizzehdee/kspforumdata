I just wish I ended up naming the craft something more interesting!\n\nI probably should have mentioned this in the first post but, being an analogue for Saturn\u0027s moon Titan, Tekto has gravity between the Mun and Duna (roughly 75% of Duna\u0027s gravity since Titan has roughly that percentage of Mar\u0027s surface gravity) and an atmosphere 50% thicker than Kerbins! Again, this is analogous to Titan which is obscured by thick clouds covering the entire surface.

I believe there are two things that might disqualify it, but I\u0027m not sure. It took a long dang time, so here it is anyway.\n\nPotential Disqualifiers:\n\n1. I switched control from the spaceplane to the docking target for alignment purposes\n2. Once docked, .03 units of RCS fuel got used from the lander can on the target by SAS before I switched off RCS. I didn\u0027t take on any fuel, so I\u0027m not sure if this matters.\n\nKestrel launched into a 100km orbit, then made a few burns to rendezvous with the target can (put into orbit just for this purpose) at 75km. Inside the can, Sherman Kerman awaits rescue. I ran out of mixed fuel at the rendezvous, and was on monoprop engines (have four installed for sufficient power) alone, along with the thruster blocks. It was enough to dock and recover Sherman, but I ran totally out on the de-orbiting burn. This actually worked to my benefit as I would have come up a lot shorter if I had finished the burn. Once back in the atmosphere the Kestrel has a ~200 unit surplus of liquid fuel for returning to base, and I used a little over half of that to land.\n\nIt\u0027s worth noting that the craft was not designed to do any of this, I built it to do suborbital hops to the poles. I just slapped a docking port on the top and gave it the old college try. The craft is all stock with the exception of the heavy landing gear from the Kerbal Aircraft Expansion mod. \n\n\u0022Kestrel\u0022\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

The gatecrasher section lists all those who broke the rules or did not complete the challenge and the lack of awards plus measured quip matches the disregard for the challenge rules and helps make the distinction between successfully completing the challenge and not, without the harshness of exclusion at the hands of a tyrannical martinet (me) based on completely made up rules (K-Prize), which is no fun and is unnecessary in a game like this with such a well mannered and thoughtful community.

Nicely done and welcome to the K-Prize party guest list. btw I didnt list the Kestrel because it wasnt shown landing, however if it has landed successfully then say so as the mission would deserve the highly regarded Advanced Pilot precision 1st Class.\n\nThanks all and good luck with release 1.0.0. Looks like it will be a lot of fun and change the spaceplane game considerably, so the K-Prize guest list will need a new section.
