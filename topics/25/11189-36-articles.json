I like to place it right behind the cockpit so it comes far in front of the center of mass.\n\nMake sure you have at least 2 action groups. One for your jet engines and one for your rocket engine and turn your engines on and off before you hit the \u0022stage\u0022 button (spacebar) at launch. Then use the jet engine action group to turn on your jet engines. When it\u0027s time to shift, use your action groups to turn engines on/off without touching your throttle.\n\nI suggest using the LV-T30 Rocket engine as it is light, powerful and has good isp in vacuum.\n\nUse 2 jet engines, 1 LV-T30 and make sure to use fuel lines to funnel fuel between tanks.

Any design tips?\n\nPartly the air intake which limits altitude and therefore top speed on aero engines (atmospheric drag is on a log scale of some kind relative to altitude, you can go a lot faster higher up) but nukes are very hard to lift, a pair of the smaller engines like the LV-909s work much better around a single aeroengine SSTO. [example](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/11214-The-K-Prize-100-reusable-spaceplane-to-orbit-and-back?p=557403\u0026viewfull=1#post557403) This layout has the advantage that all air goes to one aero engine and if it flames out\\* it wont spin the craft like dual aero / single rocket layouts. You will find it easier if you can add at least a couple of radial air scoops in a suitably aesthetic location. If not then consider a pair of T30 rockets as you will have to make up more altitude and speed with the rockets. They have 2.5x the weight but 4.3x the maximum power of the 909 but you will need to lift more rocket fuel in the first place. Air intake is pretty critical and we don\u0027t have anything which approximates a supersonic ramjet yet so I use radials and hidden arrays, but that example has no hidden parts and works fine.\n\n\\*One tip is to reduce throttle as air become insufficient as this reduces the demand for air and allows the aero engine to continue working at reduced power at higher altitudes. If you cut throttle 20% and then wait it will usually reignite.\n\nWhen building the craft relative location of lift and mass centers is critical, lift behind mass. But then it flies like a paper plane with a lump of blue tack on the nose and just nose dives unless you have attitude control surfaces far enough back from the center of mass that it gives leverage to overcome attitude droop. The further apart the lift and mass centers the more downward torque mass creates. Its all about leverage. Same goes for the undercarriage, place the rearmost pair just behind the center of mass so the plane can tilt back using the leverage of the control surfaces, if the wheels are too far back the leverage of the mass to wheels distance overcomes the leverage of the control surface to wheel distance and the craft will not lift its nose.\n\nSo let us know how it goes. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Stochasty","CreatedById":57264,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T02:41:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I find quite easy to make jet based SSTO with veery weak rocket engines and little oxidizer (or just ions!), just enough to give you the last push.\n\nYes, but that\u0027s because you already know how to do it.\n\nMy point here is that I see a lot of people who try to start with a working plane design and then add a few rockets and some rocket fuel to get themselves into space.

Then I reentered and glided all the way and landed at KSC.\n\nVery nice preforming craft. First test flight failed due to a broken fuel line but other then that no modification was needed.\n\nFitting here with a docking port in the nose cone and she could dock Im sure off.\n\nSo she would work well for building small space stations, transporting crew, deploying satellites and probes.\n\nFlight instructions and craft file is available in the description of the video in my youtube channel and the video shows pretty much how one would fly it. Didn\u0027t edit much out.\n\nAnd yes she is all stock so should be valid for the K-prize.\n\n[http://youtu.be/ayHBGs9Ztrw](https://youtu.be/ayHBGs9Ztrw)\n\n![cfok.png](http://imageshack.us/a/img404/9573/cfok.png)\n\n![rqoo.png](http://imageshack.us/a/img843/1458/rqoo.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-17T16:56:09Z","Content":"Good [advice](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/11214-The-K-Prize-100-reusable-spaceplane-to-orbit-and-back?p=333830\u0026viewfull=1#post333830) glacierre, I did it the hard way because it is hard in this instance and it can easily be improved by dropping the nacelle and adding a double radial scoop instead of single. I think the received wisdom on radial scoops may need rewriting btw because they have dropped in weight and have a high intake value.\n\nBritish\\_Rover thanks for your mission report. I am assuming you did not use modular propulsion during the K Prize mission and am adding you to the guest list with an Advanced Pilot Precision Award. Congratulations and welcome to the K Prize.\n\npa1983 thanks very much for your instructive mission video of Falcon XIV Kosmos, as usual a beautifully finished craft and another K Prize winner. \n\nThis is a K-Prize mission with \u0022Milligan Jet K-Prize\u0022 a stripped own Milligan jet which went to 4x lift off, full orbit and safe landing with the same craft without refuelling. It all relies on a lot of internal air intakes and four radial scoops which you can see in the screenies.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

The intake area is 0.004 for the radial, 0.008 for the circular, and 0.01 for the ram. Since storage capacity for intake air isn\u0027t too useful (unless you\u0027re using the disabling trick to save some intake air for jet use in space), the ram is still the way to go on an intake area per unit mass basis. It can be a bit trickier to find places to mount the inline ram intake though, so if you can mount 2.5 radials for the same number of parts as 1 ram, then radials can be worth using to save on part count.\n\nThe drag coefficient is also lower for the radial at 0.2 vs 0.3 for the circular and ram, but as far as I can tell (should probably do some more detailed experiments on this) the increase in drag coefficient at higher speeds when the intakes are open are comparable. So I think this only influences closed intakes, or makes a difference at low enough speeds that the open-intake drag coefficient is not yet saturated at its max value.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-17T23:47:09Z\u0022 title=\u002209/17/2013 11:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by tavert**"}]}
