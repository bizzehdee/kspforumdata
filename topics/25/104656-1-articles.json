So propellers should work a bit better in 1.0. As for the bearings, we\u0027ll have to see how well the new parts can be used to make them. Should be interesting to find out.\n\nAs for the challange... my best is a measily 80\u002Bm/s at below 10Km. None of my bearings have the speed needed to push high enough or produce the thrust required. They are better suited to slower rpm rotorcraft main bearings."},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T08:56:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E One day left until 1.0, but I figured I\u0027d make an entry anyway.

I pushed my own plane to 155 m/s before running out of fuel. \n\nWith 1.0 and drag no longer coupled to part mass, everything might change completely. \n\nSo the game is on! But ... with aero/re-entry difficulty at max. This might change the way we build our engines too."},{"CreatedByName":"sbski","CreatedById":135580,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T15:11:38Z","Content":"Ohhh, with the new and larger landing gear (when 1.0 cines out HYPE!) we can have MASSIVE turbo props!"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T15:57:44Z","Content":"I\u0027m actually hoping to build smaller aircraft ... these things are so large it\u0027s nuts!"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T08:09:21Z","Content":"It seems 1.0x has effectively killed the stock turboshaft concept.
