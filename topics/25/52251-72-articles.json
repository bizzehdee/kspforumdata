The first stage was also equipped with 3 engines and a bit of fuel and chutes for the return trip to Kerbin. Second stage had 9 nuclear engines (3x3 radial clusters). The 3 kerbal passengers had an uneventful launch and orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second ship was a big robotic tanker. It docked behind the mothership quite easily using RCS and but a fraction of its abundant monopropellant fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen came the Laythe plane. Unlike the two other ships, it launched itself from the runway -- and without launcher. Docking was performed without RCS, those being replaced by vernor engines under the plane belly, designed to produced some emergency lift (the lander is actually VTOL capable, even though I didn\u0027t used the feature because of oxidizer budget. It could however be useful in order to get away from some bad landing spot)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe typo lander was last. It was a multi staged lander, first stage built around nuclear engine, second stage 3-fold symmetric fuel tank legs ending with aerospike and landing leg. The third stage hold only additional fuel tanks. Once again, it docked with using only the main engine, beside the space plane on the mothership rear. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEn route to Jool \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E==========\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven with 9 nuclear engines, Kerbin ejection burn required many orbits. The 4-sections ship was wobbly, but not uncontrollably so -- thanks to the design putting the engine on front, and balancing the landers. Kerbals aboard opened - and finished - the snacks once crossing Jool orbit, and had to make due without for the rest of the multi-year flight before actual Jool intercept\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 (Yeahh, I didn\u0027t use windows !)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe original plan was to aerobrake using Jool, and visit Laythe, Tylo and the other moons thereafter. Everything changed when the pilot managed a lathe intercept. It turned into a cheap - although retrograde - Laythe orbit. The plane was dispatched for landing (and science !), and had some trouble finding some land. The landing itself was skillfully managed on an island steep slope. But one big problem became apparent after take-off : chasing for an island had taken the plane south, and it was not possible to make an equatorial orbit. The rendez-vous with the mothership was compromised !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Laythe mistake\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E==============\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever our courageous Kerbin tried to match orbit to the last oxidizer drop and got an intercept -- but docking with the plane was not possible, and docking with mothership would have been cumbersome and costly (in fuel budget).

The mothership would sit in low orbit while various Kerbals would use the Tylo lander in turns to farm science in the system, beginning -- of course -- with Tylo. After refueling and separating the lander, it performed its landing uneventfully. The fuel tanks were dropped before landing, and the aerospike stage shortly after take-off. Even though the remaining lander was low on TWR, the initial push from the second stage was enough to make it to orbit and circulize. There was more than enough fuel to rendez-vous with the mothership, drop the science, refuel, change pilot and go for the another moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E====\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe now light lander was successfully used for landing and bring science from the other moon, although there has been some short calls.

Kerbals will eat roughly 0.5 snacks per kerbal day (I think, I need to re-check the numbers). The actual time between snacking is somewhat random, so snacks can go faster or slower depending on how your kerbals feel. Unlike the \u0022real\u0022 life-support mods, running out of snacks causes a hit to your Reputation every time a kerbal reaches for a snack and can\u0027t get one - but they don\u0027t die.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently I\u0027m designing and testing in Sandbox so this wouldn\u0027t really matter to me. Hitch-hikers contain a big supply (I need to check if it is 200 or 2000) snacks while other crewed capsules only supplied 50. A universal storage compartment carries ~ 40 snacks. A test ship I made for Duna with a crew of 3 ran out of snacks on its way there with 1 hitch-hiker can and 1 3 man crew module. I haven\u0027t done the math about what I\u0027d need for a 10 man ship on a mission to Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf running it in Sandbox though, Snacks just allows me another meter-stick to measure my success with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDang It! is a mod which introduces random failures to the mission. Almost every part has a new stat MTBF (mean time between failures) which controls how likely a failure is to occur. Control capsules and probe cores come stocked with spare parts (I don\u0027t have the Universal Storage section for these). When a failure occurs a Kerbal (who is trained in mechanical or electrical repairs) will need to eva out, inspect the failure, acquire spare parts, and fix it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResource tanks (DRE heat shields, fuel tanks, snacks containers) can start to leak. Batteries can blow a fuse. Reaction wheels can get stuck - disabling their ability to produce torque. Engines can be damaged such that they produce no thrust, or have their gimbals locked.

I\u0027m still playing around with designs. I\u0027m favoring and impractical (but nice to me) long ship design.
