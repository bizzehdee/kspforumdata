It makes a HUGE difference. It\u0027s still worth pointing out, though, particularly if people haven\u0027t played in a while and are used to (or have a ship from) an older version. The new lander can actually weighs more by default than the old one, but the only difference is the monopropellant it carries. If you remove it, the can weighs the same .6 it always has. Often this is the difference between a ship that \u0022used to work in 21\u0022 and working just fine now.

Common sense says that the former is going to be easier to get to orbit as it it weighs 0.22t less. Not so, it has more drag and it\u0027s nose cone is heavier, this overrides the weight advantage and actually makes it harder to get to orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis makes it hard to design. You can use MJ or Engineer Redux to show the dV but that\u0027s only half the story now. You can build something with dV to spare but if it\u0027s more pancake-like it will never reach orbit. And there is nothing in either of those tools to tell you that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best Eve lifters now are sticks. Sure, you get more dV in theory with bits stuck on the side but they won\u0027t reach orbit. A compromise is to make sure that the bits stuck on the side are skinny. For instance, here\u0027s a sea level to 100km orbit capable lander/lifter. It beats all on the leaderboard from pre-1.0 and can almost certainly be slimmed a lot, especially if launched from a mountain top...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DAzpYkZ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DAzpYkZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s another design compromise not obvious from the picture. There\u0027s a LV-T45 engine in the middle of there. It would be better with another Aerospike but they have no bottom attachment point.
