Let the judging begin. I would like to make a comment to the judging though.. The challenge has been to design a space tug, \u0027tug\u0027 being short for tugboat. But what is the tug supposed to do? Form follows function afterall. \u003Cp\u003EThe Oxford dictionary defines a \u0027tug\u0027 as A powerful boat used for towing larger vessels, especially in harbor. This is indicative of helping to move larger vessels around to \u0027dock\u0027 with shore, etc. A tug does not normally leave harbor. This implies use as an aid in assembly, etc. Especially when unpowered cargoes or parts are being moved from one ship to another. This is similar to what sci-fi authors like James White and Arthur C Clarke have proposed for space station construction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENASA - as part of the \u0027space transportation system\u0027 defined a space tug as \u0022a chemically fueled space tug to move crew and equipment between Earth orbits (including geosynchronous), and which could be adapted for use as a lunar orbit-to-surface shuttle\u0022 Wow - M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn lander too!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ein judging this contest which end of the spectrum (The NASA gold plated version or the commercial version) is going to be given presidence?
