It\u0027s a perfectly reasonable way of doing things of course, but for anyone who is bored with that and looking for new ideas, I propose an alternative.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ERather than sending a few missions to a lot of different places at once, it can make a nice change to pick one planetary system and do an extended exploration program for just that one place. Plan a huge, decades-long exploration program that aims to\u00A0land in every biome on the planet (if it\u0027s not a gas giant) and all of its moons, gather all of the science, and then return a (possibly rather large) exploration crew to Kerbin.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s the way that this sort of planetary exploration program\u00A0generally goes, though its not set in stone.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EStep 1: choose a planetary system - technically you could choose the Mun or Minmus, but I find that this exploration method works better for places outside of Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E since most people explore the Mun and Minmus rather extensively compared to elsewhere.

You\u0027ll probably be wanting at least one interplanetary freight transport (I like modular designs, but go for whatever you find easiest), station modules, base modules (and ways of landing them), rovers (and ways of landing them), and vehicles that can transport kerbals to/from the surfaces of every celestial body in that system (except for those that don\u0027t have a surface, such as Jool). And of course, you\u0027ll also need launch vehicles for transporting all of these payloads to Kerbin orbit (and beyond, for those cargoes that aren\u0027t going to be attached to a mothership).\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EStep 3: send some survey probes to scan for the best locations for landings and surface bases. For bases, I usually go with places that are within reasonable driving range of 2 or 3 biomes, and have ore available (if planning to use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E). Different celestial bodies may present different challenges for landing, and you should consider what you want to prioritize when thinking about a base location. Also, it\u0027s often convenient with larger bodies particularly to have an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E base at the poles, so that an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E vehicle can refuel on the surface and be able to conduct plane changes with fewer fuel tanks (or you could simply design the vehicle to be able to conduct plane changes anyway). As for other landing locations, it\u0027s good to just have one picked out for every biome.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EStep 4: consider potential station orbits. It can be useful to have a station in orbit of the planet you\u0027re trying to explore, and it always makes a nice addition to this sort of exploration program. Usually the ideal base locations are not going to be at equatorial locations, so it is often convenient to position your station in an orbit that can theoretically be reached by lifting off from most of your surface locations without too much plane changing (a polar orbit covers this for all points on the surface, but it means that a gravity turn isn\u0027t an option).\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EStep 5: figure out what things you\u0027re going to send to the planetary system at what times, and then just go and explore it all.

Yes, it does mean that vehicles would have to be capable of reaching a high-inclination orbit from anywhere on the planet, but generally the amount of delta-v that is lost by sacrificing a gravity turn is less than the amount that it costs to execute a plane change (unless your station is in a ridiculously high orbit but then it costs a lot to reach that orbit).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andiron","CreatedById":141782,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-11T15:38:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLiked this mission idea, so I\u0027m working on it !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is my first craft, the nuclear-powered Satbus, who will bring eight satellites to the dunian system.

As for crewed exploration, this mid-game point will involve some reasonably extensive landing missions for every solid celestial body out as far as the Jool system*,which will include at least a one-module surface base and rover (per planetary system, not necessarily for every moon), with more extensive infrastructure for some planets.
