You launch two separate craft, the propulsion module, and the command/lander module. After you have rendezvoused and\u00A0docked the two in orbit, you use the propulsion module to get to your destination, undock and land\u00A0with the command module, do whatever you plan on\u00A0doing on the ground, ascend and rendezvous with propulsion module, and get back to Kerbin. Beyond the limitation of having to launch two separate craft for one mission, you can design them any way you want; you don\u0027t even have to have two kerbals in the command module.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t fret over the potential complexity, it\u0027s quite similar to Apollo style missions, except for the two separate launches and the fact that the propulsion module is most likely unmanned. Mods are suggested, but not needed; same goes for the making history dlc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPost progress, images, videos,\u00A0and whatnot below!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
