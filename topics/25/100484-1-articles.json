While this challenge could easily have scoring applied to it for various challenges, there\u0027s just no good way to scan for cheating due to video editors. So, I\u0027ve opted to just make this a participatory challenge with two category awards, and a badge of honor for your signature bar.\n\n**THE CHALLENGE**\n\nFly your manned SSTO, Shuttle, or Rocket to space and reach a stable Kerbin Orbit, meaning both your Apoapsis and Periapsis are at least 65km. You are not allowed to leave the view of the cockpit until you feel you have reached a stable orbit, at which time you should enter the map mode and hover your mouse over the apoapsis and periapsis points to confirm your stable orbit. While you are in the map view, you are allowed to create a single NAV point if you wish to aid with your re-entry. Once you exit map mode and are back inside the cockpit, you may not leave the cockpit view again until you have landed. You may not execute any maneuver\u0027s outside of the cockpit view. The entire trip should be video captured as proof to the world of your efforts, your video\u0027s will serve as documentaries and training tools for future wanna be astronauts.\n\n**WHAT\u0027S ALLOWED?**\n\nYou\u0027re free to use whatever mod or ship design you like that doesn\u0027t provide any additional navigational assistance. All piloting and course selections must be 100% set by the user without any instrument guidance or assistance, other than the stock instrumentation on your control panel. No infinite fuels or other such cheats to provide an unlimited supply of any particular resource.\n\n**\\*EDIT\\*** Since there seems to be a popular drive to use the mod Raster Prop Moniter, I\u0027ll create a new award category below for those pilots using any mod that shows navigation data within the cockpit.\n\n**THE AWARDS**\n\n[Astronaut Trainer] \\*Added\\*\n\nAccomplish the mission goals as stated above with the assistance of navigational software added to the cockpit view.\n\n[Astronaut Elite]\n\nAccomplish the mission goals as stated above, landing safely back on Kerbin. Any ship type, any duration, any safe landing.\n\n[Astronaut Legend]\n\nAccomplish the mission goals as stated above AND land and stop your craft either on the runway or the launching pad safely with no damage.\n\nHere\u0027s my entry showing one possibility for the Legend status award. Good luck to all\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/ait6XFCQ_TI?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nSuccessful Entries:\n\n**ASTRONAUT TRAINER:**\n\n1. \n\n2.\n\n3.\n\n**ASTRONAUT ELITE:**\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\n**ASTRONAUT LEGEND:**\n\n1.
