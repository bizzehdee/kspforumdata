The weaker weapons have no purpose if all weapons cost the same, leading to less load-out diversity. If we go with a system where each individual weapon costs a different amount of points, then a couple cheaper weapons might become more worth it than a larger weapon. It gives the designers more choice while keeping the competition all-around fair."},{"CreatedByName":"t3hJimmer","CreatedById":145943,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T23:06:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E A standard air superiority fighter load out seems to be 4 AMRAAMs, 2 Sidewinders and a cannon, presumably with equivalent of one box of ammo - they don\u0027t carry many rounds, the Eurofighter only carry 150 27mm rounds.

I would say we should get the tournament rules to be the best and most fair we can think of on our first try. Consecutive tries should bring place minor fixes to the style and adaptations rather than to be used as an excuse to leave a flawed game mechanic in the game.\n\nAlso, What are your opinions on the airborne laser?

Set a high enough min altitude and 10-15km range is feasible. I don\u0027t want to do that because I\u0027d prefer we avoid manually editing files for the moment. I do want to use it in a future interceptor challenge, where 5km is just unrealistically short.\n\nYou can set the physics range in the options menu [alt-b]. No need to muck about in the manually editing files.\n\nAfter you increase the max physics range, you can adjust the guard range up to the max physics range in the tweak [right click] menu.\n\nI have never had a plane go further than 10 km from the start point.\n\nI made this graphic for my Assault on Pirate Island Challenge:\n\n![2TGq1WZ.png](http://i.imgur.com/2TGq1WZ.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"keptin","CreatedById":8884,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T09:49:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E F-7 Vulture...Craft File available here if anyone wants to take it for a spin: [http://pastebin.com/FBg1HmiX](http://pastebin.com/FBg1HmiX)\n\nI pit the F-7 Vulture against the [Helion III-B](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129182-Gauging-interest-stock-BD-Armory-dogfighters-AI-tournament?p=2100684\u0026viewfull=1#post2100684) with deadly results.

I always leave the altitudes set to whatever the builder had them. There are advantages and disadvantages to setting high or low preferred altitudes. High altitudes have the advantage of being able to dive on their opponent, and low altitudes can get into position faster. I think it should be left up to the builder.\n\nAnyways, I arranged a bout between your Helion III-B and the F-4 Destroyer Mk3. It went similar to the fight with the Vulture. The Helion ate missiles early, but was a beast once it got up to altitude and started dive bombing.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/1bGVpS5nZqo?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nF-4 Destroyer Mk3 available here: [http://pastebin.com/XEDbqyXj](http://pastebin.com/XEDbqyXj)"}]}
