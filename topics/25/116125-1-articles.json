I\u0027m going to fix that. The challenge is you have to build a sailboat, sail to the abandoned airway, and sail back in the fastest amount of time! Now the rules and stuff.\n\nRULES\n\nThe boat must be stock, but mods are allowed\n\nNo cheats, Hyperedit, or config edits!\n\nYou do not have to land on the airway, just sail to it, and sail back to KSC\n\nThis is a SAILBOAT! Make it look like one, but kudos if you got a wind mod and you get it to work!\n\nI need 3 pictures, Start, arrival at airway, and finish.\n\nYou are allowed to use ANY propulsion method\n\nIt cannot leave the water\n\nUse Hyperedit to drop it in the water if you want, but drive it for bonus points!\n\nWhere is my attempt? It\u0027s being made right now!\n\nScoreboard\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nFAR?\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nBadge (Thanks windows!)
