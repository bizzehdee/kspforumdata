This is Katzen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am creating the Kerbal Rocket Punk challenge. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerbal Rocket Punk (KRP) challenge is my compromise on wanting to build an interplanetary network using reusable rockets that could exist today. This is tough for me since I really don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have that many hours to sink into the game. After two months of fruitless trying to create decent ground support equipment for a rocket I gave up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the reason I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have time is because I work 12 hour shifts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to create a challenge that would require being able to use a fully reusable system of vehicles that can transport 5T of stuff from one planet to another without using expendables. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome rules though. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. No \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cmagic\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 such as infinite fuel or air hogging \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Has to be realistic (should I require the deadly re-entry mod?) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Must be able to reliably move container (KAS mod maybe? Need to look into how much a KAS container can hold) from one ship to another\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. You can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t use \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cdrop tanks\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 or anything that requires the craft to be rebuilt after use. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for some questions of the community \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I want to offer a cash prizes through Paypal totaling about 200$ for all the crafts (this is not a single winner) I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know if offering a prize is considered \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Ccommercial\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 since the craft will be free to download by any. I just want to offer something with the challenge. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Which mods should be added? Kerthane mod is a given since refueling will be necessary, but as for others like B9 and Firespitter I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know what should be considered allowed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. How should I section the challenge up? By creating a prize for a system for each planet or for a vehicle that fills a specific role?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow this is not yet an \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cofficial\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 challenge. I just want to gauge the communities view, and get some feedback on the idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
