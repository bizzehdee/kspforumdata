With that outlined, let\u0027s start with our engineers\u0027 initial impressions of the aircraft as they sat on the tarmac this one sunny afternoon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nPizio \u003Cspan\u003E\u0026amp; Hartmann Co. have designed an interesting airframe that looks very suitable to cruising at altitude... and not much else. \u003C/span\u003EThe narrow track for the main gear was great cause for concern in terms of ground handling, combined with the very wide wingspan. The engines mounted far out on the wings would not help either, as they were a significant amount of mass that would further the risk of tipping the aircraft. As well, the long, thin wing showed a lot of flex. While not necessarily a problem in flight, it exacerbated risk of hitting the ground with the wings either during turns or while landing. Engineers did note that the distanced engines meant that the cabins were likely to be fairly quiet, away from engine noise. Also, the wide engine layout made for a great deal of concern when thinking about engine failure scenarios...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nOur test pilots Samantha and Kirrim, both combat veterans, boarded their aircraft to do initial testing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nConcerns of the wide wingspan and narrow track were confirmed when taking a hard turn above 8m/s, which caused the wingtip vertical surfaces and even the outer wing to hit the ground and be torn off. TCA engineers quickly went to work to make the airframes airworthy again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nThe brake programming did not play very well when paired with engine thrust reversers, which could find them stuck in the wrong position if the brakes were toggled too quickly. The flaps being programmed to the brakes were also a curious decision, as applying brakes would then de-activate the flaps when released, even if they were initially deployed by action group. The engine thrust reversers were definitely the larger concern though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nStill, we didn\u0027t want these negative impressions to affect the rest of the flight test, so we tried to maintain a clear and open mind as testing proceeded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nBut for the short version: It\u0027s The Little Things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESeps B Testing\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nThe Seps B was chosen to fly off first. Pitch control was more sensitive than expected and resulted in a tail strike that destroyed the rear portion of the aircraft, which cascaded into complete airframe failure along the runway. Despite a wheel being back there to help prevent damage due to tail striking. Yes, it was that severe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\n... Fortunately, prototypes are made in multiples, so our test pilot Kirrim was put in the second Seps B, with the new knowledge that \u003Cem\u003Emore care needed to be taken\u003C/em\u003E when lifting off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nWheels-up was achieved at ~40-45m/s as stated after a short takeoff run, with the two Wheesleys providing more than sufficient power. Climbing to cruise altitude at the recommended 20 degrees was quick, taking no more than 3 minutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nCruising altitude was reached with little trouble. Sort of. Attempts to activate \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E for stability would lead to a cascading failure of roll overcorrection by the computer. We believe this is due to the wing flex affecting the aerodynamics and the effects of the ailerons mounted far on the ends of the flexing wings. Since the Seps proved to be a stable aircraft in straight flight though, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E was simply turned off and the aircraft was left to manual flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nTesting began on the cruise parameters outlined by P\u0026amp;H Co. To our surprise, we managed a lower fuel burn rate than stated at the cruising speed and altitude, for a conservative fuel capacity estimated range of 2,400km, more than the 2,200km stated by P\u0026amp;H. Trimming the aircraft was also fairly easy, and it flew with a very neutral pitch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nHappy with this result, we moved on to safety testing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nWe simulated an engine failure on the starboard engine. The wide engine layout meant that the remaining port engine exerted a great deal of torque on the aircraft, and roll was required to counteract it, as the yaw authority was simply not enough. For a while, this felt fine, but we wanted to push it to see if we could get somewhat level flight out of the aircraft. It required throttling down of the engine, which reduced torque enough for the aircraft\u0027s rudder to keep it somewhat stable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nThen Kirrim tried increasing throttle again slowly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nThis proved to be an disagreeable course of action for the aircraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nThe Seps B entered a flat spin, and even after throttling the engines down, the Seps B proved difficult to recover from the spin which soon became a complete stall. Eventually, the aircraft\u00A0was recovered from the stall, after dropping from 7,000m to just about 3,000m.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nKirrim felt like giving single-engine testing another go, so TCA ground controllers gave the okay. Maybe she just did something wrong?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nAfter the first spin, it was identified that low to medium throttle was the limit for single engine operation. This went along fine again, until some maneuvering was attempted. This, again, proved to be disagreeable with the aircraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022b7ftBW7.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/b7ftBW7.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nAnd that was the end of Seps B Prototype #2, with our test pilot bailing out under 300m above sea level. Later picked up by recovery crews, she was still in shock reflecting on the near-death experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022NMtI2EFl.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022360\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/NMtI2EFl.png\u0022 width=\u0022640\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022jfbh5zAl.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022360\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/jfbh5zAl.png\u0022 width=\u0022640\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESeps A Testing\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nThe mishaps with the Seps B marred our perception of the Seps aircraft, but we were obligated to test both aircraft due to differences in aerodynamics. Maybe it\u0027ll be different this time? Seps A is shorter by two fuselage lengths and carries 200 kallons less of fuel, which is fairly significant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nEither because of increased caution, or just better design, we found the Seps A harder to damage with a tail strike, with the bumper wheel working fine to save the tail from damage before the aircraft lifts off. Takeoff was again quick and short, as was reaching cruise altitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nLike the Seps B, our testing found that it cruised at recommended altitude and speed with a lower burn rate than stated, attaining a calculated range of 2,800km, a significant improvement over the stated 2,200km, even with our more conservative fuel capacity standards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nWe told test pilot Samantha to head back to the testing site for general maneuverability testing. We already knew that pitch control was sensitive. We discovered that roll control was decent, and yaw control was... passable at best. However, it was noted to have problems with yaw stability, probably due to the vertical surfaces on the ends of the wings imparting unnecessary force far ahead of where vertical surfaces would be optimal. The aircraft was prone to sideslipping before finally managing to stabilize, and the consequences of this would be realized shortly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nThe aircraft was directed to land. Initial concern was over the narrow landing gear track, but it soon became clear that there was a bigger problem: landing in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nPoor yaw stability meant that minor corrections were difficult to make.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022iVJ72Hsl.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022360\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/iVJ72Hsl.png\u0022 width=\u0022640\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nWith one Seps A prototype remaining, Samantha took to the air again, with TCA\u0027s engineers opting to monitor the situation from the ground. We did a complete engine failure test. The Seps... fared decently enough, but maneuverability and control was poor at the speed it glided at, which was fairly low. It spun out again when it stalled out, but the Seps A proved \u003Cem\u003Esomewhat\u003C/em\u003E easier to recover from a loss of control\u00A0than the Seps B.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nNext was water landing. This test was performed with no airframe damage, which was finally some good news.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nAfter picking the aircraft out of the water, it took the the air again for more maneuverability tests, focusing on low-speed maneuvers. It... did not fare well. Control was found to be poor at low speeds, and the yaw instability was more noticeable, with risks of loss of control clear. We weren\u0027t even looking for acrobatic capabilities or anything (though it did do vertical loops well), just stable maneuvering. Feeling that enough data was gathered, Samantha was told to try and land again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nAnd that\u0027s how we lost all of the Seps prototypes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Verdict:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nThe Seps A \u0026amp; B are very good at doing their intended design mission- comfortably cruising fast and far at high altitude.

Ground performance did not make good impressions other than its short takeoff run. Low speed maneuverability was poor.

On top of that it can fly slowly (98m/s) for extra time to spot at less than 100m altitude. And if it\u0027s a long search, you might need a good flight endurance, which is good because at such a speed this can cruise about for 6 and 3/4 hours.

Were we excited to get our hands on one of the new planes promised from GAI. First impressions were good, as we didn\u0027t need an airport tug that tended to break our shiny new planes. After getting the pilots to stop doing donuts in the taxiway, they set out to push the Comets to their limits. Both the 1b and the 2a took off fairly quickly at 68m/s, and initial low speed and stall testing revealed excellent handling characteristics thanks to the swiveling engines. The Comets both provide great views from their cabin windows, though the pilots would like to get in on that, and unfortunately, the taildragging landing gear that GAI just loves has simply put down yet another fantastic aircraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s get the bad stuff out of the way first. The wings have no incidence, which makes for a slight nose up attitude in flight. This combined with the taildragger landing gear and measly viewing angles from the cockpit make for interesting landings, as the pilots are essentially blind without their instrumentation. This is a minor gripe, but we would like to see tricycle gear on the next iteration. Speaking of which, GAI has curiously not removed the supply of monopropellent from the cockpit, presumably as an in-flight drink to us? Another minor issue is the way the plane is built. There is a lot a fuel, giving plenty of range to both the 1b and the 2a, but it seems that GAI has merely repurposed a tanker by strapping passenger cabins to the dorsal and ventral sides. Not that we\u0027re complaining, but the complicated ducting required on the lower deck does make us wonder how we\u0027re going to service these planes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe good thing about the design is the excellent passenger experience. Apart from the mild vibrations from the engines, the whine isn\u0027t overwhelming in the rear cabin, and any sound that does get through will most likely be overshadowed by the view of the surrounding space. With both models performing best at relatively low altitudes, these planes make the daily commute much more bearable. The excellent maneuverability and excessive fuel reserves make this a possibility. For longer range flights, these planes prove to be reliable workhorses, as an engine failure will not result in any emergency action needed. In the event that both engines fail, the landing gear is strong enough to withstand field landings and the airframe is sturdy enough for ditchings. Not to mention the parachute included with the 2a.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt 44 parts and 52 parts respectively, and with 2 engines and many shared components, we don\u0027t expect the Comet to bankrupt us for maintenance. However, the intricate ducting required for the intake does require a little more work than most other jets, but that\u0027s not really a problem considering how high off the ground it is.

The largest concern on this aircraft was foreseen to be poor lift; not a lot of wing surface to help keep the Bronco in the air at lower speeds, and the fairly extreme dihedral on the main outer wings wouldn\u0027t help in that department either. But it would probably be fine once it got up to speed. Also, passing through a fuel tank bulkhead that separated the crew compartments and entrance, from the passenger compartments, was thought to be somewhat of a hassle for embarkation and debarkation. Other than these though, there didn\u0027t seem to be much other things that raised suspicion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nSo, we moved onto the flight test. O.A. stated takeoff at 62m/s on a paved runway, but we found that wheels-up was achieved around 55-60m/s after a short to average length takeoff run. A hard pull on the stick for takeoff, though, did cause a tailstrike that destroyed the rear section of the aircraft. Therefore, this aircraft, while a taildragger, is not immune from tail strikes, but it also requires significant pitch input at takeoff. The remainder of the aircraft was able to be recovered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nWe pulled the second prototype out while the first one was in repairs, and took to the skies again, this time with a gentler takeoff. We noticed that none of the control surfaces were setup for specific actuations, so we took a guess and quickly set each set of control surfaces to only actuate for single inputs. Doing this, roll control was somewhat sluggish, but probably sufficient, and would probably be fine if the ailerons were moved farther outward and were boosted in deflection. Alternatively, activating roll control on the elevators to make them double as tailerons made roll control responsive, though at the sacrifice of a little more complicated pitch stability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nCruise altitude was reached with a reasonable time of 3-4 minutes. Speeding up to cruise speed also took a bit of time. At cruise, we were able to corroborate the fairly short range stated by the manufacturer, barely 1,000km under our own conservative fuel reserves standard. However, we estimate that a maximum range of 1,100 is probable, as fuel consumption did not increase at cruise altitude despite the aircraft continuing to accelerate (though slowly). We are unsure what the maximum speed of the aircraft would be. Trimming the aircraft was fairly easy, and it flew in a very stable manner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nThe manufacturer has stated the design to improve passenger comfort by spacing away the engine from the passenger compartments. Onboard engineers on later test flights would note that noise was still moderate due to size and direct passage of sounds from the exhaust to the cabins, but bearable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nFinished with testing the standard flight portions, we headed back over the test site for the various other flight tests.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nSimulating an engine failure, we found that the Bronco was still a stable flyer, but was a mediocre glider. It bleeds speed fairly quickly, finding a relatively stable speed around 100-90m/s. Pushing this test revealed what was originally assumed about the design- the poor lift letting the aircraft down. Under 70m/s, the aircraft\u0027s state slowly cascades into worse and worse, almost dropping like a rock. It struggles to pull level, and continues descending at a high rate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nWe restarted the engine and began testing other maneuverability parameters. We conclude that its mid-speed maneuverability and stability is fine, but again, would prefer some sort of official solution to the somewhat sluggish-feeling roll rate if using a basic control surface setup, with the solution either being aileron adjustment or retaining taileron functionality. The other conclusion reached was that maneuverability suffers at low speeds, with the possibility of losing more altitude than preferred in a turn, but it was an otherwise stable aircraft, under power or not, as long as airspeed was kept above 70m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nFinally, we went in for a landing. For this portion, everything went mostly fine, but we feel that a minimum landing speed of 60-70m/s is too high, especially for an aircraft of this size. Further landing tests revealed difficulty at landing at speeds 50m/s or below, as the aircraft is severely stalling out by that speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nWe performed some taxiing tests, and the enhanced ground maneuverability mode proved very useful. Combined with the fairly small overall size of the aircraft, and it would be suitable for small or tight airfields.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nWe also did water landing tests. The aircraft with its high stall speed did not fare very well in this test, breaking up upon water impact. However, we do note that the airframe failed along the wing connections to the fuselage, and all components remained otherwise intact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nMaintenance-wise, the aircraft are fairly simple, and with only one engine to maintain, projected costs are quite low. Two separate cockpits may be cause for slightly increased maintenance in that department though. The aircraft as a whole has a fairly low to average part count of 32, which is a noted positive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Verdict:\u003Cspan\u003E\uFEFF\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nA novel yet simple aircraft, the Model 221 \u0027Bronco\u0027 shows potential as a short-range workhorse. However, we do have the one significant problem with it in its current form, and that is its poor lift. From this stems most of the problems found during testing. Relatively high stall speed and landing speed on an aircraft of this size don\u0027t make for an entirely comfortable aircraft to fly when on approach, but it\u0027s not like the aircraft \u003Cem\u003Eisn\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E flyable. We\u0027d also like the control surface setup situation to be sorted out. Other concerns are the fairly short range (possibly not a major concern), ease of passenger movement due to fuel tank bulkhead (potential significant concern), and a little better tail strike immunity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nWe recommend KEA not place orders on this aircraft in its current form, but be open to options should its flaws be remedied.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\n---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nBy the way, can the other reviews be added into the KPPM scoring sheet?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-05-28T05:15:11Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2018 05:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Box of Stardust\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"neistridlar","CreatedById":20296,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-28T06:21:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223387641\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022172690\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221527484397\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022112527\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Box of Stardust\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, Box of Stardust said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the way, can the other reviews be added into the KPPM scoring sheet?\u003Cspan\u003E\uFEFF\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes.

Another LJ-30-100? Jeb sprints out of the vaping room at the control tower to go and check this one out! After the fun he had doing wheelies with it\u0027s predecessor he couldn\u0027t be more excited! The new prototype is rolled out, it looks a bit battered... The engines are a bit wonky pointing inward, the wing tips are tilted to face the airstream and the wings look a like they\u0027re held together with duct tape. But who cares? Wheelies on the runway, right?! Well no, this one sits pretty stable when fueled up. Too bad, Jeb!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a promising start for the plane\u0027s landing gear, so Jeb, not the must trusting person, brings Bill around to have a look under the hood. As expected the steering is fully wired up to everything again. So Jeb pulls Bill into the cockpit to come along for the ride, so Bill can fix the steering if it proves too dangerous. Taxiing to the runway proved exciting with 3-wheel steering enabled and Jeb drifts the plane into position at the far end of the runway, punches the throttle to full and shoots past the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E. At about 40m/s the plane becomes really unstable and Jeb needs to correct it a little to keep going in a straight line. Adusting the friction on the rear wheels proved of some help, but it\u0027s not altogether stable still. This won\u0027t stop Jeb, so he pulls the stick back and with a loud, crashing sound completely destroys the tail and the rearmost passenger compartment. Luckily we weren\u0027t using that particular compartment because as with its predecessor there\u0027s a fuel tank obstructing half of the cabin. Slightly panicky Jeb pulls the brakes and manages to save himself and Bill, but looses most of the plane unfortunately. We will not be bringing any test-Kerbals on this thing untill it proves safe to fly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucky prototypes come in multiples. To our surpirse the strange engine placement, bent wing tips and duct-tape wings turned out to be a feature and not caused by KEA\u0027s crammed hangar policy. It looks just like the first one, rear wheel steering included. Undaunted Jeb and Bill take the controls again for another go. This time Jeb speeds up to about 70m/s before pulling back on the stick, a little more gently this time, to find that it does take to the air when you\u0027re being careful. Flying directly east from the runway Jeb decides that since pitch control is managable he\u0027ll make some altitude prior to testing the steering abilities so they can parachute out if required. Turns out that was a good idea because the plane handles abysmally with all the controls strapped together like that. Bill has a quick look under the hood, clippes\u00A0some random wires and before they can actually crash the plane Jeb gets it under control. Better to turn around and inspect the plane on the runway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe plane proves to be VERY stable on descent with the controls sorted out and doesn\u0027t lose pitch control until the speed drops below 40m/s. You can\u0027t land at that speed because half of that will be your vertical velocity in negative numbers. Better speed up a bit Jeb! Landing at about 70 m/s with full flap deployment is something Jeb could handle, any slower and the vertical speed would run out of control, any faster and the runway would not be long enough. Jeb struck the tail though, so there goes prototype number 2...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRolling out prototype number 3 Bill immediatly gets to work on the controls while Jeb rages at the mission director for having to fly another one of these. While he\u0027s at it Bill also fixes the steering, straightens out the engines and patches the wing tips so at least the whole thing is straight and under control. Jeb flies it very carefully over to the island runway and manages to pull a landing without damage, so far so good! Jeb and Bill take off again and head north to the mountains for some brochure shots and find that the plane is actualy really stable at high speed and altitude and reasonably efficient at the recommended settings. Its KPPM is a little below average it turns out according to Mortimer, which he confirms is good in big bold letters so as to avoid the previous mess up with the LJ-30-100.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter flying out to the mountains and back again Jeb and Bill perform a stall test, they point the nose 0 degrees and shut down the engines completely, then wait and see what happens while leaning back, hands on the eject seat controls. The plane slows down, completely level, all the way down to 45m/s before it starts to sideslip and tilt a little to the right, they almost come full circle before the plane decides to go the other way and actually stalls out at a mere 35m/s (half of which is downward velocity). A little jelp from Bill attends Jeb to get the plane back under control, so he fires up the engines and pulls out of the dive with ease. \u0022Since we\u0027ve already destroyed 2 prototypes we might as well ditch this one in the water next to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0022 Jeb pronounces to the horrified look on Bill\u0027s face. Jeb puts the plane into a dive, shuts down the engines and pulls the brakes, hard. With all of the spoilers extended the plane does not exceed 150m/s coming down steeply towards the monolith. Just before the end Jeb pulls it straight, heads down the coast a bit to bleed of some speed and ditches the plane sort of safely at about 50 m/s. Just like his first runway landing Jeb destroys the tail section and the rear-most passenger compartment. One of the wings is lost and it has an engine less than it was delivered with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMortimer decided to be on the resque crew so he could immediately confront Jeb with his next paycheck of roughly -120mln! \u0022These things are expensive Jeb!\u0022 he yells as the reque\u00A0chopper descends overhead. \u0022I told Gene I didn\u0027t want to fly another one and you were right there Mort!\u0022 a p!ssed off Jeb yells back at him, \u0022At least I didn\u0027t damage the runway and nobody died!\u0022 Other than the sound of the chopper everything turns silent as Bill is being hoisted out of the plane, he clearly lost his lunch and most of his consciousness. Jeb wipes the sweat off his forehead and clips on to the other line to be hoisted into the chopper as well. Mortimer tries to explain: \u0022Look, they cost 37mln to make, then there\u0027s fuel use, the amount of passengers, the range you fly, the construction, the airframe, the parts, the engines and it all needs to be maintained. On a per seat basis this thing is among the most expesive planes we\u0027ve ever tested and you just destroyed 3 of them on a single morning!\u0022 \u0022Ah, well, if they\u0027re that expensive KEA isn\u0027t going to fly them anyway.\u0022 Jeb replies. More silence ensues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Verdict:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe\u0027ve been informed by KEA that we will not be paying for the three destroyed planes and neither will Jeb, becaue we wouldn\u0027t want him to have to break his vaping habit and live with the result of the rehab, he\u0027ll never be the same. Taking off and landing with the LJ-30-100MR is a hazard, if not just to the plane, the runway as well. In the air this plane flies pretty well after we sorted the controls. Cheaply it may fly, it is expensive to maintain and to purchase. As a cost saving measure we recommend KEA abstains from the buying of this craft to avoid all the other costs altogether.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
