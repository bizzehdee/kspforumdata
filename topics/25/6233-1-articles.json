Stock parts for any thrust generating parts and related fuel carrier, structural reinforcement, flight control surface and automatic control only.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Fuel carrier of any sort, as long as not related to any thrust generation, can be use as dead weight, unused fuel from stock part fuel carrier after return to kerbin orbit will count as mission supply reserves and can be added as as extra payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Mission durations is to be accounted for, make it as short as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Letum","CreatedById":4227,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-01T04:52:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=3945.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=3945.0\u003C/a\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"4 IN 1","CreatedById":1540,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-01T05:23:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is then, this is now, with fuel line and stuff the bar to put more stuff on the mun have been raised, besides, the rule is slightly different, you have to land the payload, drop all dead weight, then fly off mun with what you designed to be lift on the ship on the return trip, it is more about maximize your rocket efficiency on putting stuff for future moon base mission then just brutal force.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
