If it came from the space station then it technically ought to break the docking rule but it is not covered by existing rules. However I am minded to overlook it on this occasion because the SP 6000 went on to land on Minmus which was the opposite direction to the assist, so it actually cost \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E and did not add towards a kudos achievement. However I will need to devise a rule to exclude docking to boosters because in order to compare craft capabilities they must proceed using their own thrust and fuel, which is the same reason the K-Prize is stock only. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-05-19T14:40:51Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2018 02:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by boolybooly**"},{"CreatedByName":"beomagi","CreatedById":168393,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-19T15:46:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 50 minutes ago, boolybooly said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@beomagi](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/168393-beomagi/) in spirit  I believe your mission is a K-Prize winner.
