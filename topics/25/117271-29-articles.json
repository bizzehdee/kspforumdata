E.G. why B-2 bombers aren\u0027t stealth fighters, regardless of wing area.\n\nYeah, but if one breaks it all down:\n\nMass: Hurts the most when you want to change direction or change acceleration. Biggest issue is when you want to take-off.\n\n--Benefit: can smooth out vibrations or help maintain stability at high velocities.\n\nInertia from mass: Once you get the object moving, it wants to stay moving in the same direction. Turning is the biggest issue\n\n--Benefit: None really. It\u0027s a PITA\n\nDrag: The more parts, the more drag. Simple as that.\n\n--Benefit: None really. It\u0027s the way it is:\n\n--How to combat it:\n\n1) keep your parts count low\n\n2) look at the parts that are on your leading edge. Choose the best for lowest Cd\n\n3) STOP PUTTING A MILLION FINS AND WING SURFACES ON YOUR PLANE!! THIS ISN\u0027T STARCRAFT OR BABYLON 5!! Besides, it\u0027s more parts to add to a target. If you want to paint a bullseye on your plane, please continue to do so.\n\n4) Keep your CG and CL positions in their proper place\n\n5) Make sure your plane doesn\u0027t exceed 3 degrees Angle of Attack. This is the biggest contributor to drag. Ideal for almost all planes here is 1.6 to 1.1 degrees. Any lower and your risk instability due to changes in your direction of lift. Any higher and you might as well have a B-52 in this tournament.\n\nJust my 2\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A2.....\n\n\u003E Question: does the ECM jammer do anything...

Adding chaff in the proper places to confuse the AIM-120\u0027s radar tracking works just as well, and you don\u0027t have the weight or drag issues."},{"CreatedByName":"CreativeCombat","CreatedById":112338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-02T17:17:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Here\u0027s my entry! sorry no professional pictures or the like i\u0027m a noob :S...\n\u003E The CX-11 Star Slugger:\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://kerbalx.com/Mr_Hubris/CX-11-Star-Slugger](http://kerbalx.com/Mr_Hubris/CX-11-Star-Slugger)\n\nThis craft is the silliest thing in the world, I love it. \n\nI was considering running a tournament myself since I have the hardware for it.
