From here you can either land the lander on Kerbin by itself or rejoin your spaceplane and return both vessels together.

Specifically, it shaves off roughly 1km/s delta-v from the cost of making Kerbin orbit for a well designed rocket, due to the realistic drag model that it implements. This means you can get to orbit with much smaller craft, as long as they are well-designed (the \u0022well-designed\u0022 part being the \u0022certain things harder\u0022 in my first sentence). Whether or not you consider this to be too performance enhancing is up to you; personally, I love FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, is having a second craft for the Mun lander required? What about doing everything as part of a reusable single stage? There are a number of people in the K-Prize thread that have done single stage return missions from the Mun, Minmus, Duna, Laythe, and others. The \u0022two-part\u0022 portion of this challenge does make it unique and therefore interesting, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s actually any harder than doing it as a single stage.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-11T20:11:01Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2013 08:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Stochasty\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ultra86","CreatedById":72695,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-11T20:34:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInteresting info on Ferram.
