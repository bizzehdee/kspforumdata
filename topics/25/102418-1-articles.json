The bomber, which would be called \u0022Silbervogel\u0022 (\u0022Silver Bird\u0022) would take off, reach a velocity of several kilometers per second and enter a ballistic trajectory. Once it will hit the atmosphere again, it will \u0022bounce\u0022 off the atmosphere, going on another, shorter ballistic trajectory. This would be repeated until the Bomber has made one \u0022orbit\u0022 and landed on it\u0027s home airfield. It would be capable of dropping a bomb onto virtually any city on the planet.\n\nYou must build a vessel with similar capabilities and objectives.\n\nRULES\n\n1. FAR is **required** for this challenge, **as the unrealistic stock aerodynamics would not allow** for bouncing off the atmosphere.\n\n2. Any part mods and/or plugins are allowed, **as long as no cheating takes place** (e.g. HyperEdit, etc... are **forbidden**). MechJeb is **not** recommended.\n\n3. Objective: Build a vessel, \n\nwhich can take off the runway,\n\nenter a ballistic trajectory,\n\nreach an altitude of at least 80.000 m ASL on the first ballistic trajectory,\n\n\u0022bounce\u0022 off the atmosphere without propulsion assistance (after entering the first ballistic trajectory, the engines may **not** be ignited anymore),\n\ndrop a payload of at least 3 tons above a point **far away** from the takeoff site (for example KSC 2), from an altitude of at least 30.000 m ASL,\n\ncircumfere Kerbin **one** time,\n\ndescend into the thick layers of the atmosphere again and,\n\nsafely land on the KSC runway.\n\n4. The vessel **must** have aerodynamic lift capability (note: because you have FAR, you can use lifting body), that would allow it to perform such a masterpiece of long-duration ballistic gliding.\n\n5. The vessel must be manned (at least **1** poor condemned kerbal).\n\n6. You may add a drone core to the bomb, and control its descent. To prevent the bomber from getting lost, **do not forget to save!**\n\n7. This is **not** a challenge to earn points, but to show off your crazy and insane evil overlord ideas to other people. My favorite entries will be listed.\n\n8. The usage of a launch sled or of a piggyback launch system is encouraged, but optional. This also means that stages may be dropped.\n\n9. OPTIONAL: After refueling, reloading the bomb and re-attaching any dropped stages and/or being reattached to the piggyback launch plane, the mission can be repeated.\n\n10. If any loopholes or uncertainities in the rules arise, inform me and I will modify the rules respectively.\n\n11. The Vessel may not enter orbit.\n\n*Sincerely, MedwedianPresident*\n\n**My favorite entries:**\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-25T18:11:03Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2015 06:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MedwedianPresident**"},{"CreatedByName":"MedwedianPresident","CreatedById":12212,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T15:23:12Z","Content":"Is nobody interested?"},{"CreatedByName":"borisperrons","CreatedById":76286,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T14:02:16Z","Content":"IMHO, this is a difficult challemge, but not impossible at all. I routinely do skip reentries with spaceplanes, so is definitely possible to perform a \u0022bouncing\u0022 trajectory, maybe not one as ambitious as Sanger envisioned, but still.\n\nYou should provide an entry of yours to show that is indeed possible, and to start competition. I\u0027ll definitely give this a go, since it\u0027s fairly challenging and let\u0027s face it, of all Amerika Bomber designs Sanger\u0027s was the craziest of them all, even better than Von Braun\u0027s piloted V2."},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T14:34:22Z","Content":"It would help if you defined how accurate the bomb needs to be. It\u0027s very hard to hit anything from altitude with an unguided bomb, but avoiding the need to ride it down would probably be better, and setting one target for everone would likely be best.\n\nSome landmark west of KSC? The pyramids? Or maybe KSC itself? That\u0027d allow a low-altitude bomb run and good explosions.\n\nYou also might want to add a \u0022no orbit\u0022 rule to stop folks from taking a dozen circuits to line it up.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-25T14:36:36Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2015 02:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wanderfound**"},{"CreatedByName":"MedwedianPresident","CreatedById":12212,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T18:10:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You also might want to add a \u0022no orbit\u0022 rule to stop folks from taking a dozen circuits to line it up.\n\nRules adjusted."},{"CreatedByName":"bs1110101","CreatedById":58438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T17:12:34Z","Content":"I\u0027ve tried this, though i cant get it to space easily, it always flips before it can get there.
