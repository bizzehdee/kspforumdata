No liquid fuel engines. No SRBs. Just air breathing turbines. (a ram jet is still a turbine, right?) \n\nVideo would be preferable to see that there really wasnt any liquid fuel engines used... \n\n**After thought**\n\nIf you can get back to Kerbin, awesome. If not, oh well. Not a requirement.\n\nIf this turns out to be not that hard, then lets see who can do it in the smallest jet. ![^_^](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_happy.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"NeatCrown","CreatedById":101431,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-30T17:10:10Z","Content":"SERIOUSLY!
