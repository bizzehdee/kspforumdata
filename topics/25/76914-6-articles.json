I got it just above the ground and gently touched it down at under 1m/s--at which point I discovered it wasn\u0027t sturdy enough to hold its weight in the gravity. (This was built in early 0.22 but took till late 0.23 to deploy to EVE due to Kraken effects in the craft) I was still able to parachute the craft to a few meters above the surface (near shore, so under 100m altitude) and then ignite engines and take off at the same time as I ditched the parachutes. I had been unable to completely fuel the craft due to kraken effects so its first stage was just over half full, but I brought enough extra Dv that it was alright. At the end I was near to exiting the atmosphere with one stage remaining but was unable to control the craft due to a powerful Kraken spin.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EI never figured out why the craft was acquiring so much phantom force or how to make it stop, but I can only assume the great Kraken did not wish me to succeed in my plan. But I see no reason to believe that with proper construction, a craft could use basically the same design as mine and have no trouble landing on low ground on EVE and take off into orbit. Oh and mine had a Mark 1 pod, not a probe core or EAS chair. I didn\u0027t think much about gravity because the way I tested my craft initially was to launch it into orbit around Kerbin, land it, and launch it back into orbit again. That ensured I had at least 9000 dV (without any calculations), and I used engines that could handle the thick atmosphere: mainsails and aerospikes primarily.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EAnyway, even though I didn\u0027t fully succeed due to phantom force bugs and lack of ability to test gravity on Kerbin, the large excess of dV I had even from a low altitude launch says a lot about the capabilities there. Now with the 2.5m quad couplers, I could probably make an even smaller one with only aerospikes that could launch from EVE\u0027s surface and also be capable of landing on it.
