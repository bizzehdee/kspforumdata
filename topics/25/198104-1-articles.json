The vehicle, known as the JFG-3\u00A0\u0022Strange Goose\u0022, is said to be capable of speeds somewhat over mach 1.0 in straight and level flight at most or all altitudes, powered by a pair of \u0022Derwent V\u0022 engines mounted on the wings.\u00A0Our own test pilots have confirmed to be the case.\u00A0The plane\u00A0handles nicely at almost all speeds and altitudes with the exception of mild wobble.\u00A0 Jeb is not permitted to fly under any circumstances until properly trained how not to break it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOur first order of business around 2 and a half months back\u00A0was to take the plane out for a spin with a disabled version of the rocket we wish to launch from it. The rocket is a pretty minimal little thing. Our Aerobee engine is just strapped to the most minimal of transponders we could acquire and some small stabilization fins have been equipped, behind a 4 meter long fuel tank that\u0027s sent more than a few ground crew to the hospital. This thing is basically a lance. Anyway, after the first flight Bill exclaimed that under no circumstances would he fly this mission without better evidence of its reliability. Seeing as Jeb was indeed scheduled to fly it, we had no choice but to go for a second flight with the payload attached. The Strange Goose was flown to an altitude of 16\u00A0kilometers, and broke level flight speeds of\u00A0 360 m/s. and was no worse for wear.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyway, the day after that, we took the thing on a proper flight. Our goal was simple: get the rocket past the Karman line. The Air Defense people were a bit surprised how minimalistic the rocket was, asking us why, when the launch aircraft is designed for ground attack roles, we don\u0027t put something a bit stronger on it? Maybe with multiple stages? Well, basically it comes down to time. We wanted a demonstration that we could reach 50 km and even the Karman\u00A0line\u00A0with an air-launched rocket as soon as possible, and Frankly\u00A0sending something to 200, 400, 800\u00A0kilometers\u00A0 up or whatnot would\u0027ve really strained the aircraft\u0027s\u00A0communications capabilities. It would be ashame to lose a rocket and a plane both because the pilot is too focused on the rocket. We don\u0027t want to lose track of the rocket either.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe flew quite a good number of flights with this little jet after launching the rocket, which turned out unstable and made it to 135 or so kilometers high. Val and Jeb told us that they thought they could set the crewed aircraft altitude record at 20 kilometers no problem. We told them the cabin would not remain pressurized at that altitude and they just laughed. Anyhow, they managed to jump out and back and neither of them lost consciousness, although I could have sworn Jeb sounded drowsy and said something completely incoherent about\u00A0a second before dropping back below the rated altitude.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn any case, we\u0027ve been getting a lot of funding and decided we should improve our manufacturing process. It\u0027s now much faster than just a few months back.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nDeciding to aim a bit further, we built a spin-stabilized rocket that used 3 stages to propel itself over a thousand kilometers high and about 3400 kilometers away. The thing dwarfed our previous design with our RD-100 engine powering it\u0027s flight. We joked that it was the \u0022Bad Neighbor Mk1\u0022 although to be honest it probably couldn\u0027t hit the same postal code as anyone who had a problem with it. The second stage had four of our Aerobees and the third had just one and yet again a 4-meter pike for a fuel tank. We decided against trying to aim for the Azores on the off chance we might rain rocket parts there, although to be honest I think it was more for the bragging rights of being the first one to send a rocket a million meters high that we didn\u0027t take such a flat trajectory. That rocket was huge. I think it\u0027s honestly maybe a foot below the hangar doors.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyway, we used most of the grant money to try to build rockets faster. Our next rocket took just 18 days to construct and had one simple mission. Put some equipment up at 70 km high or more. Three aerobees, a tank (thankfully not a giant spear this time), a guidance unit and an aerodynamic cone later, the thing is probably the cheapest standalone vehicle we\u0027ve ever made. It\u0027s one stage. We decided to make a backup of it in case something went wrong, although it\u0027s hard to imagine anything would with this. It foregoes fins for pure gyrojet spin stabilization. Val said she thought she saw it spin out up there, but the radar doesn\u0027t lie. It made it within 2-3 kilometers of its projected height of 97 km. I think if it spun out it must have been well above the thick of the atmosphere.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt this point our new launch pad is underway, but it\u0027s gonna take awhile. They told us it could be mid-1952 before we can use the pad, but I think they\u0027re underestimated just how fast this stuff can be built. I give it February 1952 at the latest. It is projected that should we succeed in developing an orbital rocket with a controllable payload, it will need at minimum a 50-tonne booster to get it up there. Possibly considerably more.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nUntil then, We will need to see if these rockets can power aircraft, or maybe we could work something out with the air defense ministry for some faster jets. Mach 1 is plenty for a fighter but to be honest, we need something a bit faster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-11-15T14:54:35Z\u0022 title=\u002211/15/2020 02:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 15, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Pds314\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pds314","CreatedById":70014,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-16T11:30:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat can\u0027t be done with early Jets can be done with MOAR early jets.\u00A0Don\u0027t worry everything is supposed to be on fire.
