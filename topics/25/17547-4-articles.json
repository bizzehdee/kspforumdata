Here, the control surfaces are inert. I am pretty sure the bug doesn\u0027t work under those circumstances; certainly all the gliders I\u0027ve been firing seem to work normally, except one very specific version of the Angel. I\u0027m fairly certain that the apparently infinitely gliding version of the Angel is glitched because the physics engine is rounding something to zero - it only works at extremely low speeds (like... 3 m/s and below).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I\u0027ve taken to turning the booster backwards and using it as a cannon to fire the Angel (the normal version) into the air. Much simpler, and kinda fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Testing the Infinite Glide Glitch at the launch pad. It does work without a capsule or SAS, but results in a comically hovering object. I now have space junk hovering over my launch pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: You also need a *lot* of canards without SAS.

I\u0027m guessing it really is some sort of zero in the system. My normal Angel doesn\u0027t act like that; it slows down and loses altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Oh, man, you CAN create some sort of Inverse Space Kraken! I put 48 canards on a single decoupler and blasted it with the big booster, and the whole screen is shaking. The behavior is BIZZARE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: 96 canards creates an unholy monster that shakes crazily and accelerates skywards. Hmm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: It\u0027s definitely some sort of Kraken-like floating point glitch. The 96 canard version just shook itself into structural damage and is shedding canards like a dandelion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: It looks like a giant version of those stupid spinner hubcaps. The inner ring of canards looks like it\u0027s somehow spinning faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Has anyone else fired off unmanned magic turbines of this size before? This is some crazy stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I suspect the unmanned versions of these are ultimately unstable.
