This is relative to current and near-future (by 2030s) human space technology.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, an Ion engine in the tens Kilonewton ranges would be considered cheaty because they are far superior in thrust than the stock Ion engine. It is also far more powerful than current or near future human Ion engines. MechJeb, including its informational and autopiloting features are certainly well within current space technology. Automated attitude is available from the even first satellite launches. Every feature it provides is also possible with manual piloting. So MechJeb is not considered cheaty. Kethane and Ioncross Life Support are also on the allowed list: In-Situ production of rocket fuel and oxygen / water from Mars are definitely possible with current / near future technology. They are also used by several existing entries already.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Patupi","CreatedById":71098,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T18:19:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat was the main reason I didn\u0027t use the Ion drives and Hybrid Ion drives from the IonHybridElectric mod. Their scaled parts (RTGs, solar panels, Xenon tanks and batteries) are pretty good, but their ion drives are more powerful than the stock ones. Not overly so, but for this game I assumed that was out. Besides, Ion takes so long to accelerate and without Quantum struts the ship wobbles a lot under physical time warp on acceleration. I really don\u0027t want to have sit here and babysit a drive for half an hour to an hour for the exit burn!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOut of interest, you mentioned Extraplanetary Launchpads before. Do you consider that \u0027Cheaty\u0027 now? My personal thoughts would be no, but limit how fast they can produce parts. IE set a tonnage per day allowance (Minus fuel). If someone builds a 40 ton ship, you should wait, say, 20 days before actually constructing it to simulate construction time. Actually, since fuel would be supplied via kethane a 1:1 ratio (1 ton takes 1 day) might be better. The fuel used in construction comes from the ship building it so shouldn\u0027t be taken into account on construction times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might (once I finish this mammoth enterprise) consider doing it over with ELP just to see how it works.

Weighs in at 25.03tons and is stackable. The engines are just for de-orbit burn, not really for re-entry, though they can be used to soften landings. So they can run on six, or even four of the engines if one or more fails. I\u0027m hoping with Drogue and main chutes it should be enough to land this fairly softly, even in Duna\u0027s light atmosphere. Might be adding in a skycrane to lift this back to orbit if necessary, or just to a new landing site further than the wheels can take it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote the Habitat has enough RTGs to supply it normally, but rover acceleration on wheels drains batteries.

I think i like the idea of supplies better, since kerbals will need not only food and water, but tools, games, musical instruments, and whatnots.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are more than welcome to make your design more realistic than required by the rules. Thus you can use either the \u0022stock\u0022 supply rule, a life support mod, or some combination of them, for example, a relaxed \u0022stock\u0022 supply rule (say 0.5 units of supply per Kerbal per day when you use Ioncross to generate oxygen). If we consider the challenge as a simulation of the initial manned Mars missions in 2030s timeframe, a regenerative oxygen supply system would be quite possible, but a greenhouse system that produces enough food for crew would seem unlikely. Considering such factors may not help the scores, but people including me would appreciate this added realism.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-30T15:33:35Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2013 03:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by sturmstiger\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hogdriver","CreatedById":33264,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T19:14:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey there, awesome challange!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan i use Ferram Aerospace Research?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sturmstiger","CreatedById":60543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T19:47:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hogdriver\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hogdriver\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHey there, awesome challange!\u003Cp\u003ECan i use Ferram Aerospace Research?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes.

I was adding in some supplies as well mainly as backup, assuming Ioncross handled support but added in some other stuff to handle emergencies (or for Jeb to get his Petite Fois and those little cakes with the silver balls on). The station will have supplies, and the Regular ships that shuttle back and forth will, everything else won\u0027t (perhaps a separate drop near the habitats in case of emergency). As far as it not updating when you\u0027re not in the ship, that\u0027s a recurring theme in mods. It\u0027s hard to handle things happening when you aren\u0027t in control. I\u0027m sure they\u0027ll figure it out sooner or later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand about EPL, though personally I\u0027d have preferred to have just limited it the way KSC launches are to regulate speed of construction, but fair enough. It is pretty powerful as it stands... though actually landing one of those pads and the assorted equipment that goes with it is a challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now I\u0027ve just been going through the crew launch vessel and having difficulty. Me and space planes don\u0027t go well together. I\u0027ve recently managed to get my design skills up enough to make a good plane that handles well full or dry, but making it SSTO is tricky. I\u0027ve done one Kerbal SSTOs but I really didn\u0027t want to ferry them up one at a time! So I tried to build a three person space plane and got a pretty good one. Stable on launch, a little slow on climb on jets, but it made it up to 23,000m fairly well and then the rockets burned well up to orbit. Even managed to dock OK too. Landing... well, the less said about that the better! Safe to say it imbalanced once the rocket fuel was used up and I guess the center of mass was behind the center of lift... it didn\u0027t make it. I tried redesign a few times, and things got gradually worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end I gave up and went for an SSTO rocket. Got a good one, single stage, carrying 4 Kerbals up, nice control and landed well too.... but was too many parts. When it got near any orbital stuff it lagged too much. So I went for totally re-usable two stage one. Smaller versions of the BHL\u0027s parachuting boosters basically. For re-entry I had a nice idea, use a rotatatron to spin a heat shield with holes in it so you could burn engines, then spin the shield so it protected them on re-entry.... didn\u0027t work. Even with careful strutting the top and bottom of the rotatatron it flopped like mad! I guess the joint of the bearing itself is very weak. Though it didn\u0027t actually come off. Did a very funny dance on the bottom of the rocket though!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end I did the same as the BHL. Uprate the fuel tankage and save some for re-entry to slow to avoid re-entry effects. Works better on the Crew transport than on the BHL actually. No flares at all. I don\u0027t have pictures to hand right now but I\u0027ll get some later.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThreeMartiniLaunch","CreatedById":62595,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T01:03:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDuna has changed!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd not just in appearance (which is awesome, BTW).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve flown dozens if not hundreds of Duna missions.

Is there a weight requirement? Does the shielding have to go anywhere in particular? Most of the ships I\u0027ve seen in this thread have the heat shields near the front of the craft.
