NO CHEATS/DEBUGGING! Again, test your engineering, not hacking.\n\n3. Post photos of: \n\njjjjjA. The entire craft in the VAB or SPH with Craft Info in the lower corner\n\n jjjjjB. Launch\n\n jjjjjC. Any important events\n\n jjjjjD. Your final orbit with the MET in the corner and Apo and Peri visible\n\n jjjjjE. The final ship\n\n4.

Now including these orbits would make an even more interesting challenge, because it is going to be a lot harder to get the pinpoint orbit you want when you have to deal with atmospheric drag, and you cannot just simply leave your spacecraft up at that altitude (I think) without it being deleted, so you would have to have a second spacecraft separate and get out of loading range. Engineering and piloting skills would be a lot more prevalent in that type of challenge.\n\nJust my 2 cents, this challenge is pretty easy as it is, and I think has been done before.
