I haven\u0027t done an ore scan of Gilly yet, but with 1.0, running out of fuel isn\u0027t a huge concern any more. I would think, that in order to stay on the ground while drilling that KAS grappling hooks would be a very good thing. I used them on an airship recently and they do a great job of keeping you planted on the surface. Beyond that, keeping pointed in the direction you want to go would be the biggest challenge.\n\u003E One thought I just had, instead of RCS to keep you on the ground, how about Ions pointed downward?\n\nOooh, nice idea!

Two questions:\n\u003E 1) Can I do it on Pol/Gilly? I only ask because I imagine that half the time will be airborne, just because of towering mountains and low gravity.\n\nAny and every orbital body is open to this challenge. If you can find a way to survive the surface of Kerbol, I\u0027ll allow it. As far as low gravity is concerned, I\u0027m of this mindset: Thus far, I have not disallowed fueled engines. I understand that not everyone wants to take a week to do what I did. But, on low gravity bodies there\u0027s going to be a fine line between driving around it on wheels and orbiting at an extremely low altitude. If I see a NERVA sticking out the back of your vehicle, there will be some serious questions. If I see Ions on the roof pointing downward, it\u0027s pretty obvious you\u0027re using them to keep yourself on the ground. Even RCS on a ground based vehicle will cause me to raise an eyebrow, though I understand it\u0027s usefulness.\n\nThis challenge is not about how fast you can complete it nor whether you can find a way to circumvent it\u0027s intent (not saying you are). This challenge exists for the same reason Magellan and Elcano left Seville, Spain... exploration and adventure. Stick to that and your questions should answer themselves.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 2) Do I have to GET to Pol/Gilly, or can I Hyperedit there?\n\nI personally like the challenge of getting the vehicle to it\u0027s destination but I also understand that could take some extreme efforts with the new aerodynamics. So here\u0027s where I\u0027ll draw the line on this question. If you wish to hyperedit, I won\u0027t know unless you tell me. BUT, I will look to see if you\u0027ve landed your vehicle from a \u0027reasonable\u0027 orbit altitude. Don\u0027t just plop yourself on the surface and start driving. Keep in mind, the first explorers of Earth had to face challenges beyond just what they found on land, they had to deal with the [doldrums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doldrums) as well."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T17:31:34Z","Content":"![L1Zo6yq.png](http://i.imgur.com/L1Zo6yq.png)\n\nCRN-07 is in development...\n\nEDIT:\n\n**Vroom, Vroom**...\n\n![4xNLdE0.png](http://i.imgur.com/4xNLdE0.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T17:51:04Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 05:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Starwhip**"},{"CreatedByName":"hobbes365","CreatedById":142635,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T17:42:42Z","Content":"First time threat visitor, but I just want to commend anyone who attempts this adventure, for I spent only a few hours before I succumbed to back spasms and hand cramps in my attempt around Kerbin.
