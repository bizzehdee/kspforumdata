Thanks to anyone who reviews it!\n\nHi cubinator ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nFirst to approve your Expedition ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nWhat a looooong journey with lots of nice pics !\n\nAnd congrat\u0027s for being the first to make the ISRU Jool 5 Challenge ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nA lot of tries on Eve, no success, but i know that Eve SSTO is another challenge... ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nThat\u0027s OK for me, lot of work, landed on everything but Eve with 4 Kerbals, with a single ship fully recovered..., well done !!!"},{"CreatedByName":"Whovian","CreatedById":101923,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-11T22:41:57Z","Content":"I ... just sent a ship out, spent a number of hours missioning, landed on Laythe, and was about to land on Tylo ... then I noticed I\u0027d had HyperEdit installed the whole time (as I\u0027d been using it to test my Laythe SSTO and forgot to uninstall it for the actual mission). Do I need to do-over everything or is this okay? I should clarify that I never actually used HyperEdit during the mission.\n\nEDIT: Nvmd, looks like my Tylo lander doesn\u0027t work so it\u0027s quite irrelevant.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-11T23:58:42Z\u0022 title=\u002209/11/2015 11:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Whovian**"}]}
