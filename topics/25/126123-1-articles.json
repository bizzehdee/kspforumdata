Stock parts, stock physics. No FAR, no part mods, no config editing.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. No cheat menu. Don\u0026#39;t alter aerodynamics, thermodynamics, crash resistance, fuel levels, or anything else you could access with Alt-F12.\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. Runs should be performed on Kerbin.\u003Cbr\u003E\n4. Vehicle must survive the run intact unless staging events are required. Vehicle which stage may or may not be accepted onto the leaderboards and will be reviewed on a case by case basis.\u003Cbr\u003E\n5. Vehicle cannot leave the water\u0026#39;s surface at any time during the run. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nScore is maximum speed, given via the F3 menu. Videos are preferred for judging; be sure to include lots of screenshots during the run if you choose not to record.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor now there\u0026#39;s going to be one general leaderboard. If there\u0026#39;s significant interest in this I may add more categories later on (FAR runs, runs on Eve, rocket/jet powered, manned/unmanned, etc). I may also add bonuses/multipliers (breaking the real record, multiple kerbals, I don\u0026#39;t know).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nShare boat designs. Figure out how to move quickly over the seas. Viciously compete for every decimeter per second of speed. Really anything within the rules goes. I would include an example run but I think this is simple enough for most people to get intuitively, and I\u0026#39;ve yet to master boating in 1.0.5. This thread is as much for me to see boat design techniques as it is to see who can make the fastest boat. :P\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nLEADERBOARDS:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSTOCK:\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou?\u003Cbr\u003E\n[URL=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/140237-Water-Speed-Record?p=2316876\u0026viewfull=1#post2316876\u0022]ABalazs[/URL]- 345m/s [B]\u0026lt;-First to break Mach 1![/B]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[URL=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/140237-Water-Speed-Record?p=2309527\u0026viewfull=1#post2309527\u0022]Gaarst[/URL]- 252m/s\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFAR:\u003Cbr\u003E\n[URL=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/140237-Water-Speed-Record?p=2312289\u0026viewfull=1#post2312289\u0022]Pds314[/URL]- 295.3m/s\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-26T23:28:44Z\u0022 title=\u002211/26/2015 11:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jodo42\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T03:20:45Z","Content":"\nGoing to make a huge hydrofoil!!!!\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlipNascar","CreatedById":137605,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T13:52:30Z","Content":"\nSo I have been tying to build a Mach 1 capable hydrofoil...
