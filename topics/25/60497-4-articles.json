You saw how many rotors the HELO: B had relative to its size- its TWR st sea-level is around 7.5 or 8 or with Cargo Throttle, and the rotors make up more than 40% of vessel-mass, and yet its top sustainable speed is only around 135 m/s, and it physically can\u0027t fly faster than 150-154 m/s (for the record, doubling the TWR won\u0027t double the top-speed- it\u0027ll increase it maybe 40-50%, since helicopter rotors work best near sea-level, where you get a lot of drag- which increases exponentially, eventually forcing you to fly higher-up, where rotors have much lower TWR...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI COULD do it with jets, or I could do it with wings- the issue that must be overcome is a helicopter rotor\u0027s velocity-curve (which is so limited as to make achieving an 175 m/s circumnavigation with electric rotors alone impossible).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWings have no velocity-curve, in fact they work better at higher speeds.

For those curious how the \u0027Hornet\u0027 achieved 240 m/s, but conventional electric helicopters can\u0027t, there were 3 reasons: (1) It utilized jet plane propellers mounted vertically instead of much lower-TWR helicopter rotors. Basically, just smaller, and thus more mass-efficient, rotors. (2) It had a small rocket on the rear. That only provided 0.4 kN of thrust- but that would be the equivalent of 2-3 kN of thrust with my much larger HELO: B, and it was subject to no velocity-curve. (3) Most importantly, it had significant wing area relative to its mass. Those wings were oriented such as to push it further down in a dive, keeping the helicopter low to the ground where props work best even when the props were throttled up to insane TWR (more than 10). Even so, the wings were oriented such as to work best in a dive, and its speed of 240 m/s was in a dive- it could only sustain MAYBE 160-170 m/s in sustained 60-70 degree flight... (wings mounted closer to perpendicular to the rotors work much better for level flight at angles of attack more than 20 degrees below the horizon- but it was designed for the much thinner atmosphere of Duna, where any angle of attack more than 12-15 degrees below the horizon would produce insufficient vertical \u0022thrust\u0022 to avoid a crash...)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-02T12:23:05Z\u0022 title=\u002202/02/2014 12:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-02T12:28:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK, so I made a little light modification to the HELO: Model B, and switched the two 6m Structural Fuselages for 6m Cargo Bays.

The design doesn\u0027t have room for sufficiently large vertical wings (I tried finding a good place for them)- so I\u0027m either going to have to spam a ton of small wing pieces (which have less lift relative to their mass), or get a rules change to allow some kind of non-propeller engine...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPerhaps an allowance could be made for use fission-powered thermal turbojets\u003C/strong\u003E- which have rather anemic thrust, extremely high mass relative to that thrust (over 2 tons for about 40-60 kN, with a reduced nuclear fuel load, including the weight of both a reactor and a TTJ nozzle) and burn no fuel?

Their main (only) advantage for me over props would be their superior altitude and velocity curves (they behave similarly to stock turbojets in terms of ISP and thrust with speed and altitude), which would allow me to mount a nozzle (like I said, it would use the existing reactor) on the back of my helicopter, and perhaps some small horizontal winglets for control/stability and a bit of lift, and be able to probably hit speeds of about 200-250 m/s (enough to circumnavigate Kerbin in under 6 hours).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, to repeat myself- if I added only 1 nozzle, it would simply be fully utilizing the existing reactor- passing air over it to make use of the leftover ThermalPower that the generator doesn\u0027t need...

Even a small amount of forward thrust that doesn\u0027t fall off with altitude like rotors do, near max altitude, would be more than enough to achieve 400 m/s- especially with a little bit of lift to help keep it aloft as well. For TTJ power and weight, though, it really varies a lot by the type of reactor you use...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thermal turbojets have a velocity curve that really only starts falling off after about 800 m/s (that\u0027s about 95% of orbital velocity on Duna- falsely leading a player who used them on the Flying Duna Challenge to conclude that they have no velocity curve, getting ALL KSP-Interstellar put in a separate category as a result, similar to all nuclear craft here... This is even though theirs is in fact a significantly less generous velocity curve than stock turbojets), and hit a peak ISP at around 5000-6000 m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheir maximum rated thrust of the jets is 300 kN- but you\u0027ll only ever achieve that with antimatter reactors (which it\u0027s difficult to obtain enough antimatter for to last more than a few minutes...) With the lowest-level standard fission reactors, they obtain about 35-45 kN with Uranium and 50-60 kN with Thorium. KSP-Interstellar just introduced a new reactor, however, which might be more powerful under certain operating conditions and with certain designs (you might have to keep the throttle down a bit, counter intuitively, to obtain maximum thrust- for instance...), and that is also a bit lighter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KSP-Interstellar reactors are based on real-world designs (or proposed designs) and operating statistics, adjusted a bit for KSP-scale, but the basic 1.25m Uranium reactors with a full nuclear fuel load weigh 2.5 tons (the Thermal Turbojets themselves an additional 0.4 tons)- with a 10% fuel load you can get it down to 1.6 tons of weight with Uranium. I don\u0027t know how much the upgraded reactors weigh. Thorium weighs a bit less, but uses the same basic or upgraded reactor, yet I don\u0027t know how much Thorium weighs on reduced fuel load (which I highly recommend- the default, full fuel load of a uranium reactor is enough to last around a game-year on idle or over 7 months on full power- though thorium burns through a good bit quicker). You can adjust reactor loading via tweakables, or using a plugin like TAC Fuel Balancer after launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENice call using the Infernal Robotics part to rotate the rotors, by the way. Although, I\u0027m curious though- did your rotors clip through the craft when you did that? Except for slightly-overlapping wing segments, I consider part-clipping anathema, and strongly avoid it at all costs- as I consider it to be \u0022cheating\u0022. Even the HELO-B, if you look closely at a few of the close-up pics (I intentionally took some of the pictures to show this), doesn\u0027t have *ANY* part-clipping.

Their base thrust is 80 kN, and 120 kN on full Cargo Throttle- like I had them in those screenshots. However, due to rotors having very velocity curves, their thrust tends to fall off very quickly when reaching high speeds- as is clearly demonstrated here, where the thrust is quite a bit greater at the *higher* altitude due to the somewhat lower craft velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s for this reason that circumnavigating Kerbin in 6 hours (requiring an AVERAGE speed of 175 m/s) is *absolutely impossible* for an electric helicopter without either including vertical wings in the design and tipping the craft over so it flies like a plane; or utilizing jet, thermal turbojet, rocket, or ion/plasmodynamic/ATILA engines (all essentially versions of the ion engine concept- listed in order of increasing thrust). The design doesn\u0027t have room for sufficiently large vertical wings (I tried finding a good place for them)- so I\u0027m either going to have to spam a ton of small wing pieces (which have less lift relative to their mass), or get a rules change to allow some kind of non-propeller engine...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPerhaps an allowance could be made for use fission-powered thermal turbojets\u003C/strong\u003E- which have rather anemic thrust, extremely high mass relative to that thrust (over 2 tons for about 40-60 kN, with a reduced nuclear fuel load, including the weight of both a reactor and a TTJ nozzle) and burn no fuel? (they rely on reactor heat instead) I already have a place for one on the back of the helicopter (the reactor is in the perfect position- I need only slap on a TTJ nozzle and an air intake- though the turbojet nozzle would compete with my electric generator for reactor output...) Their main (only) advantage for me over props would be their superior altitude and velocity curves (they behave similarly to stock turbojets in terms of ISP and thrust with speed and altitude), which would allow me to mount a nozzle (like I said, it would use the existing reactor) on the back of my helicopter, and perhaps some small horizontal winglets for control/stability and a bit of lift, and be able to probably hit speeds of about 200-250 m/s (enough to circumnavigate Kerbin in under 6 hours).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, to repeat myself- if I added only 1 nozzle, it would simply be fully utilizing the existing reactor- passing air over it to make use of the leftover ThermalPower that the generator doesn\u0027t need...
