The issue is that after 1.0.5, making shuttles became way easier, and adding to the astronaut corps manually in the OP at this time seems a bit pointless. heh.  \n\nI only posted this challenge to get people to fly the STS and get excited about shuttles. Mission accomplished! The badges though are really cool, and for that reason alone, this challenge still remains, but remains with the self-certifying provision. So if you think you meet the qualifications for a badge, wear it! :)  \n\nConcerning your space station: as long as all required modules were installed by a space shuttle, it qualifies."},{"CreatedByName":"inigma","CreatedById":69310,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T17:08:42Z","Content":"FCISuperGuy has graciously offered to take over management of the STS Challenges.
