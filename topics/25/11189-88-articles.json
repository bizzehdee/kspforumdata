It also spreads heat to other parts of the plane rather than just the front.\n\nI see in your explody pictures the angle of attack is almost zero. You should still have a high angle (about 30 degrees is good) as you go below 40 000m, and keep it there until you get below 1200 m/s in velocity. You should be able to get to that speed roughly above 15 000m in altitude.\n\nIf your space plane can\u0027t hold that angle for you, check your centre of mass and centre of lift in the SPH, (check with full and empty fuel tanks), maybe add a canard. You won\u0027t need retrorockets or firing rockets in the atmosphere. \n\nGood luck and I like the look of your space plane, like a bat-space-plane!"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-20T13:17:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, iLikeRovers said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hi cubinator, I couldn\u0027t help notice your overheating problems during re-entry.

During its design phase, this vehicle decided that it really wanted to become a spaceplane when it grows up, and it seems that it managed to get there.  \n\nEasy, carefree handling and fuel to spare for a Minmus return mission (documented below), a bit more tricky and tighter margins for a Mun trip (**not** documented).  \n\nNotable spaceplaney peculiarities:\n\n- externally mounted RTG - the only heat protection is vehicle angle of attack (see bottom edge of vertical stab)\n- no fuel lines from wing parts, because of 30-part budget. (I almost forgot to transfer the fuel on the mission!)\n- **brake chute** for landing, **a feature that I strongly recommend for novice plane designers** because it makes landings much easier\n- design flaw: when trying to board, *interesting* collision physics emanating from the air intake may deny admission to the cabin by catapulting the pilot across the scenery. (Barely managed to board, took a few attemps!)\n- rear landing light implemented by mounting the front landing gear backwards\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/46tr4/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"manni01","CreatedById":109903,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-20T19:40:28Z","Content":"So this is my new and fancy 20t *Duna Cargo SSTO*\n\nIt can bring 20 tons of payload to the surface of Duna and then fly back, of course after refueling. \n\nHere\u0027s my mission video.

I was utterly unconfident in the reentry and landing, but the stable center of mass really helped with both, I think. I was amazed that the Gigantors didn\u0027t explode, though they came close; reentry heat must be modeling occlusion pretty well. The blooper slide at the end was caused by opening the chutes before touchdown.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-28T20:14:55Z\u0022 title=\u002203/28/2017 08:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 28, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by HebaruSan**"},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-04T10:31:50Z","Content":"Congratulations to... \n\n[GGKSPMC](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/11189-the-k-prize-100-reusable-spaceplane-to-orbit-and-back/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=2468577) did it!

It would be nice to see a screeny of the ship and maybe get its name if you have a moment and in the meantime rather than disallow it I have allowed it on principle but added the truth in brackets, which can be removed in the case that you want to make a more specific report, which doesnt have to be images, can simply be text!
