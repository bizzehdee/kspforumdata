The new upper atmosphere skin drag makes it a lot harder to get a big tanker up with a worthwhile amount of fuel, and I\u0027ve been struggling to design something useful in that class.\n\nSo, that\u0027s the challenge: build a spaceplane tanker, take it to orbit, deliver fuel to whatever space station target you feel like, land it back at KSC. Two leaderboards for each of FAR and stock: one for total fuel delivered, one for fuel/\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1 flight cost after recovery. Fuel delivery must be a balanced LF/O mix.\n\nTo keep it interesting, and put the focus on efficiency and good design rather than CPU capacity, there\u0027s a maximum part count limit of 150. Must be crewed, must be a HOTOL spaceplane, stock parts only.

Where corners could be cut, they were cut, where they couldn\u0027t - a hammer was applied liberally. Seeing the part count limitation, they unanimously agreed to use the biggest, baddest parts they could find lying around, and then see if the result can be thrown out to space.\n\nThe result is the [Poofy Jaarthus](http://kerbalx.com/juzeris/Poofy%20Jaarthus.craft), already affectionately nicknamed \u0027Pain\u0027 by the pilots. It does not do anything properly - it want to tilt sideways on the runway, flip over while in the air, lose altitude while in the stratosphere, run out of electricity while in space, doesn\u0027t want to do anything at all while docking, plummet straight down while landing and drive into buildings when finally landed. This and more are, of course, the reasonable result of it being light on wings, having no control surfaces, only one battery and reactor and no solar panels, no RCS, just two struts and, well, somebody forgot to install brakes on the landing gear for the virgin flight, but at least the last one is now fixed (probably). \n\nOn the other hand - on the virgin flight it delivered **14400 units of fuel** (one full Kerbodyne S3-14400 tank equivalent) to LKO (80x80) for a measly 11747 funds, of which 6610 funds were for the fuel itself, so fuel in orbit now costs only **0.816 fund per unit**, which is only 77% more than on the ground!\n\nOperating manual - action groups:\n\n1 - Rocket engine\n\n2 - A few turbojet engines (4 probably)\n\n3 - The remaining 16 turbojet engines\n\n4 - The majority of air intakes, with them closed it should fly just fine to maybe 12km or so\n\nStaging - this will immediately disable the rocket engine, so feel free to launch the craft by staging\n\nOperating manual - flight instructions:\n\n1 - While taking off, keep pitching up, otherwise the rear wheels might lose grip and the plane fall over sideways.\n\n2 - While low in the souposphere autopilot will most likely be inadequate, but it behaves mostly fine under manual control, your mileage may vary.\n\n3 - Try to hit at least 29 km altitude with a reasonable amount of vertical velocity and at least 1700m/s of orbital velocity, it should be capable of reaching that without (relatively) too much trouble before engaging the rockets. Then run the rocket and some jet engines in parallel.\n\n4 - Docking is a bit harder with just one rocket engine, don\u0027t forget to keep changing between control points\n\n5 - It has a big battery, but with engines off electricity production is minimal, conserve it\n\n6 - Landing - it should survive a landing at a vertical velocity of -5 m/s, -8 is pushing it. Even empty it needs a high angle of attack to maintain altitude and at that AoA it loses velocity very quickly and plummets to the ground. You\u0027ll have to land with engines hot, probably running at least group 2 at half thrust.

Admittedly we did hyperedit the benchmark station into a 80x80 orbit at about 50 km distance from the spaceplane, but now that we know the ascent time (from the screenshots!) an orbital ascent with a 50 km margin of error (that\u0027s ~21 second) does not sound completely unreasonable. Also we finished with a little bit of space fuel leftover, which could reasonably be used to achieve a more distant rendezvous. Also no Kerbals were sitting in the craft, but it does have a cockpit for two and it would not present any physics changes, so I hope that\u0027s fine.\n\nWhile it does look a bit loaded with air intakes, it also has lots of jet engines, resulting in only 2.3 intake per jet engine, which would look completely normal on a more reasonably sized craft."},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T21:02:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If anyone wants a practical stock drone SSTO spaceplane tanker, here ya go:\n\u003E [http://wikisend.com/download/570898/PeaceFrogII.craft](http://wikisend.com/download/570898/PeaceFrogII.craft)\n\nNice craft, Slashy!

I\u0027m used to limiting myself to 15 tonnes/turbojet and my favourite setup is 2 ram intakes/turbojet which is more than enough. So that\u0027s what I used for my first attempt. But with over 20 tonnes of mass, 2 rams is not enough. After flying the Peacefrog III, I ran the numbers. 20 tonnes needs .026 m^2, but two rams is only .020 m^2. It made all the difference. I did managed to cajole it into orbit eventually, but I needed lots of rocket burn to establish my apo above 70 and ate into my payload to do it.\n\nFive radials is .030 m^2 which is exactly the intake area of three rams. Going from two to three made all the difference. I could have gotten away with two rams and a single radial according to the numbers.\n\nAnyway, I hope to get the mission completed and posted later today. Real life keeps getting in the way.\n\nHappy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T14:02:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E My standard configuration, and yours.

They will add up in a hurry.\n\n By the time it\u0027s all said and done, it\u0027s probably going to wind up in a weight range where the old Mk2 parts are preferable.\n\n I\u0027ll take a look at it in the next few days.\n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T23:10:47Z","Content":"All right, I have two entries.
