This challenge is to design and land a glider-style vehicle from Kerbin orbit without using parachutes or rocket-assisted touchdown, using as few wings and control surfaces as possible. In other words, design a stubby-winged flying paperweight that can just barely glide in for a safe landing. The fewer wings, the higher your score!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ENOTE: FAR (Ferram Aerospace Research mod) aerodynamics are encouraged, but not required, for this challenge.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMotivation: NASA experimented with \u0022lifting bodies\u0022 in the 1960\u0027s and \u002770\u0027s as a compromise between a ballistic, capsule-style re-entry vehicle and a winged, Space Shuttle-style vehicle. The idea was to come up with a flying capsule that was just barely controllable enough to allow for a runway landing but without the design challenges of building large wings and control surfaces that would be prone to burning up and disintegrating during re-entry. Check out the \u0022lifting body\u0022 article on Wikipedia for more background.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScoring:\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cem\u003ENote: Stock speed bonus has been updated!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour total score is your Base Score times any bonus multipliers you earn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBase Score: Your base score will be (\u003Cem\u003Emass\u003C/em\u003E)/(\u003Cem\u003Elift\u003C/em\u003E), where mass is the mass of the vehicle at landing and lift is the sum total lift of all the lifting surfaces on the vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBonus Multipliers: There will be a 2x skill multiplier for landing on the flat plain around KSC and a 5x skill multiplier for landing and stopping completely on the KSC runway (you only get one or the other, not both).

No power is allowed after you re-enter the atmosphere, and your re-entry speed at 70 km must be at least 2000 m/s (in the Orbit reference frame). No fuel use allowed below 70km or 2000 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Stock only, except that FAR is highly encouraged for realism. There will be separate FAR and non-FAR divisions. Mods that don\u0027t affect parts or physics, like Kerbal Engineer and Kerbal Alarm Clock, are OK. Kerbal Engineer is encouraged to show ship mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. No MechJeb. Part of the challenge is to pilot it yourself! (Plus I suspect that MechJeb would not be able to fly the highly optimized trajectories that the best entries will undoubtedly need.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. No parachutes and no destructive lithobraking. The entire craft that re-enters the atmosphere must land intact in one piece. Do all your fuel burning, jettisoning, staging, etc before you re-enter the atmosphere (i.e. above 70 km).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Using sneaky tactics to circumvent the intended spirit of the challenge is discouraged. In particular, to discourage the abuse of the wide and flat structural panels as \u003Cem\u003Ede facto\u003C/em\u003E wings, the M-1 and M-2 structural panels will each be assigned a lift value of 2.0 for scoring purposes. (This matters in FAR.) Flagrant abuse of other wide, flat parts may result in lift values being assigned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. No abuses of unrealistic physics. This means no significant part clipping, no spamming massless parts, no infiniglides, no Kerbal ladder drives, no kraken drives, etc. As a rule of thumb for part clipping, no part should be more than 5-10% clipped, if even that much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Documentation: Post screenshots, movies, or other info clearly showing your ship design; your velocity, fuel, and mass at 70km; your velocity, fuel, and mass shortly before touchdown; your velocity, fuel, and mass shortly after touchdown; and your position, fuel, and mass at full stop. Also clearly document the total lift of your vehicle. Additional screen caps and narration detailing your adventure are of course encouraged!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. The craft must have some kind of kerbal capsule or active probe core on it. This isn\u0027t a competition to find the most robust part and drop it onto the runway from orbit. \u003Cem\u003EAs of September 17th, asteroids are specifically disallowed\u003C/em\u003E although Goduranus submitted an asteroid-drop entry before this date, which will be grandfathered into the standings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStandings:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR Division:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
