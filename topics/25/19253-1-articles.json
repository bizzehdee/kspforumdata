This is halocon720, the TBIT Founder and CEO, back with another challenge. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday, the astronomers at the KASA Radio Telescope Array detected a strange radio signal coming from the Mun. They suspect that the signal has something to do with the strange black monoliths found by unmanned probes and manned missions alike. Your task is to locate these monoliths and place an unmanned research lander to perform further studies. Unfortunately, the KASA ISA MapSat array around the Mun was destroyed in a horrific accident involving lasers and a very bored Jeb Kerman, so you will not be able to use satellite mapping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERules:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

The lift stage is pretty normal stuff. After that you have the transfer stage which has 2 sollar pannel just for fun. The rover has 2 4 pannels to power it on site and during the long flight to target. After that the transfer stage seperates and the rover has its own 2 lander boosters. The buggy lands on its wheels and can use the remaining fuel in the landing booster to move around in space if need be. ( like a jump pack). When that ends there are still 3 stages in the buggy. Stage one seperates the 2 landing booster with their fuel tanks. It uses small seperation booster that clear the seperated stage from the rover. The next stage seperates the lower part of the rover from the return stage and the last stage activates the 2 return engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s14.postimage.org/sxn2gvfdt/seperation.png\u0022 alt=\u0022seperation.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s13.postimage.org/ey5n94f47/trip.png\u0022 alt=\u0022trip.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s13.postimage.org/fq8b8bjbb/mooncapture.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mooncapture.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s18.postimage.org/wl8sn1k61/kerbinrise.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kerbinrise.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s15.postimage.org/eatvhf9hn/landed.png\u0022 alt=\u0022landed.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChallenge accepted!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-16T10:10:34Z\u0022 title=\u002209/16/2012 10:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 16, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Rich\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded spoiler tags\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"halocon720","CreatedById":34910,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-16T00:15:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice rover ReNe!
