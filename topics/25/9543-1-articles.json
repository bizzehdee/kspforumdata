You must not use cheapass mods that make it impossible to flip or to go insane speeds, even with the friction limit of the tires. Plugins like Novapunch, Silisko, C7 industries, probodyne, tiberdyne, etc are all acceptable. In addition, modification of any parameters of part files or plugins is not allowed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The speed must be considered stable, i.e. if you flip as soon as you hit a bump at that speed then it is not stable. If you are able to catch big air and have the suspension of the cart soak up the impact, then that would be considered stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. You must use a cart base from tosh\\\u0027s cart plugin, or something that uses his plugin to define the wheel movements and friction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be helpful to use the info at the end of the \u0027flight\u0027 to assess your land speed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: this challenge is intended for kerbin only due to its higher gravity and air density, but I think that a high-speed mun record may be even more impressive due to how easy it is to leave the ground there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cooly568","CreatedById":17763,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-14T03:49:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDefinitively trying this. 8) \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"witeken","CreatedById":12816,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-14T15:47:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy highest speed is about 1800 m/s.
