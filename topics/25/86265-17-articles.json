Do you even know that? While you\u0027ve been waiting for me to heap praise on you, have you even bothered to look at other people\u0027s submission?

I\u0027ll also try hard to not care about this thread anymore. I don\u0027t know what should become of it -- simply asking a moderator to lock it would be bad, I guess. This kind of Eve mission will soon be a thing of the past, but right now there\u0027s still a number of submissions that need review, and it seems as if more are coming. Maybe you people can device a scheme to rate your missions among yourselves. Maybe someone will volunteer and start the new and revamped Eve Rocks Challenge... but if you do that, be sure to ask Ziv whether he\u0027s still OK with how the badge is going to be used. Maybe I\u0027ll lapse and try to chime in, and maybe you will chose to ignore me.

A drone rover was dropped to the landing zone in the region of 10deg S, 170deg W. This site was chosen via Kerbalmaps for its proximity to ocean, relative flatness, and mean altitude of ~2000m. Evorama landed near the rover, which drove to it autonomously. Tedgee Kerman collected a suface sample at the landing site and drove the rover ~120km in each direction to collect an additional sample from the Explodium Sea. Tedgee piloted the Evorama successfully to orbit and docked with KSS Kerbin Maru for the return home.
