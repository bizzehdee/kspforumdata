Then it made me wonder: how fast can you kill an ablator?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---RULES---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo Alt F12, keep it stock, don\u0027t mess with game files, etc. Keep it pure and genuine. I want to see how fast you can kill an ablator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure if the size matters, \u00A0but I\u0027m going to try and keep it on even ground. The size of your base, starting engines determines the size ablator you can use. For instance, a 3.5m starting engine only allows you to use no smaller than a 3.5m ablator, and a 2.5 m starting engine allows a 2.5m ablator, and so forth. However, you can stick on a larger ablator with a smaller starting engine (The Vector engine can carry a 2 or 3 m ablator). If you use a cluster of starting engines of varying sizes, you can use an ablator no smaller than the largest starting engine. You may use stages as you see fit, but you may not use an engine in any stage larger than your blator payload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will keep ablator burn up times each respective to their sizes. You gain bonus points if your vehicle doesn\u0027t blow up after killing the ablator, and especially if you come to a complete stop.\u00A0\u00A0This also means you can\u0027t have \u00A0any parts destroyed while attempting to fry your blator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I hope this is a reasonable challenge... feel free to critique my challenge, but please don\u0027t be a wiseguy. As long as you are nice about pointing out any potential loopsholes, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceplaneAddict","CreatedById":149322,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-16T03:17:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUm, well, you maywant a scoreboard, and maybe a scoring system based on time?
