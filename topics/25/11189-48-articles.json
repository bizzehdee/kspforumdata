I used an upgraded version of my trustworthy Swift SSTO which is intended to be used as a small ground-to-space-station one-kerbal shuttle (there exists a two-seater version where the inline docking port is replaced by a second cockpit). The main difference with its predecessor is that it uses two rapier engines instead of a turbojet coupled with two lv-909. This gives it a very welcome thrust boost, both in atmosphere and in space, at the expense of fuel efficiency. Given its intended role and the fact that it propels itself mainly with RCS once in orbit, this is a more than acceptable trade-off.\n\nIt is however worth noting that this flight was not exactly a routine one : it was my first attempt at delivering a functional payload in orbit with the Swift. The payload in question is the modular space scooter which I am currently working on. I weights 1.5 tons, can seat a Kerbal or be used unmanned and come with a full set of scientific instrumentation.\n\nWithout further ado, here is my submission :\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/KI6lJ)\n\nAs you can see, the atmospheric climb was not the most stable ever and I was a bit short on fuel in the end. I think I can safely assume that 1.5 tons is the maximum recommended payload weight for the Swift. But still, this was a success on the first try and I am more than satisfied with this iteration of the plane.\n\nAs a side note, the Swift follows my personal design guidelines so it doesn\u0027t rely on intake spam or debug part clipping.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-19T19:49:01Z\u0022 title=\u002201/19/2014 07:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Xeo**"},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-19T23:47:34Z","Content":"Congratulations jmiki8 on successfully completing the K-Prize mission with Puli Micron, earning an Advanced Pilot Precision Award for landing back at the KSC runway. Thanks for your mission report and welcome to the K-Prize party guest list aka roll of honour.\n\nKingtj44, you can fly the K-Prize mission any way you want and the K-Prize will be awarded as long as it follows the rules held to be self evident by the K-Prize commitee, which are in the first post, which is a copy of the master rules enshrined in biro on the back of a beer mat from the Dog \u0026 Booster. In the case of your multi-role vehicle the only thing I can think of is that if it is VTOL you may need to make a special effort to make sure the craft begins the take off by moving horizontally. The rule is intended to ensure K-Prize launches are space plane launches, if the craft can move horizontally at all then that satisfies the rule, even if it needs to deploy vertical engines to lift off due to the limitations on rover wheel speeds it will satisfy the rule if it is able to start by moving horizontally.\n\nXeo thanks for your mission report. Thanks in particular for taking the trouble to provide a screeny showing how the scooter fuel complied with the rules. The craft is clearly K-Prize capable and the Kerbal scooter is a great idea and looks cool. Unfortunately while I am sure you can solve this issue, there is still one slight snag which shows up in the screenshot entitled \u0022Engaging RCS to help with attitude control.\u0022 In this image the RCS thrusters on the scooter appear to be actively helping the craft to maintain attitude during lift off. I am sorry to say this contrvenes Rule 1 Proviso A.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Provisos to rule 1.\n\u003E **A.** Payloads may decouple from the craft providing all payload tanks are full on decoupling and any thrust generators on the payload were not used prior to decoupling.\n\nThe original copy of the rules is smudged by an unfortunate beer stain but its still legible, just. Apparently the rule is intended to distinguish staged vehicles from K-Prize space planes. I am also seeing two pairs of LV-1R radial rockets on the scooter which obviously were not used inadvertantly in the lift off because they were not activated which is in keeping with the other efforts made to stay within the rules. So its clear that the use of the RCS blocks was an oversight and was not intentional. I hope you understand this would set a precedent which could then be abused. So how do you want to play it? Would you like the mission linked as a gatecrasher or would you prefer to do the mission in such a way it qualifies. As the mission stands there are two things that can be done to make sure it qualifies, you could deactivate the RCS blocks during the launch until after decoupling or you could use the RCS blocks but complete the mission without leaving the scooter in orbit. Up to you."},{"CreatedByName":"irongut","CreatedById":97315,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-20T03:32:49Z","Content":"The Stiletto 1a is my first successful SSTO spaceplane.
