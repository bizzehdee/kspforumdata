I had previously completed a Laythe water circumnavigation, this is my second Kerbin one- I cut across a continent on my first attempt. This attempt was water only, except for the land bridge. This is a completely stock game, as always.\n\n\u0027Amphib3c-K\u0027 is nearly identical to the vessel I used on Laythe, with a few small changes. Basically took some stuff off that I didn\u0027t need. I did lower the drill, but evidently not enough, because I still had to retract the landing gear to get to the ore. Yes, it still has wings and a rudder. No, it is in no way suitable for flight of any sort, or even tiny jumps off hills. I did briefly get THREE of the wheels off the ground at the same time without exploding, but that\u0027s as far as I pushed it. See the photos at the end of my Laythe entry for demonstration of how this thing handles air under the wheels..\n\nEstimated a max range on this one at 750km. I did have one leg of 725km (between waypoints 4\u00265), and had a little fuel in the tanks at the end of it. It goes about 70m/s out of the chocks, sometimes reaching 76m/s. Most importantly, I was able to use 4X warp while sailing, once I burned off a little fuel.\n\nAs much as I miss my rover wheels, this thing actually held up fairly well on the land bridge. Kept the speed under 30m/s on land, and went much much slower crossing hills, worked out pretty well.\n\nI\u0027ll add some notes to the Imgur album tonight.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I tried to brake but jumped off a huge cliff a few clicks before finish, resulting in a fender bender. Average speed is probably 18 m/s with a sustained high of 45 m/s on the great flats.

But I have a few concerns over my design.\n\nFirst, the craft. It\u0027s very heavily based on the Rocketpilot753\u0027s rover design. My concern is that it may be too closely related and could be considered to be copying them. There\u0027s lots of differences but the main mechanisms for locomation are the same. If it\u0027s too close I\u0027ll go back to the drawing board.\n\nSecondly, I use a good number of Ion thrusters. It could be argued that I could effectively fly over the surface with this many thrusters thus breaking the spirit of the challenge. Which is something I\u0027d like to avoid. Personally, after a few tests I havn\u0027t been able to produce lots of airtime using the thrusters, and it doesnt fly. But off of the right slope, I can see where it it would catch decent airtime nonetheless. If it\u0027s too much I could reduce the number of thrusters or remove them completely to have a craft more in line with the intended idea of the challenge.\n\nYou can see images of my rover here.
