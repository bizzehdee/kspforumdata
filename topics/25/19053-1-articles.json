Basically, when you enter the SOI of Kerbol, your speed is measured with respect to Kerbol, making it many, many meters per second; so many that the values start to be affected by floating point errors on Unity\u0027s behalf. Some parts of your ship end up moving \u0022faster\u0022 than others, and it imparts phantom forces to your ship. It used to be worse, the floating point errors used to affect your distance from Kerbol as well! This imparted enough force to destroy some ships. It was fixed by clamping down the altitude to a max value and adding any excess to Kerbol itself, in effect moving the universe around yourself. Version 0.17 will have a similar fix for the velocity errors, and hopefully, the Kraken will finally be banished to the depths from whence it came!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blackout11c","CreatedById":37589,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-13T07:39:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, Flaming Stick 2 is winning with 216 points (see main post for scores)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"royalkingofgames","CreatedById":23658,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-13T11:41:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jason Patterson\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jason Patterson\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI took up the challenge with Flaming Stick 2, a 14 stage rocket using only stock parts that I, at least, think looks cool, in a very this-thing-was-built-in-my-garage-by-me-and-my-toothless-brother-in-law kind of way.
