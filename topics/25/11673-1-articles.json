To really pass, your periapsis should be above the surface for at least one full orbit before passing through the arch. That is, you can\\\u0027t take off a kilometer from the arch, accelerate horizontally toward the arch to orbital velocity and pass through immediately. That wouldn\\\u0027t really be orbiting through it. However, you can make corrections to your orbit as often and as late as you want.\n\nPost a shot of your ship passing through the arch, and also a map view shot of your orbit.\n\nHere\\\u0027s my entry, passing through the one arch whose location I know\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I did some surveying of the target arch and then wrote a bit of code to tell me how far my periapsis was from the center of the arch.
