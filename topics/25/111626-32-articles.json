Your modular design was very simple and effective and you made good use of the ISRU.  Good thinking to put the Tylo stage on top to save your lander.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, Foxxonius Augustus said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@sdj64](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/100819-sdj64/) I have some questions about restricted mods and mod use. Having gone back and read the thread I found that your concern with Tantares was the low mass of crew pods. I was wondering if that meant that I could use it in my attempt if I didn\u0027t use Tantares crew pods? Alternately could I use Tantares crew pods if I added inert mass to make up the difference? If so could that inert mass (I was thinking of structural plates) be legally clipped into the pod they were making up the mass for? I also wanted to bring up the use of [Bluedog Design Bureau](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/122020-114-bluedog-design-bureau-saturn-apollo-development-v011-vaquero-6aug2016/\u0026page=1). Although a great mod all by itself, I ask because the BDB Saturn V is almost ready and I was hoping to use it as part of the Jool-5 crossover challenge portion of the [Apollo Applications Program](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/109123-the-apollo-applications-program-10-edition/\u0026page=1).\n\u003E \n\nAs I have said before, I don\u0027t like to ban parts on a per-part basis.  Tantares will remain banned for now.\n\nBluedog Design Bureau looks good, but the current download (I got it from Spacedock today) doesn\u0027t have the Saturn V, only the Saturn 1B.

I would have probably let the clipping go since it\u0027s a lot of work to redo a Jool 5 for such a little thing, but you should fix it if you\u0027re going to attempt it again to take screenshots with the resource tab open or at least the interface visible.

I do not want to do it again right now. First docking TT and AE in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E is tedious, more than other docking scenarios. Second, the Mothership \u0026 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E launcher tends to crash my game a lot. And third, I\u0027ve already done it once.
