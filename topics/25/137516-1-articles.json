You must place enough satellites in orbits such that from any place on the planet you could communicate with at least four. Each one needs to be able to generate power and communicate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPoints awarded for number of satellites that are visible on average from any point on the\u00A0planet, which I have not figured out how to determine yet but very much open to other\u0027s ideas. Probably the best way will be to show a screenshot with a tangent line drawn to the surface, every satellite above the line counts. But I don\u0027t know how to figure out your average over time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile I have not tried this myself I think this should be possible, the biggest challenge will of course be getting your mothership to the target planet either with enough fuel to deploy all your probes, or with each individual probe having enough fuel to get into their own orbits. If you use mods please list them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"max_creative","CreatedById":159640,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-20T21:39:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGPS?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChallenge accepted!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DoctorDavinci","CreatedById":150019,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-21T01:49:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m down ... been awhile since I\u0027ve launched a monstrosity into orbit\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis will be my first mission in 1.1 ...
