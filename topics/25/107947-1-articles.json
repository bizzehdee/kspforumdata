But it\u0027s challenging enough to become, I think, a moderate challenge on the forums - one a bit less daunting than Jool-5 or Eve return. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**NO PARTS MODS OR PHYSICS/AERODYNAMICS MODS!** Use any utility mods you like (MechJeb, KER, etc), but don\u0027t use anything that changes the way aerodynamics works or how any of the stock parts function.\n\n**OFFSETTING AND STOCK BUILD TOOLS ARE FINE. NO PART CLIPPING.** Don\u0027t use the debug menu to stack on attachment nodes.\n\nHere\u0027s what I\u0027m thinking: build a stock spacecraft and its lifter for under $50k, with the following requirements:\n\n**Lifter**\n\nThe lifter must be able to put the spacecraft in a 75 x 75 km or higher orbit.\n\n**Spacecraft**\n\nThe spacecraft must be able to carry 3 Kerbals, dock with another vessel in orbit, and return the 3 Kerbals safely to the surface of Kerbin.\n\n**SCORING**\n\nEach entry is scored by tallying points from the following features:\n\n- **SCORING**  \n\n    - Cost  \n\n        - For every full $10k saved from the $50k budget (\u002B1)\n        - Lifter costs less than the spacecraft itself (\u002B1)\n\n        [\\*]Lifter\n\n        - The lifter leaves no stages on orbit - it delivers only the spacecraft, and can de-orbit any upper stages (\u002B1)\n        - The lifter has retrievable boosters or stages (\u002B1)\n        - The lifter can deliver the spacecraft to a 100 x 100 km orbit (\u002B1)\n        - Lifter orbits both the spacecraft and a Mun-capable upper stage (~850m/s dV) (\u002B2)\n        - For every 1000m/s dV remaining in orbited upper stage (\u002B1)\n        - Spacecraft is launched with a launch escape system (\u002B1)\n\n        [\\*]Spacecraft\n\n        - Spacecraft has an RCS system for translation \u0026 easier docking (\u002B1)\n        - Spacecraft has method of generating power (\u002B1)\n        - Spacecraft stores \u003E1000 units of electric charge (\u002B1)\n        - Spacecraft uses medium docking port (\u002B1)\n        - For every 500m/s dV the spacecraft has (\u002B1)\n        - For every 500 units of monopropellant (\u002B1)\n        - The spacecraft can perform a partially-powered landing (\u002B1)\n        - The spacecraft can perform a fully-powered landing (uses no parachutes) (\u002B1)\n\nThis list might grow as entries are made - if you do something cool you think is worth some points, let me know in your entry. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**SUBMISSION RULES**\n\nMake a post with:\n\n1. **The total cost of your spacecraft, lifter, and spacecraft \u002B lifter.**\n2. **The total mass of your spacecraft and spacecraft \u002B lifter.**\n3. **A screenshot of your spacecraft and lifter in the VAB.**\n4. **A screenshot of your spacecraft docked with another vessel in Kerbin orbit.**\n5. **Any other screenshots you need to substantiate your score (e.g. with resource panel displayed while undocked, etc).**\n\nOK!
