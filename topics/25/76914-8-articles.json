It\u0027s the air intakes that cant make air anywhere except Kerbin and Laythe. If you close intakes while they\u0027re full of air, they keep that air until a jet engine consumes them.

This would take a while, but doable. Unfortunately, I found that the air scoops are actually really heavy (at least, when you have a few hundred of them), which means the hard delta-v limit for an air powered single stage is probably very low...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 400 m/s ship I spoke of only had the air-scoops filled to .3 each (I didn\u0027t do the air transfer thing), so it probably could have gotten about 1200 m/s, but obviously that\u0027s no where near an Eve SSTO.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JKezCKe.png\u0022 alt=\u0022JKezCKe.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-06T21:26:52Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2014 09:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by RocketPilot573\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rtxoff","CreatedById":107622,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-06T21:43:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso it would be not better then an infiglider in terms of exploiting the physics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James_Eh","CreatedById":95163,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-06T21:58:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow.
