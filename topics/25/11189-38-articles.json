Don\u0027t be hard on yourself, spaceplanes are hard! I\u0027m still getting schooled on a regular basis. \n\nA few tips that work for me:\n\n1) Balance the plane! \n\nTurn on the CoM and CoL indicators, the blue arrow should be just behind the yellow ball. If it\u0027s too far behind you won\u0027t be able to pick the nose up. But if it gets in front then the plane will tend to flip, like it did during my second attempt. \n\n2) Have enough wing.\n\nThe total lift rating should be at least half the mass of the plane. \n\n3) Put your fuel tanks on the CoM\n\nThat will keep your CoM from shifting around too much during flight. \n\n4) Expect to fail, a lot.\n\nBut don\u0027t let it discourage you. Try to learn from it. \n\n5) Throttle back\n\nOnce you get much over 20km you\u0027ll want to start easing off the throttle to keep the jet engine from flaming out. You\u0027ll want to be al the way down to 1/4 throttle or less by 30km.\n\nGood luck and keep flying!"},{"CreatedByName":"VincentS","CreatedById":83474,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-05T12:24:03Z","Content":"Hi there,\n\nHere is my entry for the most convoluted gatecrasher mission...\n\nIt comes with a story, so let\u0027s start with it !\n\nKSC conference room :\n\n- OK, we cannot fail this mission, sponsor have been wait for this kerbaled Duna landing for ages. So let\u0027s review the details one more time...\n\nBBBBOOOOOOMMMM !\n\n- What was that ?\n\n- I think it\u0027s the VAB. Jeb said the engine required some heavy tuning...\n\n20 minutes later\n\n- Well, as you all know, Jeb just started some VAB improvements work. The bad news is that the Duna rocket cannot be assembled in a timely fashion. Some rumor stated that Jeb has destroyed the VAB by unintentionnaly blowing a rocket. This is obviously kermunist bull\\*\\*\\*\\* propaganda, as we all know that Jeb would never detonate something UNINTENTIONALLY...\n\nHowever, we have a problem : how can we put Jeb on Duna without a rocket ? Has anyone an idea ?\n\n... Silence ... more silence ...\n\n- We could send a plane ?\n\n- We have no such plane, and no time to design one -- if even such a thing it is possible !\n\n- Well, if one can\u0027t do it, then we\u0027ll have to sent two !\n\n- Yes, that\u0027s the spirit! Jeb would be proud of you ! OK everybody, you have two hours to come up with a solution ! Go to your study and come back with every available plane design.\n\n2 hours later\n\n- So we have two planes available for building : one unmanned SSTO refuelling plane, and a manned SSTO designed for Duna landing, but lacking range. What\u0027s the plan ?\n\n- Fuel plane drops fuel tank in orbit and return, Jeb uses the other plane to rendez-vous and pickup fuel, flies to Duna, lands and comes back.\n\n- I like your plan ! Let\u0027s do it now !\n\n- What about delta V budget ? Will it be enough ?\n\n- Do you have reason to believe it will not be enough ?\n\n- Well, I did no such computation...\n\n- So, that\u0027s settled. Let\u0027s go to work !\n\nAnd thus started Jeb Odyssey to Duna (and back. Maybe...)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/0m5xw#0)\n\nSummary of the mission failure :\n\nJeb\u0027s plane : went to Duna and back, with safe landing. But it used an additional fuel tank and had to jettison both the fuel tank and turbojet engine after taking off from Duna (I had not enough dv with them attached to come back on Kerbin)\n\nFuel plane : the first one \u0022landed\u0022, but only a few pieces remains after I messed up lithobraking. The second one is stranded on Orbit.\n\nI believe that it is possible to make it to Duna and back using two planes (or maybe 3) using orbital reassembly, and land everything (no jettison) back on Kerbin after landing on Duna. That would technically make a Duna capable distributed ssto...\n\nMaybe I\u0027ll try again sometime later.\n\nPS : I used no mod. I learned a lot about planes planning and doing this mission, including piloting...
