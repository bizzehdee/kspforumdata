Perhaps even my yacht with minor tweaks. Have to think about a solution for that land bridge though...\n\u003E \n\u003E EDIT: **Fengist,** am I allowed to put a buggy on the yacht, and then when I have arrived at the land bridge use it to cross the land? I do leave the yacht at that point, this is why I ask the question\n\u003E \n\u003E EDIT EDIT: I reread the text and apperently I don\u0027t need to cross the part for master mariner, I\u0027ll do that instead XD\n\nGlad you got that figured out but just thinking about it... I\u0027d say that I\u0027d allow that. While this challenge is more about \u0027rover\u0027 exploration, in the spirit of true explorers, they used some pretty creative ways of surmounting obstacles and didn\u0027t confine themselves to one vehicle to do so. Since this rover would technically be a part of the boat until undocked then it\u0027s not like you dropped it somewhere and met up with it. It would have been part of the vessel the entire trip and therefore, I\u0027d have no problem with it. However, if your rover starts to look more like a [Matryoshka doll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll) than a rover, I might have to draw the line somewhere."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-07T11:23:22Z","Content":"It\u0027s been almost six months since I started this... almost.

This is a 100% stock game, by the way.\n\n\u0022Amphib2\u0022\n\nCrew: 6 max. I sent her out with a crew of 4.\n\nMax Sailing Speed (full fuel): 38m/s\n\nMax Sailing Speed (1/3 fuel): 52-55m/s\n\nSailing Range: 400km\u002B\n\nMax Water Entry Speed: 6m/s. Anything faster risks damaging an engine.\n\nMax Beaching Speed: I usually tried for 6-8m/s or less for safety. I accidentally hit a beach at ~26m/s once, and came out OK. Scared me though.\n\nCircumnavigation: Westbound, mostly over water. There was one place where land travel was required, plus I cut across the continent south of KSC to see how well it would perform on land. (Not too well..)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/MRbgr)\n\nThere\u0027s a few notes if you go to the Imgur album.\n\nI did lose some parts along the way, but thankfully had some redundancy. For electric generation I started with 2 RTGs, 12 OX-STATs, 4 Gigantors, plus of course the 4 jet engines also produce electricity while running. Along the way I managed to lose both RTGs (very early) and 6 of the OX-STATs. The RTGs were mounted in the cargo bay, which I suspect doesn\u0027t completely protect it\u0027s occupants like I expected. The loss of the 6 OX-STATS came at a particularly bad time- right before crossing the land bridge. The land bridge is a ways north of the equator, so solar efficiency isn\u0027t great. I still had the Gigantors, but they can\u0027t be used while in motion of course.\n\nTo make up for the loss of the RTGs and OX-STATs, I ran the jet engines at low thrust while going across the land bridge. Worked out OK. A further help was the fact that I had finally figured out that the vessel was much more durable without full fuel tanks (duh).\n\nHope this doesn\u0027t disqualify me, but I did mount one aerodynamic surface, a rudder, on the back of the ship. This was because there aren\u0027t any water rudders in stock KSP, and I needed something to help keep the ship pointed forwards at \u0027high\u0027 speeds. \u0027High\u0027 meaning a whopping 38m/s. I can assure you that this vessel is in no way even remotely capable of flight. Even catching a little air going over hills almost always resulted in broken wheels at best, often followed by explosions and a debris field.\n\nOne lesson I learned is that redundancy is a good thing- I was lucky I had so many sources of electric generation since I lost so many. The first thing I would change on a rebuild is to add batteries. Amphib2 only had a single giant battery, if I had lost that I don\u0027t think I could have completed the trip. So next time (Laythe, here I come..) I\u0027ll put at least two batteries on board, maybe more. They don\u0027t weigh much, and it\u0027s hard to operate without them.\n\nMy biggest concern by far during this journey was having a crew member accidentally fall into the cargo bay. I didn\u0027t include any ladders to get out, so that would have been a big problem. I decided to have a rule of nobody moving on the roof while the cargo doors were open.\n\nAnyway, almost all of the travel was over water. I did cut across the continent south of KSC to test out the rover capabilities before I got too far into the journey, but otherwise I stuck to the water.\n\nOh, the whole journey took about 48 days, but a lot of that was spent refilling the fuel tanks.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-08T01:55:27Z\u0022 title=\u002210/08/2015 01:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RexKramer**"},{"CreatedByName":"HighExplosives12","CreatedById":150336,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-08T06:36:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So I\u0027m guessing no hyper edit to the object you\u0027d circumnavigate?\n\nwell there goes my plans of circumnavigating Minmus in a rather large tank, complete with 203mm naval guns."},{"CreatedByName":"nigelvn","CreatedById":143368,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-08T07:50:20Z","Content":"Not neccesarily, just keep adding boosters until you get there.

One of the many problems I\u0027ve encountered is determining wether my vessel can make the next waypoint before running out of fuel. There are some large stretches of open water on Laythe, and I\u0027m finding that just \u0027eyeballing\u0027 distances on the map may not be sufficient. I have a pretty good idea what the range of my ship is, now I just need accurate distance estimates between points on Laythe.\n\nI\u0027ve been using a formula to calculate the distance in radians between two points, and multiplying by the radius to come up with a great circle distance. (I\u0027m still \u0027eyeballing\u0027 the headings..) You just need to know the Lat/Long coordinates of your waypoints, and let a spreadsheet do the math (or do it by hand if you\u0027re a sadist). The Lat/Longs need to be converted to radians for the formula to function, but again that\u0027s something the spreadsheet will do painlessly.\n\nThe formula to determine the radians between two points is ArcCos(SinLat1\\*SinLat2 \u002B CosLat1\\*CosLat2\\*Cos(absolute difference Lon1-Lon2)) Again, the Lat and Long values need to be converted to radians. Once you know how many radians separate two points, just multiply by the radius of the body (Laythe\u0027s radius is 500km). You should end up with a pretty accurate distance value.\n\nI couldn\u0027t remember how to do this from navigation courses I took decades ago, so Wikipedia to the rescue! Here\u0027s the link to the relevant formulas to determine great circle distance- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance)\n\nLat/Longs for celestial bodies can be found at kerbalmaps.com. Hope this helps someone. Laythe is turning out to be a real challenge.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nHere\u0027s a couple of challenges that came up on my Laythe attempt-\n\nFirst, the rockets I used to get my floating rover to Laythe didn\u0027t want to decouple properly. Spent a couple of hours figuring out how to get them off the ship.\n\nNext, I deployed my drill and discovered that it didn\u0027t reach the ground! Missed by about a half meter! After a few minutes of panic, I tried lowering the landing gear, which was just enough to allow the drill to reach the surface. Phew!\n\nFinally, one the drill reached the surface, I was informed there was no ore, because I was in Laythe\u0027s Sagen Sea biome. Uh oh, I landed with just enough fuel to sputter to this hunk of land and refuel. I headed inland, and after about 2km finally found a spot the game would allow me to drill (with landing gear retracted of course)."},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-15T02:43:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E For water circumnavigations, can we use Better Buoyancy?\n\nYep.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E This is not edited, this rover is just that freaking fast, and stable!

Although my entry was primarily intended for water travel anyway, my brief experience over land certainly convinced me that the medium wheels on MK3 parts was a recipe for, uh, not being on land any longer than absolutely necessary.\n\nAs for using the MK3 parts, feel free to laugh, but I brought basically the same vessel to Laythe. It was my most expensive single launch to date, and still required two refuelings before leaving Kerbin, plus another top off reaching Jool. I did at least replace the rover wheels with aircraft landing gear, but that was more of an effort to increase efficiency, I still miss having rover wheels that can go in reverse. I did manage to increase the range to about 750km. Still not enough to do a true Equatorial circumnavigation of Laythe (the big stretch of water is about 1125km..), but should be enough for a respectable entry.

You have endured the endless whine of jet engines and discovered the secret of putting enough intakes to the bottom of your rover that they look like paint. Well done and welcome to the brotherhood.\n\n**nigelvn - Master Mariner** - Wow bud, just the image of all those parachutes lagged my machine. My sincere congratulations on achieving Master Mariner. You have earned the fear of every barnacle and a place of honor amongst your fellow circumnavigators. Well done.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-16T00:36:50Z\u0022 title=\u002210/16/2015 12:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist**"},{"CreatedByName":"CommanderSpock","CreatedById":147594,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-16T01:18:42Z","Content":"Is it too much to say I\u0027m going to try and circumnavigate **all** planetary bodies- with the same rover (not in one go)?"}]}
