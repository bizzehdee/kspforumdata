That\u0027s the biggest misconception of this challenge I believe, one I have been trying to clear up over and over. I\u0027m not going to expect someone to get to another planet without referencing the map at all. I do expect people to reference the map at least once inbetween locations, make a node to get information about their desired trajectory, etc. The question though is how well can you leave these steps out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the scoring, yes, it can be improved. The assumptions that I made when determining the scoring were:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 1. The player would look at the map at least once when transitioning from one orbit to another. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Nodes would be used to allow the person to know where they should be going, though actually pulling off the maneuver without guidance from the node would be worth more (ie use the mission clock to know when you reach the estimated node time, then look at the map a 2nd time to confirm your trajectory after the maneuver).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Should a player use multiple craft, pulling off the docking maneuver would usually require using the map to align trajectories.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my example, I escaped Kerbin\u0027s SOI without using the map. After confirming with the Orbit/altitude change that I was orbiting Kerbol, *then* I opened the map to try and plot a course towards Eve (which I didn\u0027t have enough fuel for). I made the node, looked at the time requirement, closed the node (and the map), and tried warping to the estimated mission time. I overshot the time, tried to initiate the retrograde burn, and eventually checked the map when near the lower limits of my fuel tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if I had used the node fully without looking at the mission clock at all (assuming I had the fuel to pull off the maneuver), my trajectory would have been more efficient. If I used Map mode to adjust the trajectory I ended up with to actually intercept Eve, that would have been fine, except it would still cost me points for doing so.
