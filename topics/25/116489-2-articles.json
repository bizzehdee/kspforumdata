I originally tried with 2xWhiplash Ramjet engines plus 2xLV-T45 Swivels, but swapped those out for 4xRapier. Test flights didn\u0027t go to orbit and all landed back at KSC, so the parts I chose to swap out were all returned for re-use. The only consumable used was fuel for half a dozen test flights.\n\nCost of the final craft, excluding the payload, is 71,426. If this makes it to orbit and back the only bits not returning will be the fuel used and the payload, if deployed.\n\nPilot notes :\n\nTake off can be achieved at 90 m/s. Initial climb out seems best at about 30 degrees nose up. Any steeper and the speed starts to bleed off. Above 10,000m flatten out to build speed and when the Rapiers peter out in air breathing mode, press 1 to toggle to rocket mode and simultaneously close the air intakes. Keep your fingers crossed you have enough fuel to reach orbit.\n\nAction group keys :\n\n1. Toggle engine mode and air intakes\n\n2. Extend airbrakes\n\n3.

Because you didn\u0027t track the cost I will have to charge you 9,000 assuming all landings were perfect. You flew more flights then me but have a slightly smaller craft and didnt lose a wing or go to orbit. If you want to go through your test flight again and multiply that by 6 we can use that as the cost seeing as no reverts no quick saves is dependent on the honor code anyways.\n\nWhat is the recommended payload and what orbit should one expect to get it too?"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T19:28:00Z","Content":"All landings were on the KSC runway with no breakages. Target orbit is 100km, but it may be able to go higher - anyone able to get it to orbit may be able to confirm based on what fuel is still available. If I was continuing the test flights myself, I would probably aim for an initial orbit around 85km to allow a margin of safety/error. The payload fitted in the provided craft file is 730 kg and there is room in the cargo bay for 2 of those, so round that up and say payload capacity of 1500kg should be about right.\n\nThe first few test flights I did were to tweak the aerodynamics to get it to fly reasonably well and were kept local to the KSC. The penultimate flight was to test high altitude speed gain and transition from atmospheric to rocket engines. That\u0027s when I decided to change to Rapiers, and the final test flight was a repeat of the previous one to make the same checks using the Rapiers. I have just done another flight like this last one, which lasted 25 mins to a maximum altitude of 31000m and returned to KSC, and represents the flight that would have had the highest costs due to the amount of fuel used. The cost of that flight was 3100. I\u0027m happy if you want to apply that cost to all 6 flights, or to apply your own average based on that cost.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-28T23:02:32Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2015 11:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Scarecrow88**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nefrums","CreatedById":145422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T23:12:29Z","Content":"Vamanos Test flight:\n\nI did not like this ship ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif) Very hard to control and strange balance of LF vs OX\n\nI managed to deploy the two satellites to LKO and return safely\n\nCost: 4148\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

This thing needs the whole runway, but flies very well indeed. got to orbit easily, flying SAS \u002B kayboard and achieving orbit the old fashion way, using no orbital nodes(not easy to do efficiently, but this craft had enough fuel). Achieved a 102Km x 103Km orbit with ease. Had just enough fuel to deorbit. Deorbit was smooth and quick. Reentry was a little harry due to actually deorbiting a little too sharpy(my bad) but the craft took it without flinching and soaked up the heat like a champ. Used both the airbrakes and pitched the nose up 30 degrees to slow the craft down quickly. It had no issues with the high nose pitch and actually fought me the whole time, trying to return to strait and level. This is a good sign, it wants to be stable. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Got the craft slowed down fairly well, but at about 32Km it started getting too much lift and started trying to climb again, so I had to nose it down a bit instead to try to dig back into the atmosphere again. This was all with the airbrakes still deployed, I was going fast... 2200m/s at reentry... nosing down didn\u0027t cause any troubles, the craft simply pulled its own nose back up once it dug deeper into the atmosphere. It slowed down enough that by 25Km, I no longer had any heating issues on the craft and was able to turn the airbrakes off, gliding into the deep atmosphere non-powered.\n\nI had intentionally undershot the runway, but this craft wants to fly so much that even with the engines idling(I was dangerously low on power by this point due to no power gen on it...), it was starting to overshoot the runway. So once again, airbrake time for a few seconds, and a little more throttle, SAS was starting to cut out from lack of power... The approach to the runway was uneventful, but the landing was a little ugly. I ended up nosing down too hard but pulled up at the last second and somehow flared the wings enough too stall the craft about 130m above the runway. touchdown, no damage and a recovery cost of 22,879Kredits launch Kredits was 23,884. 1 flight, no retries needed.\n\nPilot score: -0.987, 1 Kerbin to orbit and back again. efficient, inexpensive to operate, and flies very well.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-29T23:53:21Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2015 11:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jakalth**"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T01:34:24Z","Content":"Another pilot\u0027s log.

It flew smooth and stable all the way up to orbit. I was able to achieve a 70Km x 70Km(barely) orbit with this craft. It has a bit too fine of a fuel load, in the hands of a Novice like me, to really get much higher then that. I didn\u0027t have the most efficient flight profile... I did have 4 Kerbal passangers on board during the flight though. But, since I\u0027m lacking a space station to dock with, and the fact that I was unable to maneuver the craft enough to reach a station once in orbit, I had to content myself with a 4 Kerbal joy ride. The reentry took a long time really. I Only had enough fuel to retroburn into a 47Km reentry orbit, and I judged the entry position wrong too boot... I had the airbrakes deployed by 60Km and once again pitched the nose up 20 degrees(probably too shallow... should of gone steeper, in hind sight), but this, along with the entry angle, ment the parts were exposed to excessive heating far longer then needed. Many of the parts on the craft were glowing red hot by the time I got it down into the thicker parts of the atmosphere. At this point, I double check my fuel levels, yep, completely tapped out... Not a drop of liquid fuel or oxidizer left in the tanks. Looks like it\u0027s a dead stick flight from here on out. Time to nose down to level and deactivate the airbrakes and hope she holds up to the additional heating from not slowing down anymore.\n\nI remembered to close the air intakes at about 20Km, hopefully to buy me a few extra Km of glide. This helped. The craft, flying dead stick, proved not to be the most efficient glider I\u0027ve ever used, but she was stable and responded nice and smooth. This at least meant I\u0027d get good distance since I wouldn\u0027t be flaring the wings by accident. I tried to extend the glide as far as possible, but my bad judgment in orbit ment I was going to be short of the runway. She remained stable all the way down to the deck and down to speeds of only 90m/s. And looming in front of me were the mountains just west of the KSC... Thankfully, I\u0027ve gotten quite skilled at making mountain landings thanks to my little Drifter series of science aircraft. The landing ended up being rather easy with the crafts wheels touching down in the rolling hills just before the mountain range.

My 3rd attempt presented the same problem - the craft flipped out shortly after igniting the rocket engines, and with absolutely no control input from myself. One second it was flying fine, the next the nose pitched up and all semblance of control was temporarily lost. At that point the prograde vector was about 10 degrees and the nose of the craft was a few degrees higher, lined up with the top of the prograde circle. I also noted prior to this point that the craft would deviate from an easterly heading, but reading a post above, enabling the yaw control on the tail fin resolved this problem.\n\nMy 4th flight was finally successful.

Coming Soon ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nAlso I have an idea for the badge I will submit it and see if everyone likes it/wants to improve it before if becomes final.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-30T15:57:07Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2015 03:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nich**"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T17:09:08Z","Content":"Hmm.

Same as I did with the Sangwich.\n\n The challenge right now is just to orbit it without killing everyone. ![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif)\n\nWish me luck!\n\n-Slashy\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nWelp... short trip. I ran it off the end of the runway at full throttle. It immediately pitched up violently and entered an inverted flat spin. I was unable to recover and went into the water. Total loss and all hands lost.\n\n Perhaps a slower takeoff may help whoever tries it next...\n\n**\\*Follow-up troubleshooting flights (not for points)\\***\n\nI was able to get it off the ground by reassigning roll to the canards, disabling the ailerons, setting fine controls, and taking off very carefully. It got worse when I added power. Every time, pitch excursions leading to an unrecoverable inverted flat spin.\n\nIt\u0027s just plain too tail-heavy and too draggy in front. \n\nI was able to get it to orbit by unloading the farthest- aft tank and handling it very carefully until it built up speed. It seems to stabilize after that.\n\n Of course, that means you have to slog on the single nuc to orbit because the RAPIERS give out early, but it \\*is\\* doable. The ship got hot, but held.\n\nI had 25.48t and 1623 fuel at orbit. By my math (somebody doublecheck my figures), I had 3,009 m/sec DV on orbit.\n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-30T23:08:01Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2015 11:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GoSlash27**"}]}
