May I suggest changing the science requirement to simply be \u0022Recovered Science\u0022. That is, any science point that is successfully returned to Kerbin and Recovered.\n\nThis is easy to verify via screenshot of the recovery screen.

I don\u0027t want to unnecessarily restrict people. Anything you can do with them, you can do with stock for a fair bit more parts, e.g. 7 mainsails are equivalent to the largest engines in either pack. If everyone starts making their ship with these engines instead of nukes, then I\u0027ve seriously messed up and need to rethink things. They could help with larger landers but you don\u0027t need such a large lander that these engines are necessary for it.\n\nProcedural Parts - no\n\nMy main issue with it is that you can make a tank all LF, which gives it a much better ratio than any stock tank has for nuclear engines. A central design issue with stock nukes is dealing with rather poor tank mass ratios when tanks are drained of oxidizer or unwieldy airplane tanks (and at 8/1, still worse than full rocket tanks).\n\nKAS/KIS - no\n\nTwo things, first it makes it no big deal to have poor engineering when you left Kerbin, you can just fix it later.

But the \u0022poor mass ratio\u0022 is IMHO not really there.\n\u003Cedit\u003E Because you can make a stock tank containing LF only. The Jettision fuel mod or TAC Fuel Balancer may be helper here but you can do it with stock methods only.\u003C/edit\u003E\n\nA full Jumbo-64 tank weighs 36t.\n\nA Jumbo-64 with LF only weighs 18.4t (only 51.1% mass compared to the full tank)\n\nA PP tank with the same amount of LF weighs 16.65t (46,25% mass)\n\nSo the difference between and oxidizer-less Jumbo and a comparable PP tank is less than 5% if compared to a full Jumbo.

The big difference is size, though (the PP tank has roughly half the size), but in outer space size is more or less irrelevant.\n\n**And I honestly believe that no serious ship designer here is that dumb to send tons of never-be-used-oxidizer to Jool and back**, so he/she will surely jettision the oxidizer before launch...\n\n(I certainly will do)\n\nDon\u0027t understand me wrong: My intention is not to persuade you to have PP in this challenge (I can live without it).

Science that is processed must be transmitted, so you won\u0027t get any points for doing it...\n\nJust to clarify, this isn\u0027t quite how the MPL works. The problem is that science and data are not the same thing. Processing science in the lab does not use up the *science*, it only adds *data* to the lab. Once the science is processed, it can still be returned or transmitted to Kerbin for science points. In fact it can even be taken to a different station and processed through another lab! The lab will continue processing the data into still more science points in the background, which must be transmitted (not returned!) back to Kerbin. \n\nExample: I have a space station in Munar orbit with a landing craft. The lander goes down to the surface, takes a surface sample worth (say) 100 science points and 50 data for the lab, and brings it back to the station. The sample is processed through the lab, which gets 50 units of data. The sample is now transferred (by a Kerbal EVA, Ship Manifest mod, or similar) to a space shuttle and returned to Kerbin for 100 points of science. In the meantime, the lab is now processing its 50 points of data in the background. A few in-game weeks later, I come back to find it\u0027s turned that data into another 200 points of science, which are then transmitted back to Kerbin. So from that surface sample I\u0027ve got a total of 300 points--100 from returning the sample itself, another 200 from the science lab. \n\nSo if you process science through a lab for the challenge, you would get no *additional* points for doing so, but you could still return the *original* science to Kerbin for full points at end of mission. \n\nThe end result is, while the lab could still benefit your career save, as the rules stand now it would basically be dead weight from the point of view of the challenge, seeing as its only other function is to reset Mystery Goo/Science Jr. experiments, and a scientist Kerbonaut can do this as well. Personally I think this is fine, the MPL is basically a source of virtually unlimited science points, so being able to use it would basically make the whole idea of Jebediah\u0027s Level pretty much pointless."},{"CreatedByName":"Carraux","CreatedById":60890,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T13:16:26Z","Content":"I would suggest then to dismiss the idea of generating science / bring science back at home (well, that\u0027s only my 2 cent)\n\nAnother question for Jeb\u0027s Level: 5 Kerbanauts are required for this level.

That would tend to force every entry to ISRU. More variety seems like a good thing for participants and spectators.\n\nI\u0027m planning for the two-Kerbonaut level (Cause it\u0027d be just unfair to send one Kerbonaut on a five-year mission, and going straight to the five-Kerbonaut level would require 20 tons of life support), and I haven\u0027t run into any fuel problems on the planning stage. A lot of that is probably because I will be abusing LV-Ns and Ion Engines for the trip to, back, and tooling around the Jool system, with chemical rockets only being fired when their thrust advantage is necessary (IE, landing). But now that I think about it, I only tested the feasibility of mining on Tylo, not on the low-grav moons, Bop and Pol.\n\nAlso, one thing I\u0027m debating - Ion Engines versus LV-Ns. My current design incorporates 16 LV-Ns and 24 Ion Engines in different stages. I\u0027m suspecting I\u0027ll need to do a lot of math for this, so my question is: Does the fuel/power consumption of LV-Ns and Ion Engines scale directly to the amount of thrust? I\u0027m considering the advantages of using a nuclear stage at all. During the exit from Kerbin, we\u0027ll be close enough to Kerbol to rely on the sun\u0027s power, and at Jool unless my math is messed up it\u0027d cost less in mass to run Ion Engines on radiotope generators and fuel cells than it\u0027d cost to run LV-Ns on LFO. Generally, smaller payloads are easier to get into orbit and more stable when attached via docking connectors. Additionally, it\u0027s easier to distribute Ion Engines across the entire payload to provide generally even thrust.\n\nI\u0027m proud of my work in constructing a 16 LV-N stage that can fire literally indefinitely if supplied with LF, and that would be a huge asset at Jool, but Ion Engines may just be a better choice.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I would suggest then to dismiss the idea of generating science / bring science back at home (well, that\u0027s only my 2 cent)\n\u003E Another question for Jeb\u0027s Level: 5 Kerbanauts are required for this level.
