Even if it takes a hundred thousand years, they are willing to wait--after all, for immortal beings, any length of time is a mere blink of an eye. Even so, they\u0027d like to arrive as soon as possible to escape the boredom of being trapped inside a pod for countless millennia.\n\n**Challenge**: Send a Kerbal \u002B craft out of the solar system at the fastest possible speed. Your score will be your speed relative to Kerbol *at infinite distance*. This speed can be calculated using v\\_inf = sqrt(v^2 - 2GM/r), where v is your current orbital speed around Kerbol, r is your distance above Kerbol\u0027s center (NOT its surface), and M is Kerbol\u0027s mass. If you don\u0027t know how to use this formula, time warp until you are at least 300 million km from Kerbol and report your orbital speed. If you\u0027re too impatient to wait this long, I\u0027ll calculate the speed for you based on the screenshots you submit.\n\n**Rules**:\n\n1. Crafts must be 100% stock. You can use MechJeb or other mods to design your craft, but can\u0027t use them to fly it. \n\n2. The Kerbal MUST be in a pod or command chair; a free-floating Kerbal isn\u0027t OK. \n\n3. You can\u0027t exploit glitches\n\n4. To submit your entry, post 1) a screenshot of your craft at launch or in the VAB, and 2) a screenshot of your craft as it\u0027s leaving the solar system, after burning all its fuel. In the second screenshot, make sure the orbital speed and altitude above Kerbol are clearly visible. I need this to verify your orbital speed at infinity.\n\n**Scoreboard**:\n\n1. FlipNascar: 63.12 km/s\n\n2. cryogen: 43.69 km/s\n\n3. myself: 27.720 km/s\n\n4. Ferdoni: 21.165 km/s\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-17T04:06:22Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2015 04:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by stanleywinford**\n  \nenumerated rules, forbade glitches"},{"CreatedByName":"MarvinKitFox","CreatedById":99545,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T10:42:15Z","Content":"I was about to submit an older mission log of mine, that used a sun-grazer ion drive to get more than 68000m/s\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThen I remembered that the sun is now \\*hot\\*.\n\nThis will add a whole new dimension to the attempt..."},{"CreatedByName":"stanleywinford","CreatedById":119454,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T06:15:52Z","Content":"Here\u0027s my own attempt.
