I came in a two-way tie for the actual \u0022first place\u0022 as it was extremely hard to decide between the two. I will list the votes I actually ordered in order from last to first place. (10th to the tie for 1st. There would be 11 positions, but I tied the first two.) I also was looking for a rover that could more or less fit on a 2.5m framed lifter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10th: Antbin \u0022The One Way Ticket\u0022: This one had to grow on me, I like it the more I look at it, actually. However, it\u0027s quite a bit bigger than what I would have considered an optimal setup. It\u0027s also a rover based on stranding Kerbs on an off-world location. Those facts can be dampened by the amount of character it has, and the way you\u0027ve sold it to me. It is truly a very Kerbal rover. Unforgettable, at the very least. A good design, Antbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9th: Zekes \u0022Lorrie\u0022: Visually, I really love the design you\u0027ve put into your delivery system and lifter. However, this is scoring based on the rover and skycrane only, so, regrettably, I had to force myself to completely ignore the transfer stage. The biggest hangup was that there was not a whole lot of really good pictures of your rover. While I\u0027d assume it can land and do all kinds of things, I didn\u0027t see much documentation, so I couldn\u0027t offer an \u0022exceptional\u0022 score. Regardless, your rover and skycrane were well designed and simple, so I had to include it in my top 11. An example of fine design work. Good job, Zekes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8th: SaplingPick \u0022SkyBug Mk1 Rover\u0022: You\u0027ve gone and made your system very adaptable, with the ability to land on Mun, Duna, and Laythe, your rover will be used extensively elsewhere in the sytem, I\u0027d reckon. Your entire system is encapsulated in a tidy little fairing and does quite well. The redundancy of multiple sources of power generation is nice, too. The only place I\u0027ve docked points is on the rover, which appears to be topheavy, and appears to be putting those tiny wheels to near their weight limit for the suspension. Another issue is one you demonstrated yourself, in that it can break off its own panels very easily. Static panels only would have done better, in my opinion. However, it\u0027s still a neat, compact, and simple package that deserves recognition. Good job, SaplingPick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7th: Kasuha \u0022BSC Skycrane and Rover\u0022: Your rover has a quite different design than most of the others on this list. It\u0027s a fair bit larger, and that\u0027s what really hurt the others\u0027 scores from me who didn\u0027t make it to the list, but your rover manages to beat the odds because it has a lot to offer for its size. It can support crew, and is self-righting. It also has a lot of open space to which a payload could be added, it appears. Your largest selling points were:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Your rover is rugged, extremely versatile, and self-righting. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Your skycrane is extremely simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-You provided excellent documentation and examples of your rover in action.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing that I counted as a hangup was the size, which is one of the most important things I was looking for. The versatility you included was actually what contributed to the fairly bulky size, however, it is still an excellent entry. Well done, Kasuha. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6th: Tarmenius \u0022SCAR\u0022: Now here\u0027s a simple design if I ever did see one. The rover looks stable and extremely well-designed. The skycrane is beautifully simple, and they all fit into a fairly compact package. The only thing that isn\u0027t quite fitting in is that this system is kind of limited in where it looks like it would be easy to land. Obviously it can land on Duna, but you claim a 736m/s of delta-V, which, yes, should get most things down on the Mun. However, if this is supposed to be a system to be used by a newer player, it\u0027s not quite as friendly if there\u0027s not a whole lot of breathing room for mistakes. So, the extreme simplicity of the skycrane is also its biggest downfall, as it lacks a bit more delta-V which would have made it optimal. However, one must take it for what it is: It\u0027s still a VERY simple and lightweight system, so for that you get consideration. Excellent job Tarmenius.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5th: Spartwo \u0022Endeavor\u0022: Oh god where do I start with this one? It\u0027s so tiny. It\u0027s so lightweight. I feel like I could just frisbee that whole assembly at a celestial body and it\u0027d make it. I mean, there isn\u0027t much to say other than this is an extremely efficient looking and simple design. It looks just like one of the rovers I had designed, in that it\u0027s tiny, efficient, and it\u0027s simply well done. Nothing to be said other than it sets unrealistically high standards of beauty for newbies \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E Excellent job, Spartwo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4th: Speeding Mullet \u0022Skycon Crumple Zone\u0022: First impressions: It\u0027s big. Taking a second look: This is an extremely well thought-out and easy to use looking design that supports a robust mission architecture. The biggest complaint I have is that it is extremely large. However, just like Kasuha\u0027s rover above, for what it accomplishes, this is more than excusable. While it doesn\u0027t look like your rover can self-right, there shouldn\u0027t be a need to, as it doesn\u0027t look like it\u0027s tipping over any time soon. The fact that the skycrane handles the whole de-orbit and landing, as well as placing both sections on the ground is a huge plus for simplicity. It also appears to have plenty of fuel for the inevitable course correction. The returnable habitat is also a great feature. The only thing that lost points was the sheer size of the assembly. This may be a better craft for a later mission, after one had mastered landing an unmanned rover/skycrane. Exceptional entry, Speeding Mullet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3rd: Deathsoul097 \u0022Sojourner\u0022: An entry that I\u0027ve dropped slightly from the lead, but still stands out as an exceptionally beautiful design. The simplicity behind this design is humbling, but, as said yourself, the skycrane is overpowered. This could be a true masterpiece if the efficiency would be increased by using the \u0022ant\u0022 engines, or less of the radial oranges. This hitch may make it hard to fly for a newbie. Still, one of my favorite entries due to the compact size and beautiful design work. Still an exceptional entry, Deathsoul097.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2nd: Sploden \u0022Kuriosity\u0022: While I love the entire craft, I had to disregard everything up to the final ascent capsule. The heatshield and shielded skycrane are where I started judging. This is actually a two-part skycrane/landercrane, it seems. One for the E, and the other for the D and L, in \u0022EDL\u0022. I really REALLY like this design. In fact, it looks like what I probably would have come up with had I entered this challenge. It\u0027s rugged looking, and the rover is well designed. I really like the final descent..lander..thing. I\u0027m not sure what to call it. It\u0027s not really a skycrane, but if the OP takes it, that\u0027s all that matters. This is actually a much better landing method than a skycrane to begin with, it waits until the rover is stable on the ground, and releases it from a known height to avoid damage, then moves away. Much safer, so I appreciate that. It\u0027s optimal for a newbie to use, and it comes in a compact, 2.5m sized capsule. Very great design, Sploden! My personal favorite entry!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1st: Tie between Andrew Hansen \u0022NOKERB Exploring Machine\u0022 and Ravenchant \u0022R-31 Dustmarcher \u0026amp; Heron Skycrane\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAndrew Hansen: This was another design that had to grow on me. At first, I saw the large wheels and thought it unnecessarily bulky, especially for not carrying any science equipment. Count in the fairly large skycrane, and it starts to become very big and ungainly. But then I watched the video. That\u0027s when everything changed. Seeing that rover being able to cover immense distances and survive the extreme bumps and dings that would have meant game over for any other rover, I instantly changed my mind. Your entry went from one I wasn\u0027t even considering, to first-place tie with another great entry. I then thought \u0022Who sends out a rover to do science anyway? Humans, that\u0027s who, and we don\u0027t like them.\u0022 At which point, I completely disregarded your lack of any science equipment on the rover and took it for what it is: An extremely rugged and durable rover able to cross any obstacle it comes across. I figure this is one of the best rovers for noobs, because what does every new player do the first time they go roving? They flip it. They get it stuck or get bored because it\u0027s so slow. You\u0027ve made a tedious process such as driving a rover into an enjoyable psuedo-flight experience. Not to mention the excellent amount of character you sold it under. You also included an objective comparison sheet to all the other entries for judgement, it\u0027s not pretentious, it\u0027s not excessive, it\u0027s fun in every sense of the word. I like to think of this one like a Tonka toy. It\u0027s tough, takes a bit of abuse, and it\u0027s fun for everyone. Extremely well done, Andrew Hansen!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERavenchant: Your entry is the absolute most beautiful entry of all of them, from a visual and a design perspective. It\u0027s tiny, yet it can totally carry a Kerb. It uses static panels that are more durable than the expandable ones, and it has a skycrane that looks exactly appropriate for the job. It\u0027s wide, it carries all the science equipment, and it\u0027s adaptable. This appears to be for the other kind of new player, who more or less can fly well, but is more interested in seriously playing the game with realistic and well designed craft. I also love that you used the ant engines, as they\u0027re highly underappreciated. Your design is excellent and is why it\u0027s placed in a sort of yin-yang relationship with the NOKERB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery well done, all of you, even those not on this list! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-M5K\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-11T05:04:23Z\u0022 title=\u002212/11/2013 05:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 11, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by M5000\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Liowen","CreatedById":94498,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-10T23:42:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022XolotlLoki\u0022 data-cite=\u0022XolotlLoki\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve finally finished Kerbin rover testing, and started doing Munar EDL \u002B rover testing.
