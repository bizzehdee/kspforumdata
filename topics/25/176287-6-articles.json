Or rather about fifty unsuccessful whirls and one or two good ones- this is a great course, but man that 100-degree turn in the Rush section is even more of a killer than Dead Kerbs Kurve. I have a LOT of crash footage.\u00A0 Video here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/FvsM1RhiBrE\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://youtu.be/FvsM1RhiBrE\u003C/a\u003E I screwed up one or two turns, but overall easily the best run I\u0027ve managed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDone with a joystick (first time using one is KSP, usually I go WASD all the way). By my count the time was 00:01:00 to 00:07:13, for a total time of 6 minutes and 13 seconds. Two things I was unclear about though; firstly how far into the Bowl I needed to go; and secondly, does \u0022exit the bowl vertically\u0022 mean precisely 90 degrees? I think I made about 70-80 before my roll in this run, so if I need to re-run it let me know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-07-25T18:13:21Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2018 06:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by katze316\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
