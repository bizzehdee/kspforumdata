Get on ye boats and sail to ye south pole n back, aye?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, starting from the water at the end of the runway, sail a boat all the way to the south pole and back, it doesn\u0027t have to be the exact south pole, just to the ice caps biome and back to KSC, heres the rules:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: You must not go on land: This is pretty self-explanatory, so don\u0027t go on land, except when you launch your vessel, skimming the land is okay, but going properly on it like a rover isn\u0027t, it is fine to beach yourself on the land, as long as you get off of it and are back on your way in the sea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: You must not go into the air: This, too, except for getting into the water, which you should be using hyperedit for, theres obvious exceptions like getting a bit of air and stuff, this rule generally means no flying, getting a some air is okay, properly flying is not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: You must take screenshots: Take a screenshot at your departure, a few during your trip, one at the Ice cap, a few during the way back, and one back at KSC. But take as many screenshots as is necessary, document every cool event during your journey!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: You must come back to KSC: Enough said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAllowed mods: Better Buoyancy (pretty much required) Hyperedit (for getting into the water) Fengists shipyard/maritime pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETips: Structural Fuselages are a godsend, use these to keep your vessel afloat! Wheesleys and a good amount of LF fuselages are the best option for moving. Use control surfaces at the sides of the surface of the vessel, if you angle them a bit they look like the sides of a real boat, and they are very good for manouvring. Airbrakes are useful, as they help your craft turn and stop in an emergency situation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo lets do that again, shall we? Make your ship, hyperedit it into the water (ship lander \u0026gt; load \u0026gt; KSC (wet) or something like that.) sail to the southern ice caps, sail back to KSC, take screenshots along the way. Profit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets see what you all can do!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/k0jyBXb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022k0jyBXb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample boat, it can turn without moving!

The \u003Cem\u003EPolar Aurora\u003C/em\u003E had 4180 LF and 2 Whiplash engines for power. From departure it was cruising nicely at about 115 m/s on full throttle, 4x physwarp, about 2 game-hours in. Draining fuel mass was allowing my speed to creep up ever high, eventually up to 140\u002B m/s. Then with no warning the ship despawned and all that was left was a few radial intakes bouncing away - maybe I hit a surface seam, or possibly the weight/speed hit a critical threshold and caused a \u0027surface collision\u0027? Anyway, even so I still wouldn\u0027t have got half way to the polar ice with that fuel allowance. I figure I could double the fuel without losing too much velocity, but the part count climbs crazy and the chance of what happened last time happening again goes up with every joint.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my boat anyway:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/616221445666376384/2565312803B1ED1BF94D4D03700BBFBC412E9C48/\u0022 alt=\u00222565312803B1ED1BF94D4D03700BBFBC412E9C48\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/616221445666376788/A46BCA01702633B5B2F1292A368734587272AB7D/\u0022 alt=\u0022A46BCA01702633B5B2F1292A368734587272AB7D\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharkman Briton","CreatedById":148040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T18:12:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReally like the boat, Wheesleys are the best for boats IMO, and you can still get good speed with them, and to save on part count a bit use Structural Fuselages instead of radial intakes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xendelaar","CreatedById":139535,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T21:33:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy current design has a top speed of 34 m/s...
