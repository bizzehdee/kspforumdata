Your challenge is to circumnavigate Kerbin,\u00A0from one side to the other, while keeping your craft entirely submerged\u00A0in the water as quickly as you can. Your craft can be as large as you want it to be and you can use any mod you want. You cannot however use any kind of cheat/cheat-like mod\u00A0whatsoever throughout your trip. You \u00A0also\u00A0might want to make your craft self-sustainable\u00A0with drills/converters/solarpanels as I doubt you could carry enough fuel/electricity\u00A0for the whole journey.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, technically you cant go entirely from one side of the planet to the other but you can get pretty darn close. If you look at the image down below you can see there is a route that goes almost all the way around. Your mission is to get from A to B or vise versa.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ACBM5hL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ACBM5hL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis post will be updated with more stuff later, I\u0027m\u00A0writing this in a fairly short amount of time. And if you have Ideas of what to add to the challenge please comment them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDifferent modes and rewards to come!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease post videos of your adventure down below! I cant wait to see what kinds of craft you people come up with!\u00A0Good luck!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-21T12:00:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuggestion for someone: add two Kerbinside spawn points at A/B ( to cope with people starting in either spot ) \u0026amp; share the save.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInteresting idea, given what people do for Elcano I\u0027m sure there\u0027s a few with the stamina to do the whole way at 30m/s \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
