Here is a similar one; build the fastest survivable stock sled (Ok, not truly a sled, it has wheels). How you make sure it is survivable is up to you. I opted to launch a small plane off and parachute it down in the ocean. Top speed of 209 m/s before disconnecting at the end of the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust to be clear, this is the fastest speed of the sled itself by the end of the runway, not anything that might get launched from it.
