(actually Level 1 but it\u0027s so much more impressive than that).  The little radial reaction wheel seems like a surprise MVP (most valuable part!) because it makes all of those tiny final stages that much lighter.  I also see lots of VX series 2 engines.  It was interesting to see what you did with reentry when the speeds are so high and the rules don\u0027t exactly account for balance with a rescaled system.  It was impressive to see the efficiency and arrangement of everything, especially the landing on Tylo.\n\u003E \n\n[@sdj64](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/100819-sdj64/) thanks!

That part still has normal drag, and this drag is affected by the relative size of the part infront and **behind** it.   This is a bit counterintuitive as the part behind it is inside the fairing.  \n\nSo to avoid extra drag make sure the part you close the fairing around does not have a smaller part behind it.\n\nAlso note that there are some bugs where some parts still generate drag inside a fairing,  I think it is mostly \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E parts and kerbals in command chairs."},{"CreatedByName":"DBowman","CreatedById":122106,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-22T21:40:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 9 hours ago, Nefrums said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So to avoid extra drag make sure the part you close the fairing around does not have a smaller part behind it.\n\u003E \n\nAh thanks. I think this is what got me; replace a terrier with three sparks, so an oct strut is behind the fuel tank but in the fairing.
