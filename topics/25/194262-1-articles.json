My challenge is make two reusable rocket booster and strap them both of the sides of a space station to de-orbit it. Next stage the boosters and de-orbit them both, Finally de-orbit them all and safely bring them all back. Or you could just do it with the one booster and no space station whatever you prefer.\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarkoeZ","CreatedById":55420,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-30T17:10:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the suggestion, but i think the goal is a bit too vague for most people.
