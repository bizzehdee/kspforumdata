For this, the only mod you\u0027ll need is the Outer Planets mod which adds Sarnus (Saturn), Urlum (Uranus), Neidon (Neptune), and Plock-Karen (Pluto-Charon). The goal of this challenge is to recreate the classic NASA Voyager missions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBackground:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVoyagers 1 and 2 were probes NASA launched in 1977. Their goal was to visit all of the outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) without using any fuel whatsoever after launch. The two probes used gravity assists from each planet they visited to slingshot to the next planet. Voyager 1 did not go to any other planets as it flew by Saturn. Voyager 2 did visit the two other planets, however. In 1989, Voyager 2 left Neptune and reached the end of the mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Mission:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour goal is to build the two Voyager probes and recreate the mission as closely as possible to the real thing. You must visit Jool, Sarnus with Voyager 1. You must also visit Jool, Sarnus, Urlum, and Neidon with Voyager 2. Remember, no fuel was put into either of the Voyager probes. Recreate the two probes as closely as possible.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMake sure to comment if you succesfuly completed the mission or if you have any questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor further information, you can go onto nasa.gov and look at the information about Voyagers 1 and 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood luck!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Raging Sandwich","CreatedById":164377,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-31T19:14:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo win you must comment on how you did it and show me snapshots.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Interplanet Janet","CreatedById":146268,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-03T18:07:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could also do a \u0022Voyager 1-A\u0022, which should fly by Plock-Karen.
