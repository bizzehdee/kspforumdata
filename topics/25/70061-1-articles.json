I.E. each launch is worth consecutively less than the last, so if the first has a divisor of 1, then the next has a divisor of 2, then the next has a divisor of 3, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETechnically though, there is a way around either method. Use an SSTO and actually re-use it. I.E. make a plane that goes up and ditches a few to a few dozen Kerbals in orbit, comes back down, lands at the runway, refuels by means of a giant pre-made refueling station with millions of units of fuel, gets Kerbals from a hotel the size of a small city that is pre-launched and moved to the greens near KSC, much like the fuel tanker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2-4 launches, no fundamental limit besides the height one can build and the loading range (but let\u0027s face it, we don\u0027t need trillions of tonnes of fuel or billions of Kerbals, so multiple-mile-tall multiple-mile-wide megastructures that reach the limits of KSP loading distance and physics would be unnecessary.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, there is a disadvantage to this system in that each launch could take up to 30 minutes depending on pilot skill and how much fuel the plane can afford to waste on inefficient trajectories. This means one would still want to make their plane harbor, say, 50 Kerbals just for expediency without compromising its ability to hold together.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
