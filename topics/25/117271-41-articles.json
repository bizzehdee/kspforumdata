I was originally intending to pit all the late submissions against the tournament successor together, but quite frankly I\u0027m thoroughly sick of the whole affair. \n\nI used Bandicam to record the tournament, using the 720p YouTube preset. Be sure to adjust the preset if you intend to record your tournament using Bandicam, and perform test recordings to verify that all is well."},{"CreatedByName":"CreativeCombat","CreatedById":112338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-26T06:10:58Z","Content":"If it isn\u0027t completely clear by now, my tournament is [B]over[/B].

As demonstrated by the XMF (sorry for always using it as an example, but I see it as the most likely champion) a volley of missiles can be incredibly deadly and end the fight really quickly.
