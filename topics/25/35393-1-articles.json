I find that clustered massive SSTO\u0027s like yours are brilliantly simple to use and I have used smaller ones to put space stations in orbit.

I primarily used the spike engines because these behemoths do not take off super fast so I wanted something with good efficiency at all altitudes. Also, they are small while still being relatively powerful, so it is easy to include a lot of them. I also find them more stable than the really big engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, with mainsails and clustered engines, I find that the mainsails start overheating so easily that you need to run much of the launch at only about 80% power, which means you are basically throwing away the entire point of the mainsails.
