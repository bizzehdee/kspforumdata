(cheapest/smallest/lightest craft to escape velocity)","CreatedByName":"rocx","CreatedById":140968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T21:22:20Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"rocx","CreatedById":140968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T21:22:20Z","Content":"The other Kerbonauts are getting sick of hearing Jebediah bragging about his exploits, waving his medals around and playing cruel practical jokes. After another practical joke almost gone horribly wrong (it involved two decouplers, a Klaw and some sharks), they decide it is payback time, and get together in the VAB during the night. With your help, they will send Jebediah far away for a long time.\n\n**Build a** **craft that c** **an take at least one kerbal to Kerbin escape velocity, and demonstrate it.**  **In version 1.0.3!**\n\n**Rules:**\n\n1. One launch only, no help from any spacecraft not part of the launch.\n\n2. Craft must contain at least one Kerbal from start to finish. Preferebly Jebediah Kerman. Capsule, chair, ladder, whatever works. Jeb may steer the craft himself: he has been told a story about a planned \u0022deep space rendezvous\u0022.\n\n3. Launch must take place from the ground, launch clamps may not lift the craft more than ~10m.\n\n4. Craft must leave Kerbin\u0027s SoI. While hitting Mun at high velocity also does the job, the kerbals are pranksters, not murderers. Gravity assists are allowed and encouraged.\n\n5. Mods that add parts and mods that change physics will not be in the main ranking. If you insist, I will add separate leaderboards.\n\n6. No abuse of physics glitches and bugs. No use of EVA rocketpack.\n\n7. No recovery of any parts: this is a sneaky operation!\n\n Oh, and don\u0027t feel bad for Jebediah, you know he always finds a way home.\n\n**Scoring:**\n\nWe all chipped in: Ranking for the cheapest craft to get rid of Jeb.\n\n1.
