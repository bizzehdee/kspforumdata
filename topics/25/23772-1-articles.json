I decided to make myself some rules to play within a while ago, to add a different flavour to the game, and now I\u0027ve rewritten them with 0.18 in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs always, this is a continued work in progress, and all suggestions are appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to Play\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eits a very simple game, you begin with an amount of currency, call it what you will, Kerbdollars, spacebux, Kerbits, Kennies, etc. For starting, I set that amount to 100,000(k) or, \u0027one-hundred-thousand Kerbits\u0027. (k) from now on will designate currency, to differentiate between shorthand terms such as \u0027100k\u0027 (100,000). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this 100,000(k) you must pick a Mission and a Target, and build a vehicle to accomplish that combined goal. For example, \u0027I want to put a Kerbal on the Mun\u0027 Kerbal Landing is your mission, and the Mun is your Target. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll parts in KSP have a cost, albeit an arbitrary one. This is what we measure by.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have built your vehicle, use a handy mod such as Kerbal Engineer to find out the final cost of the vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlongside the Mission and Target are rewards in (k)erbits. Upon a successful mission, you will receive half your overall vehicle cost returned to you (as an investment in your ongoing success), and the combined rewards for the Mission and Target. A Failed Mission will not grant you any rewards, and in some more painful failures, incur penalties and/or fines. An example of a failure would be dropping a NERVA engine onto Kerbin, or Kerbinaut Death.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERewards\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENEW: After each successful mission, all missions of that type reduced by 50% in Reward. (this is a balancing factor i used heavily in the first iteration of campaign mode, and therefore is subject to change all input is greatly appreciated!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 50% reduction applies only once, so that your second, third, fourth and so on mission of the same type will all be rewarded half the reward for the first mission. The 50% reduction only applies to Mission rewards, Not Target Rewards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMissions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMissions are relatively self-explanatory, I\u0027ve tried to cover all the objectives I could possibly think of, if you have anything to add, please don\u0027t hesitate to ask, this is very much a Work in Progress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotes on Missions: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happens if you overshoot a Mission? lets say a suborbital probe reaches stable orbit. You have technically failed your Mission, but achieved unmanned orbit! take the reward for the Mission you PLANNED to achieve, and deduct 10% from the reward, lets say this 10% went into altering documents, forgery and keeping a few mouths shut.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETargets\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETargets are a way of balancing Missions around the difficulty in getting to the various planets and moons. Each planet and moon has two Targets, Orbit and Landing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOperations\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA step up from the Mission\u0026amp;Target system are Operations. Operations are any Mission\u0026amp;Target that requires Two or more Missions working together, examples being a Rendezvous mission, or an Apollo-Style Moon Mission, and anything up to complex multi-part moon and space stations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotes: After Two vehicles in an Operation, the 50% Vehicle Cost Return is reduced to 10% vehicle Cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf an Operation is undertaken with a single Mission, such as launching multiple Satellites in one launch, you gain the reward for the Satellite Mission, plus 10% of the Reward again for each Satellite after the first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10% of the Average Vehicle, Cost of all Vehicles in the Operation, times the number of vehicles in the Operation, is rewarded upon Mission Success.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVehicles\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeparate from the Mission\u0026amp;Target structure, Reusable and Semi-Reusable Vehicles can be purchased for one-off payments of their cost, plus a base price. Such things may be as simple as a taxi to move Kerbinauts around the space centre, to a complex sea rescue craft, and whatever you can imagine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrew\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach Kerbinaut is purchased individually for 2,500(k), to cover the cost of his \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Celite training\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2TM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome events in these Rules such as Life Support are defined by Time. The easiest way to find out the true game time is to make your first active vehicle a \u0027clock\u0027 . Stick a probe body nearby the space centre, and use its MET time in the Tracking Station as your overall time spent playing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel Cost\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel costs 10(k) Per KMU of LiquidFuel (This is around average of the contents of stock fueltanks, plus mark up, transportation, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse the Cost listed above for mod-added and stock Fueltanks, for balance reasons. this only applies to Fueltanks specifically for the purposes of refueling another vehicle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPenalties\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPenalties can be incurred from anything from land-falling debris below the burn-up threshold, to loss of Kerbinaut life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAchievement Bonuses\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn Achievement Bonus is a One Time Only bonus awarded after certain goals have been achieved. You get the achievement bonuses when you achieve them, regardless of the state of the mission, collect all that apply, but they each apply once as a one-time-only award.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDevelopment\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll Vehicles Marked as Test Types cost only 25% of their actual cost, but must not leave Sub-Orbital Kerbin flight around the KSC.

These points can be used as currency to gain new technology such and Ion propulsion or NERVA engines. Alternatively points can be sold off for cold hard cash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERandom Events\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERandom Events are a dice-decided amount and type of Missions that represent Government, Civilian and Military job offers to your space program.
