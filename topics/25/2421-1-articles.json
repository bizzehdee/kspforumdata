Ended up with a periapsis at about 58 km. I wanted 35, but like I said, stupid thumb. Anyway, it took maybe half a dozen orbits. (Not entirely sure, I left it to go eat dinner for a bit. But after about 5 hours of slow aerobraking, it finally dipped down low enough to catch some thick air and landed. This starting from an orbit of about 500 km, I believe. The first few passes only shaved off maybe 10 or so m/s from my speed. But by the next to last pass I was losing over a hundred.
