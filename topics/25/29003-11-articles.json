What it brings is the oportunity to accelerate only half as much habitat mass (thus the fuel savings) and only needing to accelerate the return supplies once. For everything else the standard Hohmann transfer still seems to be the most efficient option and are still likely to be required because a cycler doesn\u0027t make any sense until everything else is already in place at Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also comes with it\u0027s own myriad of interesting challenges. Our challenge gives us a max of 10 days to make a rendezvous and docking with one (otherwise you are carrying so mush hab space it offers no advantage) as it flys by and after you do rendezvous you are looking at either docking two large craft or running a plethora of shuttle transfers. Also don\u0027t miss the rendezvous, without a massive delta V reserve \u0027it\u0027s a bad day\u0027. To keep the robust mission achievement I am looking at running two in formation, running two cyclers in formation together is going to make for an interesting challenge Esp when it means to use both of them I would be making two ships rendezvous with them inside a 10 day window. From my experimentation so far I am finding the closing and docking to be the same as in Kerbin orbit (just will be huge assets doing it) So far my tests have shown that initial rendezvous just outside kerbins SOI has been docking on hardest level. I attempted one inside the SOI, flying the cycler target down to a Kerbin PE of 90 KM but that docking attempt ended up, messy, fast. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/qCVfUlFZQ4U?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003Ethat shows how an Earth Mars one would work\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-13T19:42:28Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2013 07:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by meyst\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Patupi","CreatedById":71098,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T20:54:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m assuming they have engines?

For reentry damage, does fairings count as heat shields?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. If i have a component with a transfer stage that can reach Duna can i send it right away form Kerbin orbit or do i have to wait for the windows? There will be the appropriate wait time between launches as stated form rule No.2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. As for the lifter, how can calculate its payload capability? I know it\u0027s a more of a how to question but skimming through the other pages i didn\u0027t find anything useful and from what i understood it\u0027s a trial and error procedure to build a suitable lifter. Also a single lifter will be used for either light or heavy payloads, no variations of it right?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Speeding Mullet","CreatedById":62635,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T10:54:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) Yes, Sturmstiger uses them in his own entry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) As long as you adhere to the wait times between launches, and you have the delta v, you can fire things off window with great gusto.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) I designed a payload first, and built the launcher around the weight of the payload I wanted to send. I pretty much hit the right launcher first time on the assumption that it would take me about 4800 m/s in delta V to obtain orbit. There are some good tutorials on rocket design online if you need more tips on staging etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy launcher has been identical and without variation bar the payloads it launches, I think that\u0027s what the challenge calls for. If your rocket is truly modular I don\u0027t see why this wouldn\u0027t be in the spirit of the challenge, as long as it didn\u0027t break any other rules. Personally I don\u0027t think it\u0027s worth it unless you are saving the delta v to launch off window, you may as well wait for the best window and fling as much tonnage as your rocket can manage towards Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-15T10:59:09Z\u0022 title=\u002208/15/2013 10:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Speeding Mullet\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor831","CreatedById":68286,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T13:38:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMade an official entry here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/46209-Intrepid-Mission-to-Duna-Duna-Permanent-Architecture-Challenge\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/46209-Intrepid-Mission-to-Duna-Duna-Permanent-Architecture-Challenge\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll be posting there to keep this thread clean, and I\u0027m hoping to actually fly these missions in full.
