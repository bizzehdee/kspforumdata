The giant stack of SRBs I was using (my self-imposed penance for using mod parts: no LFEs) could only do a direct-ascent profile--the launch stages didn\\\u0027t have enough push to get the final stage into an orbit; the last stage went from sub-orbital to Kerbol escape in one burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst efforts were two-stage designs basically launched straight up from the pad, which put several pods into Kerbol orbits with very low periapses, because the pad\\\u0027s position caused me to leave Kerbin\\\u0027s SoI at about 6km/s. I finally had to go from a two-stage design to a three-stage one, and went with a \u003Cem\u003Ewestward\u003C/em\u003E launch profile: first stage lifts the rest out of the atmosphere almost straight up and slightly to the west (basically just enough to counter Kerbin\\\u0027s rotation); second stage pushes the final stage west into optimal firing position; final stage goes for the gold. The loss from the western launch was made up for by not needing to get the final stage 3/4ths of the way around the planet before firing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, yeah, I think this is the first mission since .12 where I\\\u0027ve gone with a western launch profile.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
