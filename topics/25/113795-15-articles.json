It\u0027s not recommended that a Hornet pilot aim for the sky at low speed because even if the power to weight ratio exceeds 1:1 it won\u0027t be by enough to make a speedy escape. Even so it\u0027s possible and recommended if you get in a jam.\n\nThe bad news about the hornet is that it suffers from aeroelasticity at moderately high dynamic pressures. This means that if you are in a dive, at a certain amount of dynamic pressure equivalent to mach 1.7 at 2000m most control inputs will do absolutely nothing, even the elevator controls will just make the airframe bop up and down and maybe move a little the way you want to go. in this phase of flight using the air brakes is really not recommended since they are very large and when exposed to more pressure than they can handle, will part company with the airframe and take large and important things with them."},{"CreatedByName":"TMasterson5","CreatedById":144591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T00:14:20Z","Content":"I invite all of you to join us over at KSP Military Creations on facebook!Link to group: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/372011822987779/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/372011822987779/)"},{"CreatedByName":"Emilio","CreatedById":12359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T23:29:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I invite all of you to join us over at KSP Military Creations on facebook!Link to group: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/372011822987779/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/372011822987779/)\n\nJust to let you know - you already posted this 16 pages ago."},{"CreatedByName":"Halsfury","CreatedById":54576,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T00:30:17Z","Content":"As promised, here\u0027s my final revision of the F/A-18 with drop tanks.

I used tweakscale to increase the size of my forward landing gear, and decrease the size of those giant delta wings a bit.\n\nAfter testing, the plane has a maximum lifting weight of 19.9T, which is formidable. It is also entirely re-configurable to allow for ground-strike missions, even though it is currently set up as an air superiority fighter. If any of you wish to try this thing, be my guest, but keep in mind that at below 200m/s, it has enough pitch authority to stall out with relative ease (it will correct itself with fervor, preventing execution of Pugachev\u0027s Cobra, which really is more a show of instability than manoeuvrability). \n\nP.S. Also, the craft should remain combat capable if it loses one or both of its canards, or even one or two of its rear control surfaces.\n\nP.P.S. Serious thanks to FourGreenFields for making me think differently about those front canards.\n\nP.P.P.S. If you give control of the craft to the AI node (it\u0027s on the bottom of the plane, near the rear), I suggest you restrict its stearing to 70%. I don\u0027t think it understands how to self-govern, currently.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-24T19:28:05Z\u0022 title=\u002208/24/2015 07:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheHengeProphet**"},{"CreatedByName":"FourGreenFields","CreatedById":139309,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-18T21:27:17Z","Content":"![AYOH1pU.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/AYOH1pU.jpg)\n\nAs a Messerschmitt fanboy, I have to find a way to make this thing reach it\u0027s historical calculated top speed of Mach 2 with a basic jet!
