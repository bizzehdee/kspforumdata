Adding the side boosters was a lot harder than expected. the plan was to add 6 but only did 5. had to reload back to 4 so it would be balanced. Also they flapped around to much it flight so I losted a lot of thrust/fuel. Then detaching them was also tricky and slow.

Also you might want to think about having your side boosters on decouplers as well as docking ports as trying to undocking a number of moving docking ports can be slow.\n\nMy early carts had Vertical boosters on them so they could boost up to dock but I found that it was easier just to set the height right so I just had to drive under it.
