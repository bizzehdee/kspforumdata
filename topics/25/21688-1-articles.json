We could arrive at this answer, first, by calculating the highest possible dV that any spacecraft in KSP can ever attain. Because all fuel tanks carry 9 times as much fuel as their own dry mass, and the highest possible Isp using the nuclear engine is 800s, the limit as you keep adding more and more fuel tanks ad infinitum using the Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation is 800 \u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D 9.81 \u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D ln(9), or 17243.8m/s. You could set this dV equal to the dV required to make a transfer to the lowest possible orbit and solve it, but that\u0027s some hard math and I haven\u0027t been able to do it yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Night_Miner","CreatedById":51588,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-09T16:22:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E.....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHuh?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dilin","CreatedById":39058,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-09T22:21:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe closest you can get to the sun is 4000 meters, so the real challenge is getting there and not any closer than 4000m\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AncientAstronaut","CreatedById":36093,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-09T22:26:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe Kosmo-not found that he could orbit under 2 kilometers before blowing up at 1km.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
