Which immediately puts it out in front. Sensible mass, sensible part count (though could have replaced some of those segment ladders with multiple retractable ladders) and DV designed for it\u0027s intended purpose which also affords a good range of other targets. Only worry is that it\u0027s height and relatively narrow landing leg spread could make for some wobbly landings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAfter all that, some general thoughts\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my mind a stock Super Heavy Lander should *not* be \u0022super heavy. The existing stock super heavy is 20 tons. To us that\u0027s not super heavy. To a newbie who has to design a launch vehicle to get that lander into space and to it\u0027s destination mass is very, very important. Using the (very) rough rule of thumb that to get a payload into LKO one needs a launch vehicle 6 times it\u0027s mass we\u0027d be looking at a 120 ton launch vehicle for the existing stock and a 600 ton launch vehicle to get a 100 ton lander into orbit - that\u0027s a massive, massive engineering challenge which should not be required of a newbie looking to use a stock craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is such a thing as too much DV. An Eve return lander is going to be capable of landing on every other body in the system. Yet it would be totally unsuited for every other body. More DV is not necessarily better as it requires exponentially greater effort in the lower stages - effort that is wasted for every destination other than the hardest target. Personally I chose Moho as my top end destination (c. 2800 DV req\u0027d for land and return), engineered in a healthy margin of error (raising to 3600 DV) and figured the surplus would be of use in widening mission profile in easier targets but wouldn\u0027t impact too greatly on the design of lower stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Stock\u0022 is the operative word. Stock craft should have simplicity, ease of use, and be a jumping off point into more adventurous designs. This is not a competition for the best heavy lander. It\u0027s a competition for the best stock heavy lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that in mind I\u0027d like to shortlist two entries which I fear won\u0027t get enough attention otherwise and which to my mind epitomise the above points:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EBlaster - ROFL\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Efrizzank - super-heavy-lander\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth are simple, sensible, and if either of them were the existing stock lander we wouldn\u0027t be saying that the stock was such an abomination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy vote, thanks to the slightly higher DV, and ignoring the slight drogue chute staging problem, goes to \u003Cstrong\u003EFizzrank\u0027s Super Heavy Lander\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-15T18:42:36Z\u0022 title=\u002210/15/2013 06:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by MiniMatt\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xeldrak","CreatedById":57228,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T18:02:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThats a nice breakdown, MiniMatt \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E Thanks - I think these posts are one of the best parts of these challenges.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"briansun1","CreatedById":67451,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T18:04:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou know what I think I might have overdone it with the parachutes... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DaveofDefeat","CreatedById":58539,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T18:10:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENext time i\u0027ll make it carry 1,000 kerbals!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SirJodelstein","CreatedById":62251,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T18:47:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edifficult decision.

On the missions I have run with it I used about a dozen boosters to get her through most of the atmosphere and then since I have lots of TWR I can have her make the rest of the way under her own power, and then pick her up with an intra system or inter planetary main engine to be taken to the intended destination/destinations, with enough extra fuel to refuel her on the way.

Would you care to elaborate? A discussion on the pros and cons may shed light on certain concepts not considered in the crafts construction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI felt it was important to have more Delta-v than necessary and introduce certain concepts to the player.

Part of that is failing, learning and improving stock designs. My 7X lander was actually designed as a 3-man Tylo lander for which it was awesome, but I decided that there\u0027s no fun in stock crafts already being better than some advanced players can build them. Hence I made it a 7 person very capable Duna lander. I could have ditched 4 of the 8 landing stage fuel tanks and put the landing legs on the inner fuel tank and the craft would still have had plenty Delta-v, but I think it\u0027s more important to teach the player the concepts like asparagus staging and then let their own imagination improve a crafts capacity by changing and rebuilding it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am interested in hearing your opinion on the matter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xeldrak","CreatedById":57228,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T22:21:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008000;\u0022\u003EAbout 21 hours to go until the primary vote is closed!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"briansun1","CreatedById":67451,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T22:22:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Efor the poll is it locked by ip address?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xeldrak","CreatedById":57228,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T22:49:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would think so...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T22:59:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Epoll are not cheat proof. so, getting commend from others are more important. since winner gets nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"briansun1","CreatedById":67451,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T23:00:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not trying to vote for myself repeatedly if that\u0027s what you\u0027re worried about\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T23:06:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is good enough for me if I feel happy with my creation/submission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"briansun1","CreatedById":67451,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T23:11:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eit\u0027s not the destination that matters but the journey\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"minerman30","CreatedById":63054,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T23:42:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI vote for Xeldrak, with the suggestion of removing the large battery and instead putting four smaller 1.25m batteries right beneath the nosecone.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"I_Killed_Jeb","CreatedById":84817,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T00:11:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would love to test out all the other submissions but until .22 hits tomorrow KSP is just too unstable for me to do so =(\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T00:52:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022I_Killed_Jeb\u0022 data-cite=\u0022I_Killed_Jeb\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI would love to test out all the other submissions but until .22 hits tomorrow KSP is just too unstable for me to do so =(\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.22 tomorrow could be 2 months later.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Giggleplex777","CreatedById":29829,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T01:04:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sirine\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sirine\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E.22 tomorrow could be 2 months later.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you seen the Weekly?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u002210.16.2013\u0022\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T01:35:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Giggleplex777\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Giggleplex777\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHave you seen the Weekly?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot until you told me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaxmaps seems doing his job pretty smart.
