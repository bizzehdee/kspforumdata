At the apogee (or perigee), adjust to a low-eccentricity orbit. That can take a while, though. My bigger concern is how do you reliably nose-over the craft? It\u0027d be relatively easy to exceed orbital velocity and enter into an eccentric orbit. If your aim is only to stage it, perhaps you can use symmetrical ships and have one booster or engine engage moments before the rest, to nose over the craft.

I\u0027ve finally got my flight profile nailed down though: throttle to 95-100%, turn on stability augmentation, ascend at a slight angle (under full SAS control) to ~14 km on first stage and jettison immediately; wait 5-12 seconds as the upper stage arcs down to about 75 degrees pitch, and fire upper stage. It is at about 26 km and 1500 m/s that I run into trouble; the fuel burning from the front tank makes the upper stage unstable and it quits arcing towards the horizon, then flips over into a nose-up attitude until about 65 km and 2500 m/s (still going up too steeply for a stable orbit).

The rocket stopped climbing at about 45 km and was gently pushed DOWN again with the last bit of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was FANTASTIC for me, as it meant that my perikee had been pushed IN FRONT of me, and I only had to wait a minute or two to cross it and determine whether my orbit was stable or not.
