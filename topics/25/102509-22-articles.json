ALL of it. The reason is: heat generation and dissipation, like every damned thing else Squad comes up with, does not take terrestrial vehicles into account. In real world physics, items that generate heat also dissipate heat unless the surrounding environment is hotter than the item. In my testing, items that generate heat while on a planet surface, retain that heat forcing you to either stop and wait for literally hours, or come up with a stupid solution. In one example, I had the paddlewheel stacks generating heat. I put a folding radiator on the opposite end of the ship. When the stacks started to overheat, I\u0027d stop the ship and wait... nothing... heat didn\u0027t go away. I\u0027d open the radiator and magically, all the heat left the stacks and went through the ship and out the radiators. But, if I put surface mount radiators directly on the stacks, the heat didn\u0027t dissipate. As far as I\u0027m concerned, for terrestrial vehicle operation, the heat code is unrealistic and downright stupid.

ALL of it. The reason is: heat generation and dissipation, like every damned thing else Squad comes up with, does not take terrestrial vehicles into account. In real world physics, items that generate heat also dissipate heat unless the surrounding environment is hotter than the item. In my testing, items that generate heat while on a planet surface, retain that heat forcing you to either stop and wait for literally hours, or come up with a stupid solution. In one example, I had the paddlewheel stacks generating heat. I put a folding radiator on the opposite end of the ship. When the stacks started to overheat, I\u0027d stop the ship and wait... nothing... heat didn\u0027t go away. I\u0027d open the radiator and magically, all the heat left the stacks and went through the ship and out the radiators. But, if I put surface mount radiators directly on the stacks, the heat didn\u0027t dissipate. As far as I\u0027m concerned, for terrestrial vehicle operation, the heat code is unrealistic and downright stupid.

I did that when I had planned on doing mountaineering on Pol. Might not actually need it on laythe.
