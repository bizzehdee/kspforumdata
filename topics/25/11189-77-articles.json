Admittedly the payload fraction for this vehicle basically only consists of 4 Kerbals and some luggage, but I can put it around 90km and fly her home. Figure I will use her simply for crew transfers. I\u0027ll attempt something more useful later, but I really liked the re-balancing of the SSTO engines and stuff to make them more realistic (though I couldn\u0027t get them to work in .90 for some reason...![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)). \n\nThings I learned? 45 degrees to 10km, then 20 degrees to about 20km then just ride it slightly above prograde til about 2000 m/s and then circularize and all that when you leave atmo. The three engine type design worked for me because you basically have the RAPIERS helping in both modes without adding more engines. I do also have a nice 4 turbojet, 2 aerospike version that is legit, but I like the way the RAPIERS look and they are slightly more efficient with this configuration. Not proficient enough at design yet to make SSTOs for anything more than crew transfers or *very* small payloads, but playing around with them has been a nice diversion in the midst of my huge Eve return mission project. 2 weeks work so far and just one more huge technical problem to solve and I will go for my Eve Mission Return badge...![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif)\n\nApologies if I\u0027ve made any blunders in posting etiquette: new to the site.\n\nTakeoff:\n\n[![screenshot3719_zpsnsiyemb6.png](http://i99.photobucket.com/albums/l299/boggle7/Kerbal%20Pics/screenshot3719_zpsnsiyemb6.png)](http://s99.photobucket.com/user/boggle7/media/Kerbal%20Pics/screenshot3719_zpsnsiyemb6.png.html)\n\nThe Munney shot:\n\n[![screenshot3728_zpsezcsabew.png](http://i99.photobucket.com/albums/l299/boggle7/Kerbal%20Pics/screenshot3728_zpsezcsabew.png)](http://s99.photobucket.com/user/boggle7/media/Kerbal%20Pics/screenshot3728_zpsezcsabew.png.html)\n\nOrbit map:\n\n[![screenshot3727_zpsjf71d9ih.png](http://i99.photobucket.com/albums/l299/boggle7/Kerbal%20Pics/screenshot3727_zpsjf71d9ih.png)](http://s99.photobucket.com/user/boggle7/media/Kerbal%20Pics/screenshot3727_zpsjf71d9ih.png.html)\n\nOvershooting KSC and almost out of fuel...\n\n[![screenshot3736_zpsiggqkkkw.png](http://i99.photobucket.com/albums/l299/boggle7/Kerbal%20Pics/screenshot3736_zpsiggqkkkw.png)](http://s99.photobucket.com/user/boggle7/media/Kerbal%20Pics/screenshot3736_zpsiggqkkkw.png.html)\n\nGliding in to save fuel for powered landing:\n\n[![screenshot3745_zpsdsjxyuhv.png](http://i99.photobucket.com/albums/l299/boggle7/Kerbal%20Pics/screenshot3745_zpsdsjxyuhv.png)](http://s99.photobucket.com/user/boggle7/media/Kerbal%20Pics/screenshot3745_zpsdsjxyuhv.png.html)\n\n11 units of liquid fuel left!:\n\n[![screenshot3754_zps2jbasqoq.png](http://i99.photobucket.com/albums/l299/boggle7/Kerbal%20Pics/screenshot3754_zps2jbasqoq.png)](http://s99.photobucket.com/user/boggle7/media/Kerbal%20Pics/screenshot3754_zps2jbasqoq.png.html)\n\nETA: the parachute stage was a drogue chute that wasn\u0027t really necessary...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-10T12:52:21Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2015 12:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by netbumbler**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T13:33:04Z","Content":"@netbumbler, welcome to the Forum and I\u0027m pleased to give you your first \u002Brep for that sweet-looking spaceplane.

Yeah the turbos are firing, I just think the RAPIER plume is masking it. I have action-grouped the RAPIER switchover to rocket mode and the aerospike activation. IIRC I run the turbos to about 20km...basically I run the RAPIERS in air-breathing mode and the turbos until I start losing speed (seems to take me to about 850 to 1000 m/s depending on how my piloting goes), then I switch the RAPIERS to closed mode and kick in the aerospikes. And though the asymmetric flame-out bug seems to be gone, I still shut down the turbos right before they completely cut out. \n\nAnd I found a sweet way to auto-bleed speed when reentering: just have SAS and RCS on and keep a slightly nose-up profile when hitting the 30 to 32km mark...you know when the drag really starts to kick in... and just hit \u0027radial\u0027 on SAS. Then, while the craft struggles to maintain a radial angle, it creates a series of nose pops that slow you down super fast.

Well, I couldn\u0027t take the payload I initially planned, but the final version of the craft will do for rescue missions. I should test how many Kerbals I can cramp into the cargobay. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nIt was a close call though: reached a periapsis of 70.007 with 1m/s dV remaining. Though I had RCS to correct it, but I planned to use it for deorbiting, keeping stability and providing a nice CoM-placement on the way down. Not sure if my landing counts - gears touched grass first, but the inertia was enough to reach the runway. \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
