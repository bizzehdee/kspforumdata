To take a screenshot right before impact at high speeds? Seems a bit...redundant. There\u0027s no real challenge. Like whistlehead suggested, changing the rules to state that you must survive the lithobraking would make it a challenge. With a screenshot before lithobraking, hopefully during, and after, showing damages. Maybe make the scoring system as (speed of impact-# of parts lost)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can check the part count by going into map view, and clicking the little vessel tab on the right of the screen. Doing this before, and after lithobraking would show you how many parts were lost. (Screenshots of this might be needed for proof)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, say i submit one. I take a screenshot of me free falling towards the Mun at 20 m/s. I take one in map view showing that my litho-lander is composed of 20 parts. I take a screenshot of the impact, and another afterwords. Then i take a screenshot of the \u0022vessels\u0022 tab after impact, and say my engine blew up and i was left with 19 parts. My score would be (20-1)=19. losing no parts would be considered a perfect score, leaving your final score as the speed of impact. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enow, an exploit of this may be that someone could impact at 1,000 m/s, and lose all parts of a 1 part vessel and be left with a really high score. So another rule may be that the Command pod must survive. Maybe even that 50% of the vessel must survive. Lots of different rules you could choose from. If you want me to help you with more rules than i would be more than willing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-18T17:40:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is pretty similar to my \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90028-Maximum-impact-velocity\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMaximum Impact Velocity\u003C/a\u003E challenge, except for the surviving part.
