Closest I got to working was an DEMV MK4 ANT with the dish on top in a HL cargo bay. You don\u0027t have to include the kerballers or the dish, as I think those cargo bay ramps could use some lovin and I want to see what you guys come up with.

If you\u0027re prepared to scratch the paintwork it can reverse into and drive out of a MK4 cargo-bay, with the back section removed it can easily carry/deploy a huge dish with two hinges to raise/lower it through 90*. The crew can sleep in the cab, just tell them they\u0027re going camping. I added solar power and a ton of metalwork for the aesthetics/elegance.
