Lets look at historical examples of great energy fighters, or Boom and Zoom fighters. The FW-190D9 by far one of the best BnZ fighters in history. It had a phenomenal roll rate better than anything the Allies had during the war. This aloud it to pull off surprisingly quick reversals and get the shot then climb away before anything could counter it. \n\u003E \n\u003E Next we could look at the Me/Bf-109G6, again, another light weight aircraft that had a great roll rate, and actually could turn pretty decently under high speeds, but suffered at lower speeds. This mated with its power to weight ratio, it could pull itself out of most fights if it needed to. The 109G6 manual even said, \u0022when in trouble point your nose towards the heavens and climb like a home sick angel.\u0022 The G6 had a 4200fpm climb rate, when the next best allied aircraft could only manage 3700fpm. \n\u003E \n\u003E Lastly we could look at my personal favorite, the P-47D Thunderbolt. That thing was a TRUE energy fighter. If the jug was caught low, it was dead. But if it had the altitude advantage it would kill anything in the air. And because the Thunderbolt accelerated in a dive like a brick dropped by god, it could retain that energy into a mild climb. But if you asked it to turn it would burn that energy faster than a forest fire through a kindling factory.\n\nWell, debates are what forums are for, right?\n\n109 didn\u0027t have a great roll rate afaIk. Can\u0027t check my books atm, but iIrc it was nothing special in that regard. Was also reported to suffer from stiffening of all controls at high speeds. On the other hand, it could trim the elevator all the way afaIk, which could be used to assist dive recovery. Also, iIrc the massive climb rate advantage was only at some alts (I think the Typhoon had pretty awesome climb down low, same for the Lavochkins).\n\n7 tons of steel ftw! Although I still prefer the 109 (G-2), the Jug is one of the planes I\u0027m seriously afraid of, if one is above me.\n\nBut yea, if we are talking about \u0022my craft\u0022 (= seemingly the flying pencil) then I can\u0027t score much in dogfights. The flying pencil realy was built for Mach 2 top speed and nothing else. Although ofcourse that prob comes with good high-speed dive acceleration. And I can\u0027t remember much about the Shrike.
