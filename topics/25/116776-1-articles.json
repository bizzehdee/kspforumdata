The real test is Tylo. An SSTO on Tylo is quite easy but getting down is hard. Getting down and up again in a single stage really hard. If Eve is where Kerbals are stranded, Tylo is where they are buried.\n\n**The Challenge:**\n\nLand from and re-orbit to 80km the most mass-efficient SSLTO possible using stock parts only. So start with at least 80km periapsis and end with at least 80km periapsis.\n\n**The Rules**\n\n- Stock parts only. KSP version 1.0.4 only, entries from earlier versions will not be considered. \n\n- No cfg editing, save editing, debug menu, or any other shenanigans.\n\n- No physics exploits, the vessel must be lifted by engine thrust alone. \n\n- Kerbals must be in a capsule, lander can or passenger module, no chairs or ladders.\n\n- Flag must be planted.\n\n- Images or video of your attempt is required for entry, showing resources, orbits and maneuver nodes, and enough in between to show how your vessel works. Craft files are encouraged so we can learn from each other\u0027s techniques.\n\n**Permitted mods:** \n\nVisual/immersion mods, informational mods, autopilot (probably required) and Hyperdit to orbit. This is primarily a design challenge.\n\nForbidden mods: Anything that modifies stock parts, adds new parts, or changes the game\u0027s physics in any way.\n\nAside from that, be creative. Build big or small, mix and match propulsion types, whatever makes it more efficient.\n\n**The Scoring:**\n\nScore is derived from points awarded for difficulty, efficient design, usefulness, starting mass below the reference design and Kerbals greater than 1. Masses to be taken from the information screen in map mode, not the editor, and must be of the form 176.20t.\n\n\u002B1 for every 3t below the reference design mass (176.20t).\n\n\u002B10 for Jebediah mode, no autopilot\n\n\u002B.5 for every Kerbal EVA\u0027d to the surface and returned to orbit\n\n\u002B10 for a full science module, power and antenna to return science to Kerbin\n\n\u002B10 for a Science Jr on a rover which can dock with lander equipped with antenna to send science to Kerbin or with it\u0027s own power and antenna to return science\n\n**The Leaderboard:**\n\n[TABLE=width: 500]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD]Name:[/TD]\n\n[TD]Mass[/TD]\n\n[TD]Kerbals[/TD]\n\n[TD]Jebediah[/TD]\n\n[TD]Score[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]1.[/TD]\n\n[TD][Foxster](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129691-T-Prize-Single-Stage-Landing-to-Tylo-Orbit-%28SSLTO%29-Challenge-1-0-4?p=2103675\u0026viewfull=1#post2103675)[/TD]\n\n[TD]15.12t[/TD]\n\n[TD]1[/TD]\n\n[TD]No[/TD]\n\n[TD]53.69[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]2[/TD]\n\n[TD][Foxster](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129691-T-Prize-Single-Stage-Landing-to-Tylo-Orbit-%28SSLTO%29-Challenge-1-0-4?p=2106907\u0026viewfull=1#post2106907)[/TD]\n\n[TD]18.00t[/TD]\n\n[TD]1[/TD]\n\n[TD]No[/TD]\n\n[TD]52.7[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]3.[/TD]\n\n[TD][Foxster](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129691-T-Prize-Single-Stage-Landing-to-Tylo-Orbit-%28SSLTO%29-Challenge-1-0-4?p=2100720\u0026viewfull=1#post2100720)[/TD]\n\n[TD]21.10t[/TD]\n\n[TD]1[/TD]\n\n[TD]No[/TD]\n\n[TD]52.2[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]4.[/TD]\n\n[TD][Dbowman](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129691-T-Prize-Single-Stage-Landing-to-Tylo-Orbit-%28SSLTO%29-Challenge-1-0-4?p=2106658\u0026viewfull=1#post2106658)[/TD]\n\n[TD]30.10t[/TD]\n\n[TD]2[/TD]\n\n[TD]No[/TD]\n\n[TD]49.2[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]5.[/TD]\n\n[TD][Kaboom!](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129691-T-Prize-Single-Stage-Landing-to-Tylo-Orbit-%28SSLTO%29-Challenge-1-0-4?p=2101862\u0026viewfull=1#post2101862)[/TD]\n\n[TD]86.61t[/TD]\n\n[TD]1[/TD]\n\n[TD]Yes[/TD]\n\n[TD]40.3[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]6.[/TD]\n\n[TD][Foxster](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129691-T-Prize-Single-Stage-Landing-to-Tylo-Orbit-%28SSLTO%29-Challenge-1-0-4?p=2102363\u0026viewfull=1#post2102363)[/TD]\n\n[TD]880.20t[/TD]\n\n[TD]80[/TD]\n\n[TD]No[/TD]\n\n[TD]40[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]7.[/TD]\n\n[TD][Dbowman](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129691-T-Prize-Single-Stage-Landing-to-Tylo-Orbit-%28SSLTO%29-Challenge-1-0-4?p=2102225\u0026viewfull=1#post2102225)[/TD]\n\n[TD]97.86t[/TD]\n\n[TD]4[/TD]\n\n[TD]No[/TD]\n\n[TD]28.1[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]8.[/TD]\n\n[TD][Nefrums](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129691-T-Prize-Single-Stage-Landing-to-Tylo-Orbit-%28SSLTO%29-Challenge-1-0-4?p=2102326\u0026viewfull=1#post2102326)[/TD]\n\n[TD]340.16t[/TD]\n\n[TD]32[/TD]\n\n[TD]Yes[/TD]\n\n[TD]26[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]9.[/TD]\n\n[TD][Foxster](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129691-T-Prize-Single-Stage-Landing-to-Tylo-Orbit-%28SSLTO%29-Challenge-1-0-4?p=2102321\u0026viewfull=1#post2102321)[/TD]\n\n[TD]265.58t[/TD]\n\n[TD]32[/TD]\n\n[TD]No[/TD]\n\n[TD]16[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]10.[/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]11.[/TD]\n\n[TD][R](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129691-T-Prize-Single-Stage-Landing-to-Tylo-Orbit-%28SSLTO%29-Challenge-1-0-4?p=2100704\u0026viewfull=1#post2100704)[eference](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129691-T-Prize-Single-Stage-Landing-to-Tylo-Orbit-%28SSLTO%29-Challenge-1-0-4?p=2100704\u0026viewfull=1#post2100704)[/TD]\n\n[TD]176.20t[/TD]\n\n[TD]1[/TD]\n\n[TD]No[/TD]\n\n[TD].5[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[/TABLE]\n\n**The badge:**\n\nWear it knowing you are part of a select group of rocket builders.\n\n![S3X7mTI.png](http://i.imgur.com/S3X7mTI.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-31T12:30:03Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2015 12:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by selfish\\_meme**"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T01:08:47Z","Content":"A challenge I can do!

Only small downside is that I now have six toes on one foot and I glow a soft orange in low light. \n\nDe-orbit was just a blast retrograde until orbital speed was down to ~1000m/s and then leaving the rest to the onboard computer - a repurposed ZX81. \n\nLanding was an anticlimax after the horror stories from the older rocket-jockeys. \n\nPlanted the flag.

Initial circularization put us in an 15x8 orbit, so we need to raise the Pe up to 15km with another burn. \n\u003E \n\u003E It turns out there\u0027s a high enough mountain range in the way that I needed to tweak the orbit a bit using RCS to make it over, but with that done it was smooth sailing to the final circularization.\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://imgur.com/a/xKH2v](http://imgur.com/a/xKH2v)\n\nOK, sorry I am in Australia and probably a different time zone to all of you. Thanks for the entry Batz, but as Foxster pointed out the final orbit must be 80x80km. I am amending the rules so the starting orbit must be 80x80km as well.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Selfish\\_meme: Did you decide on some more points for extra crew? I have an idea for a craft to carry a couple of Kerbals.\n\nI did I am going to amend some of the rules and change the points, since you are the only one on the leaderboard your position is safe. However I do need more pics from you that show more of the flight, orbits, flag planting etc. Can you do that for me, I think you will have another entry soon.\n\nEdit: Ok the new points scoring system is\n\n\u002B1 for every 5t below the reference design mass (176.20t).\n\n\u002B20 for every additional Kerbal EVA\u0027d to the surface and returned to orbit\n\n\u002B15 for a full science module, power and antenna to return science to Kerbin\n\n\u002B10 for a Science Jr on a rover which can dock with lander or with it\u0027s own power and antenna to return science\n\nThe only other change is you must start from at least an 80x80km orbit and return to it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-25T23:16:57Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2015 11:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by selfish\\_meme**"}]}
