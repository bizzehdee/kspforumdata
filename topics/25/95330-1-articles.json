They are posted on the space station \u0022Irfrit I\u0022 and were expecting a new high-tech satellite called \u0022Spritesat III\u0022 to link up with them, but something at Mission Control went wrong and it was launched into the completely wrong orbit! Bob blames error, Bill blames food crumbs stuck in a navigation panel, and Jerald just plain doesn\u0027t know who to blame. They need you to retrieve it and bring it to them!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E**RULES**\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* You may split this into 2 missions - the first to get spritesat, the second to fly it up to Irfrit. (You do not have to physically use the one in orbit. Just bring it back and see below.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* If you do do this, DO NOT use the lifting vehicle I made for the Spritesat III ship. Get rid of everything below the decoupler and build your own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Bonus points if you can do it all in one mission. it might be do-able since their orbits cross.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* You may have to dodge a bit of space debris on the way up to Spritesat, when I made the scenario I saved right after I jettisoned the second stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoints: All of these are worth 1 point: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuccessfully bringing Spritesat back to KSC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESucessful Mission Completion - docking Spritesat to Irfrit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrew transfer to Irfrit (optional)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe following is optional but is worth 2 points:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egetting Irfrit to Mun orbit WITH Spritesat docked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the following it worth 3 points:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompleting the challenge using only one mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe challenge is in the form of a save file. Just plop it into your save folder. You can download it here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://app.box.com/s/iqa0d0lhlp0tcetbin8h\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://app.box.com/s/iqa0d0lhlp0tcetbin8h\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrivia\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* My first space station (Irfrit), it took 2 tries to get it up there. The first try resulted in a botched orbit and a firey re-entry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* With Spritesat I finally got the hang of orbiting Kerbin. Next project I am working on is getting a Spritesat in Mun orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* You can find the remains of a lander I am building to explore the Kerbin system with around the launch pad. For some reason I can\u0027t clean it up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* This is a stock mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
