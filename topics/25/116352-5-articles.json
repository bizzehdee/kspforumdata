We can have a gunship contest another time.\n\nMissiles - I\u0027ve only tried AMRAAMs and Sidewinders - do any of the others work?\n\nI\u0027ll work out a few ballpark max and min size and weight specs for what is the fighter class.\n\nGoogle says the Tu-28 was the largest interceptor ever, at 27.2m long, 18.1m wingspan, 40 metric tons weight. I very much doubt we\u0027d need anything as big as that!\n\nLess conclusive on the smallest, but the British Aerospace Hawk 200 is teeny, at length 11.38 m, wingspan 9.39 m, max takeoff weight: 9,101 kg. The Saab JAS 39 Gripen is actually lighter, 6,800 kg dry, 8,500 kg loaded, with wingspan of 8.4m\n\nI don\u0027t think we need to rescale those kind of dimensions for KSP, they\u0027re comparable.\n\nSo we could say max length 30m, min length 10m, max weight 40, min weight 6, min wingspan 7m?

I\u0027d also put a limit on countermeasure pods--and missiles/guns for that matter, so that missiles have a chance to hit, but actually run out. Someone could easily build a wacky races plane with 50 missiles or ten 30mm cannons.\n\u003E A part count or weight limit might prevent part spamming.\n\nWe already have both a part count and weight limit, and are currently working on a weaponry limit. I\u0027m going to be looking at the stats of all weapons which I think should be allowed and posting them here, and I might do some tests for the ones people would use for air to air combat less often.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-24T17:55:16Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2015 05:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Noname117**"},{"CreatedByName":"ZLM-Master","CreatedById":185115,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T18:23:29Z","Content":"Yop !\n\nMy last update :\n\n[V3.0 ( 58 PTS )](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=B4FEC25180514B47!1784\u0026authkey=!AL3xCM4U9c0Hpp4\u0026ithint=file%2Ccraft)\n\n[V4.0 ( 58 PTS )](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=B4FEC25180514B47!1783\u0026authkey=!AJTCSlpMivFBwOE\u0026ithint=file%2Ccraft)"},{"CreatedByName":"Noname117","CreatedById":53624,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T18:25:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yop !\n\u003E My last update :\n\u003E \n\u003E [V3.0 ( 58 PTS )](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=B4FEC25180514B47!1784\u0026authkey=!AL3xCM4U9c0Hpp4\u0026ithint=file%2Ccraft)\n\u003E \n\u003E [V4.0 ( 58 PTS )](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=B4FEC25180514B47!1783\u0026authkey=!AJTCSlpMivFBwOE\u0026ithint=file%2Ccraft)\n\nDo remember that the points system for weapons is not decided upon yet, and likely needs adjusting, right?"}]}
