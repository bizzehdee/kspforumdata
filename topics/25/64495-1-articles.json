The first stage of our new Space Colony construction has hit on one or two little snags. For a start, some dimwit forgot to attach the Clamptron Senior to the ass of the beast to allow the attachment of major station parts including science, a docking hub with escape pods, and long-term life support systems. The second crew capsule sent up with constructors including Bill and Bob also carried an unwanted passenger. A computer virus invaded the guidance system, and sent the station core on a direct course into the Sun, right before it jettisoned the entire propulsion system! The last communication we had from the crew suggested that the docking port had taken some damage when the propulsion systems were jettisoned as the rockets were still firing. The last bit of that transmission indicated that they had in fact enough air and power to survive until impact, but radio range of only about 3,000km. Suits and EVA systems are all nominal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHE CHALLENGE:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the provided \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.filedropper.com/strandedchallenge\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESave package\u003C/a\u003E (just unpack into your \u0022saves\u0022 folder), create and execute a mission to rescue the seven stranded Kerbals before the station crashes into the Sun, and return them to Kerbin.
