Inspired by the mission architecture for the joint NASA/ESA Mars-Sample-Return mission, i present to you\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MPZE0wg.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MPZE0wg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe objective of this challenge is to return three \u0022sample caches\u0022 from the surface of Duna. The caches have been dug out of the red sand by robot drones in a previous mission and are now waiting for someone to pick them up and return them to the KSC for scientific analysis. The caches are represented through a stack of two xenon tanks with small docking ports on either side. Cache#1 is on one side of a massive gorge, Cache#2 is about 40km away on the other side of the gorge, and Cache#3 is on the valley floor, about half-distance inbetwen the two others. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike some other challenges, this is primarily a free-form excercise. Do and use whatever you think is fun. The mission outline gives you a lot of options. Will you return each cache in a separate vehicle? Will you use a rover (or plane) to pick up all caches and return them with one launch? Or maybe use three Duna ascension vehicles and dock them in orbit for the yourney home? We will see! I am quite sure that it is possible in stock, but if you have problems with the pick-up part, i recommend mods like KAS or Infernal Robotics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETechnical Stuff\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe challenge comes in form of a scenario.

The scenario starts around day 140, the next perfect launch window comes around day 250, so there is plenty of time for preparation. If you want to launch earlier, pack enough fuel (with enough oomph, you can go anywhere without waiting for the right constellation). Direct routes to Duna for around 5000 dV start at day 180. Or do some clever slingshotting - I am not sure if the constellation is right, but it might be worth trying.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SirJodelstein","CreatedById":62251,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-28T15:27:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI did it!
