Landing a VTOL on a docking port is a nightmare. And then I saw a guy who posted a history of aviation KSP style, and I was reading on Wikipedia about the history of aviation starting with kite flying... and naturally, I had the brainfart... fly a kite. Funny how a lot of mostly unrelated crap comes together in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile this didn\u0027t solve my drone problem, I did find it an interesting diversion, one that has given me several ideas for other uses. I thought I\u0027d share those ideas with you in the form of a challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, for this you\u0027ll need KAS.
