And while i could launch individual parts and fudge edit the video then launch a solid built one, applying rules to video editing is...kinda fudgy so im sticking with the simple definition. Episode 6 of campaign mode hopefully...hopefully should be up either friday or monday depending on how fast it renders, but I describe the difference between a spacelab and space station in it. \n\n-stimpy"},{"CreatedByName":"Lord_Stimpy","CreatedById":15849,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-24T08:38:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Can you get an achievement bonus twice?
