Thank you for the submissions everyone, thank you for making this spectacle possible.** \n\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://abload.de/img/screenshot421ez2z.png](http://abload.de/img/screenshot421ez2z.png)\n\u003E [http://www./download/27wm9p5hr5r6cv7/P-1\u002BWyvern\u002BTourney.craft](http://www./download/27wm9p5hr5r6cv7/P-1\u002BWyvern\u002BTourney.craft)\n\u003E \n\u003E Fixed it.\n\nThis is a two plane tournament, two planes count as one submission. They can be the same plane. The two planes can not have more than 150 parts between them. The two planes, with all weapons and countermeasures combined, can not have more than 90 points of weapons/countermeasures. If you have turrets, such as the Vulcan Turret, they must have their maximum pitch, minimum pitch, and yaw range set to 0, 0, and 0. Neither plane may have more than 60 points of weapons/countermeasures on it. \n\nNow, the plane you submitted follows all these rules except for two. \n\n1. The Vulcan Turret doesn\u0027t have its rotation locked, but this might have just been a design \u0027typo\u0027. \n\n2. It\u0027s one point over the 60 point individual plane limit; it has 61 points. If the Vulcan Turret was a Vulcan Hidden, this would be fixed. \n\nThose are both very minor, but what I\u0027m confused about is: Where\u0027s your second plane? I can\u0027t accept you into this tournament until those two things are resolved, and you provide a second plane. \n\nMore complete rules can be found at the top of page 74 of this thread. \n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130238-Top-Gun-AI-The-Official-Tournament-Thread/page74](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130238-Top-Gun-AI-The-Official-Tournament-Thread/page74) \n\nThank you. \n\nEDIT: On a minor note, it didn\u0027t follow the naming scheme either but that\u0027s not a big deal.

Its not very maneuverable. Well it is if the AI was smart, but to get it to dodge missiles I had set the flap range very very low, so it flies really fast but turns like a Condor. In 1vs1 against a more maneuverable opponent it often losses or else the opponent runs out of bullets, which happens due to its speed reducing the chance of cannon hits, and then it becomes an endurance competition. Which brings me to #2\n\n2. It does not fly for very long. To keep the T/W very high it does not have much fuel and 3 engines will burn up all its fuel in 9 minutes tops. It can easily be out endured even by a damaged plane, as long as the opponent manages to spin and bob about such that my unmaneuverable Xiphos IVs can\u0027t hit them, eventually they run out of fuel. \n\n3. It was specifically tested against MarsRocks and SasquatchM planes, everyone else, no offense, did not seem to match even the Xiphos I and II.
