You said, in reply to me: \u0022You don\u0027t have to complete all of [the categories] to qualify but you need to at least attempt every category of the challenge.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd later:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You win if you make a self-sustaining colony of 500 kerbals in the Jool system in a semi-realistic fashion as intended by the layout of the challenge; at the most basic level that\u0027s all there is to it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you should be more clear in your op\u00A0what is absolutely necessary and what is\u00A0for points.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe biggest problem I have with the challenge is, you tell us how to do, instead of what needs to be achieved. Like the 25ton Tylo lifter:\u00A0instead of telling us we have to have one (for no apparent reason), explain to\u00A0us what needs to be achieved, and let us figure out ourselves that we need a 25ton lifter or something similar. That gives us a feeling that we are planning our own colony instead of fulfilling your vision of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother example, the satellite network. Setting it up is a great achievement, and should be rewarded (if you feel like it). However, my kerbals use the\u00A0instantaneous subspace communication, and the work required to set up the network (just because you want there to be one) seems kind of moot. If the task was clearly marked as optional, it wouldn\u0027t seem like such a chore. Those who have a lot of time to play the game and want the points would still do it. Those of us who can only play 5 to 15\u00A0hours a week can just skip it and still create a big,\u00A0self-sustaining\u00A0colony in a reasonable amount of real life time. People attempting the hard level are going to need to do some kind of network anyway, as they are using remote tech.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also don\u0027t see a reason why you are making limits for how heavy our satellites, probes and landers are. Making larger stuff requires a larger and more expensive lifter. You already have a system in place\u00A0that penalizes large stuff. No need to make it a hard rule.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll that said, I\u0027m still going to attempt to create a colony, my vision of it.

The difference between stock contracts and an epic\u00A0challenge as the Jool 500 is the scale. I don\u0027t mind doing a quick contract for some money/science rewards, even if it really doesn\u0027t make any sense. The reward in this challenge is the accomplishment. That\u0027s why, in my opinion, we should have as much freedom to design stuff as possible. That makes the accomplishment even greater. So instead of having a 25ton lifter sitting at Tylo, you could tell\u00A0a story that the scientist back home need 25 tons of soil samples from Tylo, and you get 5\u00A0points for\u00A0delivering it to Kerbin. (You can use that if you want to.) Now the lifter has a purpose.
