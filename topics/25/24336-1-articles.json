It was said landing on Mun and returning with a rocket-only SSTO was impossible, but it isn\u0027t. A mountaintop ascent from Eve will be another thousand or so m/s delta-V beyond the Mun land-and-return mission, so it is obviously very hard. But theoretically if you can build up enough horizontal velocity on high-thrust stuff like SRB\u0027s or aerospikes for the start of the ascent, you don\u0027t need TWR \u0026gt; 1 for the later parts (pseudo-stages, where less efficient engines run out of fuel but you keep carrying them along) so you can potentially cram more fuel than you would think in a nuclear core.
