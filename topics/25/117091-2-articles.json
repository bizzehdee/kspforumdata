It uses tweakscale for three parts, and includes one modified part. The modification, however is a simple rescale of the engine -- from 0.650 to 1.250 -- it can be removed if you wish.\n\nThis is also a mod request - Could tweakscale become an allowed mod for the challenge? That would help quite a lot of us I think.\n\nHere is something I cooked up for the second prototype or the \u0022F.

The aircraft would climb on their own to altitude and then turn and fight. It was actually pretty cool to watch. I even did it myself with two drones that I built to test it out.
