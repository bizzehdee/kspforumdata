There\u0027s no way I can get 4 kerbals up in 1 launch if I can only use the one that spawns with the vehicle\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I would (and intend to have) chosen to go about it is extracting crew from not-launched flights. For example, start a \u0022flight\u0022 of a three-kerbal pod, take them EVA, and have them later board, for example, a four-kerbal hab module for launch to the mission vehicle. In the abstract sense, they are merely part of the crew pool available on the planet, as the stand-in flights whose (which?) crew I use never actually take place. Do note there is nothing stipulated that denotes that the crew you use \u003Cem\u003Emust\u003C/em\u003E come exclusively from your payload-lifting flights. Otherwise, of course, you would be left with four vehicles at a minimum parked in LKO. How wasteful! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditional note, I would be strapping on a few ladders to the lift vehicle to get the crew aboard. This I do not count as a disqualifying modification to the lift vehicle, as its flight profile is not effectively impacted. That said, there is an interesting caveat to the rules that could, in theory be exploited. I shall mention it, but dissuade people from this route: the launch vehicles \u003Cem\u003Ecan be extended\u003C/em\u003E. The rules only stipulate that you must use them, and that you must not discard any parts. Extra tanks and engines that you strap on, by strict interpretation, is marginally valid. This, naturally, is an extreme allowance, and something I would consider a bit of a cheat, but not a disqualifying one. (ladders, lights, and more \u0027cutes, sure. moar biggur lifter haha, please no.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"3_bit","CreatedById":52836,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-09T13:37:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI ran some numbers, and can do it with just 3.510 metric tons.
