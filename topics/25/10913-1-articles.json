Otherwise, there is no point to its being a spaceplane.\n\nAll SRBs and external fuel tanks are extras, arrange them however you want. Or don\\\u0027t have them at all. Its your design.\n\nYou may use any kind of capsule, although C7 and especially the Mk3 cockpit are recommended.\n\nSpecial categories\n\n-Fastest mission [Kerbin to Mun/Minmus to Kerbin to ground]\n\n-Fastest atmospheric flight\n\n-Cargo capacity [What can it drop? Probes? Fuel tanks? Bases?]\n\nMy example entry:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The Veto Aerospace *Ibis*. It was the first \\\u0027large spaceplane\\\u0027 [that is, a spaceplane using a Mk3 cockpit] to reach Minmus. It was unable to return to Kerbin due to pilot error, but the fuel remaining was sufficient. In testing, it has been proven capable of reentry, atmospheric flight, and landing. Modifications such as extra fuel and cargo are possibilities.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![YaA0C.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/YaA0C.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![G3eks.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/G3eks.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![x3GMO.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/x3GMO.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![BuSEo.png](http://i.imgur.com/BuSEo.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![UkE87.png](http://i.imgur.com/UkE87.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Cthulufaic","CreatedById":6660,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T16:08:48Z","Content":"Does it have to Land like a plane?
