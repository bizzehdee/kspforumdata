Epic means something we see and be like, man I wish I could do that! and not some random task like jumping from one ladder to another, which might be difficult but it\u0027s just boring nobody cares if you could do it or not. After all, it has to be \u003Cstrong\u003Esomething people WANT to be able to do\u003C/strong\u003E, for them to even have a go at it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIt should be somewhat difficult. Not as strong of a requirement, because there are some really easy challenges that are apparently still very popular, like the K-prize, circumnavigation and machinebird. However when you do a challenge the \u003Cstrong\u003Edifficulty usually should come from engineering and not piloting skills\u003C/strong\u003E, for two reasons. The first one being that this game is primarily an engineering game and not Flight Simulator X. Second being since each person has their own crafts, it\u0027s never a fair competition. Unless of course you make a craft for people to use and do not allow any custom crafts. But that kind of defeats the purpose of the game so I have yet to see a successful challenge done that way.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHave some different levels of difficulty. This is mostly because you want an epic, difficult challenge for hard core players. But you also want more entries and not scare everyone off so that the post doesn\u0027t just sink to the bottom. You do this by having different levels of difficulty. This also makes the hard core entries feel more epic as an added bonus.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you look at the weekly Reddit challenges they pretty much all do these three important things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EThe competition challenge\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically this is the challenge with a scoring system and a leader board, and a way to win the challenge. I would say this is more difficult to establish since any challenge challenge can be converted into one of these by adding a good scoring system to the mix. Therefore this kind of challenge actually has \u003Cstrong\u003Eall the prerequisites of the first type,\u003C/strong\u003E with added complexity:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EScoring system. It has to \u003Cstrong\u003Ereward what the challenge is ABOUT, and not anything else\u003C/strong\u003E. Or else you end up in an uncomfortable position where someone submits an entry that earns huge points but isn\u0027t really what you wanted your challenge to be. Some of you might know me for doing that.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105470-Low-cost-Launcher\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELow cost Launcher\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe challenge above an example of a structured scoring system that doesn\u0027t focus on what the challenge is about. So you have a challenge for \u0022low cost\u0022 but then your scoring system rewards crew capacity instead of you know, low cost? Well that\u0027s just asking for trouble isn\u0027t it? Now you have no choice but to either change the rules or resort to that \u0022spirit of the challenge\u0022 thing, which is ultimately a get out of jail for free card for bad challenges, as good challenges never seemed to need it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EVariety of solutions. This means that the challenge \u003Cstrong\u003Eshould (potentially) have a variety of solutions\u003C/strong\u003E, and not just, who can spam the most number of speratrons onto a probe core. Whenever you have a challenge about spamming parts, you have a big problem. Not only is it unfair to those with no access to super computers. It\u0027s just unfun even when you do spam the most. There are certain types of challenge that are especially prone to spamming part. Things that involve speed and jet engines (intakes) for the most part.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChallenges that involve lowest mass or part count to some simple goal such as lowest mass to orbit, are especially bad because when you only have three or five parts, and there are only three or five parts to choose from.

Neither do people want to uninstall mods just so they could entry the challenge. So you have to make sure that you allow as many mods as possible, without breaking balance. if that means you have to do research on and try out certain mods, I suggest that you do and not just disallow it because you don\u0027t know what it does. Neither should you allow certain mods just because you like it and you don\u0027t want to give it up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would say for most challenges, tier 3 mod will be the highest you will allow. Some of these things are clearly better than stock like the B9 crew cabins compared to stock crew cabins. So if you have a challenge about crew capacity you certainly want to address that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETier 4 mods are questionably powerful and probably should never be allowed unless the challenge is entirely about using that mod, which is ill advised to begin with because not many people will have that mod, whatever it might be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone allowing tier 5 for anything other than setting up your challenge, is probably insane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR although makes atmospheric flight less tolerant. It also significantly reduces drag, reducing the required Delta V to orbit from 4,500 to 3,500. Which is a huge advantage in of it self. However since the jet engines are nerfed, on top of the more delicate design requirements, spaceplanes are more difficult with FAR. if you have an interplanetary challenge this is probably not a big deal. But make sure you address it for any atmospheric challenges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, some mods are actually underpowered. Like RLA stock-like, at least its engines. You can beat all of them with the su-74s, which is an incredibly overpowered stock engine. So OP in fact, some challenges are just begging for everyone to spam this engine as much as they can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EOn Part clipping \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EI think the biggest problem with clipping, is the tiny strut, and not really clipping itself.

Not only do they offer a lot of options, but many of the options are just a lot better than stock. Quick examples:\u003Cp\u003E1.) The Wildcat is not only a more powerful 1.25m rocket but also has a much better TWR than the LV-T45 without sacrificing thrust vectoring or much of the specific impulse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) The Vesta is both more efficient and more powerful than the LV-909, and has a better TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I haven\u0027t used it in a while and most of these details come fro memory so I might be a bit off, but I remember the Wildcat and Vesta being far more effective that stock engines, and as a result I didn\u0027t use much of anything else for 1.25m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, I would rate MechJeb at 1, not 3. MechJeb only assists with piloting and maneuvers, and is less competent than a well-trained human at pretty much everything it does. It lacks too much in judgement to make up for it in precision even in maneuvers that require a high level of precision, partly due to the tools available on the navball. I have never used MechJeb and I\u0027ve yet to see anyone (MechJeb included) that can do any maneuvers I can\u0027t also do. It\u0027s not much to brag about, it\u0027s just a fact that the most difficult maneuvers are still pretty easy once you have enough experience.

I just had the impression that the larger engines are stupid heavy while Novapunch engines are lighter with equal performances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving mechjeb does not prevent you from also using the stock navball tools so it can\u0027t possibly be less than 2 in power rating. Plus mechjeb is a tool and you have to use it intelligently, so you\u0027re not going to let it fly a spaceplane into orbit for you because you know it sucks at it. however you can let it do a landing and it will start firing engines at the last possible second, and save more fuel than you doing it manually. For me Mechjeb is most useful at planning burns, which you can then tweak manually which is a lot faster than doing it manually from start. Short burns can also be carried out by Mechjeb with great precision, although it won\u0027t do longer ones for your ion missions. Again it\u0027s a tool and you have to use it right instead of expecting it to do everything for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tend to be lazy and use auto dock for example. It may not be as efficient as manual but you always have the option to have it hold the ship in the proper direction while you do the docking translations, so helpful when you don\u0027t have a ship with balanced RCS, which is kind of annoying to have to do without mods like RCS build aid.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-03T05:46:39Z\u0022 title=\u002201/03/2015 05:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Right","CreatedById":80269,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T08:00:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022chengong\u0022 data-cite=\u0022chengong\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ehowever you can let it do a landing and it will start firing engines at the last possible second, and save more fuel than you doing it manually\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding is one of my favorite mechjeb features, but its not even the most efficient at this.
