I had 5528 first launch in the last version, ie, pre additional biomes (not listed on page 1), I have no idea how many additional points actually come from those additional biomes, but probably about 2500 (since mun\u002Bminmus got me about 4400 this time and Minmus has a higher multiplier, but the Mun has more biomes). So let\u0027s say that would be about 7000 - 8000 in one launch using this ship (or something like it) without those additional biomes on Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the ship also would not have been possible without the ability to drain fuel tanks in the VAB.
