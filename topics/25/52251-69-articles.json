On Tylo I had to land perfectly, I ended with about 1500 dv on the LV-909 (that took a number of tries, I landed it earlier with 1200 dv and couldn\u0027t get up), and barely skimmed the surface nearing the dark side at that. A 45 degree thrust on the LV-909 put me up to about 70,000 apoapis which just gave the Ions enough time to circularize (that lander is small so it picks up speed reasonably quickly on Ions).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVall was hard, but not quite as tough as tylo, trick was to land at 3000 meters, down at \u0022sea level\u0022 the TWR is only ~1.01, landable, but uses the full 3100 dv available to the Ion lander. After a number of attempts I managed a hardish landing with a good 1500 dv to take off on, which was doable, but with like 80 dv to spare after rendevous. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETylo and Vall were where the patience really was tested. But 10 trips from Kerbin to Laythe were tedious (it took 10 designs to get something that worked).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the parachute part clipping, I hear you, that was cutting it close, but in my defense there is actually an attachment point on the top of that parachute, I didn\u0027t use any mods or debug menu to pull it off, it was only what was possible in the stock builder (only mod I used in builder was the one that lets you change root nodes). On earlier designs I used two parachutes, but really couldn\u0027t afford the weight. I should have put it on the other side where I just decoupled staging portions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EAdditional details:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETylo Landing:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Landed with 1423 dV left in the thrusters, that was about 10 units of liquid fuel in the two side tanks and the center tank full.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - I must admit that I\u0027m missing many screen shots of the successful landing, what you\u0027re seeing for dV and tanks is the landing before the actual successful one, this one had 5 units of liquid fuel left in the two two side tanks, I did it again slightly more efficiently landing with 10 units, this was a critical difference.

Doing about 60m/s at 10,000 ft over terrain is approximately the optimal approach speed. My approach burned off the horizontal dv at about 30,000 m, turning nearly perpendicular to the surface at about -170 m/s vertical speed. Touch down at around 15-20 m/s. TWR at 10,000ft is more like 1.15, it\u0027s really finicky to find the perfect approach with the changing TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/2XB9Y\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
