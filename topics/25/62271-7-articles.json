Before I list those notes, I\u0027d like to comment that all the crafts were interesting and each had their own merits and unique characteristics that made them fun to play with. It was very cool to see the variety of design styles derived from a single (though somewhat vague) purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would also like to lay out my own criteria for determining a craft\u0027s worthiness to shed some context on why certain craft received certain overall ratings. First and foremost, as we are attempting to replace the Rocket-Powered VTOL, I significantly penalized craft that did not use rockets for their primary propulsion. This resulted in otherwise Good designs being ranked Poor. I\u0027d like to stress that without that criteria, many of the crafts here would be Good or Excellent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, as these craft are meant to be potential Stock craft, ease-of-use and simplicity-of-design are also key. I considered how easily a relatively new player could visually dissect the design (without taking it apart) before reverse-engineering it through disassembly. Thus, crafts with much part-clipping or advanced construction techniques were also penalized to some degree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose two considerations really drove my analysis of each craft, with some importance also placed on the standard criteria (maneuverability, flight range, Thrust-to-Weight Ratio, etc).
