Interesting maneuver before lift off btw but FYI it still does not qualify as horizontal take off because the movement of the craft has to be horizontal rather than the orientation. Also decoupling is definitely against the rules, which I am guessing you probably know. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-15T18:34:17Z\u0022 title=\u002210/15/2016 06:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by boolybooly**"},{"CreatedByName":"Aegolius13","CreatedById":165625,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-15T17:44:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, boolybooly said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [Aegolius13](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/11189-the-k-prize-100-reusable-spaceplane-to-orbit-and-back/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=2796533) Expeditionary Utilitarial Distinction (Laythe), Advanced Pilot Precision Award with Tern.\n\u003E \n\nThanks dude!

While I agree it shows skill, I dont feel it is the same as negotiating an orbital rendezvous which is what the APPA 1st Class is intended to reflect. As with landing on a runway its about navigating to a distant target successfully as well as landing or docking. You are welcome to object based on precedent if you can find an example where it was awarded for a similar maneuver but I have looked back through v1.1 APPA 1st Class missions and all of them involve docking with a preexisting station or satellite and I do not recall the 1st Class being awarded for redocking with payload or lander sections or rovers which are comparable. Sorry but I hope the intent makes sense. I did think about it on the first viewing of your mission report but decided it wasnt the same as rendezvous."},{"CreatedByName":"NoobTool","CreatedById":169803,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-29T21:03:35Z","Content":"[@boolybooly](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/6572-boolybooly/)\n\nMakes perfect sense. I didn\u0027t even consider the rendezvous aspect. I fully agree, not the same. Thanks for your reply. And thanks again for managing this thread.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-29T21:04:11Z\u0022 title=\u002210/29/2016 09:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by NoobTool**"},{"CreatedByName":"EliteGuy3","CreatedById":163454,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-30T03:32:03Z","Content":"![eveJ6tF.png](http://i.imgur.com/eveJ6tF.png)This is my first and, mostly likely, only entry.\n\nI present, the **[Jeremiah](http://imgur.com/a/S8D3R)**\n\nPretty straight forward.
