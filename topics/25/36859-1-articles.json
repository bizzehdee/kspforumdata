I have figured out that Hamachi creates networks. I \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E tested Telemachus with Hamachi, and controlling one KSP game over the internet is entirely possible and happens flawlessly. So my idea is that we get together on Hamachi and form mission control as an extra challenge. One person will be limited in their role in the launch of a spacecraft. One person could handle the basic flight control (throttle, staging, etc), while another could handle Mechjeb\u0027s Smart A.S.S for controlling the direction of the craft. Both the basic flight control and Smart A.S.S people will be extremely important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re interested, you need to meet certain requirements. You need previous experience with Telemachus, and you will definitely need good timing, and plenty of experience with KSP. Finally, you will need Skype and a microphone so we can effectively communicate and make this work. Of course, we will be in a group call on Skype and I will share my screen with everyone on the Hamachi network so everyone can watch the launch. This is not meant to be easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, onto the good part.
