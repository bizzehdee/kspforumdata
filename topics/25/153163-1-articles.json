I am interested in seeing how the heck this works considering that the satelites have no means of propulsion themselves but still need to end up in appropriate orbits. I don\u0027t know whether their Pegasus rocket can/does switch on and off when releasing satelites (I\u0027ve asked in the Reddit AMA but I don\u0027t know whether I will get a response). I guess for the purpose of determining which submission is the best, we could consider how accurate the recreation is with each aspect weighted to how important it is (e.g. having the right coloured rocket isn\u0027t as important to me as the configurations of the orbits of the satelites).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not really interested in the aeroplane landing after it separates from the rocket. I\u0027d suggest letting it fall in the sea. I also don\u0027t think it\u0027s very important to exactly mimic the mechanism used to release satelites if it requires mods. If you\u0027ve got the mods then cool, but otherwise, whatever KSP has in stock is fine, I guess.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan someone else take it from here? \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E I just want to watch the resulting videos!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-10T02:34:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe\u00A0satellites\u00A0will be positioned using differential drag. \u00A0By changing the attitude of a\u00A0satellite\u00A0you can increase the drag causing it to slow down more or less than other\u00A0satellites in the\u00A0constellation\u00A0. \u00A0This is not realizable in KSP Since there is no drag above 70km\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/c-missions/cygnss#launch\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/c-missions/cygnss#launch\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
