View full album](//imgur.com/a/4hWPc)\n\nPlease see my earlier posts on this thread from August 19^th^ and September 8^th^ for more details and pictures about the trip out. I had a fleet of four SSTO12 ships, with 3 RAPIER and 2 nuke engines, 55t wet, 21.2t dry. They made LK with around 4700 dV. They all went out via the PLAD e-k-k-j route, for around 1300 m/s all told to a Jool encounter. Using a tangential inbound encounter with Tylo, they dropped to a capturable Laythe encounter for very little dV, but they required significant fuel usage to land because of a high stall speed. After landing (first picture of this album), they all made orbit again quite easily, with no requirement for oxidizer burning. Outbound, I had to burn for around 690 m/s to get to the best retrograde Tylo assist I could devise. This was actually enough dV to put me very close to a Hohman transfer back to Kerbin orbit, but from my earlier experience of instantly burning up on contact with Laythe\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s atmosphere and reading the accounts of others, I gathered that I would be coming in too fast that way. So I added another 200 m/s or so to my ejection velocity from Tylo and dropped down more steeply to an earlier Kerbin encounter. This was also way too fast, but it allowed me to set up a gravity assist to a lower 2:1 Kerbin resonant orbit. Even that orbit was not good enugh, because it intersected Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s at too much of an angle, so at apoapsis I had to do another ~250 m/s correction to get to a more tangential Kerbin re-encounter.

MY best plane landed with about 600 m/s of nuke burn left, so I think I probably could have managed a Minmus landingif I had been willing to futz around enough.

If you mess around with the maneuver node at Ap, you should be able to raise your PE to Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s orbit and push your Kerbin re-encounter towards your PE for a few hundred m/s. It took around 250 for me to go from a lethal angled encounter at ~8 o\u0027clock to a very survivable tangential one near 6.

Right now I wing it and hope for the best, but a more systematic approach would be better.\n\n I did it mostly because I didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t want to start over if one of my ships somehow got irretrievably corrupted, and also to get a sense of how much wiggle room there was in the E-K-K-J route. As to how to get to a 2:1 resonant Kerbin orbit from Jool, I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know if this is the best strategy, but here\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s what I did: If Jool is at 12 o\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 clock and the Kerbolar system is spinning counterclockwise, you want to have Kerbin at a little past 7 o\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 clock. I ejected retrograde off of tylo into an orbit with a PE close to Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s, then boosted about another 200 m/s to encounter Kerbin at around 8 o\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 clock, just under 2 years after ejecting from Jool. By tweaking this encounter, you can easily get to a 2:1 resonant orbit. Just keep twiddling the maneuver node from around your plane correction until until your Kerbin PE is like 137km coming from the outside. Note that this orbit still re-encounters Kerbin at excessively high speed, but from its Ap, you only need to burn around 250 more m/s to correct to a survivable tangential encounter. Hope that helps!"},{"CreatedByName":"EvermoreAlpaca","CreatedById":150540,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-27T07:38:36Z","Content":"Taking a break from my make-it-work-whatever-it-looks-like approach to make a mission focused on looking swag!
