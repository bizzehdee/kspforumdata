I\u0027m not 100% sure if this is possible, but go into the persistence file and if you can, make it so you can\u0027t revert flights. Also, banish yourself from autosaving.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMedium\u003C/strong\u003E: Medium will require some modding. This is just like the easy version except get the random failures mod and a clouds mod. This isn\u0027t significantly harder than the easy version, but it still has more of a realistic challenge to it. Edit: For a fuller realistic experience (suggested by cantab), add the Farram Aerospace mod and Deadly reentry. Another mod which just makes KSP not much harder, but much funner, is Better than Starting Manned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHard\u003C/strong\u003E: If you really want to go hardcore, then do everything from the easy and medium version, plus the realistic solar system mod. Feel free to nerf the parts to make them more realistic with the real world. If you know how to, make ALL of the planets larger too. The full benefit from this comes from having slight modding knowledge, but with just basic knowledge of how to mess around with your files you can go with the basic hard mode with just the realistic system mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-01T01:25:31Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2014 01:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Clockwork13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-01T00:48:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo revert is generally known as \u0022Ironman\u0022 mode.
