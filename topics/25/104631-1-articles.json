I hereby issue you a challenge, should you choose to accept it, to land an aircraft on the runway at the KSC completely blind! To do this, you must construct an aircraft (or modify a stock one) which has some sort of object obstructing your view from the cockpit, and then perform the landing completely IVA. Some sort of HUD or other instrument mod is strongly recommended. No automation of any sort is allowed, you must control your aircraft manually. A marker or probe of some sort should be left on the runway, so that you have something to target. (This challenge is basically impossible without doing so.) You may not break any parts, and your craft must land on the actual runway, it can not roll off/bounce off. \n\nRules:\n\nNo Auto pilot of any type, you must manually control your aircraft.\n\nYour IVA must be completely obstructed, and the entire landing must be performed while in IVA. \n\nYou may not break any parts, and your craft\u0027s final position must be on the runway. \n\nDifficulty levels:\n\nLevel 1: Fly the aircraft in 3rd person until 2.5 Kilometers out on final approach. From the 2.5K mark, you must use IVA, blind. \n\nLevel 2: Fly the whole flight IVA, without being able to see. \n\nJeb\u0027s level: Fly the whole flight IVA, blind, without SAS, and without any Heads up Display. \n\nHere is a video demostration:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/F1Z-eocVcwE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nGood luck, and happy landings!"}]}
