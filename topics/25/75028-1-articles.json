It has no batteries and no solar panels plus no RCS. Be careful with your maneuvers or you will run out of power. You are not allowed to modify the Retrokerbal craft in anyway. You have to use the craft as it comes packaged with FAR. This challenge is all about pilot precision and accuracy. Mod plugins like Fuel balance or whatever else are allowed but no obvious cheats like hyperedit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe challenge is to take off and land on both Minimus and the Mun then return to Kerbin using a powered landing. Powered landing means using the parachute on the capsule is not allowed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe scoring is very simple but is in two parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart one total amount of fuel left after the powered landing. So if you have 26 Fuel and 30 oxidizer your fuel score it 56. Higher score the better. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart two distance in KM from the old pod memorial by the VAB. Place a flag near the pod memorial by the VAB to measure the distance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UWKeFdw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022UWKeFdw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELower score the better obviously. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour overall score will be your fuel remaining minus the distance landed from the VAB. So just for example if you had 56 total fuel left and landed 45 km from the VAB then your score is 11. The higher your score the better and negative scores are possible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeader board will be in three parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Fuel left\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Distance from memorial\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Overall score\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDNFs will result if you land in the water or if any part of the retrokerbal explodes on landing. If the craft lands and bounces off the landing legs then that is ok as long as nothing explodes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScreenshots required will include\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Picture of flag planted at memorial.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is my entry and I realized after I finished that I never got a picture on the pad. I did this challenge by going to Minimus first then the Mun as I thought that would use less fuel but I will try it the other way around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/oSB73\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
