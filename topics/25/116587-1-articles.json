So you must jettison the framework ***before*** you connect the winches to the engine nacelles. When you connect the winches to the CC-R2 ports, you need to attach them using the \u0022dock\u0022 option.

It\u0027s a bit slow in the corners, but this thing is going to have more control and power than I\u0027ll ever need. I swear, if and when I get Big Dog on his leash, I\u0027m gonna put one heckuva time on that scoreboard.\n\nEDIT: I messed around with another pod, and actually got a really easy and efficient setup.

Frankly, at full power the damn thing is a beast, and if you\u0027re not gentle on the controls, you\u0027ll be in all kinds of strife.\n\nThe Mobile Gantry:\n\n![screenshot_2015-08-12--00-21-46_zpspw3fal0n.png~original](http://i407.photobucket.com/albums/pp159/ElYoda69/screenshot_2015-08-12--00-21-46_zpspw3fal0n.png~original)\n\nThe Quadrinator:\n\n![screenshot_2015-08-11--22-33-08_zpscxagxl2v.png~original](http://i407.photobucket.com/albums/pp159/ElYoda69/screenshot_2015-08-11--22-33-08_zpscxagxl2v.png~original)\n\n![screenshot_2015-08-11--22-36-04_zpseix16wzd.png~original](http://i407.photobucket.com/albums/pp159/ElYoda69/screenshot_2015-08-11--22-36-04_zpseix16wzd.png~original)\n\nMobile Gantry disappearing into the distance.

If you use the gantry the boring way, and drive it out and clear of the runway, rather than jettisoning it, it has more than enough battery power to drive it all the way back to the SPH.\n\nQuadrinator Launch Sequence:\n\n1. Toggle lights to shut off Quantum Struts. See step 7 for the reason for doing things this way.\n\n2. Stage once, to release engine nacelles and drop mobile gantry to ground. Ignore explosions caused by stack separators hitting the ground.\n\n3. EVA crewman. Walk along hull to nose, jump onto gantry platform. If crewman falls off, there are ladders on the gantry, just in front of the rear gantry wheels, to climb back up to the platform.\n\n4. Attach all four winch cables. Furthest points on gantry platforms are aligned to each cable connector port.\n\n5. Jump crewman back onto pod, walk along hull to hatchway and board. If they fall off, action group 1 will toggle a ladder hidden under the starboard airbrake. You may need to hit the brakes to move the airbrake out the way so they can board the pod. A ladder is attached to the platform located under the pod so they can reach the pod\u0027s ladder.\n\n6. Using the winch control GUI, set all cables to 8.00 m length.\n\n7. Toggle Quantum Struts back on. (Turning them off, then on once all the cables are adjusted to take the tension off the engine nacelles, ensures the struts align with one another properly. Not important for play, but visually more pleasing.)\n\n8. Sort staging out. All Launch clamps go into their own group, should be in position 1, with engines in group 0 and mobile gantry in group 2.\n\n9. Turn SAS and RCS on. RCS is just for the Verner flight controls, doesn\u0027t require any monopropellent. SAS ensures the probe attached to the mobile gantry will keep it moving straight ahead when jettisoned.\n\n10. Set control to the Probe module located just behind the battery on the upper starboard engine nacelle.\n\n11. Stage once to release Pod and jettison mobile gantry. Gantry can be jettisoned using inbuilt sepratrons (spectacular and exciting), or manually driven clear of launch clamps and then steered off the side of the runway (more practical but boring, lacks the requisite crashes and explosions). Any explosions immediately on jettisoning are the wheels hitting un-detonated stack separators, and can be ignored.\n\n12. Stage once to release launch clamps.\n\n13. Toggle engines on using action group 2.\n\n14. Tap action group 8 four times, to raise pod to full height. (Pod can\u0027t be set to full height from the start, otherwise the rear wheels of the Mobile Gantry are held off the ground by the pod!)\n\n15. Hit Z to bring engines to full power. When surface speed reaches 18-20 m/s (timing this right is important!), hit X to shut engines off, and immediately engage airbrakes. Do not touch any flight controls until over the water. You will coast down the runway end-slope and beach, and onto the water without incident. As you reach the water\u0027s edge, release airbrakes. Speed on reaching the water should be about 32-35 m/s. If you are doing 40\u002B m/s you messed up your engine-off timing, and will probably hit the water.\n\nNow you can power up slightly and proceed to the starting line.\n\nNote that the engines ride slightly higher at the front. This helps when crossing shoreline boundaries and sudden up-slopes. The nose height can be adjusted with action groups 9/10.\n\nList of Action Groups:\n\nAbort: Disconnects all cables from engines.\n\nLights: Toggles Quantum Struts on/off.\n\nBrakes: Toggles airbrakes (and mobile gantry wheel brakes if connected).\n\nGroup 1: Toggles Pod ladder.\n\nGroup 2: Toggles engines.\n\nGroup 7: Lowers Pod height by 5% each press.\n\nGroup 8: Raises Pod height by 5% each press.\n\nGroup 9: Lowers engine nacelle noses by 5% each press.\n\nGroup 10: Raises engine nacelle noses by 5% each press.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-11T15:33:41Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2015 03:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JAFO**\n  \nAdded pic of Mobile Gantry"}]}
