I do have a variant of this design that uses two ion engines mounted mid way out the wings and it is trivial to take in to a stable orbit. You just extend the solar panels (which this model doesn\u0027t have) and fire up the ion engine each time it rises above 70km altitude. You switch back to jet the few times you dip below 69 km, and bam, orbit. The intakes mounted above and below the wings are because it isn\u0027t the most easy thing to correct the attitude of without power, and there are times that I\u0027ve needed those to get the jet going again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T19:07:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou have enough intakes to fire the jets at 69km???
