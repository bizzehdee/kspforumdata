The tool reorganizes where the nodes on the tech tree are drawn and also reorganizes their connections.

Currently working through stock. I have zero additional propulsion and science pieces until the 90 science nodes but after that I have very quick access to nuclear engines, the whiplash, and rhe aerospike.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould you post the code somewhere by chance?
