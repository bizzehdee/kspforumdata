Some point before my landing, I realized it had only taken me eight hours to get to the Mun, and I decided to go for a speed run. I managed to plant my flag by 8 hours and 40 minutes, and return to Kerbin in 20 hours and 56 minutes. That\u0027s hardly more than a day trip, especially if the Kerbal sleeps during the return leg. Then it dawned on me that a highly profitable business could be made out of offering day trips to adventurous/stupid Kerbals, especially once I\u0027m done building my tacky casinos on the Mun. So now I need a group of pilots to fly for my new company; Munar Tourist Traps. Apply today!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Goal:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELand on the Mun (safely) and then plant a flag before returning your Kerbal (again, safely) to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Rules:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Mods are allowable, except for MechJeb (this is a challenge about piloting).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. There is no part limit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. There is no cost limit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. You must plant a flag, and it must still be standing after you\u0027ve returned to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Cheating is prohibited, except for part clipping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Your Kerbal must survive the return to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Your total mission elapsed time must be less than 24 hours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Photographic proof of both the flag planting and your command pod back on Kerbin is necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Scoring:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis challenge is entirely about speed, so that is the only thing that (for now) contributes to your score. There will be two categories; Direct Ascent and Other. If you use any method other than direct Ascent, you are eligible for the Other category. There will be two scoreboards within each category, the primary one will be the Shortest Round Trip Times scoreboard and the secondary will be the Shortest Times to Flag Plant: scoreboard. These two scoreboards are pretty self explanatory. Shorter times are better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Scoreboards:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDirect Ascent:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShortest Round Trip Times:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. metaphor, 2 hours and 9 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.
