So if you have an idea, or a challenge, you can PM me, or post in this thread, and we can work it into this OP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour score will be based upon how much mono you have left at docking, normalized to 500 points based upon how much fuel there originally was, with a 500 point bonus for actually docking. (example: 750 fuel, 250 used, score: 833.) . Higher is obviously better, with 1000 points being no-fuel-used-how-the-hell and 500 points being running-on-fumes-but-got-it! Damage or excessive main engine fuel lost fuel is sub-optimal, and score will be reduced by 25% for superficial damage, (damaged solar panels and the like), or a 50% reduction for damage which would cause mission failure. Not docking will result in a score of zero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EDocking challenge 1:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommander: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur EVE lander, the most overly engineered ship in the fleet barely made it into orbit. On the final ascent stage, someone seemed to have licked one of the orange flavored rockomax fuel tanks. We did not catch this, because is was so high up on the launch pad, that it was a little hard to reach. We think that the frozen tongue matter left up there by tasting said fuel tank somehow caused a structural weakness. The result: While our incredibly brave kerbalnaut began the final maneuvers to enter into a parking orbit, the tank exploded, causing the ship to become unbalanced, in an horrific spin, and in an orbit which would cause cause the craft to reenter the atmosphere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, our fast thinking kerbalnaut was able to jettison the stricken stage, and use the fuel of the first stage of the lander to get the still-spinning ship into a stable orbit by burst-firing the engines when the ship was aimed pro-grade. However, this used up far to much fuel for the mission to still be successful without refueling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is currently sitting in an orbit with an apogee of approximately 125k meters, and a perigee of 71k meters. and has since been wrestled out of its spin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur engineers came up with a solution. The drive unit which was planned to be attached was also launched with a few extra fuel tanks, such that the extra fuel may be reused to top off the lander. The kerbalnauts sent up with the engine section have managed to get the ships within paint scratching distance, but here lies the problem: After multiple failed docking attempts, our brave heroes have been unable to get the ships to dock. We imagine it is due to the constant screaming, and nothing to do with the RCS system designed for when the ships were docked together, without 8 extra orange fuel tanks, and not as separate units. Nevertheless, we need these ships docked to rescue the mission! The ships still have about half their RCS fuel tanks left, but the lander has much smaller reserves than the drive unit. but we think you are up to the task!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHere is the situation: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36550973/screenshot50.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot50.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHere is the file: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFILE: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36550973/quicksave.sfs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36550973/quicksave.sfs\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(simply start a new game, place that file into the saves folder, and then press F9 from an f9able location (put a probe core out onto the launch pad). )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotes: these ships are completely stock, version .20.
