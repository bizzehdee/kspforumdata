It has come to my attention that the exploitation of the space environment can be a decently magnificent way to spend a country\u0027s resources! In such an attempt to monetize the aetheric area, we have established the Kerbal Astronomical Heavenly Space Amalgamation. The KAHSA is devoted to the design, development, and flying of machines and contraptions which can accellerate in the vacuum of space! You might call us the Steampunk Space Program! \n\nChallenge: Run a space program with steampunk technology.\n\n[![kerbal_steam_program_by_algiark-d79d2g4.jpg](http://th07.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/i/2014/067/e/4/kerbal_steam_program_by_algiark-d79d2g4.jpg)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71848-Kerbal-Steam-Program)\n\n**Rules:**\n\nRules in bold are important rules, rules in not-bold are really just suggestions.\n\n**None of this filthy substances you describe as \u0022Liquified Fuel\u0022 or \u0022Oxidation Fluid.\u0022** We haven\u0027t been able to create a motor which can produce a sustainable thrust with these chemicals.\n\n**None of these mysterious magical devilplates you call \u0022Photovoltaic Panels.\u0022** The best method we have for generating power from the sun is the Solar Boiler, and that is much too heavy to fly into space!\n\n**No magical rods of substance known as \u0027Radio-Isotope Thermoelectric Generatatrons.\u0022 This is pure dark magic.**  You can not magically create heat from metal!\n\nAll control surfaces must be placed near the Command Capsule, strings can not be made long enough to link together control inputs!\n\nNo Filthy Cheating Alpacas.\n\nNo more of the O-10 Monoprop Engines, they\u0027re too cheaty. (Yes I used some, but I\u0027m not anymore)\n\nNo exploitation of this thing you call \u0022The Physics Engine.\u0022\n\n**No machine-controlled spacecraft**, we do not have the advanced machinery required to link together binary connections such as your probe cores do.\n\nOnly the Size 0.625m Reaction wheel can be used, the others have computational machinery installed.\n\nDo not use mods not listed in the modlist or otherwise unallowed. You must list all mods you use.\n\n**No communicative devices called \u0022Communatrons\u0022 or other antennae-related electronic machinery.**\n\nNo actual steampunk mods, that\u0027s cheating. (No Vertical propulsion Emporium, even though it\u0027s a pretty good mod, it defeats the purpose)\n\nYou CAN have Steampunk Visual-only mods, like [Green Skull Inc\u0027s Steampunk Suits pack](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/72115-0-23-5-Green-Skull-Inc-Custom-Design-Spacesuits-v0-37-8th-April-14) for instance.\n\n**Oh yes, I forgot to mention the hardest part: No map view. I recommend SteamGauges or KerbalEngineer to help.**\n\n**You can use map view IF you also carry around five of the large Remote Guidance Units and a Science Lab, and at least two scientists. Working together, they can draw a map of your trajectory. The Remote Guidance Units are there for \u0022mechanical\u0022 computing power, you may NOT use them to control your ship!**\n\n**Allowed Mods (remember, rules still apply):**\n\nKSPX\n\nRLA Stockalike (Actually recommended because of the large selection of Monoprop and SolidFuel engines)\n\nInfernal Robotics (Because how else are you going to do steampunk robotic arms and such? ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif))\n\nKerbal Isp Difficulty Scaler (But only to scale DOWN Isp. I recommend about 0.75 to 0.95 Isp multiplier for both vacuum and atmosphere)\n\nFerram Aerospace Research\n\nProcedural Fairings\n\nDeadly Re-Entry\n\nAnything that\u0027s only visual.\n\nProcedural Parts\n\nAsk me if you think a mod should be included.\n\n**Scoring system:**\n\nThis is a really loose challenge indeed, so the real purpose of this thread is for you to show off your designs and missions under these steampunk rules, or showing off cool looking creations that look kinda steampunk. Really this might not belong in Challenges, we\u0027ll see how this goes. If you did something really cool, then you\u0027ll be featured in the OP.
