I decided to build an amphibious craft for Laythe. The idea was that even if I missed the land on landing, I could just jet through the water then ease onto land. I put 1 FL-t800 on its side, mounted a couple of \u0022Modular Girder Segments\u0022 on it at angles pointing downward, then mounted a couple more FL-T800 fuel tanks as pontoons. I mounted wheels to the outside of the pontoons. I then added fuel lines from the pontoons to the center fuel tank and added an engine to the top tank. I also added a couple of downward facing side mounted engines for getting back to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea was there would be 2 fuel tank pontoons and a single jet, above the water line, to push the whole craft through the water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tested it on Kerbin, and, well, it was a complete failure. Because the thrust was above the center of mass, it just wanted to nose dive in the water(if the wheels even survived entering the water at all).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems to me the solution would be to put the rear facing jet below the water line. I wonder if real physics would even allow that and how does the game handle it and how close is the game to reality?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, on to the challenge!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChallenge: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEasy:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Not very efficient but it can move at a few m/s (at 20m/s it has failed catastrophically), better to lift off and fly. It can land VTOL on land as well and drive in and out of water on the rover wheels. You only get maybe 10 mins of powered jet movement in the lower atmosphere, could be best to aim to land on land and drive to water as a solar powered rover, however the whole thing weighs only 10T, ship some extra fuel with it and do a couple of surface missions with re-fueling in between if you want to explore.

Not very efficient but it can move at a few m/s (at 20m/s it has failed catastrophically), better to lift off and fly. It can land VTOL on land as well and drive in and out of water on the rover wheels. You only get maybe 10 mins of powered jet movement in the lower atmosphere, could be best to aim to land on land and drive to water as a solar powered rover, however the whole thing weighs only 10T, ship some extra fuel with it and do a couple of surface missions with re-fueling in between if you want to explore. I made it back to a 80Km reasonably circular orbit with just 20 fuel remaining, that was my first try though, a more efficient ascent may be possible.
