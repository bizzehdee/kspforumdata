In this world, the low lives in the \u0022Dump\u0022 under the floating city of Zalem, where the High, Bourgeoisie people live. I won\u0027t get too deep in the details, but it looks something like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Gunnm_Sch%C3%A9ma_de_l%27echelle.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Gunnm_Sch%C3%A9ma_de_l%27echelle.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, you have three main parts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe actual city, which floats over the Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Skyhook, which connects the city and a space station in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the actual Space Station, up in space, which is suppose to somehow balance everything in order to make it stand still.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, do note that the whole thing doesn\u0027t move, meaning that it, in theory, is moving at the same speed as the planet\u0027s rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo-able? Probably not, but I\u0027d love to see someone do something similar.

Not that I don\u0027t like the idea, but fantasy based things often do not work out so well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, the issue with attachment systems and distance rendered. It has been discussed many times, but, KSP has a part render distance of only about 2k, I think, maybe a bit more. But even if it was 10 K, we will run into the same problem... Part render means exactly what it sounds like. It means that no parts beyond that distance are physically being rendered. Take your city, for instance... if you\u0027re focused on the city, the station isn\u0027t being rendered, thuss, neather is it\u0027s attachment system. Link broken. If you switch focus to the station, the city is not being rendered. This is the biggest flaw that is preventing the construction of dyson sphers and space bridges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, is with the space station\u0027s movement relitive to the city. This is called Geosyncronious Orbit. and there is a very spacific distance form any planet at which this takes place. In KSP, it is completely possible, however, the orbit altitude is roughly 2868 km. That is way beyond Low Kerbin Orbit... that\u0027s a stand alone station out in space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am currently working on a ground station with a geosync orbiting station above it, so the idea is valid in that since. But recognize that this is a FAR distance to assume as linked together by any physical cable. AND our render distance is going tho thwart our plans to have them linked anyways. I would, however, like to see a floating city maybe 1k off the ground with a slums city below it, though. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E....
