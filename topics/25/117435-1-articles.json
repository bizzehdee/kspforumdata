In this Mission you will Launch with a small Space Station in tow and during the Mission you will need to release the last empty fuel tanks leaving you to decouple from the Station and Maneuver it to the nose of your Craft to push it for the remaining trip to the Mun, at this point do an EVA to man the Station so it can be checked for stability and battery power. Once you arrive at the Mun place the Station in Orbit no more than a 500m Apoapsis, this is for fuel consumption. Continue back to Kerbin and land on the Runway with the Craft completely undamaged.\n\nSpace Station\n\n![p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStation Set in Mun]()\n\n![\u003Ca  href=]()![%7Boption%7D](%7Boption%7D)http://i.imgur.com/PVi0r17.png\u0027 alt=\u0027PVi0r17.png\u0027\u003E\n\nCraft Mun Lab 1 Landed Intact\n\n[![HR28xIe.png](http://i.imgur.com/HR28xIe.png)](http://imgur.com/HR28xIe)\n\nMission File\n\n[Space Tech Mun Lab 1](https://files.secureserver.net/0sViGOIHLosjn1)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-02T19:18:56Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2015 07:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by castille7**"}]}
