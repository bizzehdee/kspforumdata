You start out in orbit with Laythe but you need to bring the spacecraft down toward Laythe\u0027s surface, and stage. Inside the rocket would be a device that would be a mobile boat, like the MoonScooter 3000 but it would be able to float in water and drive itself around and get water samples from Laythe\u0027s oceans.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-27T16:38:24Z\u0022 title=\u002203/27/2018 04:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 27, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by blimpsnack\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
