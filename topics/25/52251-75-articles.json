The first two images (screenshot537 \u0026amp; screenshot539) were in Laythe orbit just before and during the Vall transfer. The Laythe orbit was eccentric (515x75) and the ejection was timed well so that the ejection and transfer only took 382 m/s. A mid-course correction of 15 or so m/s was made so that I was able to insert into another very elliptical orbit around Vall (1.93Mmx186km). The only image (screenshot570) that demonstrates the Vall orbit is during the post landing rendezvous and its from the lander\u0027s perspective, but it is about to dock, so they are in the same orbit.

And writing a computer program to calculate the changes of mass, fuel and deltaV well, that\u0027s a whole new level! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd you went with a good old modular lander with only one lander can method, that\u0027s cool, it\u0027s been a while when somebody went this way. I also liked that you left your main ship in orbit between the moons and used a moon-tug to bring your lander to the moons - that\u0027s the most optimal in terms of fuel/weight but people usually put their main ship around the moons which means they move a huge weight and waste a lot of fuel. I guess they are afraid of docking in a Jool orbit - maybe they think it\u0027s like docking around Kerbol, which can be really hard for beginners. But around Jool it\u0027s very similar to any planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess maybe you had some hard time docking the lander together sometimes as there were no probe cores on the lander engines, don\u0027t you? And there was no fuel consumption tracking on your main ship but as it went only from Kerbin to Jool orbit and back home, that must not be so bad... hmm, bu it refueled the lander-tug many times, hmm... maybe was it close? Do you have any screenshots on this? Anyway, it seems possible for me so I believe it worked well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI usually don\u0027t like shuttles to end the mission but it would be easy for you to put a docking port \u002B parachute module on the ship and I guess you might want to use your main ship later too, so it\u0027s all right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood job, thank you for the very detailed mission report! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-14T00:42:59Z\u0022 title=\u002211/14/2014 12:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Ziv\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"1of6Billion","CreatedById":46191,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-14T15:59:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi all, I \u0027did\u0027 all 5 Jool moons as well.
