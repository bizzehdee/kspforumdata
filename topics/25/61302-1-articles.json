As this was not a created page yet, I thought of a mission to fit this mission. And here it is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChallenge:\u003C/strong\u003E Build a rocket that will send a probe, called Joolie, to Jool to investigate it and it\u0027s moons. It is recommended that you get some sort of mapping equipment, such as the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/isa-mapsat-3-3-4/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EISA mapsat mod\u003C/a\u003E, so that the moons can be mapped. As well as this, you need a decent probe to gather data about the atmosphere, including it\u0027s temperature, pressure and (if you have a mod for this) it\u0027s composition (what it\u0027s made of)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERules:\u003C/strong\u003E You can use, if you wish, mods recommended above and KW rocketry. Remote tech is not recommended for beginners, but can be used by more experienced players. If you wish to use any other mods, ask before launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt must at least partially map Laythe, Vall and Tylo from fly-bys (you can also map Bop and Pol if you want to, but this is not a requirement). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you have completed your mission, de-orbit Joolie to burn up in Jools atmosphere (option to use deadly re-entry for experienced/intermediate players). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPoints\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 point for every mapping sweep of Laythe/Vall/Tylo (until you map the whole moon)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 point for each science pack on your decent probe and orbital probe (must be activated)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 points for entering laythes atmosphere for areobreaking (must be at least 45km into lathes atmosphere)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 points for entering Jools atmosphere for areobreaking\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5 points for areobreaking in both Jools and laythes atmospheres\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E50 points for mapping at least 95% the surface of Laythe/Vall/Tylo each (max. 150 for this bit, does not include the \u0027every mapping sweep\u0027 bit, so you can get much more than 150)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10 points for adding a Laythe/Vall/Tylo lander (must land safely)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E20 points for adding a Laythe/Vall/Tylo rover (must drive 5 km from landing site and re-activate after 1 night)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E40 points for adding a Laythe/Vall/Tylo lander-rover hybrid\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10 points for a cool screen shot in orbit around Jool\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10 points for a screenshot while near each moon of Jool (max. 50)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have used deadly re-entry, you get 35 points if you manage to survive re-entry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI expect points to be in the 100s for beginners, 1000s for experienced players.
