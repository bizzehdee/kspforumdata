I don\u0027t really think it should be in the running for Maximalist, though, since it is inefficient as hell for Kerbin ascent and carries no payload (I feel Maximalist should have more to do with payload to orbit rather than who can slap wings onto the most fuel).\n\u003E I thought pa1983 or someone had a craft that was up around 400 tons? (Or, I might be thinking of an older version or a post that got eaten by the Kraken.)\n\nThink the heaviest I did that did its job was 245 or 248tons with a jumbo tank as payload.\n\nIt was the old Falcon IV Cargo Transport if I recall.

My craft was not 248t or what ever it was less because landing gears have no wight in the game except in VAB/SPH. I dont think the bug was so well known then. I sure did not know about it.

Lack of new stock parts etc and overall lack of improvements in the latest versions of the game surrounding spaceplanes I kind of lost the interest. Have not flown a spaceplane to orbit and back since I built the Kosmos a month ago. Trying to get back. Fixed a new stock cargo bay for my Falcon XIV Kosmos. Needs more testing but so fare seems to work every time.\n\nI was kind of interested in making a KSP version of the HOTOL, the space plane that never flew but was the predecessor to the Skylon.\n\nIts small and rear most mounted wing makes it have that futuristic look that I just love. Tough it makes for a very usntable craft in KSP since CoL will shift forward the more one is rolling unlike a center mounted wing so I had to add internal wings in the rear, mounted vertically to compensate, basically it has the same lift no mater how much its banking.\n\nMade it in to a 3 man spaceplane, no cargo capacity bout that is doable but I have the Kosmos for that so I figured I could get the part count down further by having a pure Crew Shuttle. 283 parts and it handles better then I expected considering the real world craft had CoM and CoL problems, had that to but got it good enough that it will fly just fine. Bit temperamental thats all but still relatively stable.\n\nIts a bit overpowered so can go well past 2100m/s on jets alone, also has a small 20kN rocket engine for Orbital Manoeuvres. 400km orbit was not a problem. Could have gone a lot higher.\n\nIts a bit iffy taking off with due to its low nose and fare rear wheels (lack of better stock wheels caused that compromise).\n\nReentry was stable and landing was a peace of cake. Glided all the way to the runway. Touching down was not a problem despite the narrow wheel base and the fare rear mounted wheels makes sure the craft stays down once it touches the runway.\n\nThe craft is a fast climber and has high acceleration. So it will get in to orbit with in minutes. So makes for a good Crew replacement craft for spacestations.\n\nProbably gonna upload it in my sstos.zip file later when I have made some final test flights and changes to the craft. Will try to have the engines push trough CoM so it cant spin out due to flame outs.
