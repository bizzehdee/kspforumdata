Stock KSP (meaning no mods whatsoever), obviously another water circumnavigation. This is basically a modified version of the vessel I used for Kerbin. Yes, still using the MK3 layout, which cost a lot of money to fling out to Laythe.\n\nI made some changes to the Kerbin craft (which was Amphib2 I think). This one I called Amphib3c. I added some electric generation, now have 6 RTGs instead of 2, and I added a Fuel Cell Array. I put a lot of the little bits inside the cargo bay, and lowered the mount for the drill (not enough apparently). Biggest change was the configuration of the \u0027pontoons\u0027 and wheels. I lowered the pontoons significantly to get a performance increase. That also required widening the pontoons significantly to prevent tipping over. I also ditched the rover wheels for aircraft wheels. I miss the rover wheels, but the aircraft wheels have two advantages. First, they are a lot less draggy, so there is an efficiency bonus. Second, they don\u0027t break as easily as the rover wheels.\n\nOh, the other big change is the addition rocket engines. Big ones.\n\n**Fengist,** I have a couple of qualification questions:\n\n1. I\u0027m using wings, so need a ruling regarding those I guess. This thing still won\u0027t fly at all, I\u0027m using the wing sections instead of modular girders because they \u0027look cooler\u0027. I still have the \u0027rudder\u0027 mounted on the back too, but you already said that wasn\u0027t a problem.\n\n2. I had to deviate from the equator of Laythe quite a ways. I just wasn\u0027t able to get the range needed for the long section of water (about 1125km) on one side of Laythe. I didn\u0027t feel too bad about it because the Kerbin circumnavigation also requires some pretty big deviations from the equator, but this is up to you of course.\n\n3. Finally, a redo of Kerbin is probably up next. If I\u0027m going for Master Mariner, am I *allowed* to cross the land bridge? Or is it required to *not* cross that section? I\u0027m asking this because I\u0027d prefer to start and finish at KSC, if that is allowed.\n\nAnyway, here it is. The route map is located near the end.
