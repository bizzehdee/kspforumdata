You can use mods, sandbox, and no debug. all missing crew cant respawn, and no flight reverts. even if you are just testing a rocket design. If you wanna take yourself a step further, You are not allowed to use the same rocket design you used to go to recently visited planet systems. For example: If i use Rocket A to get to the mun, i can use the same design to go to minmus, but i cant go to duna, or eve. If i Use Rocket B to go to jools moons, i can use the same design to go to the other moons, but not the mun, minmus, eve, duna, etc. Have Fun!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
