First, the different intakes produces differing amounts of air for the jets so, what works for one may not work for another. Second, there is no max altitude as you can leave atmo with just two intakes per engine, and likely do it with only one ram air intake. Third, the only reason to cram excess intakes on a plane, correctly piloted with attention payed to the throttle, is to achieve max altitude and speed in the minimum of time. If you are looking for a plane that can run full throttle at 35,000 meters then you are going to have to cram insane amounts of intakes on the frame. If you simply want a platform that can cruise at around 40,000 meters at 1/4 throttle, then you can get away with just two ram air intakes. \n\nThe biggest factor in how your jet performs at altitude isn\u0027t the amount of intakes, but how you pilot the craft. The keys are to constantly lower your throttle while making only minute changes to direction and altitude. Changes in direction and altitude lower the amount of air the intakes gather. Chart your course before you reach your desired altitude and drop somewhat below to maneuver. If you do that while constantly lowering your throttle you\u0027ll be able to reach speeds and altitudes you hadn\u0027t thought your plane could achieve. I find it amazing how little throttle is needed at heights above 25k meters."},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-24T10:23:19Z","Content":"Overfloater, interesting design there for Space Plane Mk1, an atomic biplane, with extra steampunkily crossed struts, which somehow seems to suit the Kerbal Space Program.

I removed 2 of the swept wings and reduced the fuel to about 40 Units liquid and 20 Oxi.\n\nWith the turbojet alone (with 3 intakes) i can fly up 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 like a rocket, turn 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 at about 20km and accelerate to 2100 m/s surface (reached at somewhere 25 to 30 km), which at this point would be 2300 m/s orbit.\n\nWith mechjeb managing the intakes and throttle i can thrust to about 40 km but its merely 5 kN thrust or less, but thats enough to fight any drag that still exists at that height. My projected AP is about 100 km with a PE of -20 km. Thats pure Turbojet at this point. At the AP i need just a 5 sec burn or so with the 2 rockos to achieve a rock solid 100 km orbit. Decending requires about 60 m/s retroburn and the rest is aerobrake and glide.\n\nIf i could, i would drop so many more parts to make the thing lighter... but its impossible to attach the still necessary parts to the ones that remain. Thank god the cockpit is so huge, that gives me plenty of mountpoints for the wheels and wings. The lightest mount for intakes unfortunately is a small fuelcan, even if that can is only filled to about 30%. Which means the 1/9th of container weight turns into 1/4 th. So i would need the next flattest version of a fuel can.\n\nBecause the engine makes about 40% of the total weight, my center mass is at the very rear, which makes it difficult to place the gearbays and wings so far back that it allows for stable flight and more importantly LANDING.\n\nI wish that all parts would come in \u0022tiny\u0022 size as well. With reasonably weighted engine housings (300 kg for a thing that does NOTHING is a joke)...\n\ntl;dr;\n\nWith only vanilla parts at hand and no glitching/cheating i cant improve my vehicle any more and its almost perfection and i doubt that anyone can do any better so the game sets the limit for this challenge which makes it less of a challenge :/"},{"CreatedByName":"sploden","CreatedById":54111,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T06:13:57Z","Content":"Name: Minisistilikio 3\n\nWeight: 1.136 tons\n\nParts: 13\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Use only one; you\u0027ll be thrusting off-axis, but it\u0027ll be so little that your capsule\u0027s reaction wheels can compensate.\n\nYou can use much lighter wings. First off, the delta-deluxe has better lift per mass than the swept wings. At low angle of attack, it\u0027s 10% better lift per mass, at high angle of attack the improvement is higher. Even better: use the small control surface, and lock all the controls so it\u0027s just a wing. Half the mass of a delta-deluxe, same lift. Finally, you certainly don\u0027t need all that wing surface; I\u0027m confident that two of the smallest wings is sufficient. Instead of 200 kg of swept wings, you would have 20kg of small control surfaces.\n\nSo that\u0027s 350 kg you could save.\n\nFinally, I agree with using a lander can for an SSTO. The drag coefficient of the lander can is higher, but gravity still matters even if you\u0027ve got a plane. Once you get up high, inertia is what matters, and the drag coefficient is irrelevant.
