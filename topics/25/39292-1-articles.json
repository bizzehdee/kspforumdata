So the winner will be determined by the aircraft which can deliver the most full Rockomax Jumbo-64 fuel tanks to an altitude of 10,000m\u002B, drop them safely then land back at the airport. Should multiple entries be able to deliver the same number of Jumbo-64 fuel tanks, then ties will be broken by the number of additional full X200-16 fuel tanks which can be dropped with the 64s. If there is STILL a tie, then the highest altitude at which the tanks were dropped will break the tie. No mods should be used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs proof the require a photo of the aircraft in flight with the fuel tanks, an image of the fuel tanks being released, an image of the empty plane still flying and finally an image of the empty plane having landed back at home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs proof that it is possible, they submit their currently working prototype.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/9SXph\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/9SXph\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS. it was not until they inspected these photos that they realized their best engineer forgot to install a right wing landing gear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResults:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPirke: 4!
