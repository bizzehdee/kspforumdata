As the first three missions it will be a suborbital flight. \n\nThe major addition to this flight is that, in order to test the rocket\u0027s ability to deal with an engine failure during the flight, one of the engines will be dropped once the rocket reaches Mach 2. To the astonishment of the engineers the rocket was able to compensate the lost engine and deliver the second stage to a 91 km apoapsis.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
