The point about the min PE orbit is that anything more than 1km below that will degrade whereas every orbit with PE over that will not. However KSP measures meters and your PE will not degrade but is not quite up to the rules standard. \n\nThe standard was set both because it was easy to remember and because it was well clear of the atmosphere. This last factor is significant because some craft have dimensions approaching 100m so it would be fully possible for the capsule to be in space while the tail was dragging in the atmosphere ! So the 70km standard stands and this means the last Sabre mission is an honourable gatecrasher, feel free to lobby the K-Prize committee with beer and nuts in the snug bar of the Dog \u0026 Booster.\n\nYour Sabre spaceplane looks capable of the K-Prize mission and from what you say had enough rocket propellant to make it, so why not have another go and beat the bouncers once and for all ? ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-04T09:25:43Z\u0022 title=\u002211/04/2013 09:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by boolybooly**"},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T10:29:38Z","Content":"drewscriver ... ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) awesome, Changling is a very remarkable craft and deployment is like something out of a Bond movie!
