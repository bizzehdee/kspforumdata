So this Challenge is a simple Idea. Build a Space station that will be forever visible above kerbal space center, no matter the time of day. And by visible, I mean VISIBLE. It needs to be large enough to see from the ground at ~the brightness of Minmus, if not more. Props to those who can build one that is about the size of a bb pellet as seen from kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods that will help Achieve this: Erkle\u0027s Docking, ORDA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScreenshots of final product from kerbal and near the waking behemoth.
