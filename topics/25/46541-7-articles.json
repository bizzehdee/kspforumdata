You see, since he posted that, thermal turbojet aircraft have been GREATLY nerfed...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn particular, the atmospheric intakes he used have been removed. It turns out they had 4x the intake-area of a RAM intake, and due to a coding technicality, were producing *NO DRAG*- which is why they were removed. Obviously, removing a dragless, 4 times more effective intake option which he used in his craft means future competitors are at a serious disadvantage...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, KSP-I further nerfed Thermal Turbojets by introducing a precooler part, and requiring it to fly at high speeds. So, anything like Steven\u0027s design would now EXPLODE without precoolers- which add additional mass, weight, and drag... (and increase part-count: necessitating even smaller overall designs to counteract this...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I propose is, KSP-Interstellar designs before 0.9.1.1 (when the precoolers were added, and the option to Atmospheric Intakes removed) be placed in a separate category. It is simply IMPOSSIBLE to replicate the kind of performance that was possible with 2.5 meter Atmospheric Intakes with stock Ram Intakes or B9\u0027s SABRE Intakes...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose players who launched designs before 0.9.1.1 are at a serious advantage (including myself)- since the Atmospheric Intakes have been removed in such a way that new craft can simply no created using the intakes, but existing craft that already contain them will still have them and function for at least a couple more versions (meaning I will still be able to fly my Eagle Mk2 and Blackhawk Mk6 designs on Duna, which both used KSP-I Atmospheric Intakes- but nobody else could replicate these designs if they wanted to...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just wanted to correct myself. I hadn\u0027t actually played with precooler functionality in KSP-I yet (even though I was using 0.9.1, where precoolers were required, I was also unable to reach sufficiently high speed/altitude to even need them due to a bug with uneven thrust), so I wasn\u0027t quite sure exactly how they had been implemented. It turns out it\u0027s not actually a separate part- but new functionality for stock and B9 precoolers- so they actually do something useful in cooling the intake air. As stated before though, this is a nerf- without these parts, thermal turbojets *OR* RAPIER jets will both explode at sufficiently high speeds... (KSP-I modifies the stock RAPIER engines to also require precoolers)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT #2:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAck, I know it\u0027s the post-Christmas slump; but I really need to watch my words a little more carefully. What I MEANT to say, is KSP-Interstellar modifies the \u0022Radial Engine Body\u0022 from stock already in the game (which doesn\u0027t actually do anything except add weight, part-count, and drag to your planes) into an \u0022Intake Precooler\u0022 which actually does serve a purpose- in preventing the air compression-based overheats of TTJ\u0027s and RAPIER engines that KSP-I now makes possible.

Produces 37.5% more ThermalPower, close to twice the thrust, and Thorium is slightly lighter than Uranium. On the downside, it requires a LOT more regular maintenance.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) Utilizes just TWO of the new Procedural Dynamics control surfaces to greatly increase stability \u0026amp; control while simultaneously slashing part-count and lag. (the control surfaces, found at the rear of the lower wings, were increased to near-maximum size for the design)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(3) Incorporates a RAPIER engine to greatly increase weight-efficiency of the ascent system. When leaving Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, the Raven Mk2 moves from Twin Thermal Turbojet (T3J) power (all intakes open on Liftoff), to combined T3J/RAPIER-AirBreathing power, to T3J/RAPIER Airbreathing/Conventional-Rocket power, to T3J/RAPIER ClosedCycle/Rocket power (radial intakes closed at this point), to RAPIER CC/Rocket-only power (inline intakes closed at this point), to orbit circularization just with the higher-ISP conventional rocket (a NovaPunch2 1.25m Orbital Achievement Device- 405 ISP but low thrust). The complex patterning of engine activation and deactivation, as well as timed intake-closure (radial intakes before inline intakes, as radial intakes choke the RAPIER in ClosedCycle Mode, and cannot be precooled) is designed to maximize efficiency. The result- the Raven Mk2 can ascend to orbit on less than a quarter the fuel of the Blackhawk Mk6. (which also saves on fuel-tank weight)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know it seems I\u0027ve launched an awful lot of spaceplanes at this point, but previously I took to showing my failed designs as well as my successes...

As a result I ended up doing this challenge anyway. I posted pretty early in this thread that I didn\u0027t think this was possible with anything but electrics and ions (and now fusion electrics) and I\u0027m sticking by that claim. Kethane jets alone do NOT work well on Duna.

One of the downfalls of electrics on Duna is very low thrust. For my plane, that means getting beat to death with long takeoff times while the electrics build up speed. The advantage I get with using both electric and Kjets is that I can use the Kjets as slingshots to get me off the ground and up to altitude quickly. From there, solar panels and the K generator supply MORE than enough power to run the electrics. By using air brakes and reverse thrust on the electrics I can easily get the plane down below 80m/s and restart the jets when (not if) they flame out and I need to gain some altitude. One thing the Kjets don\u0027t allow me to do is to use them like a catapult. While I can easily reach altitudes of 18km or higher, coming back down from that altitude is much like... well, a catapult. The porpoising effect on Duna is horrendous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, the folding electrics I chose wouldn\u0027t hold much above 4500m altitude for any length of time.

I didn\u0027t think anyone had ever thought of using Kethane to make electricity for long trips. With my old plane, I discovered exactly what the limitations of the Kjets were on Duna, I crashed... lots. So I knew those alone wouldn\u0027t do it. Since everyone else was using electrics, I decided to see if they could push me along when the Kjets flamed out. They weren\u0027t as good as I had hoped, but good enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Duna11.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Duna11.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAfter takeoff\u003C/strong\u003E - \u003Cem\u003EThis is not long after my first takeoff. The KJets got me well over 10k AP while keeping my trajectory mostly flat (so I wouldn\u0027t drop like a rock). The jets only used 225 Kethane to reach this altitude and the generator was still at 0% because of the low thrust of the props. From this altitude I was able to glide long distances and once the props caught air they helped keep me at around 5-6k. When I dropped to 4.5k, I\u0027d reverse thrust, hit the airbrakes and restart the Kjets. I probably only had to do 5 or 6 vaults with the Kjets to make a circumnavigation\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-23T21:06:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fengist\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fengist\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESince I really wanted to start a Duna circumnavigation challenge after starting the Eve circumnavigation challenge, I was looking to find a way to get around Duna safely and reliably. As a result I ended up doing this challenge anyway. I posted pretty early in this thread that I didn\u0027t think this was possible with anything but electrics and ions (and now fusion electrics) and I\u0027m sticking by that claim. Kethane jets alone do NOT work well on Duna. BUT... combine them with some electric props and here\u0027s my result. \u003Cp\u003EWell, I didn\u0027t see 1D-1()T\u0027s plane before creating mine so all I can say is, great minds think alike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis plane was more of a test to see if it was possible before sending up a larger one with more Kerbals aboard. I didn\u0027t bother to really score it as this was more of an experiment (one of my few that worked.) But I think it would only get a ONE on your scale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike 1D-1()T\u0027s plane, this one is Kethane powered, using the Kethane generator to create electricity (especially at night) but with the addition of Kethane engines as well. One of the downfalls of electrics on Duna is very low thrust. For my plane, that means getting beat to death with long takeoff times while the electrics build up speed. The advantage I get with using both electric and Kjets is that I can use the Kjets as slingshots to get me off the ground and up to altitude quickly. From there, solar panels and the K generator supply MORE than enough power to run the electrics. By using air brakes and reverse thrust on the electrics I can easily get the plane down below 80m/s and restart the jets when (not if) they flame out and I need to gain some altitude. One thing the Kjets don\u0027t allow me to do is to use them like a catapult. While I can easily reach altitudes of 18km or higher, coming back down from that altitude is much like... well, a catapult. The porpoising effect on Duna is horrendous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, the folding electrics I chose wouldn\u0027t hold much above 4500m altitude for any length of time. But, the reverse thrusting and using the Kjets to vault over high terrain allowed me one feat I didn\u0027t really expect.

Well solar panels added too much weight to the vessel (I would have had to add even more propellers and wing area). RTG\u0027s were even worse.

That means it can at least make it off the ground on Duna. The gravity there is only 30% of Kerbin\u0027s, so it can certainly make it quite a bit higher than that- but I don\u0027t know how much higher since I don\u0027t know the equation for how the Firespitter electric helicopter rotor\u0027s thrust falls off with altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s nuclear-powered (a basic-level KSP-Interstellar thorium reactor, to be precise) since nuclear power is reliable day and night, and provides much better power-density for the weight than solar, both in KSP-I and in real-life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, I don\u0027t want to EVER hear how KSP-I\u0027s power densities are \u0022overpowered\u0022 or \u0022unrealistic\u0022 again. The fact is, nuclear power provides much more power for its weight than solar in real-life (at the cost of posing a radiation hazard), especially as you scale it up. This fundamental realtionship accurately holds in KSP-I. If KSP-I\u0027s fission reactors seems overpowered, that\u0027s only because you\u0027re accustomed to the terrible power densities that using solar power entails, and most other mods inaccurately try to model nuclear power to have a similar or only slightly greater power density to solar- for instance NearFuture mod, which inaccurately places its reactors somewhere in the range between its smallest and largest solar panels in terms of power-density.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EANYWAYS, a helicopter should be much easier than a plane to transport to Duna (the Firespitter electric rotors fold up- so they\u0027re not very bulky at all in-transit), so I could easily integrate it into the top stage of a rocket (a two-way decoupler should slice it off nicely when it arrives) if I wanted to transport one there. The only problem for trnasport is the slightly uneven weight the rotors provide- and even that I\u0027m looking at fixing with a design that relies on utilizing 2-4 symmetrical side-mounted plane propellers re-purposed as vertical turbines.

Despite appearances, it\u0027s not actually a very powerful rocket engine- it only produces 0.4 kN of thrust with the helicopters rotors also active on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a tiny little bugger- it weighs less than 3 tons minus the fuel (for reference, a Hitchhiker Storage Container weighs 2.5 tons), so I should EASILY be able to build the Hornet into the top stage of a rocket to Duna (also unlike most plane designs, it has an entirely unoccupied attachment node at one end- so it can easily attach to a rocket via docking port or decoupler).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExpect to see news on that launch soon (probably sometime while I\u0027m waiting for the next maneuver node to get the Raven refueled and on its way to Duna).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-29T16:05:58Z\u0022 title=\u002201/29/2014 04:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-31T10:50:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo more updates on what I\u0027ve accomplished in the past couple days since posting...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, the Minmus Spacedock (previously called the \u0027Early Spacedock\u0027) made its transfer to Minmus where it will refuel the Raven.
