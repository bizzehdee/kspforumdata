Let\u0027s put a fictional setting into place. Kerbin will be destroyed. The reason, a black hole (this is so extremely rare, impossible in the game, but just roll with it). The black hole is 5 years out (ignore the fact the black hole would\u0027ve destroyed Eeloo already), and your mission is to build an O\u0027Neill Cylinder a.k.a Island, then escape to one of the 3 places that\u0027ll survive, then land and set up a colony. Here is the layout, now the rules.\n\nThe \u0022Island\u0022 building guide\n\n1. Must be 20 meters long and 5 meters wide.\n\n2. It can be driven along by normal rockets, but making an Orion propulsion system that [works!\\[arrow-10x10.png\\](http://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/) would be amazing\n\n2. It must hold 50 kerbals\n\n3. Must have a colony of 10 kerbals to land on [target!\\[arrow-10x10.png\\](http://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/).\n\n4. Must have gravity relatable to Kerbin (9.81 m.s. squared, has to be made with centrifuge system)\n\n5. Must have a 6 hour day-night cycle\n\nHere are the 3 [targets!\\[arrow-10x10.png\\](http://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/)\n\nDres\n\nMoho\n\nPol\n\nHere are the rules\n\n1. The only mods allowed are Infernal Robotics, visuals, and Info, but if the cylinder is too heavy for the stock rockets, use KW Rocketry or something similar for ORBIT ONLY\n\n2. Remember that the black hole will destroy all but the 3 targets, don\u0027t land on Laythe and say you completed the challenge, as it will be destroyed.\n\n3. The cylinder is allowed to be assembled in LKO\n\n4. You can only set up shop at the 3 targets.\n\n5. You can ferry the 50 kerbals to the cylinder in LKO\n\n6. When you leave Kerbin, you\u0027re not coming back, so no gravity assists.\n\n7. No refueling, Kerbin will be destroyed.\n\n8. Have fun\n\nAchoo! (Pol)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nLonely Space Potato (Dres)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nMeatball! (Moho)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nScoring by fastest colony set-up, which means from fully-assembled cylinder, to colony touchdown on one of three targets.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-11T21:05:33Z\u0022 title=\u002204/11/2015 09:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by HoloYolo**"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T16:57:14Z","Content":"Did I do something wrong?"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T18:57:38Z","Content":"If I\u0027m getting no replies is it a bad challenge."},{"CreatedByName":"fire219","CreatedById":140437,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T19:05:36Z","Content":"I wouldn\u0027t say it\u0027s a *bad* challenge, it just would be hard and not that rewarding."},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T19:06:01Z","Content":"Give it a day or two maybe?"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T19:11:14Z","Content":"You gotta remember that with challenges like this, folks will need time for the whole build/test cycle.

Then make the second cylinder with the buttons reversed so they always counter-spin.\n\nAnyway, since it\u0027s big and requires these unpredictable stock axes, it\u0027s going to bug out and break a lot.\n\nI\u0027m only doing it with IR allowed, otherwise it\u0027s just messy."},{"CreatedByName":"kStrout","CreatedById":116630,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T20:29:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So what you\u0027re saying is that everyone who tries this has to make 2 cylinders?\n\nif you want to be realistic, yes.
