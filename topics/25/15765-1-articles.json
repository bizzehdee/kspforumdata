Some bugs have been causing problems, most notably a test landing the spaceplane wanting to crumble regardless of structural connections, ground collision problems when testing. Alas on a final successful landing, it was a scenic location, but an engine was damaged, plus landing gears sinking into earth meant no ability to take off. Picture they are retracted for \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs such, a photo op which I think turned out picture perfect. I knew we shouldn\\\u0027t let jeb command the new 550m/s long range craft.

I have in the works a pretty cool vertical launch spaceplane designed to land at the muns. Will award it when we have a winner for all to have. Victory will come down to when I feel we got a good set up postings and my favorite.
