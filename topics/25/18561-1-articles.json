Building a Kerbal Space Station that is able to hold the ships at bay as well as crew compartments. You are allowed to use Novapunch, Deep Space Mission Pack, KW Rocketry, MechJeb, Aviation Lights, Damned Aerospace and Damned Robotics, and any mod that allows for extra crew storage such as the Crewtank mod. You are not allowed to use Novapunch\u0027s space dock.

If so, I suggest you allow people to use things like the KW Rocketry pack (one of the bigger packs), and your more Kerbals point system should probably be changed. Perhaps have it as \u002225 points for each Kerbal other than the pilots\u0022. This will make it easier, and have a bit more competition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, I\u0027ll be attempting this challenge!
