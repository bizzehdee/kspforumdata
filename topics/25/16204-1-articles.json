Timing would be hard, I used smaller SRBs on Minmus to land my crewed rover, but they were tiny, and I could trigger them as needed to supplement my skycrane\u0027s liquid engines. I suppose it could work, baring massive explosions. . . Jeb approved!

All that is do able except for the predictable trajectory. You change the trajectory even a little bit and your craft will be too fast/slow post SRB burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
