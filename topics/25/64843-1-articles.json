If you could maintain 25 m/s on average and go perfectly straight north the entire time (both impossible) a car would take 40 seconds per kilometer, which means 40,000 seconds to get to the pole. The best time a car could get is something about 11 hours, 6 minutes and 40 seconds. Realistically, you\u0027d be lucky to average 20 m/s and the distance to the pole in the route one has to take is more like 1100 km.

If you could maintain 25 m/s on average and go perfectly straight north the entire time (both impossible) a car would take 40 seconds per kilometer, which means 40,000 seconds to get to the pole. The best time a car could get is something about 11 hours, 6 minutes and 40 seconds. Realistically, you\u0027d be lucky to average 20 m/s and the distance to the pole in the route one has to take is more like 1100 km. This means it would realistically take more like 55,000 seconds, or 15 hours, 16 minutes and 40 seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t a hard challenge, but even on timewarp, it would be very time-consuming, I give a minimum of 3 hours on timewarp, 12 hours without if people don\u0027t use any rocket thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eumm a guy on this challenge \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/70603-as-far-as-you-can-drive-oxygen-breathing-car\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/70603-as-far-as-you-can-drive-oxygen-breathing-car\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*also made by jtPB \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edrove his rover for 18 hours, and got halfway round kerbin.......\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso i did a craft on that challange and is still available for use right now.... but it is now about 60km off from KSC. below is the post i made\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emy question is.... would you give it a green light for me to continue, instead of starting over???\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehere\u0027s my try\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/9NpHB\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

I DID NOT DO THIS ON PURPOSE, heck i didnt even knew that was happening when i weirdly enough going 30m/s\u002B UPHILL\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. like i typed up there, some places have uneven surfaces, looks smooth, it doesnt appear much until you pay close attention to the wheel, or go over it when you\u0027re on at least 2x warp speed. so when i go over it, i cant do anything because 90% of my movement is out of momentum. the tires barely have any grips, so i doesn\u0027t decelerate as fast as usual, but i also can\u0027t accelerate, pushing the brakes also barely have any effect. on flat surfaces it\u0027s fine, but on the hill down slope that thing is some scary ****.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso i was pushing my brakes when i was going downhill when i was going over \u0027that\u0027 terrain, suddenly it ends, i got back to the normal surfaces and my front rover tires suddenly got 100% grip back and whoosh, my rover is 75 degrees to the air( somehow accidentally i made my rover very, VERY stable,and very VERY hard to roll) but somehow survived without a scratch literally, not 1 of my tires is broken\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. i set the rover like a real life FR car, the front 3 wheels, i disabled the motor, they just function as steering because front and back steering is unstable at higher speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand the 3 back wheel i locked the steering. just these 2 small stuff really increased my rover\u0027s stability by a sky. of course i bind 2 action group button to toggle them in case i need it. but so far i haven\u0027t need used it. what happened on note no. 1, i tried to power it purely by wheels, only the 3 back wheels, and it still goes upto 20m/s on a 30 degrees uphill slope, thats like only 70% of the power available to be used. i got the feeling even a 45 degrees uphill slope wouldn\u0027t be a problem \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. for everyone else trying this after me, putting the wheels support beam/cube on an angle like i did, it cushions some uneven ground impact to the wheels and your rover structure itself, making it more stable, AND gives you higher ground clearance for tackling difficult surfaces\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*how do i properly add spoiler again?? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Comwarrior","CreatedById":101751,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T18:38:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spartwo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Spartwo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow do you plan to reach the pole on so little fuel?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou skipped through my video didn\u0027t you... and you didn\u0027t pay attention to the bits you actually watched...
