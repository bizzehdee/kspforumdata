Many missions were made to explore the other planets, but the most dominant object of the system remained untouched. Now the Scientists want to know more about this giant sphere of plasma that holds the system together. They said the most information will be gained really close to it, inside the Corona! And that, to fully understand the magnetic forces and the eruptions, a craft has to be in an orbit where it can cover the hole star. A polar orbit, they said! Polar!

After that, so after doing the EVA, deploying the two probes at destination, use an asteroid as an impactor and set up the Power-Plant and optional doing some Science, all the Kerbals have to return to Kerbin safely, and all of this has to be done with one big ship leaving Kerbins SOI initially.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eplease provide also this data:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Game Version\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Mods used\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Weight and aprox. cost of your complete Ship\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- anything you want to mention, what you\u0027re proud of or what was really difficult or required some reloading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff0000;\u0022\u003EAdvice: You should know of the concept of Slingshots and Gravity Assists before attempting this Challenge.

For example, I\u0027m flying with FAR, so Fairings are kinda needed to Launch, but they don\u0027t make the challenge easier, since i have no gains from fairings in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sun\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sun\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI can imagine Mechjeb is banned.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, mechjeb is allowed. The difficulty here is designing the ship and setting up the nodes. And for Data readouts you can use it to. Though i think it should be mentioned if you used mechjeb for any flying, but its not prohibited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I\u0027ve done some more testing and research and revised the maximum altitude: Now it\u0027s set to 500 000 000m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReason 1: I looked it up and the Corona is in the range form 1 to 3 Solar Radii, whereas in this case it would be ca. 1.8 Ksp Solar Radii, so it fits better in the proper region for the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReason 2: The last couple of meters can easily double ore triple the delta v amount, since you can\u0027t really do any tricks as soon as you are closer than moho (Only Oberth Effect) and can make a difference between a 35km/s Mission budget or a 65km/s mission budget just to get a little closer. And since it is possible to do, you\u0027ll need a good PC for it (so many parts needed) and i would rather like to get more people with average PC\u0027s compete in the challenge than getting as close as it gets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReason 3: I tested were KSP Sun \u0027looks\u0027 the best for this mission. And once you get closer than 150 000 000m it loses the glow around and is just a yellow ball. But further out than 600 000 000m and you can\u0027t see the Dark Spots anymore. So it looks best between that range. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd 500 000 000m is still so close that you couldn\u0027t fit a second Sun between you and the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-20T12:09:37Z\u0022 title=\u002210/20/2014 12:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SkyRex94\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarvinKitFox","CreatedById":99545,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-20T15:38:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SkyRex94\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SkyRex94\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E... revised the maximum altitude: Now it\u0027s set to 500 000 000m.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk so assuming LFO rocket, the needed launch mass is now 8.8% as much.
