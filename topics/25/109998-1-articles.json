There will be four categories: liquid fuel,\n\nRCS, solid fuel and Xenon. The last one im not sure is possible but i will\n\nkeep it as an category if someone manages to build one.\n\n**What is an SSTO?**\n\nAn SSTO is defined on this challenge as a Vehicle of any shape that does\n\nnot drop any parts.

Rather take dV from LKO or something like that.\n\nedit: another idea/question:\n\nis it allowed to start with only ore as a resource? Then process it into whatever we want and go from there?
