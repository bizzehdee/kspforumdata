If your plane has a low stall speed, and you have made a very fast boat, you can fly down very low, slow down, then have the boat match the speed of the plane. The plane just\u00A0drifts down and the boat latches on to it, stops, refuels the plane, gets up to speed again, then the plane takes off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll vehicles must be stock, pictures appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
