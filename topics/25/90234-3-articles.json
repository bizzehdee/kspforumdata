That said, if you\u0027re able to put together a decent space station using only spaceplane launches, I\u0027ll happily give it some sort of special recognition. Another option would be to tweak the rules to give a points bonus for a station constructed solely from spaceplane launches.

Specifically I am a big fan of KW rocketry, the parts just look good in my opinion, but the CFG files have not been touched since pre-Nasa parts which means they are woefully underpowered. And so when I download the pack I go through and re-balance them. I do my best to make it follow the sort of Higher TWR = lower ISP methodology. And so the heavy lifter engines have things like 350 or 340 Vac ISP. (Usually still at a lower TWR than the KR-L2 because it\u0027s basically Overpowered.) What are your thoughts here? Would the modified KW Rocketry parts still be allowed in the mods category? Or is that just a total no go cause it would be so hard to decide fairness? (Obviously I can provide the configs if you need them to make the assessment.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Norcalplanner","CreatedById":112223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T17:53:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think if you provide me with the configs, and TWR and Isp are comparable to 0.90 stock engines, then that would be fine as a modded division entry.
