It\u0027s the ultimate thrill: traveling throughout the Kerbol System, getting as much science as you can, never stopping or returning home to Kerbin until the conclusion of your journey. Once you prove you can land on every planet and moon of the Kerbol System without having to return home, you have demonstrated that you can handle any challenge that comes your way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr can you? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hereby propose a new challenge, the \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EUltimate Grand Tour\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E. Now, you might wonder how it\u0027s possible to up the stakes of a challenge that goes everywhere. Now, I\u0027m sure that someone else more intimately familiar with the game might propose rules such as \u0022use only a certain number of parts\u0022 or \u0022complete the challenge in so-and-so amount of time\u0022 or \u0022carry whatever number of Kerbals with you\u0022. I, however, have a simple solution: more planets. Using mods such as Krag\u0027s Planet Factory or the recently released Outer Planets Mod, you must set out on a new kind of grand tour, one with unfamiliar and unexplored horizons. Will you guide kerbality to new and even greater heights? Or will the once-great masters fall before this new frontier? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERules: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) No cheating, or I will be very sad. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Your mission must include a minimum of three Kerbals. You may split them up however you want (i.e. sending one guy to a different planet or moon), but all three must begin the mission together. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) At least one of these Kerbals must land on each planet and moon in the modded Kerbol System and retrieve at many unique science reports as possible. (Gas giants need not be landed on, but getting science from within the atmosphere will earn you a gold star in my book.) After landing on all bodies in the system, you must return home to Kerbin and land all surviving Kerbals safely. (Note: the same Kerbal does not have to land each time.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Whether or not to use mods is more or less up to your best discretion. MechJeb is okay, as are mods that add new kinds of experiments. Infinite fuel mods are a big no-no. I want to say mods like Karbonite that let you mine resources for fuel are borderline cheating since you should have to pack what you need, but I also think those mods are incredibly cool, so I\u0027ll leave it up to you guys to decide whether you want to use it. Basically, if it feels like cheating, it probably is. Any purely aesthetic mods should be okay. [Edit: I thought about it again and Karbonite is okay.] \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Post a comment with your plans before beginning your mission so I can make sure it qualifies for the challenge. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) At least five new bodies must be added in your modded system, at least one of which must not orbit any existing planets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Reloading of saves is not only allowed, but encouraged. As a KSP player, I know the propensity of things to FUBAR millions of kilometers from home. Fixing a design flaw and replacing the ship mid-mission is frowned upon, but is permitted in the case of a mission-breaking ship glitch, provided the ship is restored to the exact same position with the exact same fuel levels, with as little alteration as possible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) You are permitted to use as many refueling missions as you want. I\u0027m not a horrible person; I\u0027ll let you have this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9) Remember: document everything. Rule #1 of the internet: Pics or it didn\u0027t happen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10) In regards to \u0022getting out and pushing\u0022, i.e. providing an out-of-fuel ship with additional maneuvering power using a Kerbal on EVA, this is permitted if the ship is completely out of fuel and within Kerbin\u0027s SOI; however, you may only perform this once for every Kerbal on the mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11) This is intended to be a fun challenge. If you feel that any of these rules will ruin the fun for you, then don\u0027t follow them. Just know that breaking them will disqualify you from getting on the leaderboard. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESuggested challenges: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EThe Sentar Challenge:\u003C/span\u003E This challenge focuses on the stock planets of the PlanetFactoryCE mod: Ablate, Ascension, Inaccessible, and Sentar. Sentar, a ringed gas giant, also has four moons: Skelton, Erin (with its own mini-moon, Pock), Ringle, and Thud. This challenge will be more of an endurance test, since it requires a lot of flying around between different parts of the Kerbol System. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff0000;\u0022\u003EPoints of danger: \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EAscension has an extremely elliptical orbit, taking it from within the orbit of Moho to beyond Eeloo; that means you\u0027ll have to target it at the right time, before it leaves the system for who knows how long. The three smaller planets- Ascension, Inaccessible, and Ablate- are small and hard to get an encounter with, and Inaccessible rotates so fast that you can only land on the polar areas. As for Thud and it\u0027s 3x Kerbin gravity...yeah, good luck. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EOther notes: I believe the pack also includes a second star system by default: the Serious system, which has only one planet, Joker. Feel free to go there if you want to be an overachiever, but it\u0027s not required to complete the challenge, since the Grand Tour technically only involves the Kerbol System. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E2) \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EThe Outer Planets Challenge:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E This challenge utilizes the extremely well-designed Outer Planets mod, which adds three new gas giants with their own moons to the system, as well as a new dwarf planet, and also implements Squad\u0027s original idea of moving Eeloo into orbit of the second gas giant. If you don\u0027t feel like bothering with the inner solar system longer than you have to and want to explore the edges of the system, that\u0027s just fine by me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff0000;\u0022\u003EPoints of danger:\u003C/span\u003E I haven\u0027t actually played with this mod before, so I don\u0027t know much about it. I\u0027ve heard Hale can be a pain in the boosters to land on, since it\u0027s a tiny SOI inside the much bigger SOI of Sarnus. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBonus:\u003C/strong\u003E For extra credit points, install the two expansions to OPM, \u0022Outer Planets Plus\u0022 and \u0022Plock Plus\u0022.

For those of you who are so bored with normal KSP that you want to start doing the impossible, this is the challenge for you. The Kraken-Jeb Challenge features eight Kopernicus packs: JoolPlus, the Minor Bodies Pack, the stock PFCE planets in Kopernicus, Odysseus System, Terrestrial Planet Pack, Trans-Keptunian Pack, Kerbol Planet Pack, and the Porp System. This is the ultimate challenge, and I seriously doubt anyone will ever complete it, even with the refueling missions this will allow. But then, I\u0027ve been surprised before... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff0000;\u0022\u003EPoints of danger:\u003C/span\u003E All the bad PFCE places are still bad. Other than that, your big obstacle is the lag. Yeah, you\u0027re gonna need a supercomputer to run this on top of everything else. [Also, look around carefully; there may now be some moons around existing planets you weren\u0027t familiar with.] \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther notes: If you beat this challenge, you win KSP.
