Although non-functioning ones are allowed on all car types for design purposes.\n\n-infinifuel is allowed\n\n-you need to upload a screenshot, gallery, or video of your vehicle to this thread.\n\n-part clipping is restricted to non debug menu (placement tricks are more than allowed)\n\n-for judgment purposes, a download link will need to be posted so I can test the vessel for handling\n\n-part count=unlimited\n\n-when judging for design, be fair and honest.\n\n-HAVE FUN!\n\n**Judging**\n\n-Design: X/10 will be judged by the viewers of this thread exempt of the creator of this vessel\n\n-Speed: X/10 participants will list top speed in their post and will be confirmed by myself during handling testing\n\n-Handling X/10 I will personally test the handling\n\n**-Each division will be separately judged, and have their own top five.-**\n\nDragster:\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nDrift:\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nNASCAR\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nFormula 1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-23T01:56:29Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2015 01:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RandomName101**"},{"CreatedByName":"aidanbossman","CreatedById":134315,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T22:06:04Z","Content":"what about wipEout racing-Anti gravity formula one, anyone?"},{"CreatedByName":"JacobT11","CreatedById":11673,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T22:48:55Z","Content":"Any limits on where dragsters can run?

Get on a multiplayer mod, get to the Mun or Minmus, create a \u0022track\u0022 by placing pods as cones and having a race! Not sure if it would ever work but would be great.
