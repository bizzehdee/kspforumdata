The X jumbo always had the problem of a heavy fuselage. Spreading the load over the wing is a lot stronger and more stable for landing and take off.\n\nLower wing also offer better placement for wheels and allows for a big underbelly offering 10 or more degrees of rotation during take off and landing and better spread of the load on the landing wheels.\n\nIm playing the new carer mode. Have not built an SSTO since last year so a bit rusty.

Its a cool look and it completed the K-Prize challenge admirably, earning an astrokerbal distinction for landing on Minmus and an advanced pilot precision award for returning safely to Kerbin. Congratulations and welcome to the 0.23 guest list, since you said it was pre 0.24.\n\nThanks Luovahulluus for three or was it four missions? Congratulations for winning a Utilitarial Distinction and Astrokerbal Distinction for the trip to Minmus with a buggy also an Advanced Pilot Precision Award for bringing Big Moth home safely. Well done for winning both the Maximalist record holder title with BEHEMOTH V and the Minimalist record holder title with Minipossu. That is quite an accomplishment and it will be interesting to see if anyone can do better than those in this version.\n\nCongratulations shufflermuffler for successfully piloting a large unnamed craft through the K-Prize mission and bringing it back to KSC runway in one piece.

She really wanted to turn left, so I had to limit one of the engines to compensate. I had some mirroring issues when attaching the wings to the Mk2 fuselages, so I figured that\u0027s why I had more drag on the left.\n\nHad that recently. In my case, it was because of a broken fuel line and asymmetric drain. The difference wasn\u0027t enough to make her roll, but KSPs mass-based drag model made her yaw badly.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I have some plans on how to convert this into a cargo plane, but with these frame rates it\u0027s not going to happen. If someone else wants to be my test pilot, give me a shout.\n\nBeen there done that. The short answer is mods. You don\u0027t even have to put it on too thick:\n\n![screenshot44.png](http://ksp.schnobs.de/k-prize/screenshot44.png)\n\nThat\u0027s procedural wings and rockomax-sized intakes. The intakes have mass, drag, and intake capacity like a quadcouple worth of standard intakes, mounting them to rockomax tanks saved me the pylons (of which I\u0027d otherwise need two per engine). The mod intakes alone are saving me 192 parts right there. The tanks also hold all the fuel I need to get into orbit and back, so the kerbodyne tanks that make up the fuselage are all payload.\n\n![screenshot95.png](http://ksp.schnobs.de/k-prize/screenshot95.png)\n\nFor scale, here she\u0027s docked and transferring fuel to my Jool-5 transfer stage. The main wings are 12 parts, thanks to the procedural wing mod. I refuse to even think about how many wing pieces (and struts!) I\u0027d need to make this happen in stock. It probably wouldn\u0027t hold anyway.\n\nAll told, that\u0027s still over 200 parts. 24 RCS thrusters, 32 struts, headlights, gear, reaction wheels... it all adds up. Still, the two mods (wings and intakes) allowed to push the part count into regions where I experience nearly no lag after liftoff or in orbit (one minute gametime comes to about 65 seconds real time). However, while air runs short at ~28km, lag is still quite bad, like 2:3 or so."},{"CreatedByName":"Firerunner","CreatedById":58673,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T17:33:17Z","Content":"Decided to twiddle around and see how small a SSTO shuttlecraft I could build with the new intakes. \n\nThis one was the result: The Scarab MkII\n\n![A4330911401E959CBC8BED7C4D4859C87CEEE0B0](http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/591413233202368606/A4330911401E959CBC8BED7C4D4859C87CEEE0B0/)\n\n49 parts (mostly because of the LFO fuel setup), weighs in at 6.33t fueled or 3.72t empty.
