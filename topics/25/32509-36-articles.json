The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E then i guess i can add ablator to the decouplers so its heavier or whatnot.\u00A0 Regardless, i think these will be my new offline weapons of choice, incredibly low part counts, and still at least semi lethal when spammed in large numbers.\u00A0 Too bad it isnt really practical for weapons heavier then ~0.5t since the recoil becomes such an issue that you are unable to use it on ground vehicles and have a high risk of destroying whatever you are shooting from too.\u00A0 Also, doesnt really work at incredible velocity either.\u00A0 Tried making a mass effect style weapon that fired at like 5% the speed of light.\u00A0 Instantly vaporized the ship, sent the 1 ibeam flying 5% of light, and sent all the leftover debris flying the opposite direction on a solar escape trajectory.\u00A0 Actually, that gives me an idea for a very simple self-destruct system for ships, a decoupler with near infinite force which tears the ship into pieces...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-15T04:06:11Z\u0022 title=\u002210/15/2016 04:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;","CreatedById":78047,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-15T04:47:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsad i was expecting to killing this thread ^^ and you keeping on posting well keep it on posting for n o w ^^\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n^think about i_t that\u0027s not a muddy day not a muddy day at all ^^\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nare we talking about mud again in this thread ?

similar or even identical to a ship without it.\u00A0 Take my edited ion engine, i added integrated xenon gas and integrated battery storage, but then i added ablator to compensate for the dry mass of the equivalent in fuel tanks (in terms of stats its 100% identical to a unmod ion engine, 3 batteries, and 2 of the medium xenon tanks but 1 part vs 6).\u00A0 The day that KSP allows me to have 2000\u002B parts loaded in one spot ill gladly ditch the craft file modding, but for now its a matter of part count (since in offline mode i really have a thing for fleet scale battles, and i just cant afford to load all those extra parts for ion ships).\u00A0 As for the new \u0022cannons\u0022 i created i dont really think they are unfair at all.\u00A0 They are lower part count and a hair lighter then a ibeam\u002B4 sepatron missile, but you have massive recoil (this may or may not create its own engineering nightmare for ships that werent designed to handle it), you cannot alter the projectile velocity as you can with conventional sepatron missiles, and they seem to be far less reliable at actually killing anything (meaning you need to carry more of them and that makes your ship pretty damn heavy).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for ramp and cargo bay armor, its just a matter of the fact that one, it tends to make killing ships much more luck based, and it generally makes large volume of small weapons worthless.\u00A0 Ofc its pretty much because 90% of my ship designs rely on larger quantities of weaker weapons to kill the enemy with bug-bites, which fairing armor renders rather pointless.\u00A0 One of my own ships that used cargo bays (the SR-1 Normandy replica) pretty much shows what i mean, firing ibeams at it (and cargo bays are easier to kill then ramps), sometimes you end up wasting 12 shots and it is still more or less intact, sometimes a single shot vaporizes the entire ship, i just prefer some sort of consistency and not playing the lottery.\u00A0 That said, I dont mind you using the ramps against me, ill just bring weapons that are specifically designed to kill them (like fairing impactors which have a very good chance of killing fairings, fight fire with fire, or indestructible hitboxes with indestructible hitboxes in this case), but it wont really be as fun of a fight as the more conventional armor schemes using structural parts where we dont have to use extremely powerful weapons either, not that there is anything wrong with instakilling competitive warheads, just i prefer to have more drawn out battles where people do damage but dont necessarily instakill every ship that gets attacked).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022PB5VrQV.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022

Fighting land battles in low gravity (love the new cheat menu set grav to minmus level) is so much fun when the wrecks get shot apart and sent flying!\u00A0 Now have 3 new omni-purpose tanks, a pz-iv analog (doesnt really look like a pz4 but its turreted and it has fairly balanced stats in terms of armor and firepower), a flatpanzer (lower profile, no turret, twice the ammo as the pz-iv, and similar armor protection), and a stug like thing based on a slightly modified hull (no turret and same firepower as pz-iv, but considerably better armor protection which lets it tank fire in any spot but the gun mantlet which will rip apart the cannon).\u00A0 All of them use the new decoupler powered \u0022cannons\u0022 to save on part count and to allow me to cram 4 shots into a very tight package (finally no more dual barreled turrets, but a single-barrel lookalike turret with 4 shots before requiring reload).\u00A0 Tried to make a new flakpanzer-IV replica but i cant seem to get the \u0022cannons\u0022 to stop tearing the turret out of its bearing when firing (works fine with a single heavy bearing turret, not so well with the wirbelwind turret which is much lighter and smaller

looking back at very old mods i cant say for certain but i believe the first ever weapon mod was something that had a decoupler in bullet form factor that shot itself out of the ship at high velocity and you could stack these ontop of each other for a sort of multi-shot effect.\u00A0 Very limited and nowhere near as good as the modern version (which is 100% stock aside from manually changing a number past 100 in the craft file), it did work and most of all it was low on parts.\u00A0 Only reason i even went down this route is the lagfest that occurs when you pile on the parts, and while it may seem like nothing to cut a 6 part weapon down to a 2 part weapon, if a ship carries over 10 of said weapons (and ive even put 48 on a single craft once, dont ask me why because there is no sane reason) that over 40 parts (184 in the case of that monstrosity armed with 4 SRM-12s) removed from the ship for a minor decrease in firepower (lets face it, decoupler weapons are inferior to good old fashioned sepatron missiles in every way but compactness and part count).\u00A0 Also, i will say its handsdown better on tanks since the instant velocity lets you facehug your opponent to death (and my new flatpanzer-IV is literally so low to the ground that many tanks cant even hit it at short range).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, ive managed to accelerate a ship to solar escape velocity with a single decoupler cannon when i was attempting to shoot a ibeam out the front at 5% light speed.\u00A0 Believe it or not it DID work, but the ship was obliterated by the recoil (and thus what was left, err a cloud of debris shot out of the solar system at fairly high velocity).\u00A0 Considering it is the exact same thing as an engine (instead of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E you are expelling weapons grade ibeam from the front at lethal velocity), i think you could easily modify the concept to function as a makeshift engine that gives you a strong kick every time you fire it...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOhh and as for the stock orion drive, im pretty sure someone streamed it, worked by using landing legs to shoot stuff.\u00A0 That would be more then capable of being weaponized, but how exactly effective it would be is another story.\u00A0 Based on my rather extensive optimization tests, you want to have the ibeam impact at ~100-300m/s depending on the target you are shooting at (200m/s is a good generic that works against most targets).\u00A0 If you can get a orion drive styled system to fling stuff out the front at those velocities (preferably structural parts at that), itd easily become a weapon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexanderTeaH","CreatedById":111209,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-20T09:36:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022

generally dont bother as the sole reason i am even using decoupler powered ibeam cannons is to cut down on part count.\u00A0 That and having to fire 2 cannons for every 1 actual shot is essentially like bringing twice the firepower but being unable to use half of it on the enemy.\u00A0 Its so inefficient on mass that id rather deal with the recoil issues which only really come into play with the long ibeams and off-center mountings which send your ship into a sideways spin every shot (not critical in singleplayer/turn based, but itd be a death sentence in real time combat since you\u0027d need anywhere from 10-30 seconds to restabilize).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, while i had to try it, attempting to fire recoilless hypervelocity rounds just rips the ship to shreds as the sheer amount of impulse generated when accelerating something to 5% light speed instantly will overload every single joint in stock KSP (only way i can think of making a functional weapon of that firepower would be a sacrificial weapon hardpoint that decouples at the same time the round is fired, it gets vaporized but the ship itself should remain functional).\u00A0 That said, dont even bother

The main reason for the insane ammo count is that i wanted to give it some staying power in a fight, an issue with most older ships for all factions i make ships for (some, and i dont mean fighters, had as few weapons as 4 ibeams and a single RT-5).\u00A0 Otherwise, id consider this comparable in ability to a ship armed with dual SRM-6 launchers (what i call the ibeam\u002Bsepatron weapon pods that were quite popular on craft a few months back).\u00A0 As for the rest, besides pis poor \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E (its really not gonna cut it in any sort of real time combat), and the fact that the armor, while there, is still a little lousy (only reason its any bit hard to kill is the fact that there is so many probes in the thing its the equivalent of like 10 separate ships glued together)...\u00A0 Not terrible, but it isnt as practical as i had hoped it to be...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-21T01:12:51Z\u0022 title=\u002210/21/2016 01:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexanderTeaH","CreatedById":111209,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-21T11:34:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222815489\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002232509\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221477011971\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002295108\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022panzer1b\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, panzer1b said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E-snippity snip snip-\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was really only complaining about the lighting in the image, though I\u0027m more than happy to test it as well.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-25T00:07:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething needs to be done about the lag...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00220arL9Oh.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://imgur.com/0arL9Oh.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just brought together a 1000 part ship, a 600 part ship, and a 300 part ship and the lag became painful (at least i proved it can be done while retaining some playability, not very fun with the FPS down, but i can do fights like this).\u00A0 Also, restarted work on my base star, ive had versions of it since like 0.25, but its really a ship that nomatter what i try, im not exactly happy with (either too many parts, doesnt look anywhere near what i want, or has atrocious armor).\u00A0 This particular model was the first with a fully armored skeleton and lack of any major weakspots in the form of clipped cargo bays (pretty much all the old ones used cargo bay spam, looked more authentic but ended up cannon fodder in battles).\u00A0 That said, it doesnt look right since it lacks that organic style curving on the arms.\u00A0 I think ill end up going back to cargo bays though for the next build, of everything i tried they actually allowed me to build organic styled shapes and look closest to the real thing.\u00A0 Now if only i could figure out a way to do that AND make it very hard to kill the ship...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andem","CreatedById":155578,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-29T03:08:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUh, guys, for future reference...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWinkAllKerb has said before in other interactions with other folks that he has autism.So it\u0027s best to take that ino account when talking to him.
