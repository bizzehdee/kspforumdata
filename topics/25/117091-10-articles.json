Pretty happy with it so far. Planned combat weight will probably be around 1.8t to 1.9t giving it a nice TWR of .6 in most cases. It\u0027s still a draggy piece of poop so it can\u0027t effectively accelerate past 90 m/s under its own power. Still, decent handling in the 50-90 m/s range, (max recorded G\u0027s in a dive was about 8.5). Doesn\u0027t have enough elevator authority to easily stall its main wing (I\u0027d like to give it more, but need to make it AI proof).\n\n![B5BAF59AD38DAC3F592000253F56464268F12A6C](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/447332276392131280/B5BAF59AD38DAC3F592000253F56464268F12A6C/) On the runway\n\n[http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/447332276392131476/6210C1225EE681AEC389A07A4412215E75700DC1/](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/447332276392131476/6210C1225EE681AEC389A07A4412215E75700DC1/) Climbing pretty well for a 50% sport engine\n\n[http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/447332276392131976/A6DBF3ABA3DF5AA4594E67B499348D6DEEC00B0E/](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/447332276392131976/A6DBF3ABA3DF5AA4594E67B499348D6DEEC00B0E/) I hope it\u0027ll turn well enough to compete with other designs, it\u0027s pretty fragile, so if it can\u0027t out-turn something it\u0027s kinda dead.\n\n[http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/447332276392132107/121D6C29785F29E8410AAAE63EFA064995BDC49D/](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/447332276392132107/121D6C29785F29E8410AAAE63EFA064995BDC49D/) landing is hilariously easy in that you just fly across the ground at 35 m/s and cut power while pulling up, it\u0027ll safely drift onto the ground."},{"CreatedByName":"TUKE","CreatedById":119239,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T13:09:02Z","Content":"Ok i re-installed BDA again, same way, and it all magically works now.............."},{"CreatedByName":"tetryds","CreatedById":50204,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T13:19:31Z","Content":"@Phearlock: it looks so exotic, amazing.\n\nMy strategy was a bit different, it\u0027s more on the heavy side so I can reach around 430km/h on a straight line at about 400m alt.\n\nMine is basically an energy fighter ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n8.5gs on a dive, now that\u0027s something.\n\nMine weights 3 tons, it handles like crap below 200km/h but is also super easy to land, the static landing legs are strong.\n\nI stay very far away from stalling at any situation, but I can only fight at high speeds, now I just need to tweak the AI to fight like I want it to.\n\nI only have one weak side, but I dare you can ever land a single bullet there.\n\n@TUKE: Awesome!"},{"CreatedByName":"Darren9","CreatedById":58062,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T13:42:38Z","Content":"Doesn\u0027t anyone want to offer up an early test version of their craft for us to play with?
