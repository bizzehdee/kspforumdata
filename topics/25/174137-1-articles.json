It has become very obvious that the KSP has been wasting time, money, and the occasional life on great feats of ingenuity, engineering, and ridiculousness. This post is a opportunity for those guilty of perpetrating these things to give to the Kerbal race. Anything and everything the population can use at large is appreciated. Mods are just fine so long as they don\u0027t make things ridiculously easy. Make the kerbal race\u0027s lives better to prove that you really need more funding for things like a Munar snack bar, or that Eve aircraft carrier. Craft files are appreciated (heck, I\u0027ll take some rescue VTOLS) and images are kinda necessary. Go ham.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
