Guess I\u0027ll have to do some rebuilding. The RCS system to try to control slippage is handled using action groups. I fly with a HOTAS (mostly for Elite), and I have my action groups on the CH Throttle.\n\nMy latest build (not in the video, nor even tested) had the same Spark rockets on the bottom to prevent bottoming out. In that case, hitting the Gears action group turned on the bottom rockets, and turned off my jets.

I see things are starting to get contentious though.\n\nThis evening I\u0027ll review the rules and make a change to help keep things in the spirit of the challenge. But let me respond to some of the comments so far, starting with JackDuggan\u0027s.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The rules did not specify if I had to use the small or large anti-gravity devices, so I chose the more aerodynamic small version.\n\nGood point, and I should have specified these do need to be the larger repulsors. I didn\u0027t think it would matter, but you helped demonstrate it does.\n\nAnd yes, I am probably going to disqualify your first run, but not before making sure the rules are clearer, so you can re-enter. I\u0027ll look at the second run this evening.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E well, the problem is that in the rules it is allowed to spam control surfaces to basically create wings as long as you use small ones. limiting the amount of control surfaces you can use would help, but you can still a) build a tiny plane and still use the control surfaces as wings or ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) use jet engines to boost you very high...\n\u003E IMO the solution would be a radar altitude limit or something like that.\n\nI\u0027m not sure radar altitude is the best way to handle it since that either requires mods (MechJeb, KER) or the IVA view (of a [hard-to-read gauge that doesn\u0027t work like real-world altimeters](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/69046), at least without mods).\n\nLimiting control surfaces is a possibility, but if I do it\u0027d be along the lines of allowing only one pair of winglets for stability reasons, one pair of airbrakes for steering and braking, etc. I had hoped that simply stating \u0022control surfaces\u0022 and limiting the lift rating to 0.5 would be sufficient. JackDuggan proved me foolish in that regard, and I\u0027m actually grateful he snapped me out of my hubris.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E As far as I can remember \u0022topgunning your way out\u0022 was forbidden.\n\nIt\u0027s not a formal rule, though--frankly that was part of the hubris I mentioned above. \u0022You can\u0027t Top Gun your way through this\u0022 was me shutting out a possibility that, as it turned out, remained quite open under the formal rules.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I just had an idea: use kOS and make a small script that puts all engines thrust limiters to 0 whenever the repulsors are not repulsing. That would make powered flight impossible and give you an incentive to stay on the ground, but still allow jumps.\n\u003E It would add another mod to the list and complicates the launch of your craft somewhat on the other hand. At lease if kOS modules still can\u0027t auto load scrips at startup.\n\nIt\u0027s an interesting idea--but as you point out, it\u0027s another mod to add. I was hoping to keep this down to requiring only two mods.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I have a better idea for a rule, or rather two.\n\u003E 1. Your craft must not be capable of or at least not sustaining the same altitude over long distances. In other words, your craft can\u0027t stay airborne for more than say, a minute.\n\u003E \n\u003E 2. When over the water portion (not including the start), you must stay ON the water at all times. Exceptions made when you hit the ramps of the posts on the water, but you can\u0027t stay up in the air.\n\nThe first rule you propose is hard to qualify considering you can use stock jets to get suborbital trajectories. But it does suggest that I should add a rule against intentionally remaining airborne. If you hit a hill fast and get a lot of hang time out of it, that\u0027s one thing, but angling thrust to maintain altitude is going against the spirit of the challenge. And whether via IVA or the default flight HUD, we should be able to see the navball to tell if a contestant is doing that. Let me think on it.\n\nThe second rule can be considered a variant of the first, although much easier to enforce as stated.\n\nOK, I\u0027ll work on this and post a clarification, update the rules, and update the leader board accordingly.

I can imagine the three hulls would create extra drag, and with the cables you\u0027d definitely have issues staying afloat and in one piece.\n\nUnfortunately, the most recent ruleset makes explicit that you can\u0027t use the surface-mounted repulsors. Still, just for the innovative design, and the fact that you were able to complete the challenge despite the extra difficulty, I think you deserve an honorable mention at least. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T18:56:50Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 06:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LitaAlto**"},{"CreatedByName":"LitaAlto","CreatedById":110917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T20:19:59Z","Content":"So I\u0027ve updated the leader board to reflect Soda Popinski\u0027s entry, which doesn\u0027t qualify under current rules but is too cool not to give an honorable mention to.\n\nI didn\u0027t set an original deadline for this challenge, but will probably close out the leader board on Wednesday if there are no new entries by then.\n\nAnd I\u0027m already giving thought to how to conduct the next race.
