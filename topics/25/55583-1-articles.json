Almost 7 km/s dV remaining from LKO. You needs lots of intakes to get to orbit almost entirely on a pair of jets, enough wings to get off the ground, 1 LV-N, and the rest fuel. You\u0027d probably have to double the design if you want to use a proper pod instead of a jumpseat.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mesklin","CreatedById":73898,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T13:00:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr you can fly to Eeloo and back with my plane:\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/11214-The-K-Prize-100-reusable-spaceplane-to-orbit-and-back?p=738996\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post738996\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/11214-The-K-Prize-100-reusable-spaceplane-to-orbit-and-back?p=738996\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post738996\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"koshelenkovv","CreatedById":53764,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T19:05:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAccording to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60025-Maximum-possible-dV-for-a-single-stage\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis thread\u003C/a\u003E maximum theoretical dV for LV-N \u003Cem\u003Ebarely\u003C/em\u003E allows to build Eeloo SSTO wcich is capable of landing and return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI doubt that anyone (okay, any more than 1-2 people) is able to make it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing ions is much more easier (but much more tedious).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
