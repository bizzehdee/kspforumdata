It\\\u0027s the Mobile Artillery! Run, for it knows neither mercy nor respite! Its relentless pilots face no worse fate than to fail!\n\nAlright, substance now. It\\\u0027s mobile due to its low weight and the ever-useful vehicle mod thing. Can do 150 km/h on good terrain (with a good driver at the wheel). The CLAWs are used to lift the wheels off the ground; that stops the whole machine from rolling and provides a decent recoil absorption factor. Decent, but not enough - you need to correct your aim after every shots. That\\\u0027s where the missiles come in (there, and in disciplinary measures). The four missiles provide a crude iron sight of sorts; by aligning them correctly and looking through them, you can adjust your horzontal aim to compensate for any vehicle dislocation caused by the double-guns immense recoil. The first volley is practise rounds, basically tracers. The subsequent four double-shots are live ammunition with substantial recoil. The two rotatron arrays allow for the guns to be aimed both horizontally and vertically, without the wobbliness that would come with the use of hinges.\n\nOh, and did I mention the unseemly fate of those soldiers who would waste this glorious army\\\u0027s valuable munitions? After the tracer volley and the four live projectiles, the pilots are duty-bound to die honourably. Should they merely have missed despite their best attempts to destroy their target, their final task will be to ram their foe and dispatch them in that manner. Should they just shoot willy-nilly, however, and waste ammunition without even counting - then they will surely trigger the Mobile Artillery Vehicle\\\u0027s disciplinary apparatus.\n\nWhich is to say, the sixth shot blows the whole vehicle to smithereens. The honourable death would be to do so on top of the enemy, of course...but trigger-happy kerbals will find themselves going boom on the spot when they try to shoot once too often.\n\nNow, say it with me: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!\n\nEdit: Now with actual image."},{"CreatedByName":"royalkingofgames","CreatedById":23658,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-06T21:12:38Z","Content":"what kind of fool would volunteer for that \n\n\u003E \n\u003E A Kerbal ;P"},{"CreatedByName":"mockingking","CreatedById":6738,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-08T13:03:19Z","Content":"Apparently, the Kerbs have learned that Service in the Mobile Artillery is not the most humane of tasks.

The proud mainstay of the mobile Artillery! The LIGHT ARTILLERY TRUCK!\n\n\u003E ![scaled.php?server=4\u0026filename=screenshot4if.png\u0026res=landing](http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg4/scaled.php?server=4\u0026filename=screenshot4if.png\u0026res=landing)\n\nI had a lot more designs, some scarily big yet effective, some carrying as many as twenty-for guns. But I had to cull the part folder a bit, and those are no longer usable.\n\nAnyways, let\\\u0027s look into the ways of the Mobile Artillery, using the near-perfect LIGHT ARTILLERY TRUCK as our example.\n\nThe LIGHT ARTILLERY TRUCK is armed with only a single Devastator Railgun and four live shells, but its light yet solid construction gives it excellent accuracy. The gun turret can rotate 360\u00C2\u00B0 and tilt from 0\u00C2\u00B0 to 90\u00C2\u00B0. This means that the LAT cannot engage low-profile targets in its immediate vicinity; but if something is that close, then you can always just ram it. Or use the SUNBEAM LASERs, but that\\\u0027s cheating.\n\nThe eight CLAWs around its truck chassis prevent it from toppling over when driving, and can be thrust into the ground for stability and to elevate the whole structure, allowing the operator to aim above obstacles (Like a runway). It can do 30 m/s with relative safety, provided that one is careful on rough terrain, in curves, and when braking. The CLAWs can be used to bring the vehicle to an immediate standstill.\n\nIn front of the Gun Turret is the Target Acquisition Systems Turret. It too can rotate 360\u00C2\u00B0, although aiming at 6 o\\\u0027clock does not work on account of the gun turret being in the way. Its double SUMBEAM lasers work to indicate the direction in which the shell will fly, serving as crosshairs when viewed through the Camera attachment. The LAZOR unit works the same way, with the added bonus of identifying targets and giving on-target camera view options. Using the SUNBEAM\\\u0027s auto-targeting function and aligning the LAZOR with them furthermore adds the option of highly accurate horizontal aiming even at longer ranges. Compensating for vertical drop requires manual input, though.\n\nTo demonstrate: Pictures.\n\nThe LAT with both SUNBEAMs and LAZOR activated.\n\n\u003E ![scaled.php?server=21\u0026filename=screenshot6bn.png\u0026res=landing](http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg21/scaled.php?server=21\u0026filename=screenshot6bn.png\u0026res=landing)\n\nFirst person camera view, taking manual aim at an MGP. Note the On-Target Camera display confirming the aim\\\u0027s accuracy.\n\n\u003E ![scaled.php?server=84\u0026filename=screenshot7xx.png\u0026res=landing](http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg84/scaled.php?server=84\u0026filename=screenshot7xx.png\u0026res=landing)\n\nUsing the SUNBEAM auto-targeting feature on a nearby ATT. Note how the SUNBEAM aims lower than the turrets\\\u0027 minimum elevation.\n\n\u003E ![scaled.php?server=803\u0026filename=screenshot8lh.png\u0026res=landing](http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg803/scaled.php?server=803\u0026filename=screenshot8lh.png\u0026res=landing)\n\nFrom the last picture\\\u0027s position, firing a shell. You can see it explode behind the ATT, as well as how the LAZOR indicates that, due to recoil, our aim is now off and requires readjustment.\n\n\u003E ![scaled.php?server=525\u0026filename=screenshot9ln.png\u0026res=landing](http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg525/scaled.php?server=525\u0026filename=screenshot9ln.png\u0026res=landing)\n\nSwitching the Auto-Targeting to the MGP, and trying to aim the LAZOR (and, with it, the Devastator) at it.\n\n\u003E ![scaled.php?server=151\u0026filename=screenshot10q.png\u0026res=landing](http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg151/scaled.php?server=151\u0026filename=screenshot10q.png\u0026res=landing)\n\nMissing the first shot because it went too high.\n\n\u003E ![scaled.php?server=100\u0026filename=screenshot11i.png\u0026res=landing](http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg100/scaled.php?server=100\u0026filename=screenshot11i.png\u0026res=landing)\n\nHaving retracted the CLAWs, missing the last shot because it was too low. Not how the explosion is visible in the On-Target Camera, proving that it was quite close.\n\n\u003E ![scaled.php?server=195\u0026filename=screenshot12qy.png\u0026res=landing](http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg195/scaled.php?server=195\u0026filename=screenshot12qy.png\u0026res=landing)\n\nThis also demonstrates the LAT\\\u0027s primary weakness: While multi-gun setups only need to hit the approximate location of the target thanks to their large are of effect, a single-gun LAT needs to hit the target dead on, or at least the ground right below it.\n\nAnd to round it off, here is the Gemini Multi-Gun Tilting Artillery Platform. It\\\u0027s still under development, since it requires more top-mounted firepower to give it a less horizontal and more triangular firing pattern, but it works quite nicely. The dual-truck setup on VTOL hinges gives it twice the stability of Tilt Platform types carried by a single vehicle, and its wide shot pattern compensates for the lack of horizontal rotation options. The heavy recoil makes CLAW-based recoil absorption impossible, so instead you simply need to drive around to readjust the horizontal aim.\n\n\u003E ![screenshot13q.png](http://img835.imageshack.us/img835/2130/screenshot13q.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"royalkingofgames","CreatedById":23658,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-08T18:27:44Z","Content":"winner of artillery see if you can build atank"},{"CreatedByName":"mockingking","CreatedById":6738,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-08T23:06:44Z","Content":"That...won\\\u0027t work.
