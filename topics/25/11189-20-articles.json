The take off weight is 205.43 tons with a 37.82 ton payload. The first prototype had to few and to narrow wheel base to be able to land, second one had to little Delta V and the 3:e had drag problems causing instability when reentering Kerbins atmosphere at 4000m/s\u002B.\n\nThis is the last prototype and the only slight problem that I had expected was center of gravity moved backwards enough for it to go nose gear up when coming to a stop on Kerbin but that was easily fixed by moving the landing gears backwards and had no effect on the take off speed.\n\nThe game runs at about 0.5x real time with 1200\u002B parts on an overclocked i7 processor so I have speed the video up to 2x to make it more pleasant to watch but its perfectly flyable and I usually have 0.5x rendering time any way even with 80 parts probably due to bugs with planet renderings.\n\nIts important to keep the number of engines down to reduce lag. They are a big source of lag on crafts with many parts when the smoke is rendered so a lot of wings is actually faster and more efficient and also lots of intakes to. Hopefully intakes will be remade by the devs so we don\u0027t need to resort to intake abuse sens real high speed crafts don\u0027t have problems with air intake amount but rather the velocity of the flow and how hot the intake air gets at high Mach numbers causing engine damaged but a heat exchanger would solve that and they have been developed IRL and are under testing for the Skylon SSTO spaceplane.\n\nThe craft uses Two Jumbo tanks and two small 360L oxidizer tanks (plus fuel) and 16x 150L Fuel tanks for the jets. 14x jet engines and 8x NV-1 Nervas supply\u0027s the thrust.\n\nDrag parachutes helps reducing speed to avoid overshooting good landing sites sens the craft has so much mass and high lift it can glide very fare with out thrust at high speeds.\n\nA payload can also be loaded on to the craft even on Kerbin. I have tested with the 37.82T benchmark payload and it docked fine after some maneuvering so its perfectly possible to retrieve cargo in theory at least from other planets.\n\nIt might be able to go to Laythe at least I hope but I have not have time to test yet. The oxygen atmosphere and low gravity should make that possible if theres enough fuel in the Jumbo tanks that can be transfered to the jet engines fuel tanks. Alternatively the small oxygen/fuel fuel tanks can be replaced with pure fuel tanks to increase the fuel to oxygen ratio. Finding a big and flat landing site is a problem tough.\n\n![screenshot425.png](http://imageshack.us/a/img5/336/screenshot425.png)\n\n![screenshot460n.png](http://imageshack.us/a/img844/7305/screenshot460n.png)\n\n![screenshot464m.png](http://imageshack.us/a/img266/2215/screenshot464m.png)\n\n![screenshot517.png](http://imageshack.us/a/img836/412/screenshot517.png)\n\n![screenshot520v.png](http://imageshack.us/a/img708/5143/screenshot520v.png)\n\n![screenshot542.png](http://imageshack.us/a/img221/7846/screenshot542.png)\n\n![screenshot550.png](http://imageshack.us/a/img507/9477/screenshot550.png)\n\n![screenshot561b.png](http://imageshack.us/a/img694/293/screenshot561b.png)\n\n![screenshot574.png](http://imageshack.us/a/img46/1599/screenshot574.png)\n\n![screenshot586.png](http://imageshack.us/a/img541/1699/screenshot586.png)\n\n![screenshot589q.png](http://imageshack.us/a/img201/6439/screenshot589q.png)\n\n![screenshot591.png](http://imageshack.us/a/img405/9919/screenshot591.png)\n\n![screenshot601.png](http://imageshack.us/a/img259/2168/screenshot601.png)\n\n![screenshot607.png](http://imageshack.us/a/img507/3534/screenshot607.png)\n\n![screenshot608y.png](http://imageshack.us/a/img69/1476/screenshot608y.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-22T14:46:11Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2013 02:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by pa1983**"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-22T14:17:26Z","Content":"You... are amazing....\n\nHere\u0027s my 19.0 design....Called the Belle I\n\n[![screenshot352.png](http://s24.postimg.org/65suxkq5h/screenshot352.png)](http://postimage.org/)\n\n[![screenshot354.png](http://s24.postimg.org/t8jdwqrmt/screenshot354.png)](http://postimage.org/)\n\n[![screenshot355.png](http://s24.postimg.org/4gjrpiag5/screenshot355.png)](http://postimage.org/)\n\n[![screenshot373.png](http://s24.postimg.org/egeo5elph/screenshot373.png)](http://postimage.org/)\n\nIt is mun capable, I did however miss KSC and landed somewhere close...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-22T14:20:59Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2013 02:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by zekes**"},{"CreatedByName":"admiralducksauce","CreatedById":59778,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T12:57:08Z","Content":"After many (many, many) attempts, I finally got an SSTO, the Hot Dog II, into orbit, docked with my space station, then back down to Kerbin.
