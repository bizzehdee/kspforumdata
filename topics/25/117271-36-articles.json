That usually isn\u0027t enough elevator to keep a plane flying unless it\u0027s balanced to the pixel (CL inside the CG sphere. A touchy balance in the best of planes).\n\nThe problem with box planes like the video portrayed or tubular fins (if you\u0027re into rocketry) is the tubes only allow so much air to pass thru them (like Alphasus was hinting at) and at a certain speed, the tubes cannot pass anymore air. So air piles in front of the tubes and you essentially have a brick wall or enough air pressure at the front of the tube to overcome the air trying to rush in, and it spills over. That\u0027s where the drag really hits tubular fins or box planes (they\u0027re essentially the same thing).\n\nThere was some supersonic tube fin testing done by the British in the late 1950\u0027s to early 1960\u0027s and it basically ended up that if one ran a cone that had a 3 degree taper, smaller end at the front and bigger end at the back, there would be sufficient vacuum at the rear of the tube that it would suck any air that would build up at the front, hence allowing more air to enter the tube fin assembly. Unfortunately they also concluded that the tube fin is not suitable for supersonic flight due to shock waves bouncing inside the tube, creating more pressure fronts, blocking more air, and eventually the tube fin self destructed from over pressurization.\n\nThat\u0027s where Grid Fins come in. They are really REALLY bad at drag in the subsonic to transonic region, but when they are exposed to supersonic air velocities, the shock waves don\u0027t build up because the thickness of the Grid Fin is so small. They are very good at low drag for supersonic flight (some missiles have grid fins, as well as bombs that are deployed at supersonic velocities).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-12T03:58:49Z\u0022 title=\u002209/12/2015 03:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GDJ**"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T03:51:27Z","Content":"Some points worth noting on the box design compared to the other designs:\n\n1) it had much more lifting area, which would have made it much more maneuverable.\n\n2) it had much more in the way of control surfaces, which would have made it more maneuverable.\n\n3) it appears to have the CoL closer to the CoM, which would have certainly made it more maneuverable.\n\n4) it had 3x as much engine, which would have made all the extra drag from the extra wing area irrelevant.\n\n5) wing area in virtually every direction ensures that it has some extra protection for deflection shots.\n\n6) using multiple parts for the wings ensures that damage at one location doesn\u0027t wipe out a large wing part, ensuring that damage is minor.\n\n7) keeping everything close together ensures that for minor damage that doesn\u0027t destroy a part, heat can quickly dissipate throughout the vehicle, effectively nullifying all of the damage.\n\nIt is a well designed vehicle that is clearly optimized wrt stock\u0027s aero model and BDArmory\u0027s heat-damage model, as well as being able to get guns on target to force the enemy AI to go into evasive maneuvers and become less of a threat.
