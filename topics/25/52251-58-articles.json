The old version of KW Rocketry is still installed, but no KW parts are used in this ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKey design concepts and considerations for this ship:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 1. Atomic power. LV-Ns and RTGs are used as much as possible in the design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 2. Fewer stages. When departing from LKO the Milne consists of two main stages, rather than the four main stages of KABOOM\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s previous effort, the Jool Explorer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 3. No Kessler syndrome. If all goes according to plan, no empty fuel tanks or other debris will be jettisoned into space during the trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 4. Two or more roles for major systems. Most major systems have at least two roles to play during the trip. For example, the kethane scanning probes are fitted with LV-Ns, and are oriented and attached to the Milne so that the LV-Ns can serve as part of the drive section during flight, rather than simply being dead weight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 5. Stock parts. All parts, with the exception of MechJeb and a few pieces of kethane equipment, are stock. I wanted to challenge myself a bit, and see how far I can go without any significant mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 6. Better names. The previous Jool Explorer had generic names for its parts, such as the tanker section and the lander. In keeping with the Milne\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s name, all designations are taken from A.A. Milne\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s classic Winnie the Pooh books. The two main parts are Pooh Bear (the lander) and Eeyore (the tanker). Parts of Eeyore can undock and become their own craft, with designations of Kanga, Roo, Piglet, Christopher Robin, Tigger, and Alexander Beetle. The lifter, doing all the work of pushing Pooh and company into orbit and then crashing back down to Kerbin, is Rabbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 7. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s all about Pooh Bear. Pooh Bear is the heart of the Milne, and consists of almost 100 tons of KABOOM\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s best engineering efforts. A stout and helpful craft, Pooh Bear is equipped with 8 LV-Ns and 4 LVT-30s, and serves as the main drive section of the Milne when docked to Eeyore. When undocked, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a 2-man universal SSTO lander. It can function as a tug, reconfiguring Eeyore\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s modules as needed. When carrying Owl (the mobile lab), it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a science gathering machine. When landed, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a kethane miner with two drills and a converter, so it can refuel itself as long as it lands on a kethane deposit. When carrying the Hunny Pot (a supplemental 18-ton fuel tank), it functions as a tanker that can bring more than 40 tons of fuel back to Eeyore per trip, at least when returning from Pol, Bop, or Vall. When carrying the supplemental hitchhiker (as it will on the trip home) it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a roomy interplanetary craft with two seats per kerbal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 8. Some efficiency has been sacrificed in favor of playability. The design uses fewer larger parts when possible to reduce part count and lag, even though it comes with a mass penalty (such as using a few Z-4K batteries instead of dozens of massless Z-400s). Both Pooh Bear and Eeyore are fitted with reaction wheels. To reduce burn times, the fully assembled Milne has 12 LV-Ns and 4 LVT-30s. TWR is 0.23 in nuclear mode, and 0.48 if the LVT-30s are also fired up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 9. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re going to leave a presence behind. Much of Eeyore can undock and become multiple independent craft. If everything goes according to plan, the Milne will leave manned fuel depots in equatorial orbits around every moon, a kethane scanner/science satellite in polar orbits around four of the moons, and a small science satellite around Jool itself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 10. Modular design. There are lots of docking ports, allowing multiple configurations for both Pooh and Eeyore. The five orbital fuel depots can be docked together to make one large station instead of 5 small ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 11. Rockets only. KABOOM is focused on rockets. No planes, rovers, boats, or jet engines are included in the Milne\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 12. Future-friendly. Putting fuel depots in orbit around each moon, each with room for three more kerbals, should aid in future Jool exploration and colonization efforts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 13. Nobody is stranded. Each manned fuel depot has enough Delta V, thrust, and parachutes to make it successfully back to Kerbin. They can also land and become minimalist ground bases on every moon except Tylo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 14. Real-life testing. No hyperedit advance testing at the actual locations, only a few reverts and a real launch with testing on and around Kerbin, the Mun, and Minmus. Although the test launch cost 1.1 million funds, 25% of that was recovered from many of the parts landing near KSC. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 15. A smaller ship. The previous Jool Explorer was 860 tons when it departed LKO. The Milne is 335 tons, less than half the weight. In spite of this, the new ship will be leaving behind a much larger presence in the Jool system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 16. Minimal landing gear. This may be a bit gamey, but Pooh Bear has only been fitted with a few landing struts for stability, with the bulk of the weight resting directly on the 8 LV-Ns instead. The ship\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s design made it difficult to attach enough struts to support a 100 ton ship, and the LV-Ns have an impact tolerance of 12 m/s, rather than the usual 6 or 7 for most parts. Testing shows that it works - with half a load of fuel on board, Pooh Bear landed at Kerbin on flattish ground at 8 m/s without incident. It was also able to drill and fully refuel on the Mun while carrying the Hunny Pot (its heaviest and most unstable mode) on a 15 degree slope, also without incident.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Chapters will be posted as they occur -I\u0027ll update my sig once I have enough for a real gallery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/gKYFe\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

So I used the same technique.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI decided that 6 panels are enough and a lot of batteries can hold the maximum thrust when the panels are not at 100%. In fact, I had about 300 m/s on the dark side too from the batteries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd my mission plan was to skip Eve and Duna, because I have made some experimental landing attempt at Duna and it seemed impossible. But during the fuel planning I always added 10-20% to the steps, just to be sure. And when I arrived to Duna I have decided that I have enough fuel to get back to the spare fuel at Kerbin after a Duna landing too...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso I made about 15-20 landing attempt until I found the best initial fuel amount because too much made the lander too heavy and unable to slow before touchdown, too little made the landing sure but getting back to the ship impossible... I also had to find the best trajectory which use the most of the fine aerobraking in the atmosphere and the best vertical decent speed which can be stopped just at the peak of the mountain. It was big fun and a huge achievement at last when I was able to get back to orbit and also to dock with the main pod again!!! This meant that I can call this mission an almost Grand Tour! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yeah, I enjoyed building the initial pictures for the mission too... there is an \u0022easter egg\u0022 in them too \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Norcalplanner\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Norcalplanner\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EReally elegant, Ziv.
