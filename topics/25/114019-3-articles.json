I made some slight modifications to it to give it a little less drag. This was basically just getting rid of a wing plate and an unnecessary structural fuselage segment among other minor things. I was able to accomplish a manually flown circumnav a few seconds under 45 minutes stopping the watch at a full halt after landing back at the KSC runway; however, don\u0027t take my word for it as any kind of entry - this is all just in the interest of conversation.\n\nOne variant I made of it can hold a consistent 1,700 m/s (give or take a few m/s depending on fuel levels which can affect angle of attack and thus drag) and at about 20 - 22 km altitude. It\u0027s nothing very special or innovative relative to the current field in this challenge - just a matter of good thrust to drag ratio and reasonably well composed layout for functionality and ease of handling. I did some math for a rough calculation of what kind of circumnav time 1,700 m/s would give me if that speed was maintained non-stop to give a sort of idea of the time barrier I\u0027d have: (3,770,000 meters)/(1,700 m/s) = 2,217 seconds of flight = 37 minutes. Once I figure in time spent accelerating, ascending, slowing down for a landing, etc., I\u0027d be hard pressed to exceed the 40 minute record that currently stands despite having an almost identical cruising speed. To optimize your ascent and time your descent in such a way as to come so close to that 37 minute limit deserves, at the very least, a tip of the hat.\n\nI\u0027m fairly certain after a decent amount of experimentation that 1,700 m/s at around 20 - 22 km is the sweet spot for high speed rapier aircraft - and this is at least partially confirmed by Xannari\u0027s craft. Go any higher, and you begin to slow a bit due to less intake air and therefore less thrust. Go any lower, below 19 km or so, and you start to risk exploding due to too much heat - that is, if you\u0027re keeping it pegged out and you exceed the aforementioned speed via more intake air and thrust.\n\nNow, if we get some people doing some really creative and clever clipping techniques, we may begin to see something in a substantial excess of that air speed.. and that of course is a feat in and of itself that accomplishes, if nothing else, \u0022the best number\u0022. However, I will be truly amazed if I see a design that exceeds a cruising speed for the bulk of the circumnav of, say, 1,750 m/s and doesn\u0027t owe the significant cruising speed improvement mostly to a part hiding trick that reduces drag, overlaps engines, fuel, etc.\n\nSo, I was thinking... what if... in addition to the best of the best one upping each other by a matter of petty minutes or seconds (for the \u0022fastest time\u0022 seekers) in the challenge, what if we added a sub-category of the competition that introduces a new dimension in which creativity, piloting skill, and engineering have even more free roam? I\u0027ll give an idea for it, although we can brainstorm others. How\u0027s this one:\n\n1. All the rules are the same, except the following.\n\n2. You may use any engine you\u0027d like.\n\n3. You may exceed 30 kilometers.\n\n4. You may use engineering and autopilot tools.\n\nMy thinking there is it would be a lot of fun to play around with a lot of the other parts, add in some interesting re-entry situations, sub orbital trajectory strategies, and maybe even make a good chunk of the circumnav more digestible and less grueling for a lot of the would-be participants. As far as the badge goes for it, perhaps a simple image edit would suffice for the \u0022Sub Orbital Division\u0022 as it might be called. That is, if it was popular enough to warrant a distinguished badge.\n\nI wouldn\u0027t want to in any way impede the fun that\u0027s being had for fast times within the existing rules - and of course don\u0027t want to take away from the \u0022spirit\u0022 of the competition. All I\u0027m wanting to see is what I think could be an exciting new dimension to this competition that I think would be a natural evolution of it ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) To add to, but not take away from.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T07:37:26Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 07:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MunGazer**\n  \ngrammar :P"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T15:56:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E As far as the badge goes for it, perhaps a simple image edit would suffice for the \u0022Sub Orbital Division\u0022 as it might be called.

I *think..* it still might be kind of like saying how many times can I dribble the basket ball before I shoot the 3 pointer, you know? For the standard atmospheric jet engine circumnavigations, it\u0027s definitely a challenging thing because you\u0027re dealing with huge fuel efficiency considerations and what not.
