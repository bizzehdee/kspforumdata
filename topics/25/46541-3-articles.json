(5.7 tons more were in the turbojet engines, 4.2 tons were in the escape engines and associated electrical systems, 4.18 ton were in Argon fuel tanks- though as I\u0027ve said, these are only marginally denser than structural fuselages- and the other almost 10 tons were the wings, control surfaces, air intakes, landing gears, wing engine mounts, and a small heat radiator)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CvmWZFj.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CvmWZFj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt flew, but turned out to be a lag machine of death on my weak computer (it had 92 parts). After making it to its peak cruising altitude of 30,250 meters; and max landspeed of 1,080 m/s; I spent a good while dolphining about my maximum cruising altitude, trying to see if I could cruise any higher, and building up as much speed as I could. Then, just as I was about to start my escape burn, I got a really bad lag spike, and the game ended up drastically overexaggerating a minor course correction (I was holding \u0022A\u0022 at the time of the lag spike)- leading to the craft entering an unrecoverable tailspin and my reverting the flight... And wasting over an hour and a half of my time (recorded flight time was less than that- but lag slowed the passage of time significantly).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERather than try THAT again, I\u0027ve followed one of the allowances made here, and fused some parts. Well, sort of. Not exactly sure how to fuse my ten Arg-100 fuel tanks into a giant one, or even fuse two or four together; instead I upscaled the longer variant of 1.25 meter Argon tank by a factor of 2, and increased its mass and resource capacity by 8-fold to match (you get four times the cross-sectional area and twice the length when you upscale 1:2 like that). Essentially, I created a long 2.5 meter argon tank- and after increasing its joint strength to match the other 2.5 meter argon tank (2.5 meter parts normally have four times the joint-strength of 1.25 meter parts, according to the other configs I examined: apparently to match their four times greater cross-section), and giving it a clever description of its own, here is the part- and a WIP on my Mk3 of the Advance Spaceplane in the background:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CFGr6sR.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CFGr6sR.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this is allowed- I did it to save part count and lag, though I also found that the upscaled part did not fall precisely into the normal 1:2:4 length ratios of 2.5 meter parts- instead falling in at between 3.3 and 3.8 times the length of the short 2.5 meter variant that NearFuture mod already had (it doesn\u0027t have any longer 2.5 meter tanks than the Arg-100\u0027s I had previously used- or I would have just used them).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the longer fuel tanks, I was able to safely extend my fuselage a little longer still without making the part count too high for my computer. I also eliminated all small wing components I could (even though they often have a better lift:mass ratio than the larger wing components- the tiny little Heavy Control Winglet I liked using so much in my previous designs in particular has the best ratio in the B9 Aerospace/Firespitter/Novapunch2 set of mods I am using), instead opting for the larger winglets to try and provide the necessary control. Here is what I\u0027ve come up with so far for a Mk3- though I don\u0027t know if it will fly as well as the Mk2 (which, if not for lag, *certainly* could have made orbit) given all the tiny wing parts I skipped out on that I normally use to fine-tune and optimize my designs...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RknsXsj.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RknsXsj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese spaceplane designs are getting unimaginably long, and past a certain point in scaling them up I\u0027m just going to be better off with an LFO-propelled escape system (the minimum weight with which I can build such a system is getting to be only slightly higher than my increasingly large Argon-based systems).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, much more of this and I\u0027m just going to abandon the SSTDABK spaceplane idea entirely- it\u0027s good enough just to strap a couple of my smaller planes to a rocket and send them to Duna that way...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry to keep spamming the posts here. Geschosskopf, let me know if I\u0027m allowed to upscale an argon fuel-tank like that, as long as I upscale the mass and all those other parameters to match- as you said in the rules fusing parts are allowed. I did my best to ensure I wasn\u0027t changing the balance at all from just using a bunch of the Arg-100\u0027s in a row (or a quad-adapter and a bunch of the Arg-10\u0027s, more precisely in this case) If it\u0027s not allowed, I\u0027ll be a very sad puppy, of course- it\u0027s not my fault my computer is pathetically weak (even on my current 54-part Mk3 design, I expect a lot of lag.

Instead, at least in flight tests on Kerbin, it keeps gradually raising its altitude, and raising its periapsis instead- always near peak altitude- and keeping just barely enough thrust for the wings to keep it climbing very slowly. Its TWR is so low that it is incapable of reaching an actual ballistic trajectory- it can never climb much faster than 10-25 m/s. Technically, it\u0027s a super-high altitude plane with the plasma thrusters engaged: and simply is capable of flying at the very edge of the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...

There ARE 2.5 meter Argon tanks- all I did was create a *stretched* variant equivalent to using several end-to-end by up-sizing one of the long 1.25 meter tanks so I wouldn\u0027t have to use literally 10 of the short 2.5 meter tanks normally found in the mod end-to-end. I haven\u0027t changed the ratio of ArgonGas to mass- so it\u0027s essentially the same thing as my design using *TEN* Arg-100\u0027s (the tanks already found in the NearFuture mod) stacked end to end. As I showed in the first screenshot, I actually designed such a craft using TEN of only the Arg-100\u0027s stacked end-to end, and it flies great except for the lag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you didn\u0027t notice, I\u0027ve been using 2.5 meter Argon tanks since the beginning- and none of these designs until the latest one included up-sized or in any way altered parts. The mod *DOES* come with a short 2.5 meter Argon tank- which suits my purposes just fine, except for the lag it creates when using a crazy number of them...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, with the clarification, are you OK with this? The difference between welding short fuel tanks, and welding solar panels, is that 2.5 meter fuel tanks can\u0027t simply be upsized to create longer versions, as they aren\u0027t flat and have three dimensions- and you\u0027ll just end up creating a 3.75 meter version instead (I actually did this by accident when trying to create a stretched 2.5 meter version, and kept the mistake for future Argon depots- though I definitely won\u0027t be using it in this challenge as it wouln\u0027t be legit). So you have to take a smaller version with the desired ratio of radius to length, and upsize it. That\u0027s the only way I know of to create a stretched version of the 2.5 meter tank *already found in the mod* at the moment. Once again, using four of the longer tanks is exactly the same as using about 15-16 of the Arg-100\u0027s stacked end to end (I made the fuslage a little longer after I could safely do it without adding too much lag.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the clarification, are you OK with this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf not, I\u0027d be more than happy to simply fuse 16 of the 2.5 meter Arg-100\u0027s already found in the mod end-to-end (it would reduce my part count even further- I still have to use four of the almost quadruple-length tanks in my fuselage for my current design) if somebody could show me how.

It\u0027s well below 2500 meters though (about 350), so to meet the challenge requirements I\u0027ll have to take off again and land somewhere higher... Maybe near the face?

I\u0027m pretty sure, form what I read on the Kethane Traveling Circus about the D\u0027OH, that the only reason you started off landing at above 2500 meters is that you couldn\u0027t find a good Kethane field at a lower altitude. I\u0027m not mining for Kethane (at least not yet- I might try installing the mod in the future), so I\u0027m really not limited by such concerns. And as I said, I managed to find a much lower landing field with a probe, purely by accident. I\u0027m also pretty sure the area below 2500 meters isn\u0027t very large (it\u0027s a depression at the end of a valley)- so that\u0027s probably why you couldn\u0027t find it on your orbitally-constructed map of the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll post an image of the proposed landing site, just so we\u0027re clear, in a second (I\u0027ve currently got my Mk3 of the Advanced Spaceplane on ascent in the background for another attempt at escaping Kerbin.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf worst comes to worst (I\u0027m horrible at lining up landings anyways), I\u0027ll probably just have to make a really careful landing on hilly ground. The spaceplane is perfectly capable of taking a bumpy landing- the problem comes when she tries to take off again, and is accelerating into the bumps- as the wings start bouncing off the bumps at an increasingly fast rate unless I cut the throttle (they have landing gears on them, so the impacts don\u0027t break them). This might take a bit more skill and patience on my part, but I\u0027m sure she can get off the ground again after landing too (though, for the reasons mentioned above, she might be best off with a \u0022ski jump\u0022 style takeoff at low throttle, kind of like the D\u0027OH)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried a welding utility- but it didn\u0027t work.

Obviously, 1 long solid part would be much less likely to fail under thrust and landing impacts than an equal length made of multiple parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the D\u0027OH, I welded the solar panels on the upper wings (actually, AncientGammoner did it for me). These are not structural parts so no problem there, and in fact the welding made the plane more vulnerable to damage because the same impact could destroy the entire group of panels instead of just the 1 hit. But doing this did drop the part count by 46, which was a big help with framerate. This is an example of legal welding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only flat areas I\u0027m aware of are very low altitude, like you found here. At 2500m and above, there aren\u0027t any big patches of flat ground. Sometimes you\u0027ll find a dune with a relatively flat top a few hundred meters wide but that\u0027s it. Otherwise it\u0027s either all sand dunes or mountains. Check out the map of Duna at KSP Maps here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalmaps.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.kerbalmaps.com/\u003C/a\u003E. In the upper right corner, hit the layers tab and select \u0022colored relief\u0022. The resulting map is basically 3 shades of brown. The darkest areas are too low and the lighter the color, the higher the ground. 2500m-ish areas are the sort of medium-dark brown. Mouse over the map and it\u0027ll show the elevation under the cursor in the lower left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENope. Rule 7: Must land at 2500m directly from entering the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, so I can\u0027t use lengthened fuel tanks because of reduced structural failures- that\u0027s kind of fair if it was a 1.25 meter fuselage like the Eagle, but 2.5 meter fuselages aren\u0027t very prone to structural failures under the kind of forces they are subjected to here- because they have 4 times the joint strength of 1.25 meter fuselages... So it really wouldn\u0027t improve the structural stability in the relevant force ranges. Plus, longer tanks are actually MORE likely to break, because of the higher torques they experience due to the inflexibility of the thing- using 16 short 2.5 meter fuselages I would be much LESS likely to experience a structural failure than using my 4 long 2.5 meter fuselages. The shorter the components the fuselages is made of, the more capability it has to bend without breaking in a spaceplane... Think of it as the difference between trying to break a twig, and break a bendy-straw... (unlike in a rocket- where shorter fuselages lead to less structural stability, due to the tendency for them to \u0022pop\u0022 out of alignment with the rest- like happened to the joints next to one of the shortest components of one of my Eagle Mk2\u0027s during ascent on a rocket...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the landing zone, once again, didn\u0027t you only land at that altitude because that\u0027s where your Kethane field was? It\u0027s not that I can\u0027t land at 2500 meters, I\u0027m just saying, why ask everyone else to replicate something you did purely for practical reasons? There are plenty of low-lying areas on that map as I see it...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETechnically the Kerbals aren\u0027t dead, but \u0022Missing in Action\u0022- nobody actually SAW them hitting the ground (and, in fact, the cockpit section that fell off most likely would have splashed down at less than its impact tolerance of 45 m/s in the ocean I was currently over- as I saw precisely this same structural failure in an earlier launch attempt, and the cockpit would glide along doing loop-de-loops thanks to its attached wings, until it landed at about 20 m/s- yet he probably drowned anyways since nobody saw where he landed. The guy in the service module was surely a goner on the other hand.)- but I\u0027m sure that doesn\u0027t matter to their poor Kerbal families... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was for a good cause though! Soon, 4 Kerbals will ride down to the surface of Duna on my undamaged Eagle Mk2. The Advanced Spaceplane, on the other hand, may have to be delayed indefinitely due to reasons of lag if I\u0027m not allowed to use the longer 2.5 meter fuselages I created... Which I consider kind of unfair- because the strength or weakness of your computer really isn\u0027t supposed to be part of the challenge... (Even currently, with 8 fewer parts thanks to the longer argon tanks, and a part count of 60, the lag is almost unacceptable- and 8 parts more would push it over the edge. The 92 part version I launched with ten 2.5 meter argon tanks and a bunch more control surfaces earlier was so laggy I\u0027m not sure I would have ever been able to land it...)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-20T01:18:49Z\u0022 title=\u002211/20/2013 01:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-20T01:53:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUpdate:... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/i50oS\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
