They never ask for anything more than to be able to provide assistance to get our brave Kerbonauts into space in (mostly) one piece.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecently, they haven\u0027t been getting any help, and are starting to grow ragged and tired. This is affecting their work, and the higher ups are plotting replacing them. Unfortunately, when Irwina Kerbolo was cleaning out the offices at night, she saw the notes they had left behind, and informed her coworkers. Now they\u0027re on strike. This means, that for the foreseeable future, there cannot be any more launches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat this means, is that we must take on their responsibilities until the management sorts out the demands being made of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour goal now is to build crafts capable of bringing a rocket from the various areas of the complex, and assemble it on the rocket launchpad. Any crafts are allowed, as well as any mods. The rocket must be capable of at least Low Kerbin Orbit, with the ability to land back on the planet safely. The number of stages aren\u0027t important, and you can have as many as you wish. The only stipulation being that the stages actually be useful. This includes stages composed entirely of physics exploiting bugs, such as stack decouplers arranged to create force to achieve orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoints will not be awarded, nor tracked. Since this is just a challenge to test your building skills and your creativity, the fact that you can accomplish this goal will be the achievement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will update an achievement board, including the names of all those who are able to complete the challenge. Very few things will disqualify you from this, as I am aware it may be required that you install one or more mods. I will not include crafts that use the exploits in the KSP physics, such as infinigliders, or other such things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, to prove that it can be done, this is my entry, the Behemoth:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Mz0lz\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
