If you\\\u0027re using multiple engines (which makes pure VTOL craft easier and lets you carry more fuel), it becomes very difficult once you\\\u0027re low enough on fuel that the engine cuts out before reaching a nice safe descent-power setting. Not so much an issue with this (just have a big enough tank to provide ballast, or a single engine with enough weight), but it can be an issue on some craft.
