You can get about 1 km/s initial speed with only 6 decouplers, 2 km/s with 12 decouplers, etc. The problem is getting rid of the probe core. If the probe is decoupled at the same time as the main decouplers, the whole thing fizzes out. If it\u0027s decoupled right after, the decoupler somehow gets stuck to the RCS craft and raises its drag so that it doesn\u0027t work well. I\u0027ve tried a bunch of different configurations, but that decoupler just doesn\u0027t want to come off.

I designed a build method that allows for a 1.5 ratio of decouplers to octo-struts. Unfortunately, it -still- doesn\u0027t work well. I can use 200 decouplers (about as much as my computer can handle, the load times get very bad) to launch a probe core straight up, but in ten seconds it\u0027s slowed to just a few hundred m/s, and it\u0027s only 10 km up. Unfortunately, drag reduction doesn\u0027t seem to work under current KSP physics. Using a low-drag manned cockpit leaves you with way too much mass, and you can\u0027t attach anything to the probe core to reduce drag because the astounding impulse of launch tears off anything with mass (fun fact, struts and the tiny 0.001 mass blocks don\u0027t actually have mass, despite what the game says) (and no, it doesn\u0027t tear it off at mach ten, the part reaches some reasonably high speed, tears off, and leaves the rest of the ship to continue accelerating).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn conclusion: There\u0027s no way to reduce your drag, so the magic atmosphere will prevent this method from being effective here.
