So (mass returned to Kerbin surface)\u00A0/ (mass of the initial ship \u002Bfuel\u00A0in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E), with 1 being a perfect score. Though given my\u00A0trial run I\u0027ll\u00A0probably scale it up by a factor of 1000. I\u0027m getting some small numbers.\u00A0 One slight variant that I\u0027m think of is (mass returned to Kerbin surface) / (total mass from Kerbin surface). Simple, no fuss, no muss scoring.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had toyed with idea of straight number of kerbals multiplier. But, since hauling around kerbals is cheap, it is an easy way to crank up the score. So perhaps a multiplier of (capacity for kerbals)/(number of kerbals)? Still a bit easy to run up but not as easy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nComments/suggestions?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daveroski","CreatedById":93896,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-30T17:27:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could always score on [REDACTED]\u00A0 or even [REDACTED]\u00A0 but if anyone [REDACTED]\u00A0 then you can [REDACTED]\u00A0 all of their [REDACTED] \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tseitsei89","CreatedById":162979,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-30T18:34:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome common and quite well working scoring ideas:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.
