(if you haven\u0027t seen an episode I would stop reading and go watch one). So you will get clues for your destination. There will sometimes be a road block clue where you have to do something before you complete the clue! This race is a timed race. You as a player will set a timer when you start your flight. When your finished with the flight, stop the timer and give me the time for that clue. When your finished with the race you will send me your time and I will put it up on a score board. If your in first place when the race ends, you\u0027ll get to help me create the next race! I will participate in this race because I know the whole thing inside out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have finished a clue PM me and I will give you the next clue. There will be 25 total.
