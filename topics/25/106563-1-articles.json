Got to the Mun nearly 5 hours into Day 2, after a few launchpad science missions, a couple of part tests, a launch to space, and finally an orbital mission. Unlocked just what I felt was needed in the tech tree. As you can see, my landing on the Mun was somewhat of a .... failure. Despite my best efforts, slowing to about 1m/s before landing, I managed to tip over my top heavy design. Unsure of what would ensue, I even attempted to record my efforts to take off, but sadly, the video decided it wanted to end up corrupted. I extended my landing legs, and tried rolling down the hill. After burning through about 1/3 of my remaining charge, I managed to get the nose far enough up in the air that I was able to throttle up the engine, and take off. Never again Jebidiah, never again! After all that, I nearly ran out of fuel on my return trip, getting the appropriate periapsis as to allow reentry. \n\nWhile it won\u0027t count towards the first mission, I was hoping that by posting, I will at least establish a completion time for the first stage, to get a more accurate measure from here on out.\n\nEDIT: I do have RemoteTech installed at the moment for my other saves, but if unmanned probes come up, will be sure to uninstall it.\n\n![h9ZcrYs.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/h9ZcrYs.jpg?1)\n\n![tPwrLhY.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/tPwrLhY.jpg?1)\n\n![B8nsHnG.jpg?2](http://i.imgur.com/B8nsHnG.jpg?2)\n\n![U9Lhmrc.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/U9Lhmrc.jpg?1)\n\n![tkNS8NR.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/tkNS8NR.jpg?1)\n\n![Vdg6qY0.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/Vdg6qY0.jpg?1)\n\n![naUNqAD.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/naUNqAD.jpg?1)"},{"CreatedByName":"TinyPirate","CreatedById":77813,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T10:06:23Z","Content":"Thanks for all the awesome entries.
