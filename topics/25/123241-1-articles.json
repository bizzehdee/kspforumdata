Jeb was stationed on the Mun for the next year, Valentina and Bill were floating in orbit somewhere over Duna, so that only left Bob. Now, Bob is not exactly known as a risk-taker around KSC. For that reason, Mission Control opted not to tell him about the rather... dubious delta-V budget that they had planned out. The launch date came, and Bob was hustled on board before he could ask too many questions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket launched. As far a Bob could tell, everything was going as planned and... say, wasn\u0027t this stage that they\u0027re using to circularize supposed to be used only for the interplanetary transfer? He contacted Mission Control about it but they said that this was always the plan and that they were totally not making this mission up as they went.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe transfer window opened and the burn began. Again, everything normal and... Ok, he knew that the Laythe lander wasn\u0027t supposed to be used for this part. He again contacted mission control again, but they again wrote it off as being all part of the plan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpon arrival at Jool, mission control directed Bob through a Tylo gravity assist, which went off without a hitch. Then they directed him to use the last of the lander\u0027s fuel to get an encounter with Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But Mission Control, how am I supposed to circularize when I get there?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You\u0027re going to perform an aerocapture, of course.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But... this ship wasn\u0027t designed for aerocapture!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Don\u0027t worry about it, Bob. We\u0027ve got this all figured out.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can imagine, Bob was getting pretty nervous by now. His nerves (read: \u0022utter terror\u0022) especially showed through when one of the solar panels (and a landing leg and parachute) exploded during the aerocapture. At this point Bob assumed that they would scrap the \u0022landing\u0022 portion of the mission. He could dump the lander in orbit and just fly home. He just about screamed when they told him to transfer fuel from the return stage into the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe landed, planted a flag, and returned to orbit, this time with plenty of fuel to spare (which would never have been transferred back to the return stage, had he not reminded Mission Control). The window back to Kerbin opened, and Bob was sent through a convoluted series of gravity assists to minimize the Delta-V he had to use... and he came up short. Monopropellant, LFO, all gone. The only thing left was to get out and push. So that\u0027s what Bob did. It took nearly all of his EVA fuel, and he barely had enough left to get back to his pod, but he was on his way home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that mission, Bob utterly refused to fly in anything that had a tank that dropped below 1/4 fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the challenge is simple: run a normal mission, whatever you want to do so long as you reach orbit, but never allow any of your tanks to drop below 1/4 fuel. Because of the open-ended nature of this challenge, there is no scoring. There is also no reward for completing this challenge, other than your own accomplishment, so I won\u0027t check too hard for cheaters. But if you do something obviously against the rules, I won\u0027t put you on the list of people who completed the challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:impact;\u0022\u003ERules:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. No tank on your vessel may ever drop below 1/4 fuel (excluding seperatrons, so long as you don\u0027t use them as propulsion) and must be staged or shut down before reaching 1/4. I\u0027ll count stacked tanks and non-asparagus tanks that are connected by fuel lines as a single tank. i.e. Each stage of an asparagus staged rocket counts as one tank, but tanks attached together in a single stage are one tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Your mission must at least reach orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. No Hyperedit, Infinite fuel, etc. Keep to the spirit of the challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Refueling is \u003Cstrong\u003EAllowed.\u003C/strong\u003E However, your fuel source may not drop below 1/4 fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. You may not detach a booster and let it push you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Mods are allowed, so long as they don\u0027t add anything that would be overpowered relative to the stock parts (No KSPI).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Give some proof of your success via screenshots of your mission, including shots of your tanks\u0027 fuel levels at decoupling (MechJeb has a convenient \u0022stage burned mass\u0022 feature that can be used to keep track of your fuel levels.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a question about the rules, just ask and I\u0027ll do my best to answer it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:impact;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EChallenge Completed By:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:impact;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EVaporo\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:impact;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E: Simple one-and-done mission to the Mun and back.
