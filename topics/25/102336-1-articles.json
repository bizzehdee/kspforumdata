I am posting this in case other people would like to give this a shot as well.\n\nThe goal is in time of 48 to 54 hours, starting with beginning tech parts (in science mode, you must:\n\n1. Build a communication relay network around Kerbin and the Mun.\n\n2. Map out the surface of Kerbin and the Mun.\n\n4. Build a Mun Karbonite mining colony on the mun\n\n6. Begin sending a science gathering ship to minnus\n\nand possibly more.\n\n7. Use IVA for all launches and burns.\n\nThe point is to see how much infrastructure you can build in the Kerbin Planetary System with in 48 to 54 hours. Here the catch though: Everything must be done in real time, meaning time warp is NOT allowed. You are allowed to sleep, eat, take care of daily chores, whatever else you need to do as long as you check back frequently, have KSP running the entire time; and make sure not to miss your important laucnh, burn and transfer deadlines. Of course all of this must be done live on twitch. Sound\u0027s crazy, eh! Well the crazier the better. If you have an idea that is even more intense, then go for it.\n\nHere are the mods I will be using, some of which are required for this challenge.\n\nRequired:\n\nRemote Tech\n\nKarbonite\n\nScanSat\n\nRasterpropMoniter\n\nProbe Control Room\n\nVessel Viewer\n\nOther mods I will use:\n\nMechjeb (mostly for planning complex maneuvers (which I am not good at), planning rendezvous, and auto-manage docking.\n\nAtmospheric Trajectories\n\nKerbal Attachment System\n\nKerbal Inventory System\n\nProcedural Fairings\n\nProcedural Parts\n\nLaunch Countdown\n\nFinal Frontier\n\nKerbal Engineer Redux\n\nKerbal Alarm Clock\n\nShip Manifest\n\nEnhanced Navball\n\nActionGroupsExtended\n\nActionsEverywhere\n\nStockBugfix modules\n\nDmagic Orbital Science\n\nFreight Transport Technologies\n\nStockalike Station Parts Expansion\n\nExtraplanetary Launchpads\n\nSo that is what I will be using. I will create another thread in appropriate forum for my twitch schedule this weekend for the challenge.\n\nGood Luck!\n\nBy the way, there is no scoring, no rewards, just some craziness and see if you can out-do the others. One more note: I said 48 to 56 hours because I am going to do the challenge in 56 hours, but 48 is good goal as well.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-20T20:03:47Z\u0022 title=\u002203/20/2015 08:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by OpenWorldAddict**"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T20:34:21Z","Content":"What\u0027s Twitch?"},{"CreatedByName":"bakanando","CreatedById":126310,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T20:44:59Z","Content":"A very nice idea, I\u0027d recommend science mode so progress is not halted by career mode.

I was trying to launch my first communications satellite, but I would lose control of the rocket as soon as it left the pad. The end result of that is that I couldn\u0027t stage it and thus it soon after crashed. After trying to launch it dozens of times and making tweaks on many different things (including changing the direction the communication devices pointed, nothing worked and frustration began to build up. Eventually in anger I gave up. I can\u0027t complete the challenge if I can\u0027t get one communication satellite off the ground."}]}
