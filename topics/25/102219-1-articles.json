On the other side there is a little island. you have to go there and deliver your payload there.\n\n![S39XNAp.jpg?1](%5Bimg%5Dhttp%3A//i.imgur.com/S39XNAp.jpg?1)\n\nThe island is found in the green circle.\n\nthe main objectives are:\n\n1. Build a bomber that can fly to the island and back.\n\n2. Deliver any payload at the island.\n\n3. Land back at the KSC.\n\nthere are some rules:\n\n1. You may not use too much part clipping. slight clipping is okay, so long as you don\u0027t do things such as hiding wings within wings and hiding control surfaces within the body of the aircraft.\n\n2. You may not use reaction wheels or RCS thrusters in atmosphere below 40.000 meters. Just activate them using an action group. EDIT: You may use reaction wheels during VTOL flight since otherwise proper VTOL control is very hard to achieve. do NOT use them at speeds exceeding 25 m/s of surface speed.\n\n3. You may use any engine available. you are allowed to go into space(you can go to jool on the way there for all I care) to get to the target and back.\n\n4. You may not use mods(aesthetic mods are allowed, since they don\u0027t alter the actual gameplay).\n\nYour score will be calculated using a points system. please calculate your score and show me how you calculated it, so I can check it.\n\n- You will get 100 points for completing the main objectives.\n- Every minute you spend from start to landing back at the KSC will count as -1 point. when you have landed, simply click the revert flight button and make a screenshot: it will show the total flight time there.\n- The payload delivers points. this will be calculated as following: weight(tonnes) X speed(surface m/s) X (amount of bombs/missiles X 1.2) : 50  \nYou may carry bombs or missiles, It doesn\u0027t matter. If they can be guided into a target with control surfaces or RCS or whatever, your score doubles.\n- maintenance costs points: every part is -0.1 points.\n\nThere are also some secondary objectives: these deliver extra points and the list might be updated with your suggestions.\n\n- \u002B0.1 points per m/s of maximum airspeed when flying under 500 meters above sea level when fully loaded.\n- \u002B20 points for the bomber that can complete the mission the fastest.\n- \u002B30 points for VTOL capability.\n- \u002B15 points if it is capable of destroying the VAB(you may use a different payload than the payload for the actual mission for this one).\n- \u002B10 points if the bomber can be refueled on the runway.\n- \u002B25 points if the crew can safely get in and out on the runway.\n- \u002B50 points if all the above objectives are complete, EXCEPT for the first and second objectives.\n- \u002B60 points if you come up with some sort of aiming system for bombs that are not guided. it does not have to be too accurate at all.\n\nThe contest ends the first of august, so you have lots of time to come up with something. In the meantime I will make and update a scoreboard of the best 5 submissions. I recommend that you record the whole thing using a screen capture demo, for example bandicam. You may also do this with screenshots. If you can provide us all with a download of your craft that would be nice too.\n\nEDIT: you may use multiple submissions, but please don\u0027t make them too similar. there have to be major differences, not just version A or B. If you wish to post a later version, please delete the post with the old version first and notify me in you new comment that this replaces an old version.\n\n**Good luck!**\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-23T08:47:11Z\u0022 title=\u002203/23/2015 08:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by BoobyTrapGaming**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jakalth","CreatedById":136495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T02:35:56Z","Content":"Is this challenge limited to 1 submission or can we make more then one entry?

But the medium bomber is going... not quite smoothly... but working so far. I have a sneak preview of the yet to be named medium tactical bomber. It is already capable of taking down the VAB but still working on it\u0027s SSTO ability.\n\nFully VTOL capable already. Though the vtol controls are difficult to say the least... Flies far better once it\u0027s forward speed exceeds 22m/s, or it is launched in VSTOL mode. Not going to say what the antenna are for just yet... ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n![tacticalbomber1_zps9prktbiv.jpg](http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/tacticalbomber1_zps9prktbiv.jpg)\n\nAnd a quad core \u0022nuke\u0022 loaded for combat.\n\n![tacticalbomber2_zpspq3l0ik6.jpg](http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/tacticalbomber2_zpspq3l0ik6.jpg)\n\nOne issue though. Without reaction wheels/RCS, VTOL is nearly impossible to control. Control surfaces do not give any control to the craft unless it is moving fast enough to get airflow over them. How about a little bone and allow reaction wheel usage during vtol ascent/landing(below 25m/s forward speed with vtol engines on only), but have to be turned off during remainder of atmospheric flight? And using VSTOL also requires that reaction wheels be turned off since flight is achieved at speeds above 25 m/s.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-23T03:02:42Z\u0022 title=\u002203/23/2015 03:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jakalth**"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T03:41:26Z","Content":"It is unfortunate that your challenge doesn\u0027t make use of BDArmory.\n\nBecause I have a slew of craft that could do this challenge.

As a VTOL, the bomber I showed works fine. As a conventional bomber, it works great. But as a SSTO it completely fails... not enough fuel, completely messed up and confusing fuel usage...(right side rocket was burning fuel from left tank even though it is not connected to it and there is no way for fuel to be transferred between the left and right tanks) and worst of all, uneven thrust even though center of thrust is perfectly lined up and all engines are outputting the same amount and using fuel at the same rate. Damn broken thingies...\n\nBack too the drawing board... and this was looking to be a very nice medium bomber...\n\nIf anyone wants to try playing around with the bomber, the craft file can be found: [Here](http://www./download/lzbtu0p6lf28wvd/Malakast_orbital.zip)\n\nUpdate: Got a replacement bomber on the way. It\u0027s already orbit capable, carries two bombs that weigh nearly as much as the bomber its self. It\u0027s fairly maneuverable even with full load. The Bomber is not vtol capable atm, might change that if it does not cause negative effects on the bombers ssto capability. And, it is smaller then my last attempt. Should have something worth posting within a few days, after some more extensive shake down testing. Lastly, the bomber is a bit unconventional in how it operates.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-25T03:28:32Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2015 03:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jakalth**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jakalth","CreatedById":136495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T04:43:50Z","Content":"Success! The flight of the Spaceplane Madrid went off without a hitch. The Madrid is a Light SSTO Bomber carrying two Hemostat Cruise Missiles. It successfully flew the two missiles into orbit where they completed the mission of attacking the island as well as the bonus of attacking the VAB, in the same run. Note: VAB was destroyed in separate run using in flight launched hemostat missile with a full load of fuel. Orbital attack was not enough to destroy the VAB. The Madrid then deorbited and returned to the KSC runway for a safe and uneventful landing.\n\n![spmadrid01_zps1dsqjcpf.jpg](http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/SP%20Madrid%20Bombing%20run/spmadrid01_zps1dsqjcpf.jpg)\n\nThe whole mission is shown through a storyboard of pictures: [HERE.](http://s1346.photobucket.com/user/Jakalth/SP%20Madrid%20Bombing%20run/story)\n\n![spmadrid28_zpsgwcn2yzf.jpg](http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/SP%20Madrid%20Bombing%20run/spmadrid28_zpsgwcn2yzf.jpg) My Boys were happy to fly the mission.\n\nFor the meat of the contest:\n\nCompleted the mission: \u002B100 points.\n\nMission time, 1h 21m approx: -81 points.\n\nPayload: (22tons(bombs only) x (230m/s fastest speed I can confirm with pictures before impact) x (2x1.2) x 2(guided missiles)) : 50 = \u002B485 points\n\nMaintenance, 200 parts: -20 points.\n\nMax speed 500 meters, 143.8: \u002B14 points.\n\nfastest mission time: nope 0 points.\n\nVtol?: nope 0 points.\n\nDestroy the VAB: barely \u002B15 Points.\n\nRefuel on runway: derpy refueler... check. \u002B10 points.\n\nExit/Embark crew: yep \u002B25 points.\n\nall objectives: nope 0 points.\n\nBomb sight: yep, got that covered. \u002B60 points.\n\nTotal: 608 points. A start for this competition at least.\n\nBombs reached an unconfirmed speed of over 300 m/s before impact, but I have no picture to confirm this so can\u0027t use it...\n\nBomber has minimal part clipping. Only clipping is for reasons of looks. The Reaction Wheels on the cruise missiles were turned off by staging, until going orbital, and they are the only ones on the bomber. I do have KER and VOID, both of which were turned off for the mission. I also have Mech Jeb, but that was not used for the mission either. Completely stock run in every way.\n\nThe SP Madrid is available for download: [Here.](http://www./download/0uv5cn6woaas5ai/SP_Madrid_Hemostat_Cruise_Missiles.zip)\n\nFlight controls:\n\nMake sure the Rapiers are set to manual switch and in airbreathing mode.\n\nUse SAS, you\u0027ll need it.\n\n1 key: turns on the jet engines, turns off the rockets on the missiles. Also turns off the reaction wheels.\n\n2 key: turns off the jet engines, turns on the rockets on the missiles, switches the rapiers to closed cycle. Also turns on the reaction wheels.\n\n0 key: deploys/retracts the 3 antenna for the nose mounted bomb sight.\n\nMissiles require manual separation.\n\nRCS is for orbital maneuvers and missile separation only.\n\nswitch control on missiles to the inline drone core once you separate them.\n\nThe vertical fins on the missiles are the bottom of the missile.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-27T22:11:44Z\u0022 title=\u002203/27/2015 10:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jakalth**\n  \ncorrected point score."},{"CreatedByName":"BoobyTrapGaming","CreatedById":138823,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T10:55:10Z","Content":"about the payload score: take a look at how heavy the load is(tonnes). then multiply that by the speed at which it hit the target(m/s). then multiply that by (the amount of bombs times 1.2) then divide that by fifty. there you have the payload score.\n\nfurthermore, I fixed the issue with my graphics card, so I will soon be attempting this as well."},{"CreatedByName":"BoobyTrapGaming","CreatedById":138823,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T14:17:15Z","Content":"alright, this seems to be a dead topic.
