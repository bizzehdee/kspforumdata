will continue adding more missions to the series as time progresses.\u00A0 Feel free to follow the series from Mission 1 through numerically, or just pick one that sounds fun, just be forewarned that the later missions will be structured with the assumption that you have completed the previous missions.\u00A0 I am pulling inspiration from several real life mission proposals from various sources, as will be evident, and each Mission will have a few options for how to complete it.\u00A0 I won\u0027t put any mod restrictions on anything, since I won\u0027t be scoring anything, but I am designing the missions for stock KSP with DLCs.\u00A0 Feel free to use whatever mods, cheats, or divine rituals to the Kracken you wish.\u00A0 The only requirement is that you enjoy yourself.\u00A0 If you don\u0027t, the Fun Police will be administering Mandatory Fun according to Hilarity Protocol 365.7 subsection

return Kerbals to the surface of the Mun.\u00A0 They will not, however, go unprepared, like last time.\u00A0 Instead, we will be be sending them with a way to get back to Kerbin, as well as reliable communications.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor this mission we need to design several things.\u00A0 We will need two launch vehicles, a Medium class and a Heavy class.\u00A0 The Medium class launch vehicle will be used for launching crew and supplies to low Munar orbit, and the Heavy class will be needed to launch some of the more bulky things.\u00A0 We will also need a survey satellite in a polar orbit of the Mun to survey for ore deposits, as well as at least three communications satellites so that we have constant communications with the brave Kerbonauts who will be setting foot upon the Mun.\u00A0 Lastly, we will need a reusable single stage Mun lander, capable of landing and returning to Mun orbit (or achieving Mun orbit and landing again) without refueling.\u00A0 This lander must be able to carry an external payload, which could be a base module, a rover, or a crew module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are two ways to go about satisfying the Mission 1 requirements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003EMission 1a:\u00A0 The

orbit.\u00A0 The station will need a station core, with power an propulsion, a science lab, and two habitation modules.\u00A0 It will also need space to dock at least three vehicles at any given time, and it must be able to fully refuel the reusable lander from either it\u0027s core, or from a fifth fuel storage module.\u00A0 The modules for this station are to be launched on the Heavy launch vehicle.\u00A0 The station is to be resupplied by crew and cargo vehicles launched by the Medium launch vehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003EMission 1b:\u00A0 Mun Direct\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter designing your launch vehicles and launching the required satellites, construct a modular base on the Mun, at a place with lots of ore.\u00A0 The base will need a core, with power and a refinery, a science lab, and two habitation modules.\u00A0 The modules are to be launched by the Heavy launch vehicle, and delivered to the surface by the reusable lander.\u00A0 The base will also need a rover, for extended science trips.\u00A0 The base will be resupplied by crew and cargo vehicles launched by the Medium launch vehicle, to low Munar orbit.\u00A0 There, the reusable lander will rendezvous with the crew or cargo vehicle to ferry the crew or cargo down to the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003EThe Launch Vehicles:\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe launch vehicles can be whatever you want, rocket, spaceplane, or some weird amalgamation with bits from both and solid rocket motors strapped to the side for good measure.\u00A0 They can be fully disposable, or fully reusable, whichever you wish.\u00A0 Make sure they are versatile, however, because we\u0027re going to be using them in future missions.\u00A0 I recommend designing the Heavy to be able to launch two station modules (or two base modules) at a time, and designing the Medium to be able to launch a full crew rotation, or a decent amount of cargo (probably fuel, unless you\u0027re using life support mods).\u00A0 If want, you could launch a reusable tug for moving things from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E to LMO and make the Medium vehicle smaller or dedicate more of it to crew/cargo.\u00A0 This option might become increasingly attractive in future missions, and may even become a requirement.\u00A0 If you choose to use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E spaceplanes for your launch vehicles, a tug is strongly recommended for delivering modules from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E to LMO, since designing a heavy lift \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E spaceplane that can deliver cargo to the Mun and beyond is quite challenging.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will be adding more missions as I complete them.\u00A0 Enjoy\u00A0 \u003Cimg
