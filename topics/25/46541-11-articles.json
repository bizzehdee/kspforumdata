My skills in aerospace design have grown CONSIDERABLY since I launched the Raven Mk2. At some point in the future, after I land or fail to land all my current models, I might introduce a newer lineup of Duna-planes for this challenge, or a similar Duna-flying challenge of my own I\u0027ve been talking about creating, using some of the lessons I\u0027ve learned lately in aircraft design...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-26T11:11:09Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2014 11:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sdj64","CreatedById":100819,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-26T15:20:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Northstar1989\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Northstar1989\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENice plane, by the way. Some good ideas there.\u003Cp\u003EYou could improve the design a bit by reducing the part-count if you installed the Multipanels mod (which basically gives you upsized versions of the Ox-STAT solar panel, though they look a bit ugly, as they are literally just resized OX-STAT panels, and the base is too tall for the scale). This might even allow you to throw on a few more wings and ion engines and build an even bigger version...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, the NearFuture mod has nuclear reactors which, though not nearly as power-dense as real reactors (or the ones in KSP-Interstellar, which are modeled after real-life reactors), still produce more EC/ton than any of the solar panels except the OX-STAT panels facing directly towards the sun (and in a plane, most of the time they will be at a significant angle). This might reduce your weight for the same actual electricity production- as the reactors would produce more power than the solars except when flying around Dunar noon- and would allow you to have powered flight at night...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, if you want to \u003Cstrong\u003Ereally\u003C/strong\u003E optimize your design, install Procedural Dynamics (better known as \u0022Procedural Wings\u0022 though the mod was never actually called this). It will allow you to basically create wings of any size and shape you desire, and the lift coefficient properly scales for large-sized wings (as well as based on other more subtle wing parameters like root-to-tip width ratio: it\u0027s basically halfway to FAR in terms of realistic lift equations), so your larger planes will produce slightly more lift compared to their wing area, like in real life... (lift increases exponentially with wing area in real life- though the curve is somewhat balanced by increased drag)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI play with all these mods myself (especially Procedural Dynamics, on Geschosskopf\u0027s suggestion- how else would I build giant flying wings like the Raven Mk2 without overwhelming my CPU with part-count and 50 separate lift equations for each wing section?) Procedural Dynamics will be especially helpful for you- since it most strongly benefits craft with large, thing wings like your ion-flyer/glider (like in real life, in Procedural Dynamics thicker wings produce more lift than thinner wings- but I believe their lift coefficient actually decreases, so it\u0027s less lift per ton of mass, making thin wings preferable on lightweight gliders...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the tips on the mods. I have used PWings before but not Near Future or Interstellar. The plane is all stock, by the way (except for KER on the launch rocket), so keeping it that way was a challenge too. The part count comes in a little high at 260. The OX-STAT solar panels are completely weightless though so I think that any other electric solution would weigh it down some more, though flying at night would be a big bonus. If I was to do it again with mods, I\u0027d also go with some electric propellers to help the ions at lower altitudes, maybe even one vertical like a helicopter for takeoff and landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: You also said that the only supersonics so far used Interstellar, but my plane does as well.

I named it the Duna \u0022Flyer\u0022 in honour of the Wright Brothers \u0022Flyer\u0022.

My only question is on the cargo. I\u0027ve been counting Kethane itself and drills, etc., as cargo if the plane can function without them, on the theory that the plane could be used to deliver Kethane to bases. So there are several questions here actually. First, can the plane meet the challenge requirements on electric power alone, without burning Kethane? Can it achieve 9000m without burning kethane? Can it circumnavigate (landing at night is OK) without burning Kethane? If so, not only the drill but all the Kethane itself counts as cargo.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAs it stands right now, you\u0027ve got \u002B 3 for 5 Kerbals, \u002B1 for all Kerbals inside, \u002B4 for 9000m (assuming you didn\u0027t need Kethane to get there, \u002B3 for 8000m otherwise), \u002B 1 circumnavigation assuming Kethane wasn\u0027t required, \u002B 1 for FAR, and \u002B whatever for cargo.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI believe you\u0027re the 1st to do this challenge with life support. That is something I hadn\u0027t considered before so I\u0027ll have to amend the rules. Life support really doesn\u0027t fit in as cargo because if you\u0027re using it, you can\u0027t leave home without it, so it\u0027s more like structural weight that has to be overcome by ingenious aerospace engineering. As such, I believe using life support should be an additional bonus for carrying the extra dead weight. And the more Kerbals you have aboard, the more dead weight you have to carry to keep them alive. So I\u0027m thinking that using life support should be a bonus of \u002B1 by default for 2 Kerbals, with an additional \u002B1 for each ton of life support supplies, to keep it in line with the cargo points. This would give you an extra \u002B1 in addition to the points above.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI\u0027m putting this new rule for a life support bonus up for public discussion, starting now and going until next Friday, 11 July. Then I\u0027ll make a final ruling on it.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELastly, I have to say that compared to my flying on Duna efforts last year back in KSP version 0.21 this was made easier by the 0.23.5 ability to \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Equicksave in the atmosphere\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E. I take my hat off to those adventurers who completed this challenge in past KSP versions. I think the current leader could/should be declared the winner, at least of round one for this challenge, as the level of difficulty IMHO has changed.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a good point, but IMHO it has no effect on the difficulty of the engineering ingenuity required. The vehicle is bound by the facts of its construction and the stock or mod atmospheric behavior you play with, so will fail or succeed the same way regardless of whether you can quicksave in flight or not. The ability to qucksave in flight is a convenience to the player that provides an ability to quickly recover from fatal pilot error, instead of having to do the entire flight leg (perhaps several hours of real time) from scratch again. So I don\u0027t see this as making the challenge easier because it doesn\u0027t affect the difficulty of the engineering aspects, which is at the bottom line what this challenge is all about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m inclined to drive on as-is without changing any rules for this new feature. I mean, it makes doing the challenge have less impact on my budget of free time, but doesn\u0027t physically make it any easier to meet the targets (no matter how much I thank Squad for providing it). However, if others feel this does actually change the difficulty of the challenge, feel free to speak up. Final ruling will be rendered on 11 July, as I\u0027ve already got a court date then \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThank you for setting this exciting challenge I have had a lot of fun and I will be incorporating my Tesla II craft design into my future KSP career saves (looking forwards to KSP version 0.24 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m glad you enjoyed it.
