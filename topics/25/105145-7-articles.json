But I did do (almost) that that with the first build, and swapped because of - yaw!\n\u003E The problem is that it tends to want to yaw/roll when *any* control input is supplied - it\u0027s manageable, but annoying. It\u0027s also something that can affect rockets, even if gently flown.\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m certain that the build is absolutely symmetric, and swapped to the tail piece because I was suspicious that lift was getting applied to one side preferentially when using the small bits used in the canards. Also tried reattaching/rotating things to no avail.\n\u003E \n\u003E Then I started a new game and copied the plane over - tendency swapped direction! So I will blame Squad/Unity for this one. It will probably go differently next time I load it ...\n\nI have found that random yaw, when not because the vertical control is insufficient is due to flex. The engines at the end of your wings are probably to blame as you suspected.
