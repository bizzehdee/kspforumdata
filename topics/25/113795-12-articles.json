The mass of the aircraft was roughly twice what it needed to be, and the mass was shifted towards the rear of the aircraft.\n\nThe clipped wings added weight and drag, and did not provide any additional lift. I removed the extra pair of wings and replaced them with control surfaces.\n\nI added a communotron to extend the front hub. I think that\u0027s the look that you were going for.\n\nThe FAR settings for the control surfaces were causing your craft to stall constantly. I optimised them.\n\nI set up some spoilers so that it can land safely.\n\nThe rear canard shifted the center of lift too far behind the center of mass. They were really hurting your design.\n\nThe structural intakes cause drag and serve no function. But they look cool, so I kept them.\n\nI added struts to reinforce the structurally risky areas. The craft no longer flexes.\n\nI added drogue chutes so that you perform short landings. For example, on the island or KerbinSide\u0027s aircraft carrier.\n\nI added basic action groups. Press 1 when you want to use the drogue chutes. Press 5 when you go transonic and press 4 when you\u0027re below mach 0.8 again.\n\nWith these very minor changes I think that you have one of the nicest light fighters in this competition. It\u0027s a good design! It\u0027s stable up to Mach 4.\n\nThe main limiting factor in your design is the stock wings and control surfaces. They suck. The stock swept wings especially suck. If you replace the wings with B9 procedural wings then it performs amazingly well.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

All of what I wrote was under the assumption of a dogfight without guided weaponary (which I did mention before). I had already expected that rockets might make agility more important.\n\nI think I may have inadvertently started this debate and I am sorry about that. \n\nBut about your craft, even if under the non-missile engagements and gun only fights, your craft wouldnt fair very well due to its poor roll rate. Lets look at historical examples of great energy fighters, or Boom and Zoom fighters. The FW-190D9 by far one of the best BnZ fighters in history. It had a phenomenal roll rate better than anything the Allies had during the war. This aloud it to pull off surprisingly quick reversals and get the shot then climb away before anything could counter it. \n\nNext we could look at the Me/Bf-109G6, again, another light weight aircraft that had a great roll rate, and actually could turn pretty decently under high speeds, but suffered at lower speeds. This mated with its power to weight ratio, it could pull itself out of most fights if it needed to. The 109G6 manual even said, \u0022when in trouble point your nose towards the heavens and climb like a home sick angel.\u0022 The G6 had a 4200fpm climb rate, when the next best allied aircraft could only manage 3700fpm. \n\nLastly we could look at my personal favorite, the P-47D Thunderbolt. That thing was a TRUE energy fighter. If the jug was caught low, it was dead. But if it had the altitude advantage it would kill anything in the air. And because the Thunderbolt accelerated in a dive like a brick dropped by god, it could retain that energy into a mild climb. But if you asked it to turn it would burn that energy faster than a forest fire through a kindling factory."},{"CreatedByName":"RocketTurtle","CreatedById":67534,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T17:54:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E faster than a forest fire through a kindling factory.\n\nThat one\u0027s new.\n\nBut in all seriousness, I agree."}]}
