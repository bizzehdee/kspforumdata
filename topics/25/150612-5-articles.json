way through my KSP1.2 Moderate difficulty entry for the challenge (just 4 nodes left to unlock after the mission I\u0027m about to describe), but I \u003Cem\u003Ejust had\u003C/em\u003E to post this

some background, I\u0027ve always been somewhat in awe of the Cavemen who do lawn assemblies.. building a craft with higher part-counts and mass than is possible with the basic \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/launchpad, by manually assembling it a section at a time, out on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E grounds. They\u00A0launch bigger, higher part-count, heavier payloads to orbit than anything a regular Caveman can do, and then fly them out even to the outer planets.\u00A0It\u0027s something I want to try at some point.. but not yet. I had a different approach in mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I wanted to do something that, to my knowledge, no other Caveman has done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve never been a big fan of transmitting data back to Kerbin.. I\u0027d much rather return the raw physical data, and get the extra benefit of the maximum points available.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what I wanted to do was land a probe on the Mun, and fly the data back to Kerbin. And it \u003Cstrong\u003Ehad\u003C/strong\u003E to include a Materials Bay. I wanted the juicy science points that thing gave.\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EAnd I wanted to do it using a lander assembled by docking sections together in orbit.\u003C/strong\u003E My first attempts, a year ago, did not go well. Only after (with considerable pain) docking a couple of sections together did I discover that fuel-transfer is not an option for Cavemen.. that tech only becomes available after upgrading the R\u0026amp;D buildings. Clearly, this was going to be a lot more difficult than I\u0027d anticipated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe dream sat on the back-burner until recently, when the introduction of the Science Container in 1.2 gave me cause to reconsider the concept.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrbital assembly presents some interesting challenges that lawn-assembly doesn\u0027t face. To begin with, there\u0027s the lack of patched conics and manoeuvre nodes to complicate matters.\u00A0And at best, it\u0027s only possible to get a few tonnes of payload to orbit at a time. So a sub-assembly is very limited in what it can carry, if it has to carry useful amounts of delta-V as well. If at all possible, none of that payload delta-V should be expended in getting to orbit. Ideally, none of it should be used when rendezvousing and docking with the other sub-assemblies. Sometimes one is forced to choose either function or thrust for a particular sub-assembly, because having both together simply isn\u0027t feasible.\u00A0Launch aerodynamics for each sub-assembly becomes a serious consideration too. Building a practical, useful craft given these constraints is not easy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut over the last week, it all came together. I wanted a squat, wide-based lander if at all possible, but tests proved that without fairings (which I hadn\u0027t yet unlocked), this just wasn\u0027t going to be possible. No matter how hard I tried, the induced drag on launch prevented any of my designs from reaching orbit.\u00A0Instead, I had to come up with a taller, more narrow\u00A0design, that still had as low a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E as possible.After a number of re-designs, this is what I came up with:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00224mHbugw.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4mHbugw.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAtop the Lander Stage sits the Science Instrument Package (SIP), and atop that sits the Data Return Stage (DRS). Each section is coupled together by a pair of Docking Port Jrs. All told, there are 39 parts, with a combined mass of 2.65 tonnes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd, of course, this is just the lander.. there would need to be a transfer stage as well.. so all told, I\u0027d need four launches, and three rendezvous \u0026amp; docking manoeuvres to pull it off.. During the course of this mission my ability to perform rendezvous and docking manoeuvres without manoeuvre nodes or patched conics has considerably improved\u00A0.. I\u0027m starting to develop\u00A0a good feel for setting up intercepts by eye, with minimal fuel used.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the first time since I started playing KSP, I dug out my scientific calculator and began calculating delta-V by hand. There were three powered sections of the craft, each of which absolutely needed sufficient delta-V to complete its assigned role. And the margins were pretty tight.. the only stage with much spare capacity was the Lander itself. As it happened, this extra capacity was crucial to the\u00A0success of the mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe DRS was first to launch, and the SIP soon followed it. The Lander Stage, being mostly fuel, was fairly heavy, and although I got it to orbit, the booster that got it there was almost empty on arrival. This had been discovered during testing, of course, so it was planned to dock the Munar Transfer Stage to it first, before rendezvousing and docking both together, to the SIP and DRS. The Transfer Stage had, I believed, sufficient delta-V for its task.. what I hadn\u0027t counted on was that almost 30% of its fuel would be needed to reach a stable orbit. You guessed it.. this was the only section that hadn\u0027t undergone considerable testing beforehand.\u00A0But it was the biggest payload I could put in orbit.. it would have to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd it did.. but only just. When the transfer burn was complete, the tank was almost dry. The Lander Stage carried almost 3 times the theoretical delta-V needed to land on the Mun, so it would have to handle Munar Orbital Insertion itself.. with luck, there\u0027d be enough left over to give a nice boost to the DRS when it came time to depart.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaking a successful soft landing on the Mun was a challenge.. I\u0027ve never been particularly good at landing small probes. Crewed landers are easy, but small probes are very touchy, and can\u0027t cope with much lateral drift on touchdown. Most of my probes fall over on landing. This mission was no exception. It took three attempts at making a landing that stayed upright. And the winning attempt was on a 10\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(34,34,34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:16px;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);float:none;\u0022\u003E\u00B0\u003C/span\u003E slope. Right at the limits of stability. If I turned the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E off, it very slowly tried to fall over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022JXHbU3i.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JXHbU3i.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI took my science readings, dumped the data into the Science Container, and used the remaining lander fuel to boost off the surface, heading directly for an escape burn, rather than wasting fuel on achieving orbit first. The landing site had been carefully selected with this strategy in mind.. it was perfectly positioned for a direct escape burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the fuel was spent, I jettisoned the Lander and SIP, and fired up the three LV-1 Ant engines until escape velocity had been reached. A quick calculation showed there was just 600m/s of delta-V remaining, so entering a stable orbit around\u00A0Kerbin before re-entry was out of the question. I would have to hit the atmosphere at around 3km/s, so the remaining fuel would be used in a braking burn when I got close to my chosen periapsis of 43km. It proved to be a very flat re-entry profile, and things were pretty hot for a long time.. I was glad I\u0027d decided not to jettison the engines too soon.. they soaked up a lot of excess heat. I was glad of that braking fuel I kept, as well.. thanks to a crossflow oversight, my first re-entry attempt hadn\u0027t had that fuel available, and the DRS burned up shortly after hitting atmosphere (to be fair, that attempt had\u00A0a much steeper re-entry profile, too.. it may have just gone too deep, too quickly).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll told, with milestone bonuses on top of contractual bonuses, I picked up 259 science points for the mission..
