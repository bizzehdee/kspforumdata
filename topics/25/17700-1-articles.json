This is straight forward enough but this is only the beginning of the challenge. The landed spacecraft must then be able to take off yet again, reach orbit for a second time, and once again land! By doing this you have completed the challenge, but is it possible to perform more than 2 pogo-jumps? Those who complete the challenge can also attempt to achieve even more, by completing 3 or more pogo-jumps!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERules\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly stock parts may be used.
