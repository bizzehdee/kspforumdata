Estimated payload weight for DTS is 21tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDay 51: BHL \u0027Alpha 2\u0027 launches the Trans Duna Insertion Vehicle with Comms/Scan sats docked. TDI will dock with the DTS and align for launch. Estimated payload weight for TDI is 20 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDay 55: DTI boosts out of Kerbin orbit on autopilot/remote guidance. No crew onboard at this time. Station has approximately 300 Kerbal-days of preserved food/air onboard, as well as a life support system. The storage tanks are a backup in case the Ioncross lifesupport system fails.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDay 92 BHL \u0027Beta 1\u0027 launches the first part of the Manned Transfer Vehicle into orbit. Launch is via drone and ship will remain uncrewed until just prior to launch out of Kerbin system. Section one of MTV is likely to be near the max of 27tons. This will be the command, habitat and Lander section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDay 133 BHL \u0027Beta 2\u0027 launches the second and final part of the MTV into orbit and it then rendezvous with the Command section. This will be the Kethane rover and transfer engines section. Priliminary plans call for only the emergency lander to be sent with the Scout mission. The Primary lander will be sent with the Gamma mission. The rover will be light, a few tons, and be carried down by the emergency lander. Priliminary estimates call for an 18ton Emergency Lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe transfer engine \u0027vehicle\u0027 will be usable as a tug later, though likely this first one will stay attached to the scout MTV aslong as no unforseen circumstances occur.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeta mission will be crewed by four Kerbals, and the vehicle\u0027s life support can only just take this. Extra supplies incase the life support fails will be stored on board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote, the Scout MTV is now complete, though unmanned, and waiting insertion date of day 283. This leaves three other launches before the launch window in case of failure of a BHL. Nominally both the scout and mining missions could launch at the same time, if nothing goes wrong. The mission plan assumes that only the Scout will launch first however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDay 174 BHL \u0027Gamma 1\u0027 launches the first section of the Mining MTV into orbit. Command and the first section of the main habitat lander go first. The Duna habitat will be used to maintain crew during the voyage, though it is exessive for this task. Once at Duna the habitats will be able to support both the scout and mining crew for the duration. The orbiting station will still be able to support 4 Kerbals at any time if necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDay 215 BHL \u0027Gamma 2\u0027 launches the second section of the Mining MTV into orbit. This comprises the second Habitat lander and the Kethane mining lander. Some consideration is also being given to sending a small aircraft for scouting duties in this launch or Gamma 3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDay 256 BHL \u0027Gamma 3\u0027 launches the third section of the Mining MTV into orbit. This completes the mining mission assembly. This is the main booster section and the standard Duna long term lander. Consideration is being given at this time to adding satellites, rovers or an aircraft with the booster at present. Weight considerations will tell if this is feasible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDay 283 Arrival of crew for the Scout mission, and possibly the Mining mission if all goes well. Launch of both at this time seems possible and will see 8 Kerbals being launched towards Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDay 291 BHL \u0027Delta 1\u0027 launches the first part of the Dedicated Duna Transfer vehicle (Note from Engineer Albright. We are NOT naming this DDT! Come up with another name!) for shuttling crew and supplies back and forth from Duna. Current plans call for a vessel capable of carrying four Kerbals and at least 300 units of supply in addition to life support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesign work has not progressed to completion of the... Transfer vehicle yet, so it is unknown how many launches it will take to assemble it in orbit. Estimates at least two launches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeyond this will be a duplicate of the Gamma mission sending more habitat landers and mining systems to fuel ships, sending orbital kethane storage to dock to the DTS and the possiblity of remote mining on Ike to supply orbital stations and vessels more economically than a Duna based facility. At present Duna mining was chosen for safety reasons, enabling refueling of ground based vehicles in case of emergency launces being needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least two, and most likely three, Transfer vehicles will be built and will then shuttle back and forth from Kerbin to Duna, ferrying cargo and modules.

The ELV does not (as it\u0027s an emergency vessel itself... sort of), it only has one engine, but the main Duna shuttle has four and can launch on two engines. The Scout MTV can only fly with all engines, but the plan is that later MTVs, ones that are dedicated as tugs between Kerbin and Duna, will have four engines and can run on two if necessary. Backup lifesupport in case Ioncross fails. Backup station habitat in orbit incase the ground base fails. Sending an uncrewed station and scan sats ahead first to set things up before the crew get there. All these aren\u0027t really necessary to do this. Heck, the Scout MTV has the life support it needs without the Duna Transit Station sent ahead. I could have just parked the MTV in orbit as the station. I just wanted to try and make things more or less the way NASA would... well, with a Kerbal twist. I\u0027m even considering making a mission patch for \u0027Project Archimedes\u0027.

I am torn between using kerthane or not. It would make things a lot easier to mine on Duna and therefore carry less fuel from Kerbin to Duna. But I also feel its sort of cheaty (at least compared to real life feasibility). I will probably use it anyway just to have more stuff to do on Duna. So far in my redesign I have the first payload almost complete, it is the first part of my Duna Exploration Vehicle and will house 4 kerbals from to Kerbin to Duna, and then land on the surface and act as the lead car for the eventual DEV. I am also working on building the second car of the DEV, a kerthane miner that is totally self-sufficient in order to haul it out to a dig site and then leave it to work. I am also starting work on a third (science/hab) car for the DEV and a permanent Duna base that is used for long term habitation and as the landing point for the DDAV (duna decent/ascent vehicle). School will be starting up in a few weeks and I hope to work on this more before then.

At least one NASA plan for reaching Mars aimed to build fuel at Mars using a core, small fuel starter system sent ahead of a manned mission. I forget what starter was used but it has a reaction with chemicals known to exist in Martian soil to produce fuel on site. The proposed vessel in that plan does not have enough fuel to return home until fuel is made... or actually the unmanned vessel sent ahead makes the fuel before the manned craft arrives so it can refuel on arrival.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeilC","CreatedById":57575,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T06:10:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I wouldn\u0027t call Kethane \u0022cheaty\u0022 at all, it\u0027s just modeling things that are feasible given current tech but that haven\u0027t been done yet.

I\u0027m still working on the 1000day one. Note that once the mini Kethane miner is up and running I should be able to refuel the satellites in orbit and send any to Ike as need be to scan there. Later plans call for a separate Kethane miner for Ike to refuel orbital hardware.

The initial K-mini miner is unmanned, though the second full K miner has a lander capsule and life-support for extended stay. It has enough for two Kerbals on short drives, or one on long term missions exploring Duna (not truly safe unless two rovers are going on mission). Other dedicated rovers will go with Odysseys 2 and 3. The Habitat Base Landers are currently planned to have wheels and legs, putting the legs down for landing and to stay in one place, legs up and down on wheels to travel to a new site. It\u0027s not planned to have enough dedicated rovers for every Kerbal on Duna, unless you count mobile Hab bases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Early%20Duna%20Mission%20Plan.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Early Duna Mission Plan.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-28T17:11:44Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2013 05:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Patupi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
