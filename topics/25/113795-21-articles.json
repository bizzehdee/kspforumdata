A larger multirole fighter like the Eurofighter or Rafale, or a something a bit smaller like the F-35 or Saab Gripen?\n\nWhat makes a 5th generation fighter is not so much how large a fighter is. The F-35 is a much smaller airframe compared to the F-22, the Chinese J-20, or the Russian T-50. Yet the Lightning II is a 5th generation fighter.\n\nThe key areas that define a 5th generation fighter are:\n\n- Low observability techniques used to drastically reduce a warplanes radar, infrared, acoustic, electronic and visual signatures\n- Sensors and on board computer systems that provide the pilot with unparalleled situational awareness.\n\nMy thoughts from the beginning of reading this thread is that the challenge of designing a true facsimile of a fifth generation plane on KSP is more or less impossible. There are no means gauge signature reductions. There are no means to replicate the onboard sensory and computer processing capabilities of these planes on KSP (which is why I suppose Halsfury has focused on performance and design metrics rather than what defines a 5th generation plane in real life)."},{"CreatedByName":"TheHengeProphet","CreatedById":14895,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-01T06:10:29Z","Content":"Yeah, the missiles are a bit ridiculous to try to build...\n\nAnd as for that 5th Gen stuff, I believe the best we can actually approximate is making the best 4.5 Gen we can, and attempt to make it \u0022look\u0022 as stealthy as possible."},{"CreatedByName":"CrisK","CreatedById":133945,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-01T14:08:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yeah I\u0027ve been messing around with modular missiles and they are sorely lacking, First off my test missile is a truly crude contraption, being basically a T-10 Hammer booster (yeah the biggest A to A missile ever yet created) with 4 fins and a fairing nosecone with a big wad of C4 in it.\n\u003E The missiles don\u0027t actually need a radio data receiver, but the guidance system is so horrible, plus the missile sometimes starts controlling the aircraft, so I\u0027m going to see how it works as a Ground to Air missile maybe that will tell me something about how they work!\n\u003E \n\u003E - - - Updated - - -\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E BDA updated again?

P.E.W. works fine for me. Did you download the updated version from @LORDPrometheus\u0027s Dropbox account?\n\nI\u0027m fairly certain that the modular missiles are meant to be long-range cruise missiles. They\u0027re not really designed for AA.\n\nHere are craft files.\n\n1.

[Flanker variant unarmed with minimal mods](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rubu7z2uv7elsgc/CrisK%20Silver%20Production%20mk2%20Flanker%20Unarmed.craft.zip?dl=0).\n\nThese planes are somewhat challenging to fly. I recommend using a soft touch when flying them at low altitudes (under 5k). Pilot assistant\u0027s throttle control is very helpful. I put fuel in both the tank and the wings. Empty the forward tank if you want to be more acrobatic at the cost of losing half your flying time. I limited the thrust to 70, but it should fly nicely at anywhere above 45. 70 seems to be a sweet spot.\n\nFor the USAF variant: keep the AOA below 60. It\u0027s stable up to around 70, and it won\u0027t stall until you pass around 75. It\u0027s the more stable design, so it can\u0027t pull stunts as easily unless the forward tank is emptied.\n\nFor the flanker variant: Keep the AOA below 70. This variant is more acrobatic and can/will stall if you go above an AOA of 75. It\u0027s capable of really weird and fun stunts, at the expense of burning speed. The cockpit is angled downwards, so there\u0027s more drag and the navball is a bit off. This gives a great IVA view though, and it\u0027s really cool for dogfighting in the IVA view. It\u0027s also amazing for IVA landings because you can see below you as you land.\n\nNeither need airbrakes to land. Hold the S key when you touch down and the rear fins will slow you down. It\u0027s easy to land on a very short strip (including Eskandare\u0027s aircraft carrier) with these planes, even with IVA. The USAF is especially forgiving with landings.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-03T16:37:28Z\u0022 title=\u002209/03/2015 04:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CrisK**"},{"CreatedByName":"TheHengeProphet","CreatedById":14895,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-01T16:55:55Z","Content":"Stable up to 70 degrees AoA?

I might have to build the wing as a single main piece and make my own leading edges to see if that fixes anything.\n\nI\u0027ll check when I get a free moment to play KSP again!\n\nTo be honest, the high performance was half voodoo/luck and half science. ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif) Every time I made a change to the plane I checked FAR\u0027s analysis window to see if the AOA increased or decreased. If the performance went down, I loaded an older save. By doing that I found 3 different wing configurations that performed well enough.\n\nIf I increased the wing\u0027s length, the AOA stability/performance decreased but lift increased. There\u0027s a healthy balance between lift and AOA performance. You can make the plane stable at an AOA of 90\u002B on the analysis graph, but it won\u0027t have enough lift at higher altitudes so the entire plane will stall.\n\nTweaking the control surfaces is also **very** important. For example, on the flanker variant you can increase the deflection of all of the control surfaces to 35 or so, and add forward-facing control surfaces that are set to affect pitch. That will allow you to turn 90% pretty much instantly. The downside of this is that you lose a huge percentage of your speed. The plane will also snap in two at low altitudes (below 5000) if you do this. The real Russian planes do this, but it leaves them sitting ducks for a bit while they pick up speed. Imagine a plane going from Mach 0.9 to Mach 0.5 in the span of a few seconds. It looks cool, but what practical purpose does it serve?\n\nI\u0027ve also played around with BahamutoD\u0027s [thrust vectoring engine](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/82341).

I think that it\u0027s a bug. I save scum to get around that. Vis-\u00C3\u0192\u00C2 -vis the lift bug: what FAR is doing is actually shifting the lift to the root of the plane. It\u0027s a weird bug and the only fix that I\u0027ve found is to reload from an older save. It completely screws up the craft file.\n\nPS: The flanker version is stable at 80% AOA and can turn on a dime.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-03T16:37:44Z\u0022 title=\u002209/03/2015 04:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CrisK**"},{"CreatedByName":"TheHengeProphet","CreatedById":14895,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-02T20:42:17Z","Content":"Peculiar, the link takes me to the text in the file, where the link to the USAF allows me to download the file.

I [updated the flanker\u0027s body](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rubu7z2uv7elsgc/CrisK%20Silver%20Production%20mk2%20Flanker%20Unarmed.craft.zip?dl=0) slightly again. It has improved performance, and I fixed a weird bug where the IVA would have reduced visibility due to the engine nacelle bugging out.\n\nI kept the trailing edge because it weirdly improves AOA performance. Not sure why.\n\nThe drone core in the center acts as a stored battery - it holds 250 electricity and never overheats. Regular batteries tend to explode at random.\n\nIf you reduce the control surfaces to around 30 or even 25 then it\u0027ll be easier to fly, but that extra control is needed above 10000m. I\u0027d rather have it be difficult to fly below 5k than give up maneuverability over 10000m.\n\nEdit: here are a couple of screenshots of the Flanker\u0027s updated body. As you can see, the lines are much cleaner now.\n\n![8cKwfVQ.png](http://i.imgur.com/8cKwfVQ.png)\n\n![xozA99l.png](http://i.imgur.com/xozA99l.png)\n\nIt\u0027s also really fun to fly IVA because of the increased viewing area. The GAU-8 has been shifted so that it\u0027s parallel with the horizon, and it\u0027s pretty fun to dogfight in IVA now.\n\n![czRgWEq.png](http://i.imgur.com/czRgWEq.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-03T17:06:41Z\u0022 title=\u002209/03/2015 05:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CrisK**"},{"CreatedByName":"FourGreenFields","CreatedById":139309,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-03T19:19:20Z","Content":"That looks pretty good.\n\nHave you tried increasing the length of the leading edge?

I also disabled the torque in the probe and cockpit, and reduced the engine power to 50%.

Here\u0027s a version I deem worthy to post:\n\n[MRF-4 Devil Ray](https://www.dropbox.com/s/eck62cvcax2k48g/MRF-4%20Devil%20Ray.craft?dl=0)\n\nNow, I took the suggestion that a fighter capable of meeting all requirements would weigh over 10t anyways as a challenge.\n\nI present the MRF-5 Spite! This puppy weighs 8.4t, and is capable of filling every requirement short of the required minimum mass. The required mass makes it nearly impossible to make a single-engine design that is at all usable. The cockpit is from [QuizTech Aerospace](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111691-WIP-1-0-4-QuizTech-Aero-Pack-v1-2-9-x-Updated-8-9-15?highlight=Quiz\u002BTech). I have yet to arm it with a gun, but I\u0027ll enjoy seeing it dogfight once I do.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/xW544)\n\nUpdate on the spite: Something odd happened with FAR, and it\u0027s stated AoA values went crazy low, but the AoA values for everything else went up. I think it\u0027s time for a fresh install...\n\nEverything is wonky now. Looks like whatever happened messed up everything, so... here, have this. [MRF-5 Spite](https://www.dropbox.com/s/v7ydrz9dvqlt2z1/MRF-5%20Spite.craft?dl=0)\n\nUpdate: Added a couple more images to the Spite album to highlight the bizarre change in AoA behaviour. Interestingly, if I load the jet, it screws up all of my things, so I\u0027m going to pull the file for now, so that link will currently take you nowhere.\n\nAlso, I made a super slick jet that is capable of high maneuverability at high speeds. It has a wave drag area under 0.3. Let me know if you want a copy.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I\u0027ve turned it into ferram4, but I\u0027m struggling to figure out how to reproduce the glitch. If you folks have encountered anything similar, head over to the FAR thread and let\u0027s see if we can squash this.\n\nThe gunned version of the Spite weighs 9t even and still meets all of the requirements, save weight. I still haven\u0027t figured out this odd bug, but the plane still handles ridiculously well, despite stalling out at a much shallower angle than before (or rather, being able to stall out, period). I think I still have some work ahead of me to try to get the wave drag area down a bit further. It\u0027s currently just below 0.4 m^2^, and I think I might be able to work it down closer to 0.3.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-04T23:58:29Z\u0022 title=\u002209/04/2015 11:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheHengeProphet**"},{"CreatedByName":"CrisK","CreatedById":133945,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-04T09:26:15Z","Content":"Great.

I thought that would have been the only one to actually do so, but it was fine with pulling 20g\u002B turns, while others would fly apart at under 15g, even with 2x mass strength on the wings.
