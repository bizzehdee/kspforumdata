Large. Volumous. Orange. The orange fuel tank only has amazing strengths. Not surprisingly, the Kerbal Space Program relies heavily upon these monstrous constructs, and to increase the production rate, new factories have been built in distant lands to supply the KSC with orange fuel tanks. The problem? The orange fuel tanks have to be transported. Because rapid utilization is key here, they also have to be transported fully loaded with fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerbal Air Transport Authority believes that the best way to transport orange fuel tanks is through the sky, aboard a plane. Thus, they have submitted design specifications for a cargo airplane, most important of which is that it must be able to lift at least \u003Cem\u003Etwo fully fuelled orange fuel tanks\u003C/em\u003E. These fuel tanks cannot be an inherent part of the airplane, indeed, they \u003Cem\u003Emay only be attached to the rest of the plane through docking ports and EAS-4 Strut Connectors.\u003C/em\u003E Aircraft that achieve this (or more) during a filmed or photographed demonstration win the challenge and may be selected for further development.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe full list of design specifications:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
