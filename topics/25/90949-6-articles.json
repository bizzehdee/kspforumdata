So I decided to have one more go at this challenge and tackle Kerbin, which in a way is harder than the low gravity planets and moons. \u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Csup\u003EI have been working on two designs. \u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Csup\u003EThe first was a monster where I put 8 SSTO capable ships on top of a super-heavy lifter. Then I dropped off each and set them down in each biome. After the science I took the SSTO back to orbit and landed it back at KSC - dunno why really, could have just recovered them but I got carried away. Anyway, that turned into a huge lag-monster and remains incomplete. \u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Csup\u003ESo, the current plan is to put an SSTO on top of a lifter and boost it to orbit. Also on the lifter is 8 lander stages something like what was left behind on the moon on the Apollo missions. The SSTO is docked to one of these, it then uses that\u0027s fuel to land. After the science is done, the SSTO drops the lander and flies to orbit, where it docks with the mother ship and collects a new lander tank stage. Science is dropped off at a capsule. The SSTO then sets off again for the next biome. When all the biomes have been visit then the capsule that has the stored science detaches from the mother ship and drops to the KSC. \u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Csup\u003ESo far I have built and tested the SSTO (uses RAPIERS) and the disposable lander.

I wanted to send a spaceplane to Laythe, but in order to get there and back without nukes, and without overburdening the ship, I needed infrastucture in place. The short version, is that I sent a small Karbonite refinery there to produce fuel on the ground, and also sent a no-frills fuel tank to sit in orbit, so I could fill up the gas tank on the way home. I also sent a fuel tender into Kerbin orbit to refuel before heading out. One cool sidenote: I got to use a 5m tank and an appropriately monster engine to send the orbiting gas station to the Jool system.

It floated on lo-fi\u0027s anti-grav repulsors, and would anchor itself to the ground with KAS winches. It was a bit of a bear to stop precicely, but I had the option of flying at Mach 1.1 just over the water\u0027s surface, or I could take it way up for sub orbital hops. The problems started when I saved my game, while the ship was attached via fuel pipe to the Karbonite refinery, and also moored to the beach with grappling hooks. This caused some bad joojoo, and all my attempts to unhook the fuel pipe led to a flying Kerbal, and a broken ship.

Why the difference in life support costs? Because the pilot of the Sky Princess could get out (thanks to the ladder, and to the probe core -- the probe core, by the way, was attached to be a control reference point, as I had to roll the command pod a little to put the hatch on top), and could hop back into the lab for processing data, the Sky Princess only needs two crew, while the Sky Princess Tier 5 needs a full-time pilot plus two for the lab. You need about 56 or 23 thousand funds to launch either mission (respectively), but most of that is recovered. I could have been much more efficient with both missions, the original Sky Princess especially, but I had it follow the Tier 5 as a possible rescue vessel (it had 3 spare seats) and the Tier 5 was limited to flying during the daytime only. I was also juggling a few other missions whose critical maneuvers could not be delayed, so the crews sometimes had to take a day off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t think to plant flags at the landing sites until I was about halfway through, but the route was to head north to catch the water, shore, and grasslands a little ways away from KSC, then west to the highlands and mountains, further west to the desert, north to the tundra and ice caps, and then south again (completing the \u0022great circle\u0022) to the Badlands. At least, that was my thinking starting out. The Tier 5 Sky Princess had a maximum ceiling of ~1500 meters with the envelope at 100% buoyancy, and could be coaxed to ~1700 meters with body lift at full speed, but I was really worried that I might not actually get high enough to reach the \u0022mountain\u0022 biome. You can see that I did, but it was a near thing. In any case, I still had to take multiple extended detours around mountain ranges and islands (which the original Sky Princess cleared with ease, with a ceiling upwards of 5 km). A couple times, I thought I had found passes, but had to turn around and backtrack. I was probably tensest during the trip to the badlands -- I figured that I could take the Tier 5 through the equatorial river valley rather than swing way north and east to avoid the mountains, but this required some tricky flying to avoid the sides. Fortunately, I had toggle-reverse-thrust bound to the brakes action group, so the Tier 5 could stop on a dime (no way could I have done this with the original -- but I didn\u0027t have to, since that one could fly over anything).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was also the struggle of disembarking -- apparently, ladders are stupendously advanced technology to the Kerbals, so the only way to leave was through the bottom hatch of the lab (and the cockpit, but then there would be no way to get back in), but the lab hung too close to the ground to be used when landed, so I had to put a Kerbal on the ladder, land, and then get off. Fortunately, there was enough clearance to get back on the ladder without having to put the airship off the ground. (You\u0027ll see a couple of images depicting that in the Tier 5 mission record.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some extra pictures, including the reunion at the end of the mission, a bad water landing (that lab is fragile), the Sky Princess\u0027s speed record (a top speed of 136.1 m/s, or Mach 0.4, with the engines at full throttle and hitting RCS-forward -- I actually set the engines a little higher than the CM so that they would counter the pitch-up moment at high speeds), a couple of flybys (I had thought that Distant Object Enhancement would let me see the Sky Princess from outside of physics distance, but maybe that only works for things in orbit), travel through the river valley, and a few shots I thought looked pretty (EVE \u002B AVP Interstellar).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/eeC2W\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Did you actually use MJ for any of this? My rules are a little loose in this department, in that I didn\u0027t want to force people to uninstall mods as long as they aren\u0027t being used for the mission. If you used it, that\u0027s fine too.
