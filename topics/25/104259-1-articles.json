If you have the skills in Photoshop or GIMP or any image-editing program, this might just be the challenge to show your PR/marketing skills!\n\nThe challenge is quite simple. People here have their respective \u0022companies\u0022. **You just have to design a poster for recruiting** **unsuspecting** **kerbals to join your \u0022company\u0022**. Something like \u0022Sign up now for our very first trip to Eve! [return not guaranteed]\u0022, or maybe something like \u0022Uncle Gene wants you!\u0022, or maybe \u0022Join the \u003Cx company=\u0022\u0022\u003E engineering team today and get a free snack!\u0022\u003C/x\u003E.\n\nMECHANICS:\n\n- There are no specific dimensions for the poster itself but portrait orientation is preferred.\n- Make it as compelling as possible! Choice of words might just be the key to a more \u0022believable\u0022 poster.\n- Quality is top priority.
