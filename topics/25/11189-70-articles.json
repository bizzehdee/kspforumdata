It ended up growing. I gave it some payload capacity, more for carrying some interesting payloads rather than a lot of payload mass. However, this would be one \u0022heck\u0022 of a tanker to refuel a ship in LKO, could fill up more than four Jumbo 64 tanks. But not very practical to do that, due to the lag, and ships would need to fly to and dock with IT. Oh yeah, lag, it has over 500 parts, nearly 600 with payloads.\n\nSo, it involved a lot of tedious flying to do maneuvers.. Or sitting back and waiting. The lag was so bad (1/4 speed or slower) that 4X warp when thrusting was more like normal speed\n\nThe album has most of the info.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Ship\u0027s burn to intercept Duna underway as I type (.06 TWR). I\u0027ll describe the new anti-pitch-up method after the mission is completed, useful for many types of bigger spaceplanes (Won\u0027t be surprised if someone has done this before). Will post the report sometime Friday.\n\n- **GeorgeG**\n\n![JmvWb9P.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/JmvWb9P.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-30T00:42:30Z\u0022 title=\u002201/30/2015 12:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GeorgeG**"},{"CreatedByName":"WhiteKnuckle","CreatedById":101722,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-27T19:43:43Z","Content":"I can\u0027t believe I still have never entered this, but I guess better late than never...\n\nMy entry, the **Nomad SX1**:\n\n![cYkJTPw.png](http://i.imgur.com/cYkJTPw.png)\n\n![UpnboR0.png](http://i.imgur.com/UpnboR0.png)\n\nTakeoff\n\n![Rcw10UL.png](http://i.imgur.com/Rcw10UL.png)\n\nClimb out\n\n![TNvWJWF.png](http://i.imgur.com/TNvWJWF.png)\n\nOrbit\n\n![5fOmCKx.png](http://i.imgur.com/5fOmCKx.png)\n\nDe-orbit burn\n\n![WKWCDtW.png](http://i.imgur.com/WKWCDtW.png)\n\nRe-entry heating\n\n![yVOCXTN.png](http://i.imgur.com/yVOCXTN.png)\n\nIf there was any doubt Jeb was at the controls...\n\n![o19USoO.png](http://i.imgur.com/o19USoO.png)\n\n![oOd5TaH.png](http://i.imgur.com/oOd5TaH.png)\n\nBill: *\u0022Hey Jeb, the runway\u0027s over there...
