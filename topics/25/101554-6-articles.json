Let\u0027s consider unlimited \u0027broken\u0027, and yeah it would have been a good idea to require the flung vehicle to begin as a proper operating \u0027rover\u0027 -- that way I\u0027d stil be on top!\n\nNo more Unlimited entries will be judged until we sort it out.\n\n@petronator, this subtracts nothing from the awesomeness of your latest fling. We just may have to find a way to restore the \u0027rover spirit\u0027 to the unlimited rules.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-24T10:37:49Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2015 10:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kuzzter**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T13:04:44Z","Content":"All right, I\u0027ve looked things over a bit more and would like to get some opinions regarding the direction of the Unlimited challenge. Per the rules in the OP, both Petronator\u0027s and Juzeris\u0027s entries are perfectly valid for Unlimited. However this is a ROVER jump challenge so in that spirit we may want to modify the Unlimited rules, to wit: \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \u0022The craft must begin and end the run as a driveable rover. For the purpose of this challenge a \u0027rover\u0027 is a crewed vehicle that can move and steer on the surface of Minmus using only electrically driven rover wheels.\u0022\n\nThus (perhaps too conveniently? hey, the OP has to have some privileges ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)) my entry in Unlimited still works because it was a drivable rover from beginning to end of the run (actually, at the end it was TWO drivable rovers!) Petrnonator\u0027s second entry looks drivable at start of run, if he can retract enough gear bays to be able to drive in a straight-ish line without toppling the whole structure. The capsule is not a rover after release, but it easily could be with addition of a couple of wheels. With some modifications Juzeris could certainly also meet this standard.\n\nNote that the \u0027drivable after run\u0027 part makes it harder for vehicles that do *not* escape, and impact Minmus somewhere. Even more difficult for a craft that hits Kerbin. So I am thinking the ULTIMATE ULTIMATE answer to this Challenge will be a rover that jumps from Minmus, lands on Kerbin at the KSC, and is still driveable. Anyone have the drupes to pull that off? ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nWhat do you all think?"},{"CreatedByName":"impyre","CreatedById":116031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T13:15:15Z","Content":"I have an idea... restrict \u0022ultimate\u0022 entries to only those which \u0022roll up a ramp\u0022. Then the challenge with flingers becomes aligning the flung object with the ground in such a way that it rolls after release (without blowing up). Maybe this makes it too difficult though, just an idea.\n\nPerhaps to minimize feelings being hurt, you could simply create a new less broken \u0022ultimate\u0022 category... a semi-ultimate.\n\nAs a side-note, Foxster\u0027s would be perfectly legit in semi-ultimate as I envision it. The challenge in semi-ultimate is having something driveable rolling up a ramp and surviving. Nothing aside from the rover and ramp would be considered.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-24T13:18:10Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2015 01:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by impyre**"},{"CreatedByName":"juzeris","CreatedById":139480,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T14:12:36Z","Content":"I\u0027m perfectly fine with my entry getting moved to \u0022legacy unlimited\u0022 or something.

My thinking: in Unlimited unlike Open the ramp need not be inert...but once the ramp is not inert, the logically absurd conclusion is a ramp in name only (RINO) that ends up looking like the massive centrifugal flingers that led us to this point. \n\nSo, suppose we required that the last thing the rover touch is some kind of \u0027ramp\u0027, said ramp being inert and in contact with the ice sheet, but you can use any kind of electrically driven flinger and any combination of ramps and terrain to accelerate prior to that point. How then would we treat a concept like mine, in which the rover that goes off the ramp flings a crewed, driveable piece of itself for distance?\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E If you\u0027ve got great aim you can easily fling something into Kerbin\u0027s SOI...
