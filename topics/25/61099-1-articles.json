Scans from Kerbin suggest that Jool is a gas giant, yet they have also recieved remote reports that, apparently, there is a surface (confirmation unclear as no Kerbal has ever returned from there). Therefore, a new mission has been commissioned to determine, once and for all, whether there is a surface or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe method by which this has been decided is via high speed impactor. Kerbal scientists determined, through some questionable maths, that an extremely high speed impactor should be able to survive re-entry to encounter whatever \u0022surface\u0022 may exist, and/or penetrate beyond. Maybe even pop out the other side, akin to a bullet through an apple.
