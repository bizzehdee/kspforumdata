I will do it myself as soon as time allows (stupid college homework X.x).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe task: Get a manned craft in orbit around Minmus, so that a brave Kerb can EVA, jet-pack down to Minmus, land on the ground, and then jet pack up to meet the ship and get back in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis should be an interesting challenge, as where you place your orbit will be tricky. If you place your ship orbit very close to Minmus, you are going to have a huge horizontal velocity your Kerb is going to have to climb back up to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPreferred screenshots for the challenge: One of your ship sitting on the launchpad, one of your ship in it\u0027s orbit around Minmus, one of your Kerb leaving the ship, one of your Kerb on the planet, and one of your Kerb re-entering the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck! I\u0027m not quite sure this is possible yet, but might as well try!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few quick terms and conditions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Stock parts, mechjeb allowed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Your ship must be in a full orbit, meaning it can go around Minmus infinitely if required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Your ship has to be able to make the trip back to Kerbin. However, getting back to Kerbin is not really part of the challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hermitao","CreatedById":38977,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-12T23:35:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EChallenge accepted =D\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
