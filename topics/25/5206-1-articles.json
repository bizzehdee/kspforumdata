In one of my initial posts I mentioned I\\\u0027ve mainly being using mods (as before 0.13 my PC could not handle large stock rockets) and said I should probably give a stock Munar lander a go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell imagine my surprise when the first stock rocket I built not only landed me in the middle of Kerpernichus Crater (the name I shall use for the largest crater on Mun), but also in the shadow of Kerbin! Okay I\\\u0027ll admit that it was a complete and utter fluke, but I think some people may enjoy the challenge! Now I can go back to seeing how much mass I can land on Mun with mods \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve attached some images but I\\\u0027m unsure how to properly display them in a post (I don\\\u0027t use forums much) so if you can\\\u0027t see them and anyone can point me in the right direction I\\\u0027d appreciate it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Seems the pictures are working fine and apologies to anyone else who\\\u0027s already presented this challenge...

For example, sometimes as I come in for a landing, a weird round shadow appears as I land, almost as if my ship were somehow landing in its own shadow. I think it might have to do with how the rendering engine traces shade . . . \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve noticed other oddities with shade, too. For example, the sun-facing side of my ship is sometimes lit up, even when on the far side of the mun from the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I could be totally wrong, too. Not sure how to easily test this, since munar orbits tend to go wonky if you ramp up the time too far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone ever seen a munar eclipse from munar orbit? Does it happen?
