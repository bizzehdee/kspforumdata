They offer a handsome sum for the completion of the task. Of course there are caveats, so lets dig on in. \n\n1. In wanting the best bang for the buck, they have requested one vehicle that can split into two and recombine when the mission is complete\n2. Both craft must be maneuverable by two separate pilots\n3. The craft should have the ability to loiter for long amounts of time. A chopper or VTOL jet (with long VTOL times capable) are preferred\n4. The craft should be armed and able to attack and defend\n5. \n\nTo prove your vehicles worthiness the following test must be completed\n\n1. Lift off from the Runway while connected and stabilize your flight\n2. Fly to the rocket launchpad and land the craft\n3. Separate the aircraft after landing and fly them simultaneously to the VAB chopper pad\n4. Land both craft at the VAB landing pad (both aircraft must be airborne at the same time)\n5. Reconnect the aircraft while on the chopper pad on top of the VAB\n6. Lift the connected crafts back up and stabilize the craft\n7. Fly back to the Runway and land safely. No part of the craft may be destroyed\n8. \n\nTo prove you completed the deed, the KAF has requested:\n\n- Video of all the tasks being completed\n- In place of the video, capture images of your accomplishments on each segment and share them out\n- The KAF has requested the designs to be unique and edgy. Jeb laughed maniacally and the general approved. What would Jeb Build (WWJB)?\n- \n\nRules\n\n- All mods are accepted except hover scripts and mods that maintain flight and heading (IE: Mechjeb, KOS)\n- No mods permitted that automate the following of aircraft\n- Both aircraft must be piloted buy one human and Kerbal copilot\n- No DMP permitted\n- \n\nScoring with be based on the following, all providing 10 points. The max of 55 points is still possible with bonus points\n\n1. Design - Does the craft separate and combine as KAF requested?\n2. Stability - Is the craft stable? Did it fly and land without damage to itself of the buildings\n3. Landing - The craft should be able to land at all the target zones quickly and safely\n4. Speed - The craft should be fast connected and separate. This is a time trial as well. All tasks must be completed in as short a time as possible\n5. Air Worthiness - Were both crafts piloted at the same time? ***Bonus 5 points for crafts that land simultaneously when disconnected***\n6. \n\nDoes your agency have the moxie to take on the challenge? \n\nCan you fly and land multiple craft?\n\nNeed an example?\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/ReRbGW2pT18?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n \nTest your coordination! Test your mettle!
