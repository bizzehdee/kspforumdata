The stream is intended for tomorrow (Sunday, Jan,31) on my twitch channel starting at 1:00pm central (US) time. The goal will be to again set the record for lowest aerial circumnavigation attempted, with the currently planned maximum ceiling being at 800 meters (though I am considering reducing this down to 500 or perhaps even lower).\n\nNow today (at about this time) I will also be livestreaming. This livestream will be for the purpose of testing the craft and the feasibility of circumnavigating at different altitudes. Giving the aircraft a nickname and deciding the kerbals who will fly it are also high priority for this stream. This will mostly be a preparation stream for tomorrow.\n\nMy twitch channel can be found here: [http://www.twitch.tv/noname117spore](http://www.twitch.tv/noname117spore)\n\nBelow is a picture of the aircraft I plan on flying, the NAM-1-D3:\n\n\u002B![CjivgM5.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/CjivgM5.jpg)\n\nEDIT: Unfortunately, because of several scheduling issues, I\u0027ve decided to postpone the stream for Friday, Feb. 5th starting at 2pm central (with the actual circumnavigation starting at 3pm).
