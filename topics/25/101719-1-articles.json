I checked to make sure it hasn\u0027t been done recently, and i can\u0027t find a similar challenge in the last 3 pages of the challenge forum, so i think i\u0027m in the clear.\n\nSo when i started writing this it was actually a beauty contest for the best looking Duna rover, but it slowly developed into an outright speed challenge. So here it is...\n\n**The Challenge**\n\nLet\u0027s see whos the fastest on the red planet!\n\nBring your hotrod out to Duna and let\u0027s have it out on the sand strip!\n\n**Build a rover capable of covering** **2000** **meters and back in the shortest time**\n\n**How do we do this**\n\n0)Go to Duna.\n\n1)Plant a flag. This is your starting point.\n\n2)Begin the run from a full stop.\n\n3)Reach 2000 meter distance from the first flag, come to a full stop.\n\n5)Plant another flag.\n\n6)Turn around and drive back to the first flag.\n\n7)Cross the finish line. Have a glass of milk.\n\n**How do we measure it** **chronologically** (edited to be more user friendly)\n\nTake a gander at the top left corner. Your mission clock is your stopwatch.\n\nKeep record of the time you depart from the first flag, and when you return to that same flag. Subtract the two and you have your run time.\n\nUsing screenshots will help.\n\nIf you want to keep record of your checkpoint (aka the 2000 meter flag), consider your time once the Kerbal reenters the vehicle from the EVA (from planting the flag). EVA time is reset, so it wouldn\u0027t match the vehicle time.\n\n**Quicksaves during the run are not allowed.**\n\nYou can\u0027t quicksave \u0026 quickload at any point between the beginning and the end of the run. Of course, you can restart the run as many times as you wish. Don\u0027t forget to restart your stopwatch.\n\n**We\u0027re doing this by the** **honor system****, but ridiculously fast times will be questioned and may require proof in the form of craft file**\n\n...or better yet, if you\u0027d like, make a youtube video of it!\n\n**Requirements**\n\n-Must be done on the surface of Duna.\n\n-Must carry at least 2 kerbals. You can bring more for bragging rights, but only 2 are required to survive...muahahah.\n\n-Kerbals must be seated on the the external command seat. No command pods! At least not with kerbals in them.\n\n-Your vehicle must be operational after the run. It can take as much damage that it\u0027s able to sustain, but must still be driveable afterwards.\n\nBy operational, i mean it can move forward/back and steer. You don\u0027t have to finish with the same amount of wheels you started =D\n\n-Must be able to to SCIENZE! The more variety you load on it, the cooler your machine will be, but hey, at the very least have one goo canister.\n\n-No limitation on the number of wheels...but it HAS to have wheels!\n\n-You can use rocket engines, but your vehicle must still be capable of moving under its own power after your fuel has depleted.\n\nFeel free to use decouplers to shed weight, if you\u0027re brilliant enough...i\u0027m not...\n\n-RCS thrusters and reaction wheels are ok to use, just make sure your vehicle does not depend on these in order to operate.\n\n-The vehicle must complete the journey on ground. Hopping around from one dune to another is ok, due to the low gravity, but you can\u0027t just all-out hover across the 2000 meters.\n\n**Big air = ok; hovering across = not ok.**\n\n**Limitations**\n\n-no cheats/debug/etc...duh!\n\n-STOCK parts only\n\n-No part or physics altering mods\n\n-Information or graphic mods are ok\n\n-No parts or size limitation. Can be as small or as big as you want.\n\n**Winning**\n\n![charlie-sheen-winning.png](https://nbchardballtalk.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/charlie-sheen-winning.png)\n\nThere are no winners here, only lo...\n\n...just kidding!\n\n**I will edit this post to include** **your fastest time** **and your name.**\n\n**In order to be included, your vehicle must meet the above listed requirements.**\n\n**If your vehicle is good looking enough, it will get an honorable mention, even if your time sucks!...er...i mean...even if your time isn\u0027t as \u0022well seasoned\u0022 as others...**\n\n**Submitting**\n\nPlease include at least 3 pictures:\n\n1 showcasing your vehicle on Duna at the starting line (first flag).\n\n1 showing your vehicle at the checkpoint (2000 meters) with the first flag and its distance visible in the back.\n\n1 showing your vehicle at the finish line (the first flag), with the second flag and its distance visible.\n\nAny other picture that you deem interesting enough to share.\n\nIf your vehicle completes the run in a ridiculously damaged but still functional state, a picture of that would be fun, too.\n\nA short description of your vehicle and its features.\n\nIf you\u0027d like, share anything interesting that happened, like your vehicle doing a couple of crazy corkscrews and landing right side up during your best run...things like that.\n\nDon\u0027t forget to post your time.\n\nYou are invited to share the craft file of your creations, but not required. I definitely would like to get them. I\u0027ll probably make a car lot or something and put one of each in there =)\n\nIf you want to make a youtube video of your run, you are certainly welcome to do so! I\u0027d even be curious to see how you fellows bring your hotrod to the red planet.\n\n**--------------------------------**\n\nIf you have any questions, please let me know.\n\nThank you for participating and have fun.\n\nMay the fastest man win!\n\n![bebked.jpg](http://oi60.tinypic.com/bebked.jpg)\n\nOk so there\u0027s the challenge, and here\u0027s my submission:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E This is the **Duna Buggy** (get it?? I\u0027m so original...)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![14n1js1.jpg](http://oi60.tinypic.com/14n1js1.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s equipped with all the science sensors available, with the exception of the Science Jr. module. Actually it had one of those too, but it was exploding every time i went over a small hill, so i removed it.\n\u003E \n\u003E It has mono-propellant powered ***turbo boost*** and a reaction wheel for stability.\n\u003E \n\u003E The buggy pictured here is a previous version with no reaction wheel, but i could hardly sustain speeds over **18m/s** without it. I decided to put one in and now i can comfortably cruise at **40m/s** over Duna\u0027s hills.\n\u003E \n\u003E I usually use antennas on my buggies for that \u0022remote control car\u0022 appearance, but i decided to go with a new look for this one. Not a bad look for transmitting data.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![246l209.jpg](http://oi57.tinypic.com/246l209.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s go time!\n\u003E \n\u003E ![2vactp4.jpg](http://oi59.tinypic.com/2vactp4.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Here she is at the starting line. The buggy in the back is an older version i landed in this area previously. There\u0027s nothing particular about this location: i just ended up orbiting over it and decided to land near the old buggy.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![i4odmr.jpg](http://oi59.tinypic.com/i4odmr.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E And we\u0027re on our way!\n\u003E \n\u003E ![2ewlhn9.jpg](http://oi60.tinypic.com/2ewlhn9.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E First checkpoint! I reached a peak speed of 40m/s and had to brake slowly, so i overshot just a tad.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![mlgsqs.jpg](http://oi61.tinypic.com/mlgsqs.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E And across the line! It took me a little longer to drive back since i had to turn the car around. Also, i drove a little slower to be safe.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![f9nus6.jpg](http://oi62.tinypic.com/f9nus6.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n![b9ei3d.jpg](http://oi60.tinypic.com/b9ei3d.jpg)\n\nMY TIME: **** **3 minutes, 14 seconds.**\n\nTIME TO 2K CHECKPOINT: **1 minute 31 seconds**\n\nTIME FROM 2K CHECKPOINT TO FINISH LINE: **1 minute 43 seconds**\n\nThese checkpoint times aren\u0027t necessary, but i took them just for fun. If you like, you can do the same. I took the first checkpoint time right after i planted the flag, but before turning my car around.\n\n[**Download link for the Duna Buggy**](http://kerbalx.com/hobbes/Duna%20Buggy)\n\nWell, this was a long post, even for me...\n\nAnyway, hoping to see some submissions.\n\nGood luck!\n\n![podium.png](http://png-4.findicons.com/files/icons/2472/pretty_office_icon_set_part_7/128/podium.png)\n\n**LEADERBOARD**\n\n --- **** **Name** **** ----------- **Time** ----- **Additional notes**\n\n1.

We can use screenshots to determine starting time (when you **leave** the first flag) and finishing time (when you **return** to the first flag)\n\nIf you plan to keep count of your checkpoint time (when you place the second flag), keep in mind that the Kerbal on EVA has a reset mission clock, so the time will have to be taken upon his reentry in the vehicle.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Also, can we hyperedit? I\u0027m sure Uncle Jebby can get this thing to Duna somehow, but that would be the boring part...\n\nUnless others object to this, i suppose that\u0027s fine, on the condition that it\u0027s actually feasible to lift your vehicle off Kerbin and land it on Duna. Looking at your car, i think you won\u0027t have issues with that.\n\nThis precaution is mainly to avoid some sort of horizontal \u0022Kerbin-to-Jool sized rocket on wheels\u0022 that can\u0027t be transfered to the surface unless you\u0027ve got Scott Manleyness.\n\nI don\u0027t know anything about hyperedit, so obviously just keep your parts and physics legit. Personally, i enjoy the challenge of transferring stuff to other planets.\n\nSpeaking of transferring stuff, i\u0027m designing a garage to carry over to Duna. I\u0027ve never designed a building before on KSP, and it\u0027s actually pretty fun. I just have to figure out how to move this massive piece of shi...metal off the ground.\n\nThe finished version will be bigger, hoping to include other contestant\u0027s designs.\n\n![fz966d.jpg](http://oi62.tinypic.com/fz966d.jpg)\n\nI\u0027m glad to see people interested in this challenge.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E You could use [mediafire](https://www./) or [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/home) to upload the .craft file.

You\u0027re right of course, I misread the rules. Actually I can\u0027t say that the boys really did come to a full and complete stop after passing the 2000m flag, other than the fact that since they reversed direction their velocity at some point had to equal zero. I can\u0027t recall if I ever applied the brakes: I had lit the rockets in the air and turned the car around on its gyros. The rear bumper hit ground destroying the driver-side engine, so if velocity was zero at any point it was there.

Final time of 1:32. Here\u0027s the craft download if you want to confirm:\n\n[http://www./download/wc4pmb0w8kc3r3q/Duna\u002BRacifier.craft](http://www./download/wc4pmb0w8kc3r3q/Duna\u002BRacifier.craft)\n\nAction groups:\n\n1- Activate upward-facing engines\n\n2- Toggle forward engines\n\n3- Toggle reverse engines\n\nThe rover is extremely durable, with a collision tolerance of 80 m/s on most of the external parts, and can carry 2 Kerbals. One for going forward, one for going backwards. It uses plane wheels for moving under rocket power, so it doesn\u0027t break the rover wheels. On plane wheels, it has a maximum speed of about 90 m/s, above which you are liable to crash and die. Otherwise, it has to retract the plane wheels and use the rover wheels to move.\n\nI used Action Groups Extended during the run, so I didn\u0027t have to keep going back to the SPH every time I wanted to change my action groups, and the rover had a MechJeb pod. The craft download should be completely stock, though.\n\nIt took probably fifty tries before I got it right. I tumble, crashed, exploded, and died countless times. Something I learned: you \\*have\\* to be sure you aren\u0027t using those downward-facing rockets when you don\u0027t need them. Otherwise you run out of fuel and explode in the the last half-kilometer. And beware of speeds above 80 m/s. If you crash above 80, there\u0027s no recovering. I also tried to minimize my time spent planting the flag by planting it right in front of the seat. I can drive right over top of it without breaking it, and time when I\u0027m not moving is time wasted.\n\nAlbum:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

If you cross the finish line at a trillion m/s but still manage to bring it down to a full stop at some point and still have a drivable vehicle, that\u0027s fine.
