It\u0027s a failing in the program that causes the control system to not reverse the gimballing when the rockets are above the COM. I know in reality above or below makes little difference. In KSP the gimbals will fight other control methods when mounted like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a side note are there any radially mounted drogue chutes available outside a big mod? I think B9 or KW has it, but I was trying to cut down on larger mods in this and stick mostly with stock. Sometimes it\u0027s tricky to mount drogues on a ship when the inline structure is used for docking or staging leaving no-where to put the drogues. I end up radially mounting structural fuselage just to put drogues on, which add more struts to stabilize them. Means adding eight to ten parts just to put two drogues on a vessel! I know there was a separate mod for air brakes a while ago, might try that instead.

These heatshields are designed to aerobrake vessels at Duna and Kerbin (re-usable heatshields, at least until Kerbin, Maybe could be replaced after that), and some launches can\u0027t fit one of the heatshields on so I stacked a couple on some earlier flights, then left a spare in orbit to be picked up by later missions. There is no room for Heatshield addons on normal ITV or Habitat Lander launches from KSC. Others can stack one or two heatshields on.With the Destiny Lander I had difficulty making it usable, good for mining Kethane, and enough DV to mean it could carry useful amounts of fuel to orbit from Duna if neccessary. Thus it weighs in at over 50tons, but is launched dry at about 22tons, partially refilled at Duna from reserve ITV tanks and lands at IKE to mine Kethane and refuel itself and the ITVs. I wanted to do this without the launch dry and refuel with Kethane thing, but had to compromise on this for the Destiny Lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote, had difficulty using Ioncross (apart from the whole \u0027won\u0027t use oxygen when not an active vessel) as it actually weighs MORE for the transit to Duna than the supply packaging Sturmstiger suggested. Went with Ioncross for just the Habitat Landers and this is only used when landed on Duna with air intakes to give indefinite supplies on ground. In orbit and transfer between Kerbin and Duna all ships use supplies based on RCS which will be locked out once launched so they aren\u0027t accidentally used as RCS. The initial unmanned station DTS-1 carries 3750 Kerbin days of supplies to help later missions.

Nothing major, but 5way symmetry is impossible normally, and it goes up to 50way symmetry if I remember right.
