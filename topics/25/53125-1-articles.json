The idea is to build a craft capable of handling any kind of mission you throw at it and be able to adapt your craft to the different missions. To do this challenge, you first need to build a core space craft, there are no limitations on what parts you can use. If you use modded parts, list them. Once you build your core space craft, and this can even be something on the order of size as a space station, get it into orbit. Once it\u0027s in orbit, you have to adapt your craft to each challenge and complete the challenges in the order listed in the challenges list for the mission. Some things to keep in mind are the ability to add fuel for the mission and payload you have to transport, change out the engines, possibly land the entire craft on another planet and take off again, tow an SSTO to another planet, carry multiple rovers, crew, satellites. It must be capable of refueling. It doesn\u0027t have to do all of this all at once, you will add and take away different modules over time to adapt to the different missions. Don\u0027t use the debug option for part clipping, but if you push something into a strut or something along those lines then it\u0027s fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EAnnouncement: Anyone can join this challenge at any time and still get scored.

Meaning that once it\u0027s up in space, that\u0027s it. You can\u0027t return it to Kerban or revert flights. Only on challenges that specifically state that you must land on Kerban, are you ever allowed to land that craft on Kerban. No cheats or use of the debug menu is allowed at any time. No editing part files to put things in space for you or anything like that. All screenshots must show the mission time. All mods that you use have to be listed. If you use any mod other than Mech Jeb that uses some sort of flight control system, get it approved first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter you are done making your core craft, get it into orbit and submit a screenshot of it. After that screenshot is submitted, you may begin making parts for your craft for the first challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour core craft is the only thing that can have attachments. For example, if you build a rover, you have to dock that rover to your core craft and the core craft has to transport it. If you build a plane, that core craft has to transport that plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you lift any attachment into space along with your core craft at the time of the initial launch, you must keep and maintain that attachment. For example, if you attach a standardized lander unit to your craft, that lander must go wherever the core craft goes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll mission important components that you take with you must come back with you, or be retrievable from orbit unless otherwise specified by mission parameters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you change parts on the core craft, you must deorbit the old parts or suffer the score penalty for littering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew missions will be added once every two weeks and then the old mission will be erased. (This has changed for now until someone has completed the most recent mission)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your core craft is damaged during a mission and you manage to complete the mission and bring it back to Kerbin; you may then land it at the KSC for repairs.

The core craft will never touch a planet unless otherwise specified in the missions. You have to have a separate lander that you attach to your core craft for missions that require landings. If you lift another kerbal up to your core craft, you cannot leave that kerbal in the lander module, he has to join the rest of the crew in the core craft. Or the lander has to have an unmanned module when you dock it to your core craft. Think of your core craft as a small station of sorts. To add more crew, you have to add more to the craft.

I think the core craft should be more of a stand alone vessel, so it has to have a command module, room for attachments and it\u0027s own engines. I know I didn\u0027t really specify those kinds of limitations, but lets say that your core craft has to be capable of going to the Mun, achieving a Low Mun orbit of about 50,000 meters and then returning to LKO, to meet the core requirements. So you need a starting command module, starting fuel supply, and starting engines. So I think your craft would need a little bit more. The core craft can never land on another planet unless the mission says it has to. So all missions that require landings will require you to attach a separate lander to your core craft. So you\u0027ll have to land, take off, then dock it back at your core craft that remains in orbit. I added some core craft basic requirements to the rules to clarify what I was looking for in a core craft.

Once you launch it into orbit, you can then dock more sections to it if you wish. The core craft submission screenshot has to preform the test run to the Low Mun Orbit and back to LKO on it\u0027s own without any additional parts. After that, you may add attachments and rearrange them as much as you want. The example that I posted has lots of docking ports so I can add stuff to the craft, but that craft that\u0027s in the screenshot is all one piece and can\u0027t be separated, except for the engines on the bottom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the second question: I guess that does contradict. You can extend the core with core attachments, for example, you need to add a hitchhiker storage piece, on the top and bottom of that piece there will be docking ports. If you add a long engine and on that engine there are two more docking ports, then you added docking ports for more gear to be docked. Both situations are fine. I guess what I was trying to say is more along the lines of, you cannot stack gear with other gear. So you can\u0027t stack one satellite on the top of another satellite that\u0027s connected to a docking port on the ship. You have to equip your ship with enough ports to store all of the gear separately and not on top of itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the third question: No, and I\u0027ll add that to the rules now that you\u0027ve mentioned it. The Kerbals each have to be in their own command pod or in a hitchhiker bay. The only use of external command seats may be on landers or rovers. Limit of 2 for a lander and limit of 6 for a rover.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"700NitroXpress","CreatedById":90322,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-16T02:59:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hodo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hodo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe DX-1 Total the ship has a crew of 6, I think, I haven\u0027t checked in a minute, been busy playing another game online.

Your craft submission can\u0027t have any docked pieces to it and it has to be capable of preforming the Mun test run to low mun orbit and back to LKO without the aid of any attachments. However the craft that you have things docked to is fine to use as long as the main command part can do the Mun run and back on it\u0027s own. You can launch a duplicate to prove this without taking you craft apart if you wish. I believe your core craft is the top section with the four engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Carl","CreatedById":2645,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-16T03:10:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat your basically asking us to build in other words is a space tug for the core stage, and then we\u0027ll attach mission payloads to that?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
