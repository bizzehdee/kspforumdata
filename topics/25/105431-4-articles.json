Not sure if we should use the average of all those numbers, the lowest, or the highest. There are 3 sets of 3 \u0022sample shots\u0022, with heavy fuel, mid fuel, and lower fuel on board to sort of give a good idea of performance and also provide proof.

I\u0027m betting one of the implications of this will be that if you wanna go super fast, you have to go super high - you can only make stuff so sleek, then after that it\u0027s about finding thinner air. So it\u0027s like they\u0027re giving you the lift you need to get way up there and explore those upper regions, but you\u0027ll have to be very attentive to the drag profile of your craft, and perhaps sea level speed runs may be a less competitive option."},{"CreatedByName":"MunGazer","CreatedById":141954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T05:45:08Z","Content":"Oh uh, hey Slashy - I was just realizing, a good basic rule you might want to add for any of the competition categories is a guideline for the Re-Entry Heating setting in the difficulty options.

The first thing I noticed when I rolled down the runway, as I suspected, was that I was able to rotate a lot sooner and take off than before, and it seemed like I did in fact have 44% more lift for a given airspeed; I rotated at 60 something m/s, whereas with 1.0 it was like 80 or 90 something m/s that I was able to get off the runway.\n\nThen, I noticed that, again as expected, the increased drag kept me from accelerating as quickly; more throttle was used to climb/maintain airspeed, and of course there is more fuel consumption in the midst of all this. The drag increase does in fact dramatically reduce your acceleration and top speed. I was thinking - this is probably more realistic. In real life, as you approach 340 m/s or Mach 1, there should be a great deal of air pressure/resistance to deal with at very low altitude. I think I remember some basic physics that says that the air resistance increases with the square of the velocity, which would mean that 33% more drag would have profound effects with that exponential scaling. It made the craft feel very stiff and jerky with regard to control inputs - it\u0027s like the control surfaces, when deflected even a little, have a violent impact due to the more forceful impulse they impart on your aircraft with the increased drag and lift in the physics, and at the same time, it is also having to work against the rest of your aircraft\u0027s surfaces which are also providing stiff resistance to counter those forces. The end result is that your aircraft feels like it handles in a much more stiff and jerky manner than it did in 1.0, where it was buttery smooth. I feel like when I make a simple 5 degree change in pitch with a slight control deflection, the craft is oscillating wildly from that maneuver, \u0022bouncing\u0022 so to speak. I wish there was some way squad could make it a little smoother, I don\u0027t mind the velocity change and that it slowed down my ship some. Also, if I turned my SAS on for a simple 300 m/s 30 degree angle climb, the aircraft would oscillate continuously, pitching up and down rapidly. So I just turned it off and never touched it again.\n\nNext, I got up to around 25 kilometers and slowly approached 1250 m/s \u002B. I found it incredibly easy to maintain altitude, however avoiding overheating was much more difficult. My engines were the only parts that started overheating. All this was happening between 25 km and 27 km altitude. If I remember correctly, I think my speed was capping off at the mid 1300 m/s range. I expected this slower airspeed, but my main focus was on all the odd handling. Not difficult to handle, just much different than 1.0. Then at some point around 27 km \u002B, I didn\u0027t have enough lift anymore to keep climbing, so I thought ok I\u0027ll just maintain what I\u0027ve got. But that did not happen despite my hopes.\n\nI began descending because the effort to hold that slightly higher altitude of course resulted in increased drag and a dramatic, rapid drop in airspeed because of the control surface deflections and increased angle of attack. So you begin to drop like a rock. When you try to slow your descent by pulling back on the stick, you get punished harshly with drag and your airspeed drops even lower, so you dive more, and it\u0027s a vicious cycle. If you do like real life and kill the throttle, go nose down, you\u0027re screwed too because then you\u0027re going to accumulate too much airspeed and/or overheat. I also got all these little green life bars on my parts that appeared when I began to descend, and I\u0027m not sure what they represent. Heat? Damage? Stress?\n\nThen the crash happened. KSP.exe has stopped working. This has happened twice in a row, in both of my only two so far openings and attempts to play 1.0.2 and in the same situation - pulling back on the stick mildly in an effort to pull out of a dive while seeing all these life bars and with my engines having huge overheat bars despite the fact I shut them off long ago. At some point during that descent, that\u0027s when the crash occurs. It doesn\u0027t take long, something on the order of 15 seconds or so of that.\n\nSo, here\u0027s a review and a summarized version of the major problems so far with 1.0.2:\n\n1. Game crashes consistently (stock and unmodded) within at least one reproducible scenario.\n\n2. Control deflections for aerodynamic parts result in extremely violent moments of force on the craft despite reduced control input sensitivity.\n\nEdit: I was obviously upset at the changes and crashes at the time I made this post. Please take my confirmation biases and misunderstandings here with a grain of salt.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T07:32:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 07:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MunGazer**"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T13:30:13Z","Content":"All,\n\n I\u0027m going to have to reset the competition in light of the atmospheric changes in 1.01 and now 1.02.\n\n I\u0027m learning the new aero, so I may be a bit slower to respond here.\n\n Please bear with me!\n\n-Slashy"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T16:32:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I began descending because the effort to hold that slightly higher altitude of course resulted in increased drag and a dramatic, rapid drop in airspeed because of the control surface deflections and increased angle of attack.

Maybe I can\u0027t even use that old craft file. Despite that though, I guess I\u0027ll stay at it but if it keeps crashing even with a fresh install and save there won\u0027t be a whole lot I can do. I\u0027m going to try again without using the old .craft, maybe that will solve the problem.\n\nEdit: Ok, I tried a brand new save, and a brand new build, not importing the old .craft file. I basically rebuilt the sojourn from visual references. The game crashed again mid flight. I was about 9 minutes into my flight, at about 25,500 meters altitude. My velocity was about 1,532 m/s. I was holding steady. I had some heat bars eventually show up on all my parts, but they were stable - the thing that started getting hottest was the intakes. Since I wasn\u0027t at the much higher altitude of 27 km and a higher AOA, my engines didn\u0027t get too hot this time around. As more and more parts started getting those little life bars, the game seemed to start having these small hiccups that got more and more frequent, as before. Then, it froze really hard and \u0022KSP.exe has stopped working\u0022. So, it appears that I can easily reproduce this crash time and again, and it so far appears to be an impossible crash to avoid unless I avoid all those little life bars appearing. It\u0027s like KSP is having trouble as a result of those heat bars updating. So, hopefully this will get fixed in the next patch. Other than that, I\u0027d say the sojourn is still performing well. I just won\u0027t be able to compete at all until the game quits crashing. See you guys then!
