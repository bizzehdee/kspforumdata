I didn\u0027t document the journey, as it wasn\u0027t for a challenge, but I can easily make it a bit bigger to seat the extra Kerbals and send it again. Also, I just realized it doesn\u0027t have a xenon tank, because I don\u0027t use Ion vessels (or nukes, for that matter). It has \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003Elf\u003C/abbr\u003E/o and monopropellent though, because it is also a mobile refueler for Moho landers.

So I was thinking that maybe it would be a good idea to split this up into two separate challenges. One would be focused on building a \u0022practical\u0022 mobile base that would be a useful mobile lab in career mode, the other would be more of an anything goes, with bigger the better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe practical science bases would use lowest mass as their base score. Bonus points would be awarded for features like suborbital hop ability,\u00A0being amphibious, or having a dockable smaller science rover/hopper to go out and grab samples. This challenge would have required parts of a science lab, space for 3 kerbals (engineer plus two scientists for the lab), one of each science experiment, and the ability to be self-sufficient. If it\u0027s purely electric driven, then \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E and fuel is unnecessary. If the base is powered by jet engines or rockets (like an amphibious base, or one capable of very high speeds using landing gear), or capable of suborbital hops or has a dockable vehicle that uses the fuel, then it needs to have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E so it can be fully self-sufficient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe anything goes challenge would be more about building big, with different categories for single-launch and assembled-in-orbit. In this case, the larger base wins with bonus points for aesthetics\u00A0(not sure how to objectively score this though) and features like the ability to pack up and fly back into orbit. Think Atlantis from Stargate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll bases should have electric wheels they can use for low-speed maneuvering. This goes for amphibious bases as well so they can drive out of the water.

It would combine the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to get to the planet (from the KSP \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E maps) with the planet\u0027s surface gravity and atmosphere. Additionally, it would consider the difficulty of navigating to the planet. Kerbin\u0027s moon are relatively very easy to navigate to and wouldn\u0027t get any navigation bonus, any of the planets beyond Kerbin would get a respectable bonus, and a moon of another planet would get even a larger bonus.
