(Badly drawn pain pic coming later on).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically you land something really light on the Mun. Your lander will have a ring like hook thing streching into the air (Doesn\u0027t matter how big it is, but weight is an issue). Then you\u0027ll put a hook thing to orbit the Mun and grab the lander and take it to orbit. Your lander wont have thrusters or fuel, must carry atleast 1 Kerbal. The weight of the orbital hook doesn\u0027t matter, personal prefference, unbreakable links (or w\\e in the debug menu) is allowed, but would like to see someone manage it without it. The orbital hook must keep an orbit while hooking (no slowing down, grabbing and then speeding up). Also I\u0027d say don\u0027t use mods or modded parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVideos would be awesome (even attempts)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-23T07:53:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll go ahead and say that this is impossible.

I don\u0027t see how you could make something that would lithobrake on the mun light enough to survive with a kerbal in it and land with the hook in an upright position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA better challenge would to be pose this as an emergency rescue scenario.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour one man lander has been damaged in someway and cannot fire its rockets. KSC planned for this situation and installed the Kulton Skyhook recovery system on both the lander and CM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe CM can\u0027t land for various reasons, no landing legs and/or too heavy, but it can approach the surface at a low speed and catch the LM\u0027s hook with its own hook. If you brought the CM in slow enough you should be able to hook the LM without breaking anything. Assuming you can design a hook that will actually hold the LM as it flops around at liftoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBonus points to make it more like the Fulton system if you can figure out a way to use a winch from the KAS and sepatrons to fire the winch line up for the CM to catch. Not sure if that last part is doable with the way switching between ships is done at low altitudes and how physics load is set at approach distances. I think you would have to put the CM in an extremely low orbit, then switch to the LM and time the launch of the winch so that the CM reaches it before it falls back down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a 100% doable using the magnet on KAS to grab the LM but I don\u0027t know if you can design a hook with stock parts that won\u0027t let go as you accelerate to orbital speed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
