I made this because airplanes, where they\u0027re possible, have a lot of advantages for exploring large areas compared to rovers and multiple lander hops. Doing this was by far the greatest design challenge I\u0027ve come across so far in over 300 hours of playing, and it resulted in something not only quite useful but also fun. So, if you want to cover long distances on Duna, or create an air service to ferry Kerbals or whatever between your scattered bases there, you might want to try making a Duna airplane yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDesign Requirements:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The vehicle must create its lift by the motion of aerodynamic surfaces through air. So, airplanes and helicopters are OK, things held up by rockets and balloons are not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The vehicle must be capable of being delivered from the ground on Kerbin to the ground on Duna. However you get it there, apart from HyperEdit, is fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. On Duna, the vehicle must be able to take off under its own power from a location with an altitude of at least 2500m and be able to climb to and maintain an altitude of at least 5000m. Higher is better\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. The vehicle must have sufficient range to fly at least 1/4 of the way around Duna and return to base, or at least 1/2way around Duna to another base. Longer range is better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. The vehicle must be capable of indefinite use without further support from Kerbin. IOW, if it burns fuel, you have to be able to refuel it on Duna, and it must be able to make repeated flights, so no jettisoning parts to enable single flights. If the vehicle has parachutes, you must provide access to them so Kerbals can repack them between flights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. The vehicle must be able to carry at least 2 Kerbals. More is better, as is enclosed seating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. The vehicle needs to be able to land in short, fairly rough places to enable ground examination in any area of potential interest.

They\u0027re hard to see but there are 6 of the radial Kethane tanks on top of the lower wing, carefully positioned so as not to affect CoM as they drain. The generator has the virtue of only kicking on as needed, like the gas-burning engine in my Prius. The solar panels do most of the work but I have the Kethane for extra power if needed, for when the sun\u0027s at a bad angle, and for night operations. The generator is in the rear fuselage just in front of the tail fins. All this feeds 2 of the Firespitter electric motors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mk 1 fuselage tubes, the wings, and the 16 air brakes are from B9. The main landing gear and the small wheels under the wingtips are from TT\u0027s Multiwheels, and the tailwheel (this is a taildragger to save weight) is also from Firespitter. There are also some of the B9 omnilights scattered around. The fuselage ends in a flat surface where the stage separator for the delivery rocket used to be, and the KAS docking ports are back there. It seats 2 Kerbals in lawn chairs on the nose.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-19T16:41:36Z\u0022 title=\u002208/19/2013 04:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Geschosskopf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T07:19:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhoops, I spoke too soon here. D\u0027OH is right :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYup, it flies on Duna just fine, but I can\u0027t get the damn thing off the ground at Kerbin yet. I thought I\u0027d already done that, but it must have been an earlier version. Anyway, it\u0027s got so much lift that when put atop a rocket, it either pulls the whole rocket over or breaks off. So, I\u0027m pursuing 2 alternative methods. 1 is to build a big winged jet/rocket stage for a horizontal take-off, a sort of quasi-SSTO. As usual with my SSTOs, this ALMOST works but not enough rocket delta-V left to circularize at the top. I\u0027m thinking I can make this work eventually but it\u0027s such a pain, just like SSTOs. The other method is to add some detachable downforce plates under the D\u0027OH for a vertical launch. This is showing promise, in that I\u0027ve got it narrowed down to a range of plate size and angle. Too little and the same problem happens as before. Too much and the thing goes the other way. Maybe some linear RCS up there, too, although I want to avoid that because it would be a permanent addition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut anyway, until I can meet the requirements myself, this is on hold.

I was up till 0300 this morning struggling with various ways of launching the D\u0027OH. I might have to try launching the D\u0027OH sideways or backwards like that, although as this whole this is about the aerodynamics, I can\u0027t help but feel such non-aerodynamic launches go against the spirit of it all. But OTOH, the real point is to overcome the aerodynamic issues of Duna\u0027s thin, noncombustible air; the realization that Kerbin\u0027s thick air could cause a problem on the other end was an unexpected surprise, in that I thought I\u0027d overcome it long ago.

So technically, if you used Orbital Construction to replace the aerodynamic problem of Kerbin with the tedium of building the orbital shipyard and sending up all the needed materials, that would be OK, too. The Kerbin issue wasn\u0027t originally part of the idea anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what do you think?

Build your plane and stick a small de-orbit booster on it, then use HyperEdit to put it into your desired orbit at Duna (say about 45-50km). Then use the booster to start you down the desire path, ditch the booster, and fly it from there. That way, you can learn how well it enters the atmosphere and how to slow it down for a safe landing. And if you get past that, then you can see if you can take off again and how well you can fly. Think of this as the guys back at KSC running a simulator. You do this in a separate game from your real stuff, then copy over the craft files when you\u0027re happy with them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust be careful doing this. If you clutter up Duna\u0027s orbit with a bunch of different test planes that you HyperEdited there, you might forget which ones you launch-tested and which ones you just HyperEdited straight from KSC, so you\u0027ll end up like me with something that flies great on Duna but is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to launch from Kerbin \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. Although I did manage to get it off the ground after several launches using the Orbital Construction mod. But seeing your fancy tinkering above, that makes me feel like I weaseled out of part of the challenge, even if the Kerbin side wasn\u0027t the original intent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, one of the major issues with flying on Duna is getting slow enough to land safely, especially if you want to land within walking distance of a chosen spot (your base, an anomaly, etc.). Because the air is so thin, any given wing has to be moving relatively fast to generate enough lift to fly. But there doesn\u0027t seem to be anything resembling level ground on Duna these days. There are very occasional spots that are only slightly sloped but they tend to be only about 100m wide, all surrounded by rather big, rolling sand dunes of variable height and the valleys between them which make up the bulk of the terrain. This puts a premium on managing to fly slow in thin air, which apart from using VTOL-type thrusters means you have to have a really big wing on as light a plane as you can build, which makes the whole thing big and difficult to launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing about this thin air is that even if your plane can fly slow in it, the air won\u0027t slow it down very quickly, and the low gravity reduces the effectiveness of brakes. So, even if your plane can land at about 30m/s with the brakes already locked when it touches, you\u0027ll still roll and bounce about 500m, and it goes up rapidly for higher landing speeds. This will take you up and down at least a couple of dunes. If you\u0027re plane\u0027s only about 30m/s and built tough, it can usually survive this treatment OK, but higher speeds can easily make you faceplant in the side of the dune ahead, plus you end up miles from your landing target. So, there seems to be a need to either be able to fly very slow (for Duna) and/or have retro rockets, drag chutes, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the D\u0027OH in one of its test flights on Duna. I built it as part of this Kethane-based long-term mission I\u0027m doing so, so I copied that saved game over to another one so I could build the thing to fit what I\u0027ve already got on the ground, in this case a Kethane refueling station at 2500m. In this case, the D\u0027OH arrived via HyperEdit as described above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NgvbQd7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022NgvbQd7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can\u0027t read the fine print, I\u0027m about 17km from my base about to start my descent. I\u0027ve found I have to chop throttle and pop the 16 air brakes at about 5km out to have much hope of stopping anywhere close. But the plane can taxi up and down dunes OK so I\u0027m happy ending up within about 1-2km \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here\u0027s one of my failed attempts to get it off the ground.

On the back is a stage with the huge rear wings and the jet engines. The middle stage is rockets and a docking port so the thing could link up with an interplanetary tug once in orbit. But the rear wings are necessary all the way through the atmosphere, so what happens when the jets finally die is I drag the rockets down into their stage so the rockets can fire while the wings are still attached. Then ditch the wings and jets once above 70km to expose the docking port and give the rockets less mass to push.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs with most of my spaceplanes, however, there just never seems to be quite enough rocket fuel. I could get it out of the air but it was always sub-orbital after many attempts. GEEZ, I hate spaceplanes.

That was the main purpose for the RCS tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are absolutely right about the thin air on Duna making it quite a challenge to slow down. That\u0027s the purpose of the parachutes.

It has enough wing surface to just get over the mountains on Duna and still fly slow enough to take-off from 4000 meter altitude on Duna. Have to stay under 60 to keep the tires from popping. Yet it could rover around and climb like a rover if needed. It\u0027s hard to see in the pictures but Glider F has two \u0022wing seats\u0022 for extra passengers. One of the other models has an extra outside seat too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA tip you might could use on getting one to space is to put the rocket engines about the center of the plane\u0027s COG. Let the wings act as rocket fins to help stabalize the whole structure as it goes up. Once it\u0027s out of the atmosphere it no longer matters on the wings but CG of the rocket/plane system needs to be pretty close. In my case, the wings already had a 5 degree incline to assist in level flight as a plane. So at lift-off I would put the nose at about 5 to 10 degrees toward east because the wings were trying to assist in lifting the craft the other direction just a bit. I couldn\u0027t go over too far until the air got thin because if you try to turn over too soon, the wings would \u0022hold up the ass\u0022 and the nose would go over too soon. So basically the flight path up was not going to be optimal for fuel use. Basically it goes 10 degrees all the way to 20k then prograde to 40k.

The reason I hadn\u0027t offered it before is because none of those planes in the photos I\u0027ve posted out perform the 6SKK from my company thread. But, the 6SKK doesn\u0027t do Duna well from my own estimation. I haven\u0027t tried it there yet but from flight characteristics of its performance on Kerbin and Laythe, I would think it doesn\u0027t have enough wing surface for Duna. But a modified version could be easily made for Duna though. And if I were to want another plane on Duna, that\u0027s what I would do, modify the 6SKK for a Duna version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike I said earlier, it\u0027s nice to see some one taking an interest in Duna planes.

If you look close, you can see the big wings are attached to radial separators mounted on the small I-beams. The whole engine/intake/fuel tank assembly between the big wings is attached to the tail of the D\u0027OH with an inline separator, and there\u0027s a Clamp-O-Tron Sr. centered on the rear for the interplanetary tug to attach to. Despite all the separators, this is an SSTO. The plan: to get safely in orbit then ditch the big wings, then send up one of my standard interplanetary tugs to dock on and push it to Duna. At Duna, the tug puts the D\u0027OH in a 50km orbit then detaches and goes on to other things, leaving the SABREs in the remains of the SSTO assembly with just enough delta-V to de-orbit.

Hell, this one even flew itself off the runway and settled into a nice climb all by itself (one of the benefits of being a tail-dragger, I suppose). Of course, being so big and heavy, it was in no hurry to pick up speed, although it climbed like a champ at very low pitch angles due to all that wing.

Never having used SABREs, part of the purpose of this flight was to determine where they flamed out, so I could work around that in subsequent attempts.

Nothing broke off in all this but I\u0027m not surprised; I build my ships tough because the pilot\u0027s usually been drinking \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, switching quickly to the map view, keeping 1 eye on the resources tab and the other on my apoapsis, I cut power when I saw I\u0027d reach 77km and still had what looked like enough bars left to circularize. So I set up an Ap node while still at about 50km which, by the time I got to it, was off-target a bit. My 77km Ap ended up being my 72km Pe and the burn gave me an 80km Ap on the other side of Kerbin. GOOD E-(explicative deleted)-NUFF! So I ditched the big wings after this burn:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kVirYYn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kVirYYn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I had just enough dV to circularize at 80km with 113m/s to spare. Yay me! Next time, I\u0027ll switch to rocket mode at 25.5km so I won\u0027t waste fuel stopping the off-center flameout gyrations \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/E65SK0w.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022E65SK0w.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen it was just launching my standard interplanetary tug with my standard 30-ton lifter and have it dock with the D\u0027OH which, not having any RCS, made the tug do all the work. But it\u0027s built for that and more. So I ended up with this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vPoaAdy.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vPoaAdy.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4600m/s dV is enough to go almost anywhere so I figure I\u0027ve got the problem solved, given the D\u0027OH can handle everything on the Duna end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting this cow into orbit was at least as hard as making it fly on Duna. All in all, as Sherlock Holmes used to say, it was a \u0022two-pipe problem\u0022.

Um, er, what? Oh, let me check. Let\u0027s see, in the parallel universe of the Kethane Travelling Circus, it\u0027s Y1D135. According to Alexmoon\u0027s web site, the 2nd Wave won\u0027t be able to leave until Y1D290. That day will see the depature of the D\u0027OH, its support bowser, and some Kerbals to pump gas and fix flats. All this will attempt to land within at least a few Kms of the kethane drill/habitat module already down there. Now that I\u0027ve got all the components working, most of this should happen very quickly once I have time to play again, which won\u0027t be until this coming weekend.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
