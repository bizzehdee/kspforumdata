Like orbiting with a single stage of solid rocket boosters or trying to max out the G-meter on lift off. Or this one that I came up with last night. Just make it to space only using RCS as thrust. No other engines may be used but RCS. My record is 45,000 ish meters. I\u0027m going to go with it being impossible to orbit like this but I think escaping the atmosphere is possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gojira","CreatedById":10884,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T20:12:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll have this done quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T23:07:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis has been done before I\u0027m afraid. I don\u0027t know if linear RCS thrusters are fixed in this version but they were certainly buggy in the previous version - a set of eight attached to one fuel tank would hit 300,000m altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_Barrett","CreatedById":3206,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T23:15:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERCS to Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bluejayek","CreatedById":18471,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-26T02:28:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tim_Barrett\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tim_Barrett\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERCS to Jool.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoring.
