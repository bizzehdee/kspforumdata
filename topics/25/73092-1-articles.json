Save Jebadiah Kerman, who is on course to collide with kerban. You need a rocket that can reach him, rendezvous, take him aboard and bring him back to kerban safely. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe scenario files are here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a quicksave file for starting altitudes of 1,2, and 3 thousand km.

What remained useable was the second stage(in space, it had two stages, the lower one with several ion engines to provide a bearable amount of thrust), and 2 small solar panels(the other solar panels also exploded). A heroic effort involving waiting over 4 years, throttling down to 45% thrust, and inching towards kerban at the world record slowest speed, almost saved our brave kerbalnaut... However, doom was soon to befall him, as he slightly, er, undershot the planet(or overshot?) and ended up on a collision course with kerban. Seeing as 45% thrust wasn\u0027t enough to establish an orbit once the error was discovered and there was no parachute on the spacecraft, Bill was doomed. Despite our best efforts of launching rockets randomly towards his direction when he was at an altitude of 500,000m, he died that day. This scenario is essentially a recreation of that fateful drop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis should be feasible, I have been able to launch straight up towards a target, decelerate rapidly, and rapidly accelerate to over 4000 m/s in the opposite direction, then land the final stage with a parachute, with stock parts minus mecjeb(didn\u0027t even use it). That took me a little over 8 minutes total, the challenge being to rendezvous with the target within the short window period of time and transfer the crew. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Nr14r\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
