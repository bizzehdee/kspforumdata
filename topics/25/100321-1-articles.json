The SSTO must be capable of horizontal take-off and landing (you don\u0027t have to use the rough runway, the grass is fine). and must be capable of reaching at least a 70km stable orbit (Pe\u003E69km), and have enough fuel to return to the KSC and land. The idea here is to have a reusable spaceplane that is good for \u0027Science data from space around Kerbin\u0027, Rescue missions, and light part testing in an early stage career game.\n\n**That means:**\n\n- Maximum part count: 30 parts\n\n- Maximum mass: 18 tons\n\n- Maximum height: 20m\n\n- Maximum width: 15m\n\n- Maximum Length 15m \n\n- Maximum part tech level - Tier 5 (essentially, any part you can research at the un-upgraded R\u0026D center)\n\n**What is allowed:**\n\n- Informational mods (e.g. MechJeb/Kerbal engineer) or cosmetic mods (e.g. cloud mods, etc)\n\n- Clipping, except for fuel tanks and engines\n\n- Any and all abuse of the offset tool is not only allowed, but encouraged!\n\n**What not allowed:**\n\n- Upgrading \\_any\\_ buildings at the KSC\n\n- Any mod parts except for information only parts (e.g. MechJeb)\n\n- Dropping engines or any structure during the flight. This is an SSTO spaceplane challenge.\n\n**Winning conditions**\n\n- Anybody who can do this challenge is a winner. The grand champion has the highest delta-v on reaching orbit.\n\n- Please post a picture of your craft on the ground, flying and in orbit, and the F3 information screen once you have landed \n\n**Some things to consider when designing your spaceplane:**\n\n- No resource transfers are allowed at tier 1. Think about your fuel flow and balance, and whether you plan to restart engines for the approach into KSC. (if you\u0027re a hotshot glider pilot, that\u0027s ok too)\n\n- The runway is rough, the grass is a little smoother so plan your landing gear design with this in mind.\n\nPlease include a link to your .craft file so that others (including me!) can try out your designs\n\nFAR/NEAR. I have no idea if this is possible in FAR or NEAR, but feel free to have a go. FAR/NEAR entries will be listed separately.\n\n**Winners**\n\nGoSlash27 917ms\n\nBatz10K 536ms\n\nMicromars Completed\n\nStarhawk Completed\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-24T18:03:02Z\u0022 title=\u002202/24/2015 06:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Batz\\_10K**\n  \nUpdate leaderboard"},{"CreatedByName":"MircoMars","CreatedById":61811,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T21:28:33Z","Content":"I never build spaceplanes in my early career, but I had to give it a try.\n\nI came up with a crazy 2 turbo, 1 srb, 2 48-7s pointed forward design. It made orbit once, but my pilot skills are not that consistent. and since that was technically a test run, I didn\u0027t make enough screenshots... (not one in orbit \\*facepalm)\n\nif you guys wanna try, the flightprofile is like:\n\n1- taxi to flat gras and orient east\n\n2- full throttle, at 110m/s pitch up and use landing gear to get her fat arse in the air airborne\n\n3- pitch to ~65\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 until 15km\n\n4- pitch down a bit, but not under 40\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 or SRB will push her down\n\n5- ignite SRB at 20km (before flame-out), throttle down turbos (don\u0027t try to shut them down!). at SRB cutout AP should be 85km (\u002B-10km depending on pitch)\n\n6- while coasting: shutdown turbojets, activate forward tanks, activate 48s, turn nose retrograde when out of atmo\n\nthe rest is trivial. she glides pretty well (as the 2nd pic shows) and the turbos will have fuel left, so landing is no problem\n\n[.craft](http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=51908989153076853762)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
