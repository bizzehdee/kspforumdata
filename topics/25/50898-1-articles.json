If you can launch a craft that generates at least 500 E/s of electricity and has a satellite dish, we can beam the energy back to a receiver at the space center and power the space complex. The station needs to roughly orbit the equator. If the station is in keostationary orbit, the engineers can continue working 24/7; but if not they will work during the half-time that the station is overhead providing power. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERequirements:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least 500 E/s electrical generation while in sunlight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least 1 satellite dish\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReach (roughly) equatorial orbit over Kerbal Space Center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESubmit an image of the craft in orbit while producing power, preferably taken from the angle of the sun (that makes it much easier to count the solar panels).
