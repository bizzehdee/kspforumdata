While I\u0027m a noob, let me know what you think of this idea for a challenge\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChallenge: Jebadiah Kerman\u0027s long lost, ultra rich Warren Kerman uncle desperately needs a tax break and has decided to take advantage of an obscure loophole in the Kerbal tax code that allows a 100% tax credit for personal research and development. As such, he\u0027s decided to fund a mission to the planets to write off as much as he can, but he can only manage to save as much as he can return in science value\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERules:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0) 0.23 stock parts only. No mods that allow performance improvements, extra science or similar. Mechjeb, Engineer and the like are ok. No console cheats\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) One launch only: Warren doesn\u0027t have time to build multiple ships before the tax man cometh. The ship may come apart into pieces such as landers after launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Jebadian Kerman must be on the mission. You may bring as many Kerbals beyond him as you wish\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScoring: \u002B1 point for every science point the mission brings home, either by recovering the ship on Kerbin or transmission. (screenshot for instrument transmission\u002B screenshot of recovery as proof)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1000 for each unique planet (including Kerbin) scanned with at least one instrument from space\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1000 for each unique planet (including Kerbin) scanned with at least one landed instrument. Instrument must return non-zero science to count. (A crashed unmanned lander without antenna would not count even if instruments were working, for example)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B500 for each unique moon scanned with at least one instrument from space\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B500 for each unique moon scanned with at least one landed instrument, same non-zero science requirement\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-1000 for each Kerbal stranded on a planet/moon/in orbit \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-5000 for each Kerbal KIA\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDifficulty: since science only works in career mode, this might take some time to plan. To get enough science to manage serious missions you have to burn through most of the \u0022easy\u0022 stuff like Kerbin orbit, Mun and Minimus landings and so forth. There will be a balance past that point- to get some of the goodies like the higher tech instruments or the Mainsail engine requires a lot of science, so you might have to do this without a lot of tech higher up the tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to criticize or offer suggestion; I\u0027ve been having fun trying to work my way through the tree from scratch as a player and I\u0027ve enjoyed reading the challenges. I\u0027m curious if anyone thinks this one interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T02:04:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forum.

Once I get some of them back I\u0027m going to give this a try- my biggest challenge right now is not having the Mainsail and some of the advanced construction parts, so my heavy lifters are pretty awful and under the rules I can\u0027t use my refueling stations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as the challenge, I\u0027m interested in the trade off between easy science and maxing out the tech tree, as well as the challenge of building a large, multipurpose ship. (My current ships aren\u0027t much more than minimal setups with a nuke engine and as many experiments as I can fit/power) If it doesn\u0027t work feel free to let me know\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alicelewis","CreatedById":98859,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T06:30:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI want to say Thanks sharing such a nice link.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
