As for your question on if I have tried it personaly, it is on my to do list to see how tall I can make one, however due to my current hardware limitations I cannot expect to get close to the goal of 2km tall as the sheer number of pieces needed is too much for my system at this time, therefore when I do mine I don\u0027t expect to be at the top of the leaderboard.
