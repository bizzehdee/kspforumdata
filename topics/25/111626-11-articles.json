Not because I don\u0027t want to recognize people who do it but because most people doing grand tours now are using ISRU (In Situ Resource Utilization - that means the drills, ore tanks, and converter). If you do want to do a grand tour without refueling, it is a seriously tough challenge that only few players have accomplished. And *not a single one since KSP 1.0*. I have an attempt in progress but it\u0027s slow going. Done the Mun and Minmus so far, but I might not have enough xenon to finish.\n\nISRU and Jeb\u0027s level pose different kinds of challenges. Jeb\u0027s level is more of a classic science/career style if you\u0027ve played before KSP 1.0, while ISRU uses the new parts and refueling to hop from moon to moon. You can also gather science on the ISRU level if you want and your total will be noted in the leaderboard.\n\nA grand tour in Jeb\u0027s level still needs to follow all the rules. That means no ISRU."},{"CreatedByName":"Crazy-Engineer","CreatedById":152014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-12T08:20:58Z","Content":"b9 aerospace has been updated to 1.0.2: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104966-1-0-2-B9-Aerospace-Procedural-Parts-0-40-Updated-09-06-15](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104966-1-0-2-B9-Aerospace-Procedural-Parts-0-40-Updated-09-06-15)\n\nBut im still seeing b9 aerospace listed in orange\n\nEdit: I noticed this is only the procedural parts ![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif) , sorry and just ignore this post.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-12T10:47:18Z\u0022 title=\u002210/12/2015 10:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Crazy-Engineer**"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceplaneAddict","CreatedById":149322,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-14T12:59:48Z","Content":"Astobond, you had the basis for an AWESOME ship.
