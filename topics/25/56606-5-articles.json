It flew very well with tanks full; I managed a clean powered landing with both 1/2 and 1/3 throttle.

I honestly never knew about it being bad when empty when looking at it in the SPH the COM is way far in front of the COL, but I guess it could go further back (normally I refuel in orbit so I never actually got to test the low fuel landing). I say for a first attempt building an SSTO, well this was built before .23 released, it is not to bad for my first attempt. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T02:51:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@inigma\u003C/strong\u003E Welcome to the challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) A very informative video.

We don\u0027t clip fuel tanks of the same time either, and all tanks must not be over clipped where they are invisible and inaccessible (for anticheat and refueling reasons).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, for the record, using the RAPIER to feather acceleration with the Turbo Jet isn\u0027t bug or cheat. In fact, it\u0027s the same principle as simply throttling down one engine versus another in any plane. Since KSP doesn\u0027t provide multiple engine throttle controls (yet), toggling the RAPIER while cruising with a Turbo Jet at high altitude is the equivalent of managing two separate engine throttles since all you\u0027re doing is flaming out your TJE toggling your RAPIER off, and then waiting for the TJE to flame back on, and during its low throttle warm up, re-enngaging the faster warm-up RAPIER for continued push thus maximizing the thrust potential of both engines in tandem. On a real life SSTO, a computer would simply automatically adjust the combined thrust for maximum efficiency. I don\u0027t see how it\u0027s a cheat more than a way to take advantage of two separate engine\u0027s strengths (TJE\u0027s slow warm up and higher thrust at high alt, and the RAPIER\u0027s fast warm up period but lower thrust at high alt). The pairing is beautiful in my opinion. It essentially gives any plane the opportunity to choose to manage one\u0027s TWR to either increase altitude or gain faster speed, but not both at the same time. Balancing the two is what feathering the RAPIER does until doing so becomes inefficient (you start to waste fuel) above 2000 m/s and 34km.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-01T00:39:44Z\u0022 title=\u002201/01/2014 12:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by inigma\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-01T10:27:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Blaster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Blaster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EKermaJet KR100 Kodachi, a modification of the 102 Duchess.
