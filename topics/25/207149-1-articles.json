As soon as I mastered the stock game, I installed kerbalism, so that all the trappings of life support would give me a good reason to make ships bigger and more complex.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I made a grand tour, with some facilitations. Then I asked myself,\u00A0 what next?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I made another grand tour, at hard mode, without facilitations. Then I asked myself, what next?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I installed OPM, and I made another grand tour. It lasted six months in real life. Just refueling the ship took decades every time. Then I took a hiatus, because I needed a pause from large ships at that time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut now I need another challenge, and I want another large system to take with a large ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExcept after last time I don\u0027t know what more I can do, so I\u0027m here looking for advice.

Problems; I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s actually doable with a reusable ship, given the deltaV requirements. and there\u0027s all the mess with cryogenic fuel boiloff. I also don\u0027t know about mod compatibility. finally, the last time the game lagged badly enough, i fear this could be a lot worse\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- planet pack grand tour. for this i\u0027d like a nice planet pack, with variety. must be compatible with kerbalism and its resource allocation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- OPM grand tour hard mode. skipping the inner moons of Sarnus because of the radiation levels. Problem: I\u0027ve done it already, this would be the same with more stuff breaking up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- others.
