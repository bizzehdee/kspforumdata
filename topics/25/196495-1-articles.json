It\u0027s easy enough to send a few sats to orbit the Mun and provide good relay coverage for the farside, but you could also \u003Cem\u003Eland\u003C/em\u003E a network of relays to do the same thing at far greater cost!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo why would you want a series of relays on the surface of the farside of the Mun? Well, as the analogy for the Earth\u0027s Moon, let\u0027s assume that stable orbits are a problem we want to work around, There\u0027s also the station-keeping that all real sats need to do with limited fuel. So there could be a real-world application if it could be done practically (which is doubtful with the cost and difficulty of landing).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s my example of one such farside surface relay network:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Qt8W1kE.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Qt8W1kE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022tAzjU6D.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/tAzjU6D.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022UeCDZI9.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/UeCDZI9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile I had fun doing these missions, I figured that others could do it better and I want to see that!

You only need to do an equatorial relay network - i.e. you don\u0027t need to cover high inclinations. Land the network, post a pic or vid demonstrating that you are communicating through the surface relays, and claim your patch! One caveat, \u0022Occlusion Modifier, Vac:\u0022 must be set to the default (0.90) or higher. (This is a setting from the start new game menu under the advanced game difficulty settings, so if you didn\u0027t touch those in your current game then it should be fine.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022CoJIf6R.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/CoJIf6R.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow for some additional competition parameters!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nMost Hops Trophy: awarded for the vessel with a periapsis above 10 km that takes the most Mun surface hops to communicate back to Kerbin. You can set \u003Cspan\u003E\u0022Occlusion Modifier: Vac:\u0022 \u003C/span\u003Eas high as you want for this challenge, but let us know what you set it to. Your network still needs to meet the criteria for the basic badge (i.e. must cover the entire farside for orbits above 10 km). \u003Cs\u003EGiven that you will be able to communicate through a significant portion of the Mun\u0027s crust, the challenge will be in figuring out how to position the relays and your orbit far enough apart to force more hops.\u003C/s\u003E This is about the opposite of efficiency!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBig Dropper Trophy: awarded for the mission that deliveries the highest number of landed relays deployed by one lander/skycrane (without resupplying the vessel with additional relays)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLoS Decoration: Build a realistic line-of-sight (LoS) Mun farside network. \u003Cs\u003EThe game might not make use of all your relays, but show us how they have LoS around the Mun.\u003C/s\u003E Set \u003Cspan\u003E\u0022Occlusion Modifier: Vac:\u0022 to 1.0 or higher in the advanced game difficulty settings (new game start) and then create a functioning surface relay network. \u003C/span\u003EAnyone that does this gets the basic patch with a special decoration for their achievement.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRealistic Relay Trophy: Design the most realistic relay station. Stations on the real Moon would have to contend with high and low temps, would need to be low mass but very stable, and would need a realistic power source.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nExtra-Kerbin Decoration: Build a surface relay systems outside of Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E to either communicate back to Kerbin or to the primary body (e.g. Ike farside to Duna).

Only it\u0027s not actually quite exact, apparently because KSP is using a different (probably a lot coarser) terrain mesh for occlusion testing than for actual rendering. But it\u0027s pretty close. In theory, on a perfectly smooth round body (like the polar ice caps of Kerbin or the flats of Minmus) with occlusion at 1.00, surface stations should not be able to connect to each other at all unless they\u0027re raised up on towers of some sort. In practice, this mostly seems to indeed be the case, although the location of the stations may also matter (presumably because of the coarseness of the occlusion mesh).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, setting the occlusion factor to 0.99 (it goes down in increments of 0.01) on the same perfectly smooth spherical planet will allow connections between stations up to 2 * arccos(0.99) \u2248 16 degrees apart, even if they\u0027re both at zero elevation! At 0.98 occlusion, the maximum distance goes up to about 23 degrees.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, the slider in the difficulty settings actually goes up to 1.10, and setting it above 1.00 does make it even harder to get ground relay stations to connect with each other. It\u0027s still possible in non-flat terrain, but you can often fail to get a connection between two mountain tops even if it looks like they should have line of sight, especially if there\u0027s any kind of a hilltop in between.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut in my testing, I never saw \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E actual difference between occlusion factors 1.01 and 1.10(!). I suspect the actual scaling factor might be capped at 1.01 in the game code, even though the cap in the settings UI is higher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-08-24T09:51:00Z\u0022 title=\u002208/24/2020 09:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 24, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by vyznev\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sky Vagrant","CreatedById":196995,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-24T13:03:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223843150\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022196495\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221598262450\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002290620\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vyznev\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, vyznev said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, setting the occlusion factor to 1.00 means that you essentially need a line of sight between relay stations.
