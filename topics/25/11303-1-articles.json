In KSP at least it feels like less of a hassle to just slap more rockets under it ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAnyway here goes the spaceplane: it takes off (barely!) on a set of six turbojet engine. Taking a 45 degree nose up course will get you up to about 15km on the last drops of jet fuel. Discard the engines and light the rockets. A set of parachutes will make sure that the discarded wings dont crash into the rocket. Use the rockets to get high up into the atmosphere, then ditch the top wings.\n\nTop stage is the orbiter/lander/re-entry vehicle. It has copious RCS to perform minmus maneuvers and glides to a soft landing on kerbin. It has a full tank of fuel and a lander engine for maneuvers and maybe a mun landing. Atmospheric powered flight is also possible with it (just barely with a full tank, more easily with drained tanks).\n\nI feel the second stage could perhaps use a third rocket, the desing isn\\\u0027t quite finished yet ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Eumaeus","CreatedById":21260,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-29T21:39:30Z","Content":"Yeah SteevyT!

If yourcareful you have enough fuel left to de-orbit at base but if your not you gotta do it on RCS (either way you get home =P)\n\nCraft is attatched.\n\nBeware the big plane lurches and it difficult to land (it is possible though just dont go too nose up). Dont pull any crazy shit in it either as the spaceplane has a habit of flying off.\n\nDetatch the spaceplane at about 10-12km up and fly straight up as you can (disable SAS). Achieve orbit, Return home.
