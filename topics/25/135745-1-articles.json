The new heat shield has an attribute called boundsMultiplier, which eliminates radiant heating to objects whose outer surface are within the set point (0.7) diameters of the shield. For example, if you put few short rockomax tanks on the heatshield, the inner two are protected (within .7 diameters) and the outer one will explode. Likewise, If you put 15 rockomax-size battery discs on the heat shield, the inner 10-ish are protected. This seems to work on any of the heat shield\u0027s connectors, and I believe the mechanic is intended to be a work around for ships blowing up due to radiant heat coming off the inside of the heat shield during reentry.\u00A0 In real life it wouldn\u0027t (provided you coat the bag\u0027s interior with a high emissivity material), but in KSP it would be difficult to program the effect. Directions and distances are very different calculations when optimized for speed. As a note, I can\u0027t seem to get boundsMultiplier to work on other parts despite some creativity/persistance, and I suspect it has some logic tied intrinsically to the new heat shield part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 So the funny thing is, bounds multiplier doesn\u0027t decrease the radiant energy experienced by the heat shield itself, just the things near it. So if you inflate the heat shield it\u0027ll still explode near the sun like normal. However, if you use your radiant-heating-immune parts to shade the heat shield, you\u0027re in business! Just make sure to keep the thing pointing at the sun, or it\u0027ll blow!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 I\u0027m still waiting for the youtube upload, so.... more back story! I found this by serendipity while I was building a ship for this challenge. I figured the new heat shield in its undeployed state would be great, because it has a much smaller cross-sectional area but retains its high heat tolerance. It was working out quite well, especially with active heat dissipators on the shady side, I think I was in the mid 40Mm and dropping steadily. I started testing the mechanics of heatflow through struts, when I accidentally flipped my ship backwards and it.... was just fine. Better than fine, in fact- It became invincible! So I dug through the game files to find out why, wrote a silly story and had fun putting it all into a video. The struts on the ship in the video are just for looks by the way. Generally, the less things you have on board, the better. With a stripped down ship, it can get very slightly under 599,000m.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 If this sounds neat to you, the mechanics are ripe for exploring.

But also no.... Even though it would be protected from radiant heat, it\u0027d still be affected by conductive/convective and adiabatic compression heating... the nasty reentry stuff. Wait, maybe it wouldn\u0027t have reentry heat. I just remembered Hydrogen cools down when compressed because of the Joule-Thompson effect. On the other hand, I guess it would still heat up because JT is due to intermolecular forces, so it probably wouldn\u0027t apply at the high temps of the sun. Jool, maybe, if squad happened to model the effect.

The regular heat shields have ablators will help with the reentry heat, and the active coolers might help with the conductive/convective stuff. It would take some liberal clipping to make the ship shaped right, but it might be possible to dip quite deeply (~1km) into the upper atmosphere.

Here\u0027s some things I found which might be helpful:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Even though the heat shield provides immunity to radiative heat, it is not itself immune. You need to keep it in shadow by putting some thin 10m thing on its big connection point. I prefer the big battery disc, but a thin rockomax tank should work fine. Oddly, it seems like the 3.75m heat shields don\u0027t provide any more \u0027shadow\u0027 than my rockomax-sized battery, so perhaps my understanding of the effect is a bit off. It\u0027s held in the other cases I\u0027ve tried, though. In any case, in order to keep the heat shield in shadow, you need to keep it pointing down at the sun. Varying by more than a few degrees will cause your ship to explode. A good way to get the hang of this is to turn on \u0027ignore max temp\u0027 and spin the ship around to see which directions work, and which don\u0027t- you\u0027ll get the feel pretty quick! Of course when you time warp, the direction of the sun changes while your ship\u0027s doesn\u0027t, which can cause also explosions. To get around this, I made a little trick which you can see at 7:47 in the video. You can \u0022walk\u0022 the heat shield in by rotating a few degrees west of down, time warping and repeating. I think it makes more sense just to see it, so I\u0027ll leave the explanation there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. It\u0027s better to not inflate the heat shield. It soaks up waaay more radiant heat that way. The ship you were using in the later pictures looked like a great one!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. The less things on the heatshield the better. Even though they are immune to radiant heat, some objects still soak up a bit of heat from somewhere. If you look in the video at 7:59 you can see the dull red glow of the heat shield and the small decoupler beneath it. This heat conducts to and radiates out of the heat shield fairly quickly, but there\u0027s still a limit to how many of certain things you can have connected. I\u0027m not certain the mechanism, but I know that for Kerbal heat tolerances, I was pushing it to put as much science stuff on my ship as I did. I wanted the science, though! And it looked dopey without the 60 struts. In any case, the shroud definitely adds to this heat load, so it\u0027s best to go without it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022recreation.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://s32.postimg.org/s7ibs4kut/recreation.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust to make sure I wasn\u0027t missing something silly, I went ahead and made a lookalike of your ship and spirited it out to the sun using hyperedit.
