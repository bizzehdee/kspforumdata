I can\u0027t get the same speed and climb rate on jets as I could with the old payload - even though the paylaod is narrower!!!\n\nIf I climb higher to avoid overheat, then I lose too much thrust, and don\u0027t reach the same speed, and am no longer climbing.\n\nIf I don\u0027t, the fairing overheats, and I lose the payload.\n\nI did manage to get a perapsis above ground, but repeated attempts failed to achieve orbit. I also have some problems with the right liquid fuel-oxidizer ratio.\n\nI determined that my old payload is a much better heat sink... with multiple parts, there is a heat gradient... the part closest to the fairing is much hotter than the part where the end of an orange tank would be... and it only dumps heat into the next part.\n\nIn contrast, the old design has an orange tank that is dumping its heat into 3 adjacent parts (2 orange tank equivalents). It heats up much slower than the ore can immediately adjacent to the docking port\u002Bfairing base.\n\nSo... while the payload seems to be inert.... its heat conduction properties are actually very important (in some cases, after payload separation, then the Mk3 cockpit would overheat and explode, so the payload may also be involved in stabilizing the heat of the cockpit - although that may simply be due to the sudden acceeration that results from dumping 206 tons of payload - note I had the probe core in the utility bay behind the cockpit, so I could still fly the plane for a while longer).\n\nI\u0027m sure if I go back to the original payload \u002B fairing, and slap on even more fuel tanks as I previously described.\n\n\\*\\*\\*But that raises the question... is the payload still considered inert if its heat sink qualities are very important? \\*\\*\\*\n\nI also note that its not as useful as I thought, as any sensitive equipment on the payload like batteries and solar panels will likely be fried by the heat, despite the protective fairing.\n\nI\u0027m also considering ways to get it narrower, and making the payload stick back more... and taking the 90 tons of fuel out of the rear tanks in the spaceplane rather than the mid tanks, it will be an even better heat sink... and I should be able to demonstrate a \u003E40% payload fraction...\n\nIf I just make the ore tank payload longer, I can make it so the fairing doesn\u0027t splay outward at all... that might fix the heating problem.\n\nI\u0027ll have to see if I can still make it balance\n\nI\u0027m sure one could get even better results by decoupling the jets after flameout, decoupling the wings after 32k or so.... but then you need to use more space-tape (struts), part count goes up... maybe heat conduction problems go up... etc.\n\nI didn\u0027t set out to explicitely get a high payload fraction... but I\u0027m absolutely sure that over 40% is possible....\n\nIt seems you just need the right payload\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T09:19:07Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 09:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KerikBalm**"},{"CreatedByName":"mightyhuhn","CreatedById":112522,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T10:09:09Z","Content":"your math doesn\u0027t make any sense too me can you share the craft?\n\ni mean the dry plane should be at about 120-220 tons. so how to get a fraction of 40 % with a small payload of 202/206 ton?"},{"CreatedByName":"Radam","CreatedById":79910,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T10:33:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Well, Yesterday I tried and failed to get to orbit using a modified design....\n\nI suggest you put the fairing base between 2 mk3 tanks."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T10:36:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \\*\\*\\*But that raises the question... is the payload still considered inert if its heat sink qualities are very important? \\*\\*\\*\n\nThat\u0027s a good question, and one that didn\u0027t matter in previous versions.

Tilt up slowly to 30 degree up ascent to around 8000 feet and begin to level towards horizon with orbit indicator 5-10 degrees off horizon. Accelerate til over 1000 m/s continuing to ascend until the rocket motors kick in on their own, tilt nose up to 45 degree ascent til apoapsis is around 40,000 meters. Level back out. Accelerate until orbit encircles planet and periapsis turns to apoapsis on the other side. You MAY lose your flaps due to heat. This is okay, you will still be fully in control of the craft due to the tail surface controls and it will still be very controllable on re-entry.\n\nOn re-entry.. open drogue shutes if you want to use them to slow descent. I recommend if you do this you do set up an action group to cut them as I honestly have not needed them yet on re-entry. If you wish to do a glide descent, first burn of speed to a shallow re-entry path and keep your nose pitched up 10 degrees as you enter the atmosphere to bleed speed. Eventually it will return to flying like a normal aircraft. Clearance and absorption granted by the landing gear should make for relatively easy landings.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T12:01:37Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 12:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Maelstrom Vortex**"},{"CreatedByName":"mightyhuhn","CreatedById":112522,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T12:00:00Z","Content":"i just broke the record by a little bit... :\n\n[http://abload.de/img/challengev31iyut8.png](http://abload.de/img/challengev31iyut8.png)\n\n[http://abload.de/img/challengev32gluxd.png](http://abload.de/img/challengev32gluxd.png)\n\n[http://abload.de/img/challengev33ybuaf.png](http://abload.de/img/challengev33ybuaf.png)\n\n[http://abload.de/img/challengev3418uir.png](http://abload.de/img/challengev3418uir.png)\n\n[http://abload.de/img/challengev35spucm.png](http://abload.de/img/challengev35spucm.png)\n\ni messed most of the screns up but it is.\n\n100/9.53\\*4.6=48.26862539349423\n\ni\u0027m going to make a video.\n\nf5 saved it:\n\n[http://abload.de/img/challengev3new126u84.png](http://abload.de/img/challengev3new126u84.png)\n\n[http://abload.de/img/challengev3new2npuoy.png](http://abload.de/img/challengev3new2npuoy.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T12:04:09Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 12:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mightyhuhn**"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T12:00:57Z","Content":"Maelstrom Vortex, I\u0027d be happy to calculate your payload fraction, I would just need you to provide a screenshot of map view with the vessel info window open when sitting on the runway or pad, as well as another similar one with the payload separated and focused in orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"Maelstrom Vortex","CreatedById":111435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T12:18:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Maelstrom Vortex, I\u0027d be happy to calculate your payload fraction, I would just need you to provide a screenshot of map view with the vessel info window open when sitting on the runway or pad, as well as another similar one with the payload separated and focused in orbit.\n\nAdded to imgur follio as images 6,7,8,9,10.

A 6 minute flight according to the game time really takes me like 20 minutes.\n\nQuick saving in flight often leads to disasters... trying to optimize the flight profile over and over uses a lot of time... then I change the design... etc.\n\nI didn\u0027t even build mine for this challenge, but rather just to try and make an SSTO that can get a large payload to orbit (large in mass or volume).\n\nIncidentally, I didn\u0027t want part count to go too high, which is probably how it ended up being so competitive (reduce part count, reduce mass)\n\nI accomplished that, so I\u0027m happy. This challenge did make me realize the limits to my SSTO... The really heavy payloads at the limit of its capabilities need to be good heat conductors or long and thin. \n\nI still think I may be able to get it to orbit with the right ascent profile... judging by that one screenshot where it is at 21km and 1,275 m/s before the fairing overheated (nothing else had at that point).\n\nStill.. when I load that thing up to its limit... the payload fairing starts to cook... even more parts in the utility bay cookoff... etc.\n\nI also realized its TWR with the KR-2Ls is not good enough with a full payload... its good enough if I can get a decent climb rate and above 1,300 km on jets alone, but when I\u0027m forced to do a steeper climb on jets to avoid overheating, followed by a shallower acceleration up to speed, the KR-2Ls don\u0027t have as much oomph to get it climbing again as I would like... I think I lose a lot due to resistance and gravity drag. If I hook up fuel lines to all the rapiers to allow them to suck oxidizer (can they still suck liquid fuel like a jet, when in rocket mode?)\n\nThen with 28 rapiers going (I forget if the stats changed)... I\u0027ll more than double my TWR, which may overcome the lower Isp if I just use them to get up past ~32-35km.\n\nI think for my own purposes, I\u0027ll \u0022certify\u0022 the design for 150 tons of payload...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Sure, and if the ablator burns off before reaching orbit that would reduce payload mass. Not really seeing a problem with it.\n\nWell... then the heat shield is like a fuel tank.... ablator instead of fuel.\n\nOr maybe its like the decoupler rule.\n\nSure, for now, heat shields are massless... but if it was on the payload loaded with ablator, it was serving a much more direct function than a heat sink.\n\nAs such, I\u0027d think he\u0027d have to include a way to decouple it from the payload. One more decoupler would drop the mass fraction a bit.\n\nBut with no ablator in it... its just a heat sink... which is a similar situation to my design....\n\nIt seems that as designs start to push into the 40-50% range, heating concerns start to cause some \u0022gray areas\u0022\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T16:34:05Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 04:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KerikBalm**"},{"CreatedByName":"mightyhuhn","CreatedById":112522,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T16:57:01Z","Content":"currently i decouple it."},{"CreatedByName":"Radam","CreatedById":79910,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T17:52:51Z","Content":"Fairings are now properly heavy."}]}
