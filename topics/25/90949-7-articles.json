The central stack used a huge 5m fuel tank, mated with the most powerful KW Rocketry engine there is. Joined to it, were and additional four 3.75m rocket motors. In fact, the upper stage used it\u0027s own, slightly less powerful 5m engine to get the ship into orbit! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea was to get an enormous mothership in polar orbit of Moho, with six landers attached, so they could each peel off and do their science business on the surface below. There were some drawbacks, however. The landers sucked. They were necessarily tall and thin to facilitate mothership docking, which left them quite prone to falling over on Moho\u0027s bumpy terrain. It took some work, and a bit of luck, but I was able to land almost all of them successfully. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E Every lander was equipped with two Goo Canisters, a Materials Bay, and all the scientific instruments, except the barometer.
