The only other time machine is on the Mun (or if you\u0027re impressive enough some other harder-to-reach planet)! Problem is, Jeb is stuck before the invention of the liquid-fueled rocket, in the age of steam, cogs, and gunpowder rockets!\n\n**The Challenge** \n\nNormal Mode: Create a rocket using only SRBs, with no Solar Panels, and fly it to the surface of the Mun near some kind of easter egg or monument.\n\n**Hard Mode**: Create a rocket using only SRBs, with no Solar Panels, and fly it to the surface of the Mun near some kind of easter egg or monument, without using RCS.\n\n**Harder Mode**: Don\u0027t use map view. \n\n**Super Mode**: Impress me.\n\n**The Rules**\n\n-Your spacecraft must **not** use any Liquid Fuel or Oxidizer for rocket thrust. It **can** be used to generate power with a fuel cell, however.\n\n-You are **not** allowed any linear thrust with monopropellant. Monopropellant is for turning only.\n\n-Your Spacecraft must **not** use any solar panels or Radioisotope Generators for power generation.\n\n-You must **not** provide any screenshots of the location of the monument or easter egg, unless it is clearly marked as a spoiler.\n\n-Use of the O-1 Puff Monopropellant Engine is **not** allowed.\n\n-For a list of allowed mods, see [this post](https://redd.it/2xy741).\n\n**Required Screenshots**\n\n-Your craft before launch\n\n-Your craft at every staging event\n\n-Your craft doing any major burns\n\n-Your craft landed on the Mun, next to a monument\n\n-**Hardmode only** Your craft launching back to Kerbin\n\n-**Hardmode only** Your craft landed at Kerbin.\n\n-Anything else you want, **except** for anything that would show on the map screen where the monument is clearly, unless marked by a spoiler.\n\n**Further Information**\n\n-If you have any questions, just ask in the thread.\n\n-This is written as a reddit challenge.\n\n-The downgraded SRBs from the 1.0 update present a rather different challenge than they did in 0.90. It is considerably more difficult. Bright side is that you can use RCS for turning your bigger rockets."},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T15:44:31Z","Content":"Hmm...maybe I could make a fuel-celled powered probe...."},{"CreatedByName":"Teilnehmer","CreatedById":143330,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T03:46:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E **Hard Mode**: Create a rocket using only SRBs, with no Solar Panels, and fly it to the surface of the Mun near some kind of easter egg or monument, without using RCS.\n\u003E \n\u003E . . .\n\u003E \n\u003E -**Hardmode only** Your craft launching back to Kerbin\n\u003E \n\u003E -**Hardmode only** Your craft landed at Kerbin.\n\nSo is returning to Kerbin required for hard mode or not?\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe challenge is great and hard!\n\nIt\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s pretty easy to land on Mun. I went manned. My rocket wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t big at all. There was no problem with turning it without RCS or even dedicated reaction wheels. The torque of the MK1 lander can inline reaction wheel in vacuum and winglets at the bottom of the rocket in atmosphere are more than enough. I also didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t use fuel cells.\n\nThe insuperable obstacle for me is the requirement to land near an easter egg or monument. Precise landing is very hard without throttling!\n\nI suppose the only way for me is to try landing a hundred times and accidentally hit the point.\n\nWhat is the maximum acceptable distance to an easter egg?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-22T04:13:19Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2015 04:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Teilnehmer**"},{"CreatedByName":"K3achas","CreatedById":99468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T00:18:26Z","Content":"I\u0027d like to point out that if it wern\u0027t for launch failures on the rocket\u0027s end, the first satalite would have been solar powered.
