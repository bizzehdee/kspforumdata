But, I\u0027m still reasonably happy with a lucky 13th place. As Cruzan called, I think the building tricks got a lot of the judges disinterested.\u003Cp\u003EAnd why am I still happy? Well, because dissecting the results a bit more, 7 out of 21 judges put my craft last (or close to it at 51), and that\u0027s a 30% of people that I conclude didn\u0027t think my craft should have competed at all, plus me. Then there are 4 others that put me somewhere in between, and then half the judges put me on the top 20, 8 of them among the top tens (the ones that didn\u0027t mind the replicable building tricks, I guess). So I think the building tricks (undoable on a stock version without changing a few parts, I was very fast to admit) were the \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E thing keeping me from the final round.

When I was flying it the thing tore itself apart which happens on part clipped crafts. However, I like the White Dart enough to have rebuilt my own version using my favourite SSTO engine setup and some modifications to the aerodynamics making the plane very lively. It also gets 6km/s\u002B dV@LKO which is quite useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find it hilarious that I\u0027ve made the finals considering the Gecko placed dead last 6 times out of 21 and a respectable second last once. There\u0027s no doubt looks is playing the dominant role in some of the judging. Still, I like the quirky style I committed to and I\u0027m at or near the top ten with almost every other judge so it has been recognised for what it is. IE; not the best plane I can build but, a learner to train on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy finalist pick was Filthy because, apart from Giggle he was the only one to design a plane with decent handling(a core capability) and no show-stoppers or disqualifications.

If an SSTO has an even number of jet engines, the pilot is unable to safely and dynamically throttle down to just below the operational intake requirement in order to keep the jet engine running as long as possible, right up to the edge of space. I am surprised no one else mentioned this, and I noticed someone even criticized my design decision of not binding my intakes to the jet engine toggle group. The reason I didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t bind my intakes to a toggle group is because on the way to space it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s best to keep the jet on as long as possible even if it is throttled almost all the way down.

This is also why I dislike rapiers; it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s impossible to separate the cycle modes and run them simultaneously, and Auto cycle-switching is the worst.

For this contest though I think the R-2 is...too refined for a stock craft. It\u0027s like giving someone a brand new Audi R-8 or something when a stock craft should probably be more along the lines of a \u002798 Blazer haha. There\u0027s no room to tinker with the design or even a need to improve anything. The way the side intakes are mounted is also a little beyond the design level of a stock craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMiniMatt: Mallard\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a very \u003Cem\u003Ebusy\u003C/em\u003E design. The core of the design is good, but all the added features might be a little over the top for a stock craft. Outside of the competition the abort stage and everything else are top-notch design elements, but for this contest they aren\u0027t really needed. Pretty close to being a top pick though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHeagar: HOTOL \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I don\u0027t like the aesthetics, the HOTOL is extremely user-friendly as far as construction goes. Rebuilding it or removing pieces and adding new stuff would be very easy to do with this as a base design. Doesn\u0027t have a ton of range, but that\u0027s okay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EO-Doc: Gecko\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilar to the Mallard in that this is a fairly \u003Cem\u003Ebusy \u003C/em\u003Edesign. The middle tanks are also a pain to click on for refueling. The base design is very good and performs well, but I feel like the whole thing needs to be toned down in order to be a stock craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eoo0Filthy0oo: Wolphine\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilar to the R-2 in aesthetics and overall design. Room for improvement, but pulling it apart and putting it back together might be difficult for a beginner. Using multiple tank sizes is odd and it\u0027d be better to simplify it and combine them in to larger tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWaRi: Peregrino\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot much in the way of aesthetics, but for a stock craft it is a very good candidate. Easy to reconstruct, take apart and add on to. All of the vital components are easily visible and it doesn\u0027t try to hide anything which is good for a stock design. It is missing some components that I would have liked to see (batteries, slightly more monoprop). The handling is a little too stable, but that could easily be adjusted by the player with this design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVERDICT.....\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWaRi\u0027s Peregrino! On top of what I mentioned, I really think that something that needs to be showcased to newer players with SSTOs is that simplicity is key. You can make it to orbit with very few parts and a small design! Starting players off with a large design might send them down a dark road of adding more fuel and engines, just compounding the complexity. I know when I first started out my SSTOs were way too big. If I had been given a stock craft that was smaller like the Peregrino I might have put 2 and 2 together to figure out that I needed to start much smaller. Small, simple, easy to build and fly. The Peregrino does all that very well. The player can fiddle with the aesthetics and the handling on their own \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xeldrak","CreatedById":57228,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-28T18:36:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EAnd the winner is:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:36px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1st:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71015-BSC-Aeris-4a-Yes-it-s-spaceplane-time%21?p=1018771\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1018771\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:36px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E Giggleplex777 - R-2 SSTO \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2nd:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71015-BSC-Aeris-4a-Yes-it-s-spaceplane-time%21?p=1018826\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1018826\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E oo0Filthy0oo - Wholphine Hybrid \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3rd:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71015-BSC-Aeris-4a-Yes-it-s-spaceplane-time%21?p=1002205\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1002205\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E Cruzan - BSC Bolt \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EGiggleplex has won once again.
