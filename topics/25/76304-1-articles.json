Rather than fix the issue, they have decided that it is best to put this button to use to stage spacecraft. All other settings now need to be set before launch until they find better ways of controlling the spacecraft. Now, since you are in charge of this space program, you need to design spacecraft capable of going places with this restriction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHE CHALLENGE: Create a spacecraft that, once launched, can get places with staging being your only input. You are allowed to press any buttons you want before you launch the spacecraft to allow you to throttle up and turn on SAS (or keep it off if you wish). No mods (this includes no mechjeb, obviously).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERULES:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENo mods.

Crashes are scored higher than flybys of the same celestial body, but not higher than flybys of a farther celestial body. Any orbit of a body that is not kerbin or kerbol is scored higher than all crashes and flybys. Any successful landing (if possible, and not on kerbin) is scored higher than all crashes/orbits. Any successful return is scored higher than all landings (again, if possible).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELEADERBOARD:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs this is a very easy challenge to cheat on, you will need to provide the craft file for your entry and also take some pictures of the journey. I do realize that pictures don\u0027t mean anything, please don\u0027t point it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have successfully orbited kerbin using only staging.
