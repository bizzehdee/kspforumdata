I usually make standards orbits with mothership\u002Blander(s).\n\nFrom what i readed on this forum, if you have enough dV on the lander and to keep as much fuel as possible on the mothership, you can make maximal elliptical orbits with the mothership (and minimal capture burn) but that will need more fuel on the lander to land (more speed at PE) and to make the \u0022rendez-vous\u0022 after re-orbit.\n\nYou can also park the mothership in a Jool orbit (maybe above Tylo Orbit or near Vall Orbit, don\u0027t know what is best) and use Tylo and/or Laythe gravity assist to go where you want and back to the parking orbit, but i never tested this kind of parking orbit ^^\n\nBTW, gravity assists in Jool system can save a LOT of fuel, so you almost always can find a solution to finish the mission ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nHope this help ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-26T20:36:46Z\u0022 title=\u002209/26/2015 08:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by astrobond**"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T22:25:42Z","Content":"Having done this once I found it most expedient to allow myself to be guided by whichever encounter allowed me to gain the encounters and orbit adjustments i needed.

It will be too big and you will need lots of fuel shipped to the Jool system to feed it. Take along two or three landers designed for particular moons and discard them when you have finished with them. Keep them as small and efficient as possible. Consider command seats to save the weight of capsules. \n\nDon\u0027t make a huge wobbly rocket to ship a massive craft to Jool. It will be very hard to maneuver and will be difficult to keep on course. Better to take the ISRU route if you are going to need a lot of fuel. \n\nDon\u0027t rush things.
