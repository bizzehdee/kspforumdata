One launch would take up the passengers and return empty; the other launch would take up fuel for the next trip and retrieve the passengers. But there\u0027s no extra points for re-using hardware, so write that up as roleplaying, just like the use of pilots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnother problem is that mass of Nukes, they lob on a massive amount of weight, making you use more fuel, adding even more weight, etc. Using a single nuke is all you need to get the transfer job done.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not quite as easy. Even with periapsis-kicking, you eventually have to do ~1000m/s in a single burn. A low TWR means losing some of the precious Oberth Effect. I\u0027ve never calculated it, but from experience this is barely noticable at a Kerbin-TWR of 0.2, while at 0.1 (that is, 1m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 acceleration) you already need about 15% more delta-V than it says on the node. It becomes \u003Cem\u003Eprogressively \u003C/em\u003Eworse as TWR decreases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, that only hurts you on that one burn to Jool. Later burns are shorter and/or have less oberth, while your vessel\u0027s TWR will have improved. So a TWR on the order of 0.1 might still work out, but going much below that will make things more expensive in the end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve just pieced together a similar vessel to my previous entry, but from Mk3 Passenger Modules (I don\u0027t know if Mk2 ones even were available back then). Taking the passenger section from Kerbin to Laythe requires a lot of additional gear, but something on the order of 100 funds should be doable nonetheless. Too bad that this challenge gives no style points. With three dedicated vessels, it\u0027s more like 80 funds, but still without any command chairs at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-14T12:25:35Z\u0022 title=\u002202/14/2015 12:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Laie\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-15T18:35:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really think that hardware cost should somehow factor into this.
