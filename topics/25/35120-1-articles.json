Now im here challenging you to help. I will ask for certain things to send all around the kerbal system and who ever post the best i will use in the video. Right now we need a satellite around the mun. Im looking for a medium sized satellite that can be sent up in 1 peice to the mun. I will create the lander so you create the satellite alone. If yours is good enough it will be used and you will be messaged. Be sure to have a picture , and download available. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoal:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me to colonize the entire kerbal system with your creations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
