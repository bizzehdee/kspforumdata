I\u0027m making this with the intention to help tune the challenge\u0027s rules to give equal oportunity fo stock players and those of us with a serious mod addiction\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENitro, here we go:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use DRE, FAR, Kethane, KAS, Engineer and Mechjeb, of the ones you know. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrecise Node: Lets you edit and fine tune your maneuver nodes and provdies some info.

My computer has its own little kraken inside sometimes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERCS Build Aid and Editor Extensions, to help with building. I never use part clipping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVNG parachutes: Kerbals have parachutes. It would essentially be the same as grabbing a parachute with KAS and deploying it to save your kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Alternate Resource Panel: A shinnier, prettier resource window to the top right. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModular Fuel Tanks: Let\u0027s you edit a tank so it carries either fuel, LFO or MP. It\u0027s balanced against the weight of the part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBucky\u0027s altimeter and vertical velocity displays.

The latter has the same fuel and monoprop, a decoupler and instead of a large battery, a fuel cell to generate electricity. I don\u0027t use that one much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFASA: just for the launch clamps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirespitter: I have the fuel and electric propeller engines and the swamp engine, the seaplane floats, a radially attached SAS and that\u0027s it. The engines are slow, air breathing engines that consume fuel and are good for light planes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPorkjet\u0027s Habitat Pack: Inflatable habitation modules for crew, nothing else. Good for hauling kerbals around with style. The weights are balanced against the hitchhiker module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHGR (Home Grown Parts) and the test versions: Command pods, 1.875m fuel tanks and engines, decouplers and heatshields. There\u0027s an inline parachute with a built-in decoupler. Balanced against stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKlockheed Martian Smart Parts: Autostaging parts, auto action group parts, fuel control and interruption, and some other goodies I can\u0027t remember. I have the Shuttle engines but Not going to use them because they\u0027re a bit unbalanced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKommit Nucleonics 2.5m NERVA: Exactly the same thing as having two stock Nervas: double thrust, double weight. But it fits in the big tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSPX: Only using the probe sized SAS units, no engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKW Rocketry: Again, no engines. Only using the fairings and the SRBs, and those only for launching, which I believe doesn\u0027t affect this challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELionhead Aerospace\u0027s Circular solar Panels: only for the looks, really.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMagic Smoke Industries Infernal Robotics: Hinges, pistons, rotors. Things that can make ships change form or walk or make cranes and stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENear Future Propulsion Pack: I am weird, because I don\u0027t like the engines. I loved the Capacitors, so that\u0027s all i have. They let you store some electric charge and release it at once, then they recharge slowly. I also kept the structural parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENothke\u0027s Service Compartments: Hollow cilinders that let you hide stuff inside. They\u0027re merely structural.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENova Punch: I kept RCS nanocone. It\u0027s a cone with RCS thrusters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERealChute: Makes parachutes behave like actual parachutes. You can preconfigure them (with a GUI, much better than tweakables). They come in many sizes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERLA Power Gen: Only kept the RLA MMRTG:, its a mini RTG. Six of those make one stock RTG and have the same power. Think cutting a stock RTG in six and adding just one of those pieces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERLA Stockalike: 0.625 fuel tanks, small MP tanks, and 0.625 engines. They\u0027re either balanced or weaker than stock, but nake for cool designs with very little space. It comes with some structural tiny parts too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKN2 Cabin: A 3 Kerbal Airplane pod, fuel droptanks for airplanes with 50 units of fuel and self-contained probe-sized rcs thrusters with a tiny amount of MP. They\u0027re balanced IMO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPorkjet\u0027s SpacePlane Plus: MK2 size adapters and tanks. I only really use the air intake, it has the same stats as the stock ram-intake but looks way better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarshine Industries Parts: Keeping for the Sepatron 2 and the 6.0 thrust that consume more than 6x MP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELackLusterLabs SXT Parts pack: Only for the structural parts, the tiny jet engine (1/14th of a stock jet engine with slightly worse TWR), and 0.625 LFO tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurboNisu\u0027s Stockalike parts pack: Structural mostly, and also fuel tank caps and adapters with fuel in them. Weight/content balanced against stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFloating around there are also kOS (Programmable computers), Editor extension, part highlighter, and other mods I either just poke around with for fun or help me build and such.

View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the core craft is pretty close. It\u0027s 17.125t, 10535t dry. 5 crew pods, a claw as the main forward attachment, docking port sr. on the bottom. It has just under 3,400 dV, so no problem for the Mun test run. It\u0027s heavy on reaction torque, assuming it\u0027ll usually be attached to things, but that might introduce wobble on the docking ports, so that might need to change. I\u0027m a little concerned about its weight, getting it out of Eve\u0027s gravity well won\u0027t be fun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe spaceplane isn\u0027t named yet, but it\u0027s a SSTO that successfully took 100t to LKO, mostly by dint of spamming intakes. It\u0027ll need to be tuned and have intakes moved to non-clipped locations before it\u0027s fair to use. Also, it crashed on the first landing attempt, but I think that was just the CoM moving too far back from fuel usage in combination with the insane lift and thrust ratios once the payload is gone. Hand-adjusting the fuel position, or maybe TAC or PWB fuel balancer, should fix the landing problem. (Or add radial thrusters to the nose to keep it from bouncing off the runway.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-26T19:12:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022700NitroXpress\u0022 data-cite=\u0022700NitroXpress\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThose look fine to use.

You have to have a vertical launch from the launch pad. Your shuttle setup should resemble something close to an actual NASA shuttle launch. The points from shuttle missions can stack with the points from NASA knows best. But they do not stack with master of aerodynamics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can get points for both separately, but not on one launch. A shuttle launch gets shuttle mission points and an SSTO launch from the runway and back gets master of aerodynamics points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJet engines are for planes, is a buffer point of 5 points just for not using get engines on lifters from the launch pad. You only get it once and only as long as you keep jet engines on your planes and don\u0027t attach them to rockets. So you could get it even if you don\u0027t use planes at all. This is just supposed to help offset point penalties from space debris. So if you launched that core craft you have right now on a rocket, you would get the jet engines are for planes points because you used a rock with no jet engines on it.

However, the actual space shuttle lands at much faster speeds than the KSP physics engine will support safe landing, KSP parachutes don\u0027t work to decelerate on the ground, and without FAR, landing in a true aerodynamic stall is impossible.
