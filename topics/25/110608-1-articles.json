For decades since early Kerbal kind first laid eyes upon this gas-giant. Many have wondered how it was formed, why it\u0027s in our System and possibly give clues on how the Galaxy was formed. Then the moon of Laythe is called in to question. Many Kerbals have wondered could Aquatic life could exist on Laythe despite it\u0027s extreme cold just like on Kerbin (minus the cold.). For decades, these questions have been asked with no clear answers by the Kerbal Astronomy Society. Now, independent and national space agencies (you.) are finally getting a chance to explore the Jool System. Below, you will find various contracts to undertake to finally answer the question; Is Kerbal-kind the only species in the known planets? \n\n**Long Range Observation (Optional)**\n\n- 1. Observe Jool using a Telescope (CactEye 2 Orbital Telescope mod is recommended.)\n- 2. Report findings here on forums.\n- 3. Move on to next contract.\n- Permitted Mods: CactEye 2 Orbital Telescope mod, MechJeb. Other Mods may be allowed, but you must PM first regarding them and include a link to them on the forums.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9\n\n**Jool Exploration**\n\n- 1. Establish a Communication link back to Kerbin with a Communication Satellite.\n- 2. Send a probe down to the planet and investigate utilizing a variety of instruments. (OPTIONAL)\n- 3. Send a manned mission to Jool utilizing a Airship and conduct experiments in EVA. Preferably with Mystery Goo and experiments like Temperature and so on.\n- 4. Position a Space-Station in the Jool System, orbiting Jool. (OPTIONAL)\n- Permitted Mods: Hooligan\u0027s Airship Mod, MechJeb. Other mods may be allowed, but you must PM first regarding them and include a link to them on the forums.\n\n**Laythe Exploration**\n\n- 1. Send a Probe to the planet to investigate. You can either try a land or water landing. Whichever works best for you. Conduct experiments. (OPTIONAL)\n- 2. Send Kerbal to the land portion of the planet and make a Moon-base out of what you would like on the planet. (OPTIONAL)\n- 3. Send a Manned Submarine to the ocean portion of the planet and explore the oceans and conduct EVA experiments and investigate the ocean and search for signs of aquatic life.\n- Permitted Mods: Hooligan\u0027s Submarine Mod and any other submarine mod you may find, MechJeb. Other mods may be allowed, but you must PM first regarding them and include a link to them on the forums.\n\n**CONTEST RULES:**\n\n1. No cheating please! That includes HyperEdit, Debug Tool!\n\n2. No unapproved mods. Any mod can be approved/denied if you PM it to me and I review it and see if it\u0027s suitable for use and doesn\u0027t violate Rule One.\n\n3. In order to qualify as completing the 2nd qualification of the Jool Exploration. You must use a airship and get as physically close to the planet as possible without violating the Kraken\u0027s rules and Jool\u0027s physics. \n\n4. That\u0027s all. Go do it!"},{"CreatedByName":"DMSP","CreatedById":124853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T08:15:49Z","Content":"I\u0027ll work on an entry.\n\nYou should have seen my old Laythe save.\n\nI had a base on almost every island...\n\nAnd had a bunch of ocean bases.\n\nLike 4 out of every 5 flights were either on Laythe or it was a Base."},{"CreatedByName":"Bar27262","CreatedById":141348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T17:51:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ll work on an entry.\n\u003E You should have seen my old Laythe save.\n\u003E \n\u003E I had a base on almost every island...\n\u003E \n\u003E And had a bunch of ocean bases.\n\u003E \n\u003E Like 4 out of every 5 flights were either on Laythe or it was a Base.\n\nWow. Laythe really reminds me of Subnautica. I have the additional planets mod and I love looking at it\u0027s moons. I thought about originally doing a Sarnus challenge, but I didn\u0027t want to make it a mod only challenge."}]}
