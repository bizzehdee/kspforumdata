Once in a while I reload due to abject stupidity/carelessness, sometimes it\u0027s more fun to just go with it. I take those case-by-case. If the failure is due to a genuine design flaw or piloting mistake I go with it, even if I lose some Kerbals. In this case (partly since the contest is named after Elcano, not Magellan) I feel like the goal is to finish with at least one of the same Kerbals you started with, so if Shannon Kerman dies I\u0027d have to start over from scratch. \n\nThat said, I think I might start a career save someday where I follow a strict \u0022ironman\u0022 rule, even including glitches. One of my favorite books is \u0022The Sirens of Titan\u0022 by Vonnegut, and it has something called \u0022Chrono-Synclastic Infundibula\u0022 that remind me a lot of our Krakens... I like the idea of trying to actually integrate glitches into the KSP continuity and dealing with them, rather than just F5/F9\u0027ing whenever a Kraken attacks.
