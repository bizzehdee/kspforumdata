The results were impressive, but I know they can easily be exceeded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship is attached below. With stock parts, she achieved a velocity of over 15 000 m/s relative to Kerbin, and over 22 000 m/s relative to Kerbol once she was out of Kerbin\\\u0027s sphere of influence.
