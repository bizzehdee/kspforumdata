This challenge sounds interesting. I was thinking of working on a method to obtain all of the achievements and get seventy-two Kerbals on Duna, around day 500 or 750. It\u0027d use only stock parts, but perhaps with mechanical Jeb to help with suicide burns, deltaV calculations, and target rendezvous. Ideally I\u0027d need an 81 payload launcher that is 51% recoverable. However, I might be able to work with a 23 or 22 payload launcher. I have a few questions before I start testing this stuff out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: For mobility, how mobile does it have to be? Is 0.1m/s fast enough, or must it be able to maintain 23m/s without flipping, at night, on rugged terrain, and must there be lights on all vehicles?(Do the kerbals sleep at all?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: For crew safety, how does the piloting error work? Wasting 20% available delta V is one thing, but spending 20% delta V going the wrong way at the wrong time can result in a 40% of expected loss of delta V or worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: How much delta V should I plan on using to get from Duna surface to Duna circular @ 100km? Some wiki says 1500-2000 delta V to get to 45km Duna orbit, but it also says 1700 delta V for a kerbin-duna round-trip. Of course, getting to a higher orbit means more fighting gravity and less tangental speed, so it\u0027d make sense that a 100km orbit is easier than a 45km orbit. Perhaps I\u0027ll want a 1000km orbit, if it\u0027s much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: NERVA disposal... How do you dispose of a NERVA engine? Ideally, I\u0027d just leave them in a circular orbit. No harm done to either planet, as per the restriction\u0027s intent, plus, they will have docking ports, robotics, and 20% fuel left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5: How fast is too fast for reentry effects. I\u0027d assume if it lands in-tact it\u0027s fine, since the fuel tanks survive being next to a 3000 degree engine...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6: For the 1.5x bonus, is that 50% of the total launch vehicle including payload, or just the launcher vehicle?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7: Can the top stage of the launch vehicle have too much fuel, so that once it jettisons your craft in parking orbit, it can retro-burn back to the planet for recovery(and perhaps slow it\u0027s reentry); this will mean the top stage gets into parking orbit but won\u0027t be counted as payload, and won\u0027t assist beyond parking orbit.(to assist with recovery)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8: For simplicity can I say that every capsule/pod contains fuel for 10*maximum kerbal count? (to avoid swapping kerbals on consecutive short-term missions) That tiny bit of extra food is quite important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9: If I say some RCS tanks are kerbal food, can I still use other, non-assigned, RCS? I\u0027d have to transfer RCS from the fuel tank to the food tanks to reverse the craft\u0027s automatic use of all tanks simultaneously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m rather addicted to locating loopholes. IE: 20% fuel wasting is fine, but 20.01% will kill everyone. This may be fine, but without a firm border, the lobster red flames might be invisible to me. I may just find that reentry mod to make sure I don\u0027t mess that up. Anyone have a link to the related thread? Also, how difficult is it? I routinely de-orbit refuelers from 300km or so, and come in with 1.5-2km/s velocity max. I hit the ground at ~5m/s(after the acceleration snaps my main tank off the parachute from 10g\u0027s of deceleration) Slowing down to 1km/s and 10m/s (w/ tank) on splashdown would be do-able, but much below that would be nigh-impossible with the atmospheric rules(can\u0027t switch craft while in atmosphere), and time management. (Do I circularize my payload, or save my first stages?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, I\u0027d like to double check that someone hasn\u0027t already done a launch similar to this, or is significantly working on it.(aiming for the moon, and others have already made it to Pluto/routinely made it to the moon) If so, I probably shouldn\u0027t waste my time. Or if the latest KSP makes this too easy, (Coming to a sword fight at range with a machine gun and rocket launcher). Personally, stock-only parts and a couple realistic mods would be quite the achievement.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Patupi","CreatedById":71098,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-07T09:01:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs far as mobility is concerned just to move at all on wheels was considered mobile I believe. Given you don\u0027t know the terrain at your landing spot (unless you\u0027ve done a LOT of surveying on 0.21.1) I\u0027d suggest against going for a very slow moving lander. Any slope will stop it cold, or worse lead it rolling backwards! I believe Sturmstiger did say at one point if the bases can take off and land repeatedly (presumably from refueling) then that also is considered \u0027mobile\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDelta V calculations: well Sturmstiger did list the transit dV at the beginning of the thread, and they are an upper limit (it will change as the orbits change over time) Also the times of the Hohmann windows he gives are an approximation too, again as orbits match up differently at different times. As to launching/landing at Duna, I\u0027d suggest getting hyperedit, not for the challenge itself but to test your designs. Consider it the equivelant of simulations done before hand at KSC. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E From my experience 1500 seems adequate to launch from Duna to low Duna orbit. Bear in mind with different drag/mass ratios this will change slightly. Though with Duna\u0027s tenuous atmosphere not as much as on Kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERe-enty and aerobraking at Duna from a normal situation (ie, normal Hohmann transfer speeds or normal LDO re-entry speeds) don\u0027t SEEM to generate re-entry effects, but in general most entrants have put heat shields on anyway, just to be safe. Using Deadly Re-entry would be helpful. Just do a search on Spaceport for that mod (This is on my Tablet as my comp is fried at the moment so I\u0027m limited on what I have access to). The rule on re-entry and Aerobraking is that if there are NO visual effects at the worst point then you\u0027re OK. Just post a pic or vid to prove it and you\u0027ll be fine without a heatshield.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the entrants I\u0027ve seen have not disposed of their Nerva\u0027s at all. The ships using Nukes are kept in space and shuttle back and forth between Duna and Kerbin. I suppose in the end they could be de-orbited on any airless body to destroy them (Say Ike or Mun). The rules only state you can\u0027t use them or dispose of them in Duna or Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the \u0027reusable launch vehicle\u0027 percentage... it\u0027s not that hard to get way more than 50% resueable anyway, which ever way you look at it. But I assumed it was 50% of the unloaded vehicle as the loaded vehicle will change slightly with slightly different loads. The rated payload is the MAX the launcher can take. It\u0027s unlikely all your payloads will be exactly this in practice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last stage of the launcher can definitely have too much fuel. I did this a lot as my launcher could actually lift way more than it\u0027s rated payload to LKO. As long as you don\u0027t use this to lift your payload to a higher orbit it\u0027s fine. It\u0027s not part of the rules but it does seem consistent with them to tidy Kerbin orbit by de-orbiting your launcher\u0027s non-reusable sections when you\u0027re done with them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you go by the letter of the rules I guess you could say the supply is food beyond the 10day limit, but if you\u0027re going to be that picky about it you\u0027ll need to plot exactly when you launch your personel shuttle to fill your mission in orbit with Kerbals. I think in general people have calculated based on total time and not deducted the 10 days from the supply just to be safe. Bear in mind if you use Ioncross or other life support mod this doesn\u0027t really apply any more as those mods REQUIRE supply all the time (for ioncross the vessel has to be active, but still in principle...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the RCS/Liquid fuel storage for supply remember you can shut off a tank from being used in KSP. Right click and tick the little green arrow on the right and that tank won\u0027t get used if you want it to only be supplies. Then you can use the rest of the tanks as RCS. Just state somewhere how much of the RCS on that ship is for supplies and I\u0027m pretty sure Sturmstiger won\u0027t have a problem with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t comment on Deadly re-entry really as I haven\u0027t used it I\u0027m afraid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure what you mean with the last paragraph, though I\u0027m assuming those are euphemisms \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E As for comparable efforts check out the listing for the \u0027In Situ\u0027 mission that NeilC did.
