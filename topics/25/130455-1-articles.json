If you are a candidate and have \u0027Kolony\u0027 buildings out there that I have not researched for yet, here is your chance to shine ! The winner gets a MAJOR exclusive in my KSP Universe: to have all their habitat modules used for: Manufacturing, Living, Greenhouse...NOT STORAGE; subsistance only.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hate to have to use the MKS for everything (except small storage) but the buildings look kool, and have proper design. I just cant use buildings with processes in them; I really do not want to advertize a building part when any process within it is not used according to my specifications.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe buildings cannot be or look like any that have processes in them...IE BIOMASS, EL, MKS etc...I will sort it out later; time for me to look for buildings as well out there in kerbal space !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe designs must be ORIGINAL but may have ideas ported off of other designs; they may NOT be copies of other models.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like the idea of expandable/inflatable modules as temporary quick setups. The buildings can have a process in them that has a lifetime constraint ! I have my own ideas for lifetime constraints on parts where the part ceases to function and must be salvaged. Radiation causes damage over time (hint). I can devise my own simple lifetime timer for any part depending on where it is located.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe building design is such that these are intended for space and surface; I may choose one or more designs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso a hint: I like the older MKS designs but they seems a bit cramped for the Kerbalnauts; resizing them is easy. (actually looking at them again it is hard to tell if they are cramped for those l\u0027il kerbals !)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere will be a space-only set, much looking like the NASA types, both made of aluminum alloy, and a lighter weight versions of the same (golder coloring, shiner?), at least 1/3 to 1/2 as dense; these are probly made of Karborundum (my possible endgame choice, and I can choose any material, you just have to make it look pretty !). I use Karborundum as carborundum !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo...1) Living 2) Greenhouse 3) Resource Processing (A) Food B) Fuels) 4) Manufacturing\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPriorities: Surface (any planet/moon), Space (and low grav moons). Designs can be similar for both surface and space. I want solid structures to be endgame primary; inflatables are difficult to make.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI myself will be using Blender and Unity to work on some modelling; I may do up some streams next week on that to give this building project a week to take off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMods such as BioMass and TacLife I \u0027DO\u0027 use; parts, processes, etc, but with modifications. I do like to promote great awesome models when I can but I am trying to avoid conflicts of interest and confusion of resource process design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI play KSP realism, but not RSS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have USI and MKS part models as primary \u0027ideas\u0027 for my habitat modules; why; because they are just great models; more than likely, they will be used, but with most of my own processes and maybe some of those included if they work for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have found another process-free model set...it will be included and looks really great; it is not part of the contest because I found it; it needs testing etc; I have high hopes for it. I have not seen any other kolony models out there; next week I am gonna try my hand at making my own just for fun (!) and might even stream it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood Luck !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCommander Zeta\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-22T02:37:33Z\u0022 title=\u002201/22/2016 02:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 22, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Cdr_Zeta\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eaddendum\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-22T08:42:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTip: If you want people to make a mod for you, you should make a mod request in the Add-On subforum.
