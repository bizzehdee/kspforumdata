In your attempts, did you go to escape by flying directly upwards? Suddenly I realized that going to a low parking orbit and then burning to escape from there is more fuel efficient. Should have known that, but I was never interested in straight-up velocity contests so I never thought about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlown this way, the same rocket I used previously cut the round trip time to a little less than a year. Aiming is quite tricky, for now I settled to going in an elliptical orbit and then finishing the acceleration when I was in the \u0027straight\u0027 section pointing to the Sun. (This is suboptimal). Trimmed a bit by eye with RCS on the outbound leg, final error a little more than 2 degrees (I flew half a million km to the side).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt first I used the orbit technique thorfinn but then I tried the straight burn and found that used less!
