Public opinion on the space program is an all time low and the dwindling confidence of the Kerbal government means that the Space Program is on the brink of cancellation. Jeb has proposed one final solution, and the Kerbal government has given him his last blank check to build a rescue mission for the stranded Kerbals. If successful, the story will re-ignite the public\u0027s interest in SPAAAACE and secure the future of the Kerbal Space Program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour mission, my dear Kerbal Engineer, is to design a rescue vessel for Laythe.
