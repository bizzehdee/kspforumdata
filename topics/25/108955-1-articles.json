In answer to your question, it is ok for you to lose contact with the ground if you are slowing down before you left the ground. For example, once you have reached max speed and pulled your chutes, if your ship left the ground while ddecelerating it would count in hard mode if you stopped before the end of the runway.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E My best Hard mode so far . . . \n\u003E I was going for the smallest and fastest dragster.
