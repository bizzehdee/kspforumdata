Nearing the surface, their descent stage engines cut out. Their craft began to accelerate quickly and they had only seconds to react. In a desperate move, they inverted the craft and used the descent stage as a large crush bag to soften the impact. The trick worked, but their craft was torn apart from the force of the impact with only a scattering of parts that remained salvageable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/whatcanyoumake1_zpsvoasydrl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022whatcanyoumake1_zpsvoasydrl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plan: Using just the parts that survived the crash, the crew needs to build a craft that can move them to a safe distance from the leaking radioactive debris of the descent stages nuclear engines. Along with this, they need to find a way to contact the orbiting relay satellite to call for help. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Build some type of vehicle to move the crew to safety. It needs to be able to at least move, the rest is a matter of storytelling. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Build some type of communications device(tower, antenna, etc..) to contact the satellite. It only needs to look like it would work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: Be creative and have fun with the build. You do not need to use all the parts from the crash, but only the parts that survived can be used to make something.
