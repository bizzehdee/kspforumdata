The current stock design doesn\\\u0027t have enough ?V to reach low Kerbin orbit, let alone attempt a M\u00C3\u00BCn landing. The version with Capt Slug\\\u0027s landing legs on the first stage is... optimistic. It could easily be modified for m\u00C3\u00BCnar flybies with stretched stages (run 2-3 tanks above each engine instead of 1), but getting the upper stage to land on the M\u00C3\u00BCn will be slightly harder.
