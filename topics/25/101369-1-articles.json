If you\u0027re planning on using a mod and you aren\u0027t sure if it\u0027s allowed, ask. Do it as a pure surface skate or take off, go to orbit and skim the ice at periapsis; whatever tactics you like, so long as you start and finish stationary on the ice and do it all with the fuel load you started with. Post screenshots of yourself stopped on the ice before and after, a screenshot of your maximum speed and a couple of shots proving that you did fly it from KSC to Minmus.\n\n**Minmus Ice Racing Championship: Leaderboard**\n\nWanderfound, 503.5m/s\n\neddiew, 457.9m/s\n\nUnusualAttitude, 300.6m/s\n\nKuzzter, 207.5m/s\n\nLordFjord, 129m/s\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nDemonstration run:\n\n[![screenshot184_zpszljyoh5h.jpg](http://i1378.photobucket.com/albums/ah120/craigmotbey/Kerbal/Beta/Iceracing/screenshot184_zpszljyoh5h.jpg)](http://s1378.photobucket.com/user/craigmotbey/media/Kerbal/Beta/Iceracing/screenshot184_zpszljyoh5h.jpg.html)\n\n[![screenshot199_zpsvwk8xk5k.jpg](http://i1378.photobucket.com/albums/ah120/craigmotbey/Kerbal/Beta/Iceracing/screenshot199_zpsvwk8xk5k.jpg)](http://s1378.photobucket.com/user/craigmotbey/media/Kerbal/Beta/Iceracing/screenshot199_zpsvwk8xk5k.jpg.html)\n\n[![screenshot208_zpsgpxcsfix.jpg](http://i1378.photobucket.com/albums/ah120/craigmotbey/Kerbal/Beta/Iceracing/screenshot208_zpsgpxcsfix.jpg)](http://s1378.photobucket.com/user/craigmotbey/media/Kerbal/Beta/Iceracing/screenshot208_zpsgpxcsfix.jpg.html)\n\n[![screenshot213_zpsgu4inhzw.jpg](http://i1378.photobucket.com/albums/ah120/craigmotbey/Kerbal/Beta/Iceracing/screenshot213_zpsgu4inhzw.jpg)](http://s1378.photobucket.com/user/craigmotbey/media/Kerbal/Beta/Iceracing/screenshot213_zpsgu4inhzw.jpg.html)\n\n142.1m/s.
