Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to design and test your submission to this bidding war.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EThe Rules\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The following mods are allowed: NovaPunch2, KW Rocketry, NearFuture Propulsion, KSP-Interstellar (see exceptions below), B9 Aerospace, Firespitter, FAR (see rules below), Stock Rebalance Mod, StretchyTanks/StretchySRB\u0027s/ProceduralParts, MegaPanels, Kethane, Kerbal Joint Reinforcement, KAS, Orbital Construction (won\u0027t help you, except as payload- but go ahead and use it if you want), Krag\u0027s Planet Factory (once again, not going to help), Extraplanetary Launchpads, Nyrath\u0027s Orion mod, ProceduralDynamics, ProceduralFairings, TAC Fuel Balanced, MechJeb2, RemoteTech, TAC Life Support, MechJeb/RT For All mod (adds MJ2/RT to all command modules), any graphics (purely aesthetics) or memory/resolution-reduction mods\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Suggest other mods to me if you think they should be allowed. I will be the judge on what it fair and admissible in all matters (and similarly what is exploitative/cheap)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- FAR will be allowed (as will ProceduralFairings, which should help with it), however due to the greatly increased performance of many rockets while using this mod, due to the more realistic simulation of drag, you will receive a points-penalty for using it (this is for balance/fairness for those of us whose computers cannot handle FAR\u0027s RAM usage). I have chose a value I think will somewhat balance things, but if I find FAR rockets are dominating the scoreboard, I may increase the penalty (this applies retroactively). You have been warned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Due to the in my opinion unrealistic and overpowered nature of the fusion and antimatter reactors in KSP-Interstellar, these reactors will be totally disallowed FOR ALL PURPOSES. I am a huge fan of some features of the mod myself, but this had to be done. The fission reactors will be limited to current-day (or near-future) technology: Molten-Sodium and Solid-Bed fission reactors only! Also, for those using very old versions of KSP-Interstellar, the Atmospheric Scoop part is banned, as it produces no drag due to an error in the coding acknowledged by FractalUK (the mod creator)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If you choose to use microwave beamed power for a KSP-Interstellar rocket, you will be limited to no more than one 3.75 meter (or smaller) fission reactor at/near the KSC, and one 2.5 meter Uranium reactor (no Thorium or Uranium Nitride- these reactors require more maintenance) at/near the island runway. You may use as much beamed solar power as you like, however- sustainability for the win!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You may design and launch a rocket to takeoff from an alternate launch site anywhere on Kerbin using Extraplanetary Launchpads. You will receive a points penalty for doing so, but it is is not meant to be balanced (it takes a LOT of effort to build a mountaintop launchpad, for instance). This is meant to be one way to potentially increase your score. On the downside, such launchpads often cannot safely launch the largest of rockets due to the inability to secure a perfectly level launch site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Your rockets (or spaceplanes) may reach a maximum weight of 1.2 KILOTONS (1,200 tons). They may contain no more than 120 parts, but will receive points penalties for higher mass and part-count, not meant to fully balance it out- larger is better. You can even receive a small bonus for launching an enormous rocket, for its shear impressiveness to behold (although this will not outweigh the penalty for its huge mass). It may contain no crew, except for in the payload (so you don\u0027t use suicidal Kerbals to help pilot the boosters).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You will receive points for every half-ton of payload to make it to orbit. This is by far the most important source of points. Payload is defined as a detachable portion of the rocket which may be utilized for other purposes. It MAY NOT contain any engines used during ascent (even though use of payload engines in normally a good idea in normal play), air intakes, or parts with lift. It must have an accessible docking port, by which it detaches from all other stages. If the payload is 1.25 meters or more, the docking port must be a standard Clamp-O-Tron or larger. If the payload is 2.5 meters or more, the docking port must be a Clamp-O-Tron Senior or larger. The payload may contain no SAS force, except for a single crewed command module, or probe core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The largest bonus available to you comes from using a \u0022100% reusable Space-X style reusable launch vehicle\u0022. If you don\u0027t know what this is, I highly recommend looking it up. I also demonstrate one on my thread (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57509-Kerbin-and-Beyond-a-Maturing-Space-Program/page20\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57509-Kerbin-and-Beyond-a-Maturing-Space-Program/page20\u003C/a\u003E). Note that using a spaceplane will also qualify for this award- IF you managed to land at again safely back at the KSC, or on an Extraplanetary Launchpads runway elsewhere on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B The basic idea is that you launch straight up, so that your entire rocket has an apoapsis above the lower atmosphere before clearing your first stage. The next stage then (at least mostly) circularizes the orbit before the lower stage falls low enough to disappear in the atmosphere- and you then switch to the lower stage on its way down. The lower stage, with the aid of a built-in probe core, performs a guidance burn to bring its trajectory back towards the KSC (I am requiring you land it within 50 km of the KSC for this challenge- this is easy if you keep your initial ascent vertical) and a short \u0022suicide\u0022 burn to cancel its velocity shortly before touchdown with the ground (this takes surprisingly little fuel- drag will slow you down to terminal velocity long before you reach the ground). Use landing legs/pegs to protect the engines from exploding on impact with the terrain- your entry will be disqualified if you use parachutes (they are complex and expensive to reuse in real-life, and drastically overpowered in the stock game) or lose any parts on the way down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B The upper stage then detaches from the payload, and performs a re-entry maneuver of its own to touch down somewhere on Kerbin (preferably close to the KSC, although not required for this challenge due to its difficulty- I was unable to reach the KSC with the upper stage on my own attempts.) In order to be gentle on the reusable (non-payload) stages, I am also requiring you use mechanical decouplers or docking ports to separate them from the rest of the rocket- no explosive decoupler plates please. Similarly, please do not burn the lower stages by igniting the next stage up with the engines pointed directly at them at point-blank range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EObjectives\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are to launch a rocket (or spaceplane) from on the ground on Kerbin to a stable orbit (the periapsis must be at least 72 km, to provide a small safety margin) around Kerbin.

The big thing is actually the amount of payload you can get to orbit. And, as for points- you can pick up a LOT by launching from a mountaintop (although I was thinking of EXPl Launchpads, this is actually possible with Stock- just set up a jet-powered skycrane to carry large segments of the rocket to the new launchpad, and connect them with docking ports...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-30T17:17:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rakaydos\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rakaydos\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/WiOR0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/WiOR0\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods are FAR and Stock Rebalance. 150 tons to orbit with Fuel to Spare.
