This means high speed, yes, but high speed at a body with low gravity. By getting myself through Moho\u0027s SOI on a retrograde orbit, I managed an eccentricity of over 21000. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeaderboard:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStock:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnaltered Mods:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.cfg edits:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may use Mechjeb to determine the eccentricity of your orbit, or you may dig up this value from your save file. Using mechjeb as the side capsule is allowable in a stock entry (using the Mechjeb command module or Mechjeb Thruster/Engine Mix falls under Unaltered Mods, unless they are manually edited)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
