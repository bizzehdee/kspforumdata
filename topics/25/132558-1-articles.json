Im working on a book (on a social web called wattpad, related to books) and i want to give more publicity to my book from the beginning, to do that, i thought about doing a book trailer... And i realized that to do it, i need kerbal ships... Beautiful kerbal ships... So here is the task:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI need a small drone mothership with three spaceplanes drones, capable of reentering (something that looks amazing)... I recommend the use of KSP Interstellar (Project Pluto like ramjets) and some mod that adds atomic explosions... The idea is that the mothership will enter into kerbin systems, will release its three spaceplanes, and will be destroyed in atmosphere, the spaceplanes would reenter safely and turn on the ramjest and start dropping atomic bombs... I need a video about that. showing how the mothershipo aproaches kerbin (at warp speeds) and it gets destroyed, and another with the dornes being released, starting reentry, and dropping bombs (cinematic mode, please)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, i need three massives colony-transport ships (is any way to put text in some parts? If any of them has a hull plate that reads \u0022MCT\u0022 would we awesome). Two of them can be the same design, they have to be large ships, and the design must be like if they werent finished when launched. The other, i dont care about it (this should be the one that has a \u0022MCT\u0022 text on one plate)... The idea about that is that the two first colony ships would land on kerbin, on different places (one of them in a continent, on the coast, the another one in an island). I need the same as the dropship and drones....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf any of you gets bored, and wants some kerbal work, it would be apreciated (and thanked on the video description, of course).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
