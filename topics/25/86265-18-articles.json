They also cannot move sideways on ladders so you need to be able to have a straight path down the side of your vessel. My first Eve lander had 7 or 8 ladders in sequence and it took a couple hours just to build and test the long climb. I figured I could find a way to make the staging work with the cans at the bottom - it\u0027s probably the way I will always try to build my larger landers from now on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe huge first stage block of tanks and engines work a little better for me than trying to deal with any decoupling. By removing the need for decouplers and sepratrons, I can fit more tanks in a tighter space and keep the part count slightly lower. As you can see from the pictures, I also just let MechJeb fly it: with a horrible frame rate I find controlling it manually to be a huge pain. When you add in the autopilot, that huge block is kind of a \u0022fire and forget\u0022 launcher that gets me all the way to space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T20:59:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI concur with the Commander, getting three Kerbals down and up is no joke--and yeah, I\u0027m with you on the ladders. I managed mine with two extendables, some rungs, and a clamber over the FT-100s in the upper stage. Previous attempts with a bigger vessel, I had the escape vehicle up top as usual but transferred crew to a couple of cans on the bottom that I left behind with the landing gear and \u0027chute stacks.

I\u0027ve basically only checked whether the numbers add up. As I was requesting a *lot* of pictures of the launch, and data display as well, there was little room to hide any shenanigans. I don\u0027t think I ever had to disqualify anyone for cheating. If someone has tried, she was flunked for not showing the resource panel. The rest was checkboxes: command pod? Stock parts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI usually paid little attention to Kerbin lifters and the transfer stage, at least from a cheating point of view. If it looked alright, I assumed that it was. However, the overall mission design was a way for people to gather bonus points. I was more likely to overlook some minor issue if the mission displayed creative solutions or beautiful vessels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the more difficult part about reviewing is finding a few pics where you actually have a good view. I often wondered \u0022how did he do that\u0022 or \u0022what\u0027s in that gap\u0022 yet in thirty pictures there often only were very few that allowed a glimpse of some important or interesting detail.
