I did a concord style SSTO like that with the jets at 5 degree angle and the rockets at 10 degrees then I had the rocket fuel and some jet fuel with the engines in the engine nacelles like the concord but I also had 3 fuel tanks in the fuselage above CoG but I had just enough so they where drained first before I got so high the control surfaces would not have been able to compensate so by the time they where emtpy CoG was in Line with CoT."},{"CreatedByName":"ThePsuedoMonkey","CreatedById":58589,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-11T20:56:24Z","Content":"My personal best is the *Iron Buzzard*, an 18T lifter.

There very heavy in comparison to a lot of other parts in the game.

They are itinerantly unstable but responsive. Most modern fighters uses this to its advantage with fly by wire systems but KSP has nothing like it and its aerodynamic model and current control systems seem unable to deal with it.\n\nBuilding something like the concord in KSP often has the problem that the pitch surfaces side by side with the ailerons wont provide enough force to rotate on the runway."},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-12T22:04:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Unless you move them *far enough* forward.
