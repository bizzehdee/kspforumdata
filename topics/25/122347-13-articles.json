Yeah the AI does some really suicidal stuff; you need a combination of plane tuning \u0026amp; steer factor and a lot of practice runs to minimise that but I think our craft at this point are outstripping the AI\u0027s ability to cope. You\u0027ll notice that when it can\u0027t make it\u0027s mind up, flies straight and gets bounced by the opponent before it can decide what to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStalling is generally not a good idea, you lose energy \u0026amp; most importantly control. I let the Hummingbird stall very rarely because when it does it won\u0027t matter ( usually at the top of a loop and it\u0027ll pull through anyway ), pretty much the same as the previous craft. The other one I\u0027ve got on the go for later I can\u0027t get to pull high enough AoA to stall because it\u0027s turn rate is utterly mad already. Really though this is my... 10th I think airframe, which is counting everything that looks like a Swallow as one airframe even if they\u0027re fairly different - I can\u0027t think how many it\u0027d be if everything was counted seperately. Got to be well over 100 versions. Just needs practice, experimentation, and using all the FAR tools.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESet up a bunch of savegames for a random selection of other people\u0027s craft - don\u0027t put them all in one save or you\u0027ll kill performance - like in the video I did about setting up fights. That\u0027ll save you tons of time testing.

It is the result of two weeks of continuous optimization. I ran it against D-10 and Swallow F-1 while testing until I could reliably beat both of them. I still can\u0027t claim I understand what makes it good. As I wrote before, It is easy to save 2 tons of weight while keeping control authority, lift, and thrust the same as K-191, which should be better. But isn\u0027t. Maybe having a bit more momentum helps going into a near-stall in a way that the KI can cope with. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI never optimized for low straight-line wobble. The moment in which your craft shoots the opponent is almost always in a steep curve, and in that situation the control deflection is maxed out, meaning no wobble. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also played with rear cannons, which scored the occasional kill against craft that do a better job putting themselves behind me.

Saw them in action on DrDavinci\u0027s plane and started playing with them. Found out that configuring control surfaces to act as spoilers helps with cornering a lot. Before, I configured front-facing control surfaces with naught to -100% AoA. Higher means more stable at high AoA. But cornering is slower than without the AoA setting at least on some of my planes. Setting the same surfaces to act as spoilers, on the other hand, makes for faster turns with lower AoA and thus lower loss of speed. It is kind of the opposite of using AoA with negative deflections. I still wonder if setting the AoA parameter to something positive would not do the same as the spoiler setting, effectively. Have to try that out at some point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe that as it may, I now have another parameter that is worth playing with, and that\u0027s good! I use spoilers extensively in the K-201 10, and I find they help with cornering while slow. I saw 10G in a turn while slower than 150m/s! More importantly, when slower than 100m/s it runs like on rails where it was stalling before.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DoctorDavinci","CreatedById":150019,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-08T16:39:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Van Disaster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Van Disaster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@DrDavinci: in other words, CoM is in the middle of the fuel tank \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEssentially .. make your CoM the center of your fuel mass which in the case of 1 tank is in the middle of your tank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, once you start into multiple tanks it can start to get tricky as different mass tanks with different fuel capacities and loads will start playing havoc with the CoM/CoL relationship\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-08T17:00:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@EzBro: by spoiler do you mean pitch control? aircraft spoilers are usually surfaces that only act in one direction - \u002Bve pitch only, for instance, more usually used for yaw ala FAR\u0027s yaw brakes, or roll - or used as air/speedbrakes.
