The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E given that you have 2 issues that cannot be solved using the decoupler cannons.\u00A0 For one, the ship firing said weapon gets 100% of the recoil and because of that you have to actually design the ship to be able to handle recoil (this may or may not affect where and how you can place weapons on the craft, for me ive had to reinforce the launch points on at least a few ships), and you are stuck with the ibeam velocity you build the craft with.\u00A0 The latter is actually a major downside from my experience because you cannot cater to multiple target types, you want higher velocities when dealing with very thick targets, and lower when dealing with fighters and thinner capitals, sepatron powered ones allow you to pick what distance you fire from and thus impact velocity, pulse cannons you get a flat velocity nomatter what you do (best bet is to go with omni-purpose mid velocity but you are still going to be too high or too low if you didnt modify them for every battle).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only real spot where i have to say pulse cannons are superior in almost every way is with tanks since you can be very accurate when you more or less facehug the enemy as the rounds get up to speed instantly.\u00A0 Might have to make a rule for tank battles akin to no shooting from closer then 50-100m if we even consider such weapons ok to use in the first place (myself im all for it as part count and they do have clear ups and downs).\u00A0 Based on preliminary tank vs tank testing, their lethality is incredible if and only if you facehug (or something like 10-20m) not because they are so inherently powerful, but because you can almost guarantee whatever you are targeting gets hit with the rounds.\u00A0 Past about 50m they become comparable to standard weapons where you are nolonger guaranteed a hit on target.\u00A0 Also worth mentioning is that the more powerful the cannon the more lethal it is to the user, ive had to tone down the weapons on my tanks a few times because they kept flipping the tank, tearing the turret out of its bearing, ect, so its quite hard to make em work right outside of the super low mounted hardpoint style ive used in my TDs so that recoil doesnt instantly flip you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Canberra_Gaming","CreatedById":160705,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-31T04:19:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo anybody up for a battle?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"quasarrgames","CreatedById":91692,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-31T18:38:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222905877\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002232509\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221483157992\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022160705\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Canberra_Gaming\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 hours ago, Canberra_Gaming said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo anybody up for a battle?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m almost ready.
