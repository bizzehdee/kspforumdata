Really, we just call it doomsday meteorite. They say the impact should happen within 200 days, unless something is done to prevent it. They say it\u0027s very small but made from a material that will explode like several nuclear bombs!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere you go. I made a challenge! I used hyperedit to create this scenario, the meteorite is a bunch of fuel tanks glued together, so it\u0027s heavy, but not too big. Making it on collision trajectory with kerbin was hell... harder than beating the challenge, I would bet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone wants to give it a try, go ahead! anything that prevents Frederico from colliding with kerbin counts as winning. Extra winnings goes to anyone who captures it and leaves it orbiting some planet, the mun or kerbin.
