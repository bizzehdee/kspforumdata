I think the only difference between normal wings and control surfaces is in the AOA calculation, but what you mostly notice is that the small control surfaces have a lift to drag ratio twice that of swept wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027ve reviewed that thread. The math in the OP is dead on, but the ramifications of what it means seem to be off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Most parts have the stock drag coefficient of .2. This is multiplied by .008 and the mass of the part to give a \u0022true\u0022 drag coefficient. Then it\u0027s plugged into the classic drag formula 1/2*p*v^2*Cd.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWings are more complicated. They have 2 parts to their drag, parasitic and induced. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The parasitic drag works normally, except that it is multiplied by .02 instead of .2. This is critical to understanding how forces operate at speed in a KSP aircraft. The wings are already a fairly low-mass assembly, but that .02 multiplier means that parasitic drag from wings pretty much doesn\u0027t exist! I mean... it *does*, but it\u0027s so miniscule that it can be safely ignored.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The induced drag is a function of angle of attack. sin AoA * Cdi * p * v^2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E At high angles of attack, high velocities, and high pressures, this value is huge. It can be much higher than the parasitic drag of whatever you\u0027re lifting. This can cause bizarre and counter-intuitive behavior that wouldn\u0027t be readily apparent, like shuttles flying backwards on reentry even though the CoG is ahead of the CoL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELift works almost exactly the same way as drag, except the AoA formula is a bit convoluted. It\u0027s not exactly correct, but I crib the function as Cl*sin(2*AoA). The wing produces no lift at zero incidence to the airstream and no lift at 90 degree incidence, with a maximum lift coefficient at 45 degrees. Again, this isn\u0027t exactly how lift works, but it\u0027s close enough for planning purposes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E What\u0027s critical to understand for our needs is that \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eany aircraft can be analyzed for efficiency by simply dropping the \u0022p*v^2\u0022 part and just looking at how it behaves in a global situation in any angle of attack.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELift is Cl*sin(2A). Induced drag is Cdi*sin(A) and parasitic drag is mass of the aircraft (ignore wings)*.004; a constant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If you plug these into a spreadsheet, you can see how a combination will behave for a given AoA. You can see which angle of attack yields the most lift for the least drag (most efficient) and what that ratio will be. You can see where drag from the wings overcomes parasitic drag, which tends to cause instability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Long -\u0026gt; short, the efficiency of a wing isn\u0027t determined by it\u0027s overall lift or lift- mass, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ebut rather it\u0027s lift to induced drag\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Slashy\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-11T23:21:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETsevion,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Do you happen to know what the current record is for an all wing SSTO?
