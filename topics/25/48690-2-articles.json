I figured that instead of landing on such a high-gravity moon such as Ike, it would be worth much more to use that dV to go to Jool instead, and do some EVA landings to get the crew reports and surface samples. However, with my math for the fuel I have left over, it looks like I won\u0027t have enough to escape Jool and get back to Kerbin. I suppose I\u0027ll have to get there and find out.

I did figure out you could only store one per pod beforehand, but I thought I missed something somehow lol.\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, now to explain why that nearly gave me a heart attack; I\u0027m working on a tier-0 mission right now that\u0027s already done a Duna/Ike flyby and is working on an Eve flyby with a gravity assist to head out to the Jool system (if I had missed some easy science, I\u0027d flip a table). I\u0027m hoping to pull in ~2000 science, with EVA landings on Bop and Pol. Also if I have enough fuel when I get back to Kerbin, hopefully some Mun orbits (to get all the biomes) and an EVA Minmus landing will be possible as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using a slightly modified version of allmhuran\u0027s ship (so much dV for tier-0!), with a couple extra tanks on the final stage.
