I\\\u0027ve been thinking over this one since i got KSP. The challenge is to build an interstellar starship based off a real-game plot, Sid Meir\\\u0027s Alpha Centauri, which is designed to travel to that planet. Note that you DO NOT have to fly it there, only get it assembeled in orbit using the 1.4 multiple ship controls with as close to real functionality and design (i.e. pod seperation). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe UNS Unity is a large starship designed to carry 10,000-20,000 (doesn\\\u0027t have to be exact scale) in cyrosleep to the Alpha Centauri System. Using 3 engines powered by a fusion reactor, the ship reaches the star in 40 years at a slowly accelarated to 1/10th of lightspeed (approx. 29,979,245.8 m / s, again you DON\\\u0027T HAVE TO DO THIS) and has the capability to seperate 8 seperate habitation/cryo chambers as landing pods for descent to the planet.

It\\\u0027s launched in one big block, just because I could. That was before I made my nuke reactor (and was WHY I made the nuke reactor), so it just had a bunch of nonfunctional nerva engines stacked internally as a placeholder. It had 24x 2-meter habitation pods, and (iirc) 9x 1-meter habitation pods, and a FULL 3-meter fuel tank AFTER achieving solar escape orbit, for the deceleration phase at the destination star. It also had a few extra fuel tanks, for supplies. The solar arrays were just for use during the ~100 days spent near the sun, and to get the nuke reactor fired up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E How would we assemble anything in orbit?
