That sudden termination of area at the back of the nozzle causes excessive drag.\n\nAlso, I\u0027ve noticed that the drag seems to increase considerably at somewhat over Mach 1, meaning that even though it has a drag area fully armed with drop tanks of 1.02 m^2, the narrowing mach cone probably causes parts of the plane to suddenly see more airflow at about Mach 1.1.\n\nBut yeah, any ideas for making basic jets aerodynamic at high speed would be much appreciated.
