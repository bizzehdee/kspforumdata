Switch off RAPIERs, activate the PITs and the VASIMR, then coast. Once above 45k altitude, go full throttle along prograde, unfold solar array, roll to face it towards the sun. Use capacitor banks to keep the batteries from emptying. When capacitors are exhausted, turn off PITs and burn all the way to apoapsis on the VASIMR. Keep prograde. At apoapsis, reactivate RAPIERs to burn off any remaining oxidizer, then deactivate them again.

Or must have some \u0022horizontal\u0022 velocity while lifting off? Most lifting off of anything I know is done vertically.\n\nIt doesn\u0027t have to be a spaceplane *with wheels*, but the requirement is that it begins its takeoff completely horizontally, or more importantly *with no engines giving it lift*.(VTOL craft are allowed, but they must be able to take off like a plane as well) You can immediately turn to a vertical ascent once you lift off, but you must start off horizontal.\nedit: It actually gave me a bit of a silly idea. What if you had a spaceplane that could land horizontally, but was built to take off vertically, and was equipped with a system to stand itself nose-up for launching?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-13T04:58:19Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2014 04:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Sean Mirrsen**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecha Pants","CreatedById":58006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-13T05:12:44Z","Content":"if you look over in the Affordable space program thread you\u0027ll see exactly that in [sdj64\u0027s entry](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/69358-An-Affordable-Space-Program-making-the-reusable-spacecraft-pay-off?p=1081277\u0026viewfull=1#post1081277), It even tips itself back up after loading cargo."}]}
