Using the equation for orbital period, the maximum time for an orbit with its apoapsis at Kerbin orbit (13,599,842,304 meters) and periapsis at 1/2 Kerbin orbit is 1,657.55 hours. ( Period = 2*pi*sqrt(semimajor-axis^3 / gravitational_constant_of_Kerbol) )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAcheiving an orbital period of 1/2 Kerbin\\\u0027s is impossible in unpowered flight -- in order for the semi-major axis of the orbital path to be one half that of Kerbin\\\u0027s -- the radius of a circle is its semi-major axis -- the periapsis of the orbit would have to be the center of Kerbol. We have evidence that this causes, uh, catastrophic rocket failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo. We want to minimize the number of orbits Kerbin makes before we intercept it. An orbital period of 2/3 would result in a flight where the rocket orbits three times before rendevousing with Kerbin on its second orbit around; however, that leads to an orbit with a period of 1695.33 hours -- slightly too long, which means our periapsis will be slightly too high to qualify for the challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next best option, then, is three Kerbin orbits. After some number twiddling, an orbital period of 3/5ths of Kerbin\\\u0027s fulfills our requirements nicely: our periapsis comes out to 5,656,838,754 meters, and our mission time should \u0027only\u0027 be 317.88 days -- about 46 real life minutes at 10,000x time compression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESooooo, my intended mission profile is currently: boost to Kerbin orbit, adjust orbit such that its apoapsis is slightly outside of Kerbin\\\u0027s sphere of influence (or such that we\\\u0027re barely at Kerbin\\\u0027s escape velocity). Once that\\\u0027s acheived, bring periapsis to as close to 5,656,838,754 meters as possible with fine RCS bursts. Wait until we reach periapsis. Adjust orbit such that apoapsis is as close to 13,499,842,304 meters as possible, to correct for the initial escape burn. Wait another 4.5 orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf everything\\\u0027s correct and proper and nothing goes terribly awry, we should pop into Kerbin\\\u0027s sphere of influence with a relative velocity of around 2,180 m/s, with Kerbin on a direct collision course with us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf everything isn\\\u0027t correct and proper, we do have some leeway.

I also agree the idea of lowering apoapsis and then burning a new one to catch Kerbin is another way to do it. That was how I did my last mission in fact, only I mistimed it and got ahead of Kerbin and had to wait for it to catch up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeh, thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for doing a rendevous...I think the best one-year solution would be to do a half-orbit down to your goal PE, then burn to raise your AP such that you swing past Kerbin\\\u0027s orbit, dangle outside of it for a while, then rendezvous with Kerbin on the downward plunge. The math for this, however, is a little difficult, since you\\\u0027re not actually doing a rendevous at AP, you\\\u0027re doing it mid-orbit. The closing velocity will also be much, much higher -- not only are you going faster, but you\\\u0027re not travelling in the same direction at Kerbin, which means that much of your extrasolar velocity will be transformed into slamming-your-face-into-Kerbin velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might doodle around with the math some today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other option is the most fuel intensive -- drop to a very near-Kerbol circular orbit, then swing out in a new parabolic. This\\\u0027d require only two half-parabolic orbits, plus the partial circular orbit to get the correct angle for the rendevous burn. This is how we I do Mun intercepts now, by the way -- circular to intercept parabolic, very fast. The problem is that all the delta-v required to do these orbit adjustments is almost certainly extreme; at least two times what\\\u0027s required to do the easier, but more time-consuming, intercept I did. You\\\u0027ll need a calculator utility for this, though, or to crunch the numbers to figure out when you need to burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel requirements aren\\\u0027t really a huge deal when you\\\u0027re working with NovaPunch, of course, but when you\\\u0027re doing it stock in the current build, the VAB starts to bog down even on the vehicle I used, and making tweaks becomes absolutely painful. -.-\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ash73","CreatedById":15228,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-24T00:34:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI thought I\\\u0027d take my solar rocket for another spin, and this time I saved some screenshots...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake off, I\\\u0027m using various mods and plenty of rocket-power!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.hassallcastle.talktalk.net/kerbal/01.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002201.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApproaching Kerbin orbit, I\\\u0027ve given the crew a science lab with solar panels to make their long journey a bit more comfortable:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.hassallcastle.talktalk.net/kerbal/02.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002202.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDestination Kerbol, boosting the orbit to escape Kerbin\\\u0027s gravity:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.hassallcastle.talktalk.net/kerbal/03.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002203.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERetro boost, creating a 5:3 orbit with Kerbol (thanks again nivvydaskrl!), controlling the ship is tricky outside the Kerbin/Mun system:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.hassallcastle.talktalk.net/kerbal/04.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002204.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReturn trip, looking good for re-capture as the ship\\\u0027s velocity is slower than Kerbin so it should catch us up:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.hassallcastle.talktalk.net/kerbal/05.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002205.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERe-capture, a few small adjustments and Kerbin\\\u0027s gravity grabs my plucky Kerbanauts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.hassallcastle.talktalk.net/kerbal/06.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002206.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERe-entry, greeted by a sun-rise!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.hassallcastle.talktalk.net/kerbal/08.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002208.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal stats:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.hassallcastle.talktalk.net/kerbal/09.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002209.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really enjoyed this challenge, and I hope they give us some more planets/moons to explore asap. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nivvydaskrl","CreatedById":6789,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-24T05:24:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOoh, very cool, Bedazzled.
