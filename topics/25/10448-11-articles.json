For full unmanned control around the mun you need full kerbin coverage and additionally **3** powersats in **any** mun orbit or **1** in a mun-polar orbit and **1** in a mun equatorial orbit. \n\u003E \n\u003E The satellites must be launched on personal missions, and can be communal. They don\\\u0027t have to be though. To keep things simple, you can switch satellites from \\\u0027private\\\u0027 to \\\u0027communal\\\u0027, but that switch will be permanent.
