Please indicate clearly what you\u0027re using.\n\n- Nothing may break or fall off, burn or explode.\n\n- No launch clamping.\n\n- No exploitable airfoils, this includes procedural fairings and infiniglide flaps.\n\n- No SRBs, seperatrons, RCS, ullage or any other thrust, jet or other dV source including force decouplers.\n\n- Your rocket must burn for no more than ONE second. In terms of SD video capture, that\u0027s 25 frames. 30 if you\u0027re capturing in NTSC.\n\n- Kerbin escape velocity counts as \u0022infinite\u0022. Can you do \u0022infinite\u0022 on just one second of burn?\n\nSCORING:\n\nMaximum altitude attained AKA Kerbin apoapse.\n\n(Cue the decoupler exploits. No. LFO engines only).\n\n(Note: all the information is there, for those of you who can do math, to calculate just how much fuel is needed for each engine to burn for exactly one second and to top the tanks accordingly.
