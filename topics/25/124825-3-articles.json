This is a bug that\u0027s been around since KSP was created. I even warned Nathan of it before they released 1.0.5. If you dive to a location where the depth is \u0026gt; 1,000 m on any planet, you\u0027ll pass through the terrain and into the center of the planet\u0027s mesh. There is no \u0027crack\u0027, it\u0027s every planet.\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, your challenge will always be taking advantage of a known bug if they dive deeper than 1,000m\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUm... Actually, the first time I pushed a submarine down to under 1000 meters, it collided with the ground at ~1040. The ground still exists at that point, you need only keep the camera above 1000 meters BSL. When I crashed (at 40 m/s, you can guess the results), the camera was below 1000 meters BSL, and the ground I crashed into was invisible. Insofar as I can tell, this is a visual-only bug, and unrelated to whatever mysterious forces allowed me to clip through the terrain while AFK.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m tempted to make a SAS-powered or wheel-motor-powered prop-driven sub with anemic levels of thrust, but infinite range due to dozens of RTGs. Unfortunately, I\u0027m not on a PC with KSP installed at the moment. Also, getting the balance and streamlining right for a sub like that would be HARD. Even something as simple as direct-drive SAS would be independently buoyant, and also generate considerable torque. Additionally, getting it to be power-efficient whilst also being of reasonable size and shape for aquatic usage could be tricky.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-12T04:08:52Z\u0022 title=\u002211/12/2015 04:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pds314\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
