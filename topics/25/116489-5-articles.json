Stay level until you see the beginnings of Mach effects (around 260 m/s), then smoothly pull up to 30-35 degrees.\n\nSwitch SAS to \u0027Hold Prograde\u0027 at 7500 m altitude.\n\nSwitch SAS to \u0027Stability Assist\u0027 after you reach 420 m/s and pitch up to 12-15 degrees.\n\nWhen you reach 12 km altitude, pitch down to the horizon until the vertical speed indicator gets very close to 10 m/s.\n\nAllow pitch and speed to rise naturally. The shock cone may get really hot.\n\nWatch your speed top out (should be over 1500 m/s) and **allow it to begin dropping**. \\*\n\nWait until 27 km before pressing 1 to activate closed cycle mode for the Rapier.\n\nAs soon as your apoapsis is over 36 km (just a couple of seconds), switch SAS to \u0027Hold Prograde\u0027.\n\nKill engines when desired apoapsis is achieved.\n\nCircularize.\n\nReentry is straightforward.\n\nThere are no airbrakes, so pitch is used to remove unwanted speed.\n\nBecause there are no airbakes, runway approach should be fairly low and slow.\n\nTouchdown below 100 m/s for safety.\n\nI used the Place-Anywhere RCS ports rather than the thruster blocks due to heat tolerance.

The only roll authority on the vessel is the reaction wheel and the Rapier\u0027s roll authority, so it was very difficult to counteract.
