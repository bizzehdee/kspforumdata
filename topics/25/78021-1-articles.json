You are allowed to transfer kerbals to separate spacecraft if you wish. Just remember to include the cost of each space craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you want to do is be able to take people to Laythe and back with the cheapest possible price per ticket that will be able to keep the program running indefinitely. This means that a ticket needs to be able to pay for the fuel there and back, all dropped stages, and the costs of recovery of dropped vessels. If a fueling trip to a station that refuels the Laythe bus needs to happen every 10 tickets, then a ticket will have to include 1/10th of that refueling trip\u0027s cost. If a Laythe bus drops stages (not recommended), a ticket needs to include the cost of those lost stages. Note: 1 ticket is for one kerbal, so if each trip takes 2 kerbals and costs 1000 funds (no idea if that figure is realistic. I doubt it) in total, then a ticket costs 500 funds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, if the craft can land at the KSC, then you don\u0027t have to include the cost of it in the total cost.
