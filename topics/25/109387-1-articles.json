With just one whiplash jet engine, I was able to go around 1,500 m/s. So here\u0027s the challenge: Create a craft that can go ridiculous speed at low altitudes \n\n**Rules**\n\n1. No cheating (don\u0027t use the f12 menu!)\n2. The attempt must be made under\n3. Heat shield and fairings are suggested but not required\n4. Attach a .craft link for your entry. If this is not done, the submissions will be discarded unless there is a valid reason.\n5. Set the speed at below 3,000 meters above sea level and take a screenshot(f1 or fn\u002Bf1) having one screenshot while flying at around its top speed and one of the f3 menu is ok\n6. Some part clipping is ok as long as it isn\u0027t ridiculous (use common sense)\n7. Most of the craft must survive especially the probe / kerbal(s?)\n8. You can use MechJeb and still be considered stock\n9. Use the latest version (1.0.2)\n10. HAVE FUN!\n\nHonorable Mentions will be given to some of the largest crafts, smallest crafts, and any craft that can make me laugh. Also, if I need to have more categories I will.\n\n**Leaderboards**\n\n**STOCK**\n\nManned:\n\nUn-manned:\n\nHonorable Mentions:\n\n**MODDED**\n\nManned:\n\nUn-manned:\n\nHonorable Mentions:\n\n**MY FAVORITES**"}]}
