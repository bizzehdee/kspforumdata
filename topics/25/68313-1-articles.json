The rules are pretty simple: the SSTO can\u0027t have the capacity to make it to a stable orbit without docking, no mod parts, no cheats, and no ARM claw. This will require a rendezvous craft of sorts to dock with the SSTO in the sub-orbital path, as well as a decent docking ability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EScoring\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E5 points for every km below 200,000 m for the SSTO\u0027s apogee\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E1 point for every part under 50 for the SSTO\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E1 point for every part under 300 for the rendezvous craft at launch\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E100 points if you can return to rendezvous craft to a stable orbit\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eminus 20 points if the rendezvous craft pushes/pulls the SSTO in orbit\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E20 points if the SSTO doesn\u0027t have RAPIER engines\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E5 points for every 500 m above Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere the docking is achieved\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KissSh0t","CreatedById":57142,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-06T03:15:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow do you dock with something in orbit if you are not in orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John Crichton","CreatedById":102565,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-06T03:53:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you dock with something in a stable orbit...don\u0027t you have to match velocities and therefore end up in a stable orbit before docking too?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"digitaleyes","CreatedById":106489,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-06T03:53:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESend up the refueling vessel and park it around 150,000 m over Kerbin.

Any entry for this would rely on a craft being nearly perfectly balanced on fuel vs consumption so that a perfect launch would leave it just a 100 m/s or so shy of a stable orbit, that way you could have enough time to use another craft to link up and dock to transfer fuel. Timing is literally everything on this challenge tho, if you are off by to much you\u0027ll never be able to correct, and without Mods like MechJeb I\u0027m not sure how you\u0027d ever get this timing down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do have 1 thought on this challenge that appears to be within the rules but ultimately defeats the purpose of the challenge, And that would be to have your craft rendezvous on the ground and use the extra power from the rendezvous craft to push your SSTO into a full orbit. As such I\u0027d recommend you add on to your rules that both craft must be off the ground when they rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TJPrime","CreatedById":101641,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-06T11:07:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESSTO stands for \u0027Single Stage To Orbit\u0027.
