The Abort system shuts down the RAPIER engines, pops all the decouplers on the wings and deploys the four parachutes. You\u0027ll probably need to use it during R\u0026amp;D, unless you like killing Kerbals. The plane is also equipped with an RGU so it can be flown unmanned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.P.S. Notes on flying. Before adding anything, it\u0027s very easy to get off the runway but be careful not to over rotate or you\u0027ll have the tail off. Fuel first drains evenly from the foremost and rearmost tanks, then it drains from the mid-forward tank before the mid-rear tank, so fuel shifting may have to be done to avoid a tail heavy condition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP^3.S. Why RAPIERs when it has no oxidizer?

Dunno why, but soon as it\u0027d go vertical under MechJeb control it\u0027d yaw left or right and wouldn\u0027t pull out of it. After changing the tailfins it works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtra odd is with rockets above and below the wings, it wouldn\u0027t yaw, but the thrust would run out too soon. Soooo, turbojets, which combined with the Rapiers use up all the fuel in the wing tanks by the time orbit is reached, leaving just a bit more than enough oxidizer in them to deorbit. Since I don\u0027t have it setup for fuel to flow *to* the wing tanks I dumped them and their engines after the flight path was on target back to KSP - but they could be kept for a fully reusable SSTO spaceplane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill wishing for a spaceplane ascent guidance module for MechJeb so it won\u0027t try to fly them like rockets.
