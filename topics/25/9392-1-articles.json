Create a ship that you can put into orbit around the Mun with a dropship vehicle attached. Release the vehicle from the mothership in orbit and have it land on the Mun. Then meet up with the mothership in orbit. I\\\u0027m not sure if MechJeb can pull this off, my original configuration was to have Mechjeb on the dropship but something wasn\\\u0027t right as I couldn\\\u0027t control the ship and activating autopilot made it go all weird. My next attempt will be to have the command module as part of the dropship and leave the Mechjeb on the mothership.
