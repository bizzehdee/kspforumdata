Flying this mission it seemed to me that this wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t ideal and I could do it more efficiently so for the second stage of refuelling I built my Mk2 refueler. This used a little less fuel but was an absolute pig to fly and wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t worth the effort, I also thought I better take up some extra monopropellant as I will have a number of dockings and don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t want to run out. This was unnecessary as I had massive amounts of monoprop left over. Even though I thought I had done the calculations to know how much fuel I needed to lift, it turned out that no I still need heaps more. My final fuelling mission also sent up the Pol-Bop lander as this wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t sent up initially to leave a docking port free on top for refuelling.

I got a good transfer with a minimal wait and set off for Jool, of course the good transfer did mean a very slow transfer but sometimes it is worth it. I aerobraked hard at Jool to set myself up in orbit approximately halfway between Laythe and Vall so as to control the amount of delta V to go to each moon. In retrospect I should probably have set up between Vall and Tylo as I used a lot of fuel in transfers to Pol and Bop that would have been reduced further out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/sMuPB\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/sMuPB\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving established myself in orbit I sent the first landing crew out.

Following a fairly uneventful trip the boys circularized at Pol and prepared the lander for descent. A fairly innocuous spot was picked from the window and the deorbit burn commenced. It was a very easy landing on Pol as there was heaps of fuel so a very slow descent was used. Aster collecting as much science as was readily available Jeb and Bob jumped back in and headed back into orbit. They then went with a minimum velocity escape from Pol (as I had got this wrong a few times I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have any pictures of the return as I didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know if it would work) After rendezvousing with the ship the lander docked, swapped out its crew for Dodfred and Rodsey, cleared all the science to the lab and cleaned the experiments. The lander then redocked to the tug (which was not refuelled) and headed out to Bop. Circularized on arrival at Bop and aimed for a fairly high point to land on. Landing was made at 17,495m and was one of the more difficult as Neither Dodfred nor Rodsey were a pilot so there was no SAS on the lander. After getting out and collecting science and planting a flag it was time to head back. Very straightforward ascent and circularization, rendezvous and docking. The return to the main ship was more interesting, as my escape burn was probably all wrong so there was a huge (422 m/s) burn required to match planes that I hadn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t factored in to my fuel calculations. I then had a circularization burn (257 m/s) before the rendezvous proper could start. At this stage I had a little over 1000 m/s left in the tug and I was thinking I am going to have to quickload from before going to Bop and refuel the tug, however I persevered in case I might make it, however as I wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t expecting to keep it I stopped taking pictures. Along the way I transferred all fuel from the lander to the tug to give it a little more and got fairly close to the main ship. I ran out of fuel while closing the final gap, however as I had over 1400 monopropellent I allowed it to try to finish with RCS, which was successful. I then docked the tug to the Tylo/Vall lander and the lander to the main ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/Zn8up\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/Zn8up\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Tylo/Vall lander was crewed up with Wehrsen and Lemvis and was ready to go once the tug was refuelled. The transfer to Tylo was fairly easy, but the circularisation burn at Tylo took a fair bit of fuel (730\u002B m/s). After having saved in orbit I then spent a large number of attempts to land on Tylo. Again I ran into the problem of lack of confidence in success resulting in fewer than ideal pictures. After 10 attempts I was able to impact Tylo at a speed that did not result in an explosion, I was however falling over on the bounce. I finally worked out the right position for the burns and stuck the lander to the surface of Tylo. What it wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t was a pretty landing and the craft was on a 15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 lean, luckily it was a stable lean so the crew disembarked, collected their science and planted their flag. Then with a lot of hope flowing they attempted to get back to orbit, as they had less fuel left than planned (only 2744 m/s). Having established a low apoapsis (30 km) the circularization burn was planned and showed there was sufficient fuel, which was a major relief. While retracting the landing gear I discovered the impact had been sufficient to make one of the legs immobile. I then rendezvoused the tug and docked it to the lander and towed it on back to the main ship. After docking, transferring science, cleaning out the experiments and swapping Dodfred and Robsey for Thomfal and Wehrbert we set off for Vall. The transfer to Vall was very easy and with a full fuel load in the tug I didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t even think about the need to document it properly. The transfer and refinement put me on track for a polar orbit with only 236.5 m/s required to form the desired orbit. Undocked the lander from the tug burnt for deorbit and proceeded to land on Vall. Again the science, moonwalk and flag followed by ascent. Rendezvous and docking were carried out by the lander as there were huge fuel reserves. The tug then dragged the lander back to the main ship. The tug then docked back to the main ship, the experiments were transferred to the lab, the crew returned to their quarters and the experiments cleaned incase a second Vall landing was to take place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/sTZ5S\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/sTZ5S\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship was then readied for sending the Laythe lander out, at this stage it was discovered that you can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t dock through a decoupler, and it was also noticed that I had missed two parts from the main ship. There was supposed to be a probe core to allow the main ship to return by itself and there should have been a decoupler to allow the Hitchikers to separate so they were guaranteed an easy landing. At this stage I also didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know how much delta V would be available to the main ship as the Laythe lander was still attached and quite heavy. It was decided to launch a rescue/refuel mission to make sure the main ship could return. The rescue ship was simple, 4 radially docked nuclear engines with probe cores attached to enough rocket to get it close enough to the main ship. Once in orbit I decided to refuel the lowest stage to maximise available delta V so a refuel for the refuel was launched. I then planned the transfer at the lowest fuel usage window. Part way to the transfer window I decided with how much delta V I have I can use a faster sub optimum transfer and get there much sooner so the plan was changed and 800 m/s extra was spent to shorten the transfer by more than 250 days. Once in Jools SOI I adjusted the orbit to get a Laythe encounter inbound. I set up for aerocapture at Laythe and for little fuel got myself into a 100 km orbit. I then sent the main ship to Laythe to meet up with the refuel. The refuel then rendezvoused with the main ship and each engine was docked to the main ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/w38AA\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/w38AA\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe whole main ship with Laythe lander still attached dropped its periapsis to enable the lander to hit a clear point in the Sagen sea. After transferring out the last of the fuel in Laythes flotation tanks the main ship was undocked, turned around and burnt to lift its periapsis above the atmosphere. The laythe lander then proceeded down into the sea on parachutes, which given that there were many were staged to open at various altitudes to minimise the stress on the lander. Following a safe landing the boys (Jonbas and Elger) went for a swim in the sea, and collected the science. They were very disappointed to discover you cannot take seismic readings in the sea but had to make do with what their instruments offered. After jettisoning some parachutes (5T worth) they ascended. The ascent was odd as KER was saying I was still splashed down. I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know what caused this but it was a major problem for me. I got into orbit easily enough but I was still splashed down, so there was no time warp available nor could I rendezvous, and because I was moving over land I couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t change vessel. I tried getting the guys out and then rendezvousing with them, but it just kept crashing the game when I tried to take both out. Eventually while feeling extremely frustrated I decided to try to control from the docking port to see if it would recognise that as not splashed down. When I did this it offered me to undock the decoupler, how a decoupler can be docked I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know, but this was the magic I needed, I was now recognised as in orbit. I then rendezvoused the main ship and spacewalked the guys and their experiments to the main ship. Docking wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t an option as there were no free docking ports and I had forgotten the RCS ports on the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/Lgwbt\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/Lgwbt\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving successfully landed on every moon and returned with science it was time to head home. I moved the main ship to a circular orbit at around Bops altitude. I then brought the tug and landers (which had two of the crew inside in case I had wanted to do an extra landing) to meet up with the main ship. I disconnected an engine to free up a docking port, transferred the crew from the the Pol-Bop lander to the Tylo/Vall lander and all the fuel from the Pol-Bop lander too. I then docked the tug and lander filled up the main ship to max fuel,transferred the crew to their quarters, undocked the tug, redocked the engine and we were ready to head home. I nice early transfer window was available, so the journey home started only 34 days later. 1 course refinement after a year put me on a good course for setting up an aerocapture at Kerbin. I set up my aerobraking periapsis andgot a reasonable aerocapture, though the apoapsis was higher than desired, so I merely raised periapsis instead of circularizing. I then circularized at periapsis to give a 150 km circular orbit. When I had done a few orbits a landing window opened up (large patch of water in the sun). My deorbit burn had me passing over KSC on the way down which gave the crew their first decent view of home in about 6 years. Landing was primarily by parachute with a small burn to ensure a safe landing speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E18648.9 science points were returned along with the 12 crewmembers who were now well experienced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/brrlI\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/brrlI\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully this will satisfy all the requirements for this challenge (what level I am not sure, I was aiming for a Jebediahs level but not sure if I hit everything needed)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESqwazare: Congratulations, you have finished the JOOL-5 Challenge on Jebediah\u0027s Level! \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWow, you really built a huge main ship!

One would load without any of the parts originally surface-attached to the command pods. Three different times, I had a bug where an undocking pod would suddenly catapult away from the ship 90 degrees from the docking port, the port would fly in a different direction, and small parts would remain in their original position by the main vessel, attached to nothing but unmovable. And once, a few of the SSTO\u0027s parts would detect collisions with the ground and explode (wing, tailfin, intakes) while the plane was still 100m in the air. The fuel lines on the Vall lander got corrupted somehow when the subassembly was placed in the cargo bay, so I managed the fuel manually during the flight. The lander pod would spin in small circles if you tried to use SAS to hold it still, but only when not attached to lift stages... it managed to make it despite this, but I wish I knew why. Near the end, a bug that caused the ship to disintegrate when undocking meant that all the kerbals had to be spacewalked back to the SSTO and the second pod and 4-man can had to be left in orbit. The original intent was to land with the entire Minnow back in the cargo bay, and I\u0027m really glad I thought to put enough seats in the SSTO for everybody just in case.
