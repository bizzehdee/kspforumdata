This is where I got my idea for the challenge. You must assemble a rocket that will get you to kerbin using nothing more than KAS and the spare parts letting the countryside ( courtesy of hyper edit). The only requirements are you must assemble it piece by piece. If needed you are allowed to edit the cfg to reduce the number of kerbals needed. Ie screwdriver doesn\u0027t require engineers or to increase the weight limit that kerbals can move. I know it can be prohibitive how many engineers you\u0027d need just to assemble a medium sized rocket. I\u0027ll post pics when I attempt it myself.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sardia","CreatedById":149922,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-23T06:28:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/Ux7WT\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/Ux7WT\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nfirst attempt started off well,\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe rocket was building straight up and I was feeling I wouldn\u0027t even need the extra gear to make sure it stayed up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rocket is too tall, and I can\u0027t hold items in my inventory and jump, cuz I\u0027d be too heavy.
