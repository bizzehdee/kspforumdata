Apply some inflation, say 13% to the national budget, so that 10 turns later that national budget would be 600800, and as a result, anyone with a 1% budget would get 6008 per turn at that point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApply a modifier(or several) based upon overall performance, such as advancing your program. Keep progressing and moving towards some end goal, and you generate prestige for your program, and this makes you look good, so you get larger budgets as a result, something like \u002B0.2% per successful mission that isn\\\u0027t to far behind the leading edge. If 0.2% were the value for a full prestige gain, then achieving 35,000m when everyone else achieved 70,000m shouldn\\\u0027t be worth the same increase, say 0.15%. You stil progressed, your program is more impressive than it was, but you didn\\\u0027t do something new and really WOW people.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETech should probably have a sliding cost as well. The first to research it pays full cost. All 10 n one turn do it, then all ten pay full cost. Later completions of an already achieved tech level should be cheaper. This of course should wait until after there is a stable cost/income progression that works well with minimal anomalies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an incentive to drive forwards and achieve your goals, completing firsts should achieve a one-off payout. Don\\\u0027t divide it among those that achieve it, just give it to everyone thats gets there that turn, but it needs to be a campaign first. Going to 35,000m when someone else went to 70,000m is nothing special at all. its a successful mission and progresses your program, so you receive the prestige bonus, but no one-off payout, should have reached 70,000m if you wanted that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd last, a subsidy system, to keep it interesting. A system like this benefits good players more than anyone else. because everyone works with similar budgets, and has the same prospects to generate a larger bonus, those you can do the same mission on a cheaper budget will have more to work with next turn. Several firsts and several missions with the cheapest rocket, and you could be sitting on a very sizable lead between your budget level, and the surplus cash you have banked at the moment. So to keep players from being left behind in a campaign, subsidize them by some amount to help them keep up once far enough behind. not enough that they can leapfrog the leader and get back out in front, but enough that its VERY difficult to actually get out ahead of the pack enough to be unchallenged in being first to do something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI make no claims to balance, the numbers are pretty much just off the top of my head and would need some tweaking to find good values, but it might do everything needed from it with a minimum of fuss, and best of all, it could be very predictable. players would know exactly what their payouts might be. If everyone does the same mission in the same turn, the cheapest rocket is the best choice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it becomes worth considering if you should go for say, the 35000m mission, or go straight to the 70,000m mission. Both will only get you a prestige increase in your budget, each will only get you one payout. the 70,000m mission should probably carry a larger payout, so you get more money sooner, but getting two full size prestige bonuses for doing both missions may well yield the greater income just a couple turns down the road. Choices, places for people to have a different decision and diverge. Makes for an interesting campaign race instead of always only clamoring to do the next mission up, or two ahead of the current one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eleaping ahead might put you ahead and help you stay there by collecting the payouts. more money sooner means more money to do firsts, which means more payouts, and more money to do firsts. steady progression might build the prestige more rapidly and leave you with more income later when preparing to goto the moon if you can\\\u0027t easily afford it the moment its viable. once programs reach orbit and there becomes much more room to do a wider selection of missions, the divergent paths might show their strengths since it becomes impossible to guarantee yourself all the firsts, there\\\u0027s too many for only you to get them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne can also crowdsource the list of achievable firsts by looking here, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=10554.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E[suggestion] Some suggestions for achievements.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats that.
