You are the right stuff! Your name is on the guest list, aka Roll of Honour, welcome to the party. (btw mechjeb is allowed by the rules see below.)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It does indeed reach an orbit of much higher than the required, I was just tired and trying to shorten the video, so I did not really think about the fact I might have cut out parts you wanted to see for factual info, and it does come to a complete stop as well, at the end of the video it is barely going 40 m/s so I think you can find that easy enough to believe. Either way I will record a new video in a day or two of it going and landing on Mun and then coming back just for \\*\\*\\*\\*s and giggles.\n\nExclipse, thanks for clarifyin. Would be interested by a M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn or Minmus mission, X-Wing looks capable. I understand tired, I get very tired and confused sometimes due to an illness I have so I can sympathise with that. And in a way because of that tiredness my dilemma remains. Obviously the apogee is much higher than required and I cannot see the parts cut from the video and I do believe whatever you tell me but when you say it reached much higher then required I am not quite sure if you understand about the rule that the PE also has to be above 70,000m as well as the AP. (Alternatively leaving Kerbin SOI and entering another also qualifies.)\n\nI feel I should explain to make sure there is no doubt.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Rules\n\u003E 1. The craft may not lose any parts in flight, no decoupling allowed. \n\u003E \n\u003E 2. The craft must lift off horizontally, reach orbit (PE \u003E 70,000m) and land intact ready for \u0027refuelling\u0027.\n\u003E \n\u003E 3. All fuel tanks, wings (lift generators) and engine parts must be stock, for fairness.\n\nIts just that from 11 mins onwards the velocity, altitude and elapsed time numbers in the vid of the X-Wing\u0027s orbit all correspond with a 62,000m PE, according to the elliptical orbit tab in KSP calculator! Hence my dilemma. So I am not sure if you understood the PE rule or whether you made a burn and retro burn, in the 5 mins you cut, which cancelled each other out but raised the PE briefly, or even whether you successfully landed another mission where the PE was above 70,000m. Either of the last two is a K Prize whereas the first is an unintentional gate crash ! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) Sorry if I seem pedantic, its just I tend to have to force myself to think clearly to counter my illness and I hate to make mistakes where other people are concerned, its almost an obsession!!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-12T23:04:20Z\u0022 title=\u002209/12/2012 11:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 12, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by boolybooly**"},{"CreatedByName":"Exclipse","CreatedById":45977,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-13T00:51:24Z","Content":"Haha, no I did two burns, I can post the bit with my initial PE being above 70km.

While there is no prize specifically for this, the fact that you set it as your goal and did not give up until you achieved it deserves recognition and since you requested recognition for it I made a unique mention of it on the Roll of Honour aka the guest list. Thanks for posting your video and congratulations to you and your team!\n\nExclipse, thanks for explaining and in the light of that explanation there can be no doubt that you take your rightful place on the Roll of Honour and are a very welcome guest at the K-Prize party.
