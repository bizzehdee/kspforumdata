I have managed to put multiple vehicles into orbit and have almost completed the orbital assembly of the first of many space station/orbital refuel platforms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at some of the creations on this forum, my imagination cannot help but run wild. I have tried myself to turn some of these dreams into reality, only to find my building skill severely lacking. The VAB/SPH seem very twitchy and getting parts exactly where I want them is just not happening. I need alot more practice before I can attempt anything on such a grand scale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do however wish to share one of my visions and challenge those with more experience than myself to prove it\u0027s possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChallenge follows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***********************************************\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECreate an interplanetary vessel using stock parts with the following capabilities:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Ability to reach, orbit and return from ALL celestial bodies in the known galaxy from Kerbin with margin for error.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Ability to carry at least one re-dock-able, adaptable purpose, planetary lander vehicle. (Building bases, mining, crew transfer etc)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Come complete with an emergency rescue boat. To rescue stranded Kerbals in case the lander vehicle is damaged and/or cannot return to the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Ability to transfer fuel to/from the ship in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Ability to be launched without the use of debug (hacked gravity etc) or Mechjeb. Orbital assembly is acceptable if required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Ability to look BADASS!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***********************************************\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVision:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink along the lines of Galactica, Nostromo, Sulaco or any other monstrous starship ever seen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe vessel will be permanently harbored in space and will never enter an atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts function is to sustain and transport smaller, less able vehicles across the galaxy so that they are able to complete their mission, return to the \u0027base ship\u0027 and return home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe vessel could also double as a mobile refuel tanker or colony ship. (Dock spare fuel tanks or habitation units instead of lander craft)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart count is not really an issue, although the less parts used the better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWeaponry not required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeavy armor plating not required although the vessel should have some kind of shell (kind of required in order to make it look like an actual starship)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***********************************************\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink you can make it happen?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI saw this the other day on Rocket Builders forum, looked liked a fun thing to try, but also hard, me with my skills failed horribly ... But I think other people should try this as well because for some reason the author didn\u0027t post this in this forum so I did. To win the craft most be with the least parts that means the lowest amount will win. Go crazy with mods (But not to crazy like 200 mods that no one can download) and if you are even nicer, posting the craft file will be really appreciated. Also a craft with less then 600 parts is recommended.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbin-JP","CreatedById":77590,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T12:28:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHOCgaming is doing this isn\u0027t he?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eran100","CreatedById":17678,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T13:10:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kerbin-JP\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kerbin-JP\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHOCgaming is doing this isn\u0027t he?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t really know him... does he do that?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
