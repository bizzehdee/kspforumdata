KER, KAC, NavHud, Transfer Window planner, Precise Node.\n\n- How many Kerbals are on the mission?  \n\n5, one for each moon\n\n- How many launches was needed to start your mission from Kerbin?  \n\n1\n\n- How much did your mission cost?  \n\n1.959.972 for the main launch, 632.665 for the refuel\n\n- Did you needed a refueling mission?  \n\nYes, but only because I wanted the main ship to be reusable (and the mun trolled me on the initial transfer to Jool). It got back to Kerbins SOI on its own and was refueled for capture burn. Rendevouz of a massive refueler with the mothership on escape trajectory is fun!\n\n- Did you bring additional stuff like satellites, rovers, etc?  \n\nNo\n\n- Share the delta-V information too, if you tracked it!  \n\n3583 to Kerbin orbit  \n\n4820 Kerbin -\u003E Laythe (the mun troll...)  \n\n1404 Laythe -\u003E Tylo  \n\n1009 Tylo -\u003E Vall  \n\n1202 Vall -\u003E Bop  \n\n585 Bop -\u003E Pol  \n\n2279 Pol -\u003E Kerbin SOI  \n\n2342 Kerbin Capture and going equatorial (after refueling)  \n\n---------  \n\n17224 (13641 from LKO)  \n\nnot including lander d/v\n\n- Any additional note or description?  \n\nReuseable nuke mothership.

It actually started out as an extension of the Elcano Challenge, but I thought I\u0027d aim for everything and see what happens. This is all done in 1.0.5 (and just in time too!). No mods were used for the mission, it was done all stock. I did use alexmoon\u0027s web based transfer window planner.\n\n![AtaXfXO.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/AtaXfXO.jpg)\n\nI sent three kerbals on the mission, though one was mostly for show (Marissa). She was the science officer and stayed behind on the Mothership (called the Iron Narcissus) in case the crew needed a safety pilot. The main crew members were Julella (pilot) and Obemy (engineer), who have been my intrepid Elcano crew on all the missions. Julella and Obemy landed on all the moons (2 Kerbals).\n\nThe entire mission itself was launched in one giant ship (pictured above). It weighed about 2300 tons at launch, was a bit over 500 parts, and cost about 1.5M Funds (which includes all the Elcano vehicles). I didn\u0027t use any refueling for the Jool-5 portions of the mission, but I did use the miniISRU parts for refueling my Laythe circumnavigation vehicle.\n\nPol, Bop, and Vall all used a small lander tug (named Tin Poppy) to deliver rovers to the surface and return the crew to the Mothership. For Laythe, the crew landed in the boat (which is capable of driving on land) and returned via an ascent vehicle which was delivered later by probe. Tylo was also a special case, where one crew member (Obemy) brought the rover down, and Julella brought down the crew return vehicle. Both vehicles on Tylo unintentionally used some lithobraking to land, but managed to complete their mission otherwise.\n\nSpoiler\n\nTin Poppy\n\n![ShdrtdL.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ShdrtdL.jpg)\n\nPayload Configuration\n\n![qW243Td.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/qW243Td.jpg)\n\nI didn\u0027t track all the dV, but I did keep the alexmoon plots for the ejections.\n\nSpoiler\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Rf9Nj/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nI\u0027ve posted some of the progress earlier in this thread, but since it\u0027s all scattered and I broke the album up into several parts, I figure it\u0027s probably easier for me to post an index here, rather than filling up a post with a bunch of separate albums. \u0022Mission Start\u0022 is where the actual mission begins.

The first stage is the one for landing second for orbiting, third for final approach. After that the kerbal will transfer over to the passenger module (The ship is a giant space shuttle which isn\u0027t reusable)  If it has an atmo, I would use an SSTO Which actually is also a miner of some sort. THe design is pretty unique It uses heat shields combined with airbrakes to slow down. After it lands it would mine a few resources for fuel then leave. After it is approaching the kerbal will get out and go to the passenger module. I have 4 landers and 1 plane, all non reusable.

I\u0027ve been KSPing for a couple of years now, and thought it was past time to tip my hat to you lot, who are in my opinion geniuses. I\u0027d also love your input, because I think I may have bitten off rather a lot...\n\nSo I\u0027ve been all over Eve and Duna, but I\u0027ve never gone to Jool. So, obviously, as soon as I heard about the Jool-5 challenge, I promptly decided to do it. And then, with a bit of arrogance, I decided the top level of difficulty isn\u0027t quite enough, and I want to set myself some additional constraints:\n\n1. **Simultaneity.** Instead of visiting the moons in sequence, I have to have one Kerbal on each moon **at the same time**. So that means 5 landers, and an awful lot of transfer windows.\n\n2. **No littering.** Everything has to be recovered, except that which can be soft-landed on another planet. I need to work out a way of bringing everything home, or leaving it safely on the surface of the moons.\n\n3. **SSTO mothership.** However I launch anything else, the mothership has to reach orbit as an SSTO spaceplane. No pressure.\n\nI\u0027ve been deep in design and planning for a while, and I think I\u0027m nearly there. I have a mothership, which I managed to get to orbit once or twice without flipping...\n\n![hn0JjRX.png](http://i.imgur.com/hn0JjRX.png)\n\nAnd the completed ship that will leave LKO is going to look something like this:\n\n![DJxPGR8.png](http://i.imgur.com/DJxPGR8.png)\n\nClearly, the additional constraints I\u0027m applying mean I have a huge payload to take to Jool, and the tyranny of the rocket equation has already led me to add two huge nuclear boosters, each weighing over 80T. And, because I need to be able to recover them, I\u0027ve created a little ion tug that can bring them back under escape velocity while the rest of the craft goes interplanetary. At the massive TWR of 0.01...\n\n  I was a little surprised at how hard it was to design a Tylo lander, but I\u0027ve settled on this modular design, with an engine plate, four pillars and an upper support section, all of which should fall away undamaged after descent to reveal the ascent stage. Fingers crossed.\n\n![6JUMLcF.png](http://i.imgur.com/6JUMLcF.png)\n\nAnyway, I reckon I should head first to Tylo, which is the heaviest payload, whereupon I can dispatch my two ion landers outwards to Bop and Pol, before going for a Vall intercept - throwing out my Vall lander on the way past - direct to Laythe to orbit and drop my Laythe lander. I\u0027ll then definitely need a refuel, for which I\u0027ll probably use my big nuclear booster and a million ion engines to get it there, before reversing route. What do you think? Anything that I haven\u0027t considered that might trip me up?\n\nThanks for your time, and fly safe.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-24T18:29:54Z\u0022 title=\u002203/24/2016 06:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 24, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Empyrean**\n  \n\u003Cedit to=\u0022\u0022 fix=\u0022\u0022 an=\u0022\u0022 image=\u0022\u0022 link=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/edit\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Nathaniel411","CreatedById":146942,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-24T23:22:09Z","Content":"Change of plan.
