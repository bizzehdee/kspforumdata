Feel free to save Kerbals from Orbit to get more crewmembers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Set every gain to 50% (funds, science, rep) and every loss to 200%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- No quickload, no reverting flights (check your staging \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the interesting rules:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- To leave Kerbin\u0027s SOI to the inner planets, you need at least 2 Kerbals (it\u0027s a long journey, they need companie - also, it\u0027s to navigate and do safety-checks in deep-space)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- To leave Kerbin\u0027s SOI to the outer planets, you need at least 4 Kerbals (same as above, but the journeys are way longer - anti-boredom-measures need at least 4 Kerbals)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- To leave Kerbin\u0027s SOI at all, your Kerbals need training or experience. Only Kerbals which have participated in a trainings-camp in space around Kerbin for at least 20 days are qualified to leave Kerbin\u0027s SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- For every Kerbal alive in your Roster, you get permission to launch 10.000 funds to space. This means at start with 10 Kerbals you can launch up to 100.000 funds per start. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Building rockets takes time. Building time is: 0 to 100.000 funds = 5 days; to 200.000 funds = 15 days; to 500.000 funds = 80 days. Same goes for planes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If you recover a rocket or plane from the launchway, you can use it again right away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- For communication between Kerbin and Deep-Space, you need a Satelite in Geostationary Orbit above KSC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- For communication between planets you also need a satellit just below (about 1million meters) the planets SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo restrictions to the tech-tree\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse whatever mods you like, I personally think that FAR is cheating (it makes things just too damn easy). I play this vanilla with texturemods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are my rules, maybe some of you find them useful :-) Have fun, and feedback if you like it or not would be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreetings!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mideg","CreatedById":126846,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T09:06:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat rules, I try to follow a similar set.
