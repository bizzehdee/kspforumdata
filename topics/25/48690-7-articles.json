I miss-spent my points after the first mission and didn\u0027t get all the science gear I wanted - oh well. My design is similar to Vector\u0027s, using the multiple science pods. I used a lander to grab each pod and take it down to a Mun biome. The pod ship (which I named the Pineapple Express) also acted as a fuel depot for the lander. I initially planned to collect science from all of the Mun biomes, Minmus, as well as the space zones above the two moons and Kerbin as well. I ran out of fuel, however, and wasn\u0027t able to get to Minmus, as well as missing the 4 Mun biomes too far from its equator.

So far things are going very well. By burning more intelligently and going for more advantageous intercepts with Eve and Moho I have managed to do the Eve \u0026gt; Moho \u0026gt; Kerbin \u0026gt; Duna approach phase and still have over 1800 oxidizer remaining. That, for comparison, is *double* what I had at this point in my previous attempt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, this time around I did not get a free encounter with Ike while passing Duna. The two Ike crew reports (low and high altitude) and four Ike EVA reports (low and high altitude x2 command pods) are probably worth around 150 total science. That\u0027s quite a lot to give up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, here are my options:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Continue past Duna without the Ike intercept. Perform a free return to Kerbin and get a boost up to Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Land on Duna, pick up the additional points for a ground sample as well as landed EVA reports (x2) and the landed crew report, then escape back to Kerbin (or head to Jool, not sure which is better) via an Ike gravity assist plus Oberth burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna is actually quite cheap. Delta V required is 1300 (both down and up, so 2600 total), but landing is actually almost free with 5 parachutes, so really it\u0027s more like 1500 total. That\u0027s *less* than the cost of a landing and ascent at Vall. Not sure what the additional science value of a Duna landing is, I\u0027m guessing about 350 total, plus I\u0027d get all the reports I would be missing at Ike, so about 500 total difference.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-12T14:36:02Z\u0022 title=\u002211/12/2013 02:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T15:10:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow about swinging by Ike on the way home from Jool?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor landings, how practical is lithobraking?
