I started my Jool-5/Grand tour mission. Right now i am visiting the other planets but my Jool-5 ship/landers are at Kerbin orbit. The bad thing is that i noticed a major design flaw at my Laythe lander and a tug that i have that will make completion of the mission impossible (forgot a ladder). Can i change the lander and tug with a new one? I will have fixed the design flaw and the design of these 2 units will be almost the same. The balance of this change is that it will make the drive unit and trip to Jool more unstable since the replacement will remove some struts that i have placed for stability\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s still in Kerbin orbit then it can be changed, yes.

I found it last night. Once you have an encounter with a planet stop what you are doing. Then double click on the targeted planet at any place at its orbit in order to focus on that planet. Zoom in. You will see a purple orbit that is the ship\u0027s orbit once in the planet\u0027s SOI then by adjusting the maneuver node you can get the desired orbit. At the pic below is a planned EvE orbit. You can see the yellow orbit (target orbit), the orange orbit (current orbit) and the purple orbit (planned orbit). The final result is a normal almost 0 degrees equatorial orbit at Eve with aerocapture with the least amount of \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV from 32 days away.
