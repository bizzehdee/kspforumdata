Use the latest version of FAR, v0.15.4 as of this post.\n\n2. The only source of thrust on your vehicle can be the J-33 \u0022Wheesley\u0022 Basic Jet Engine. No physics-breaking magic drives of any kind, no rockets, no turbojets, ion-thrusters, RCS, or anything but basic jets.\n\n3. No debug cheats, no modifying the drag or area ruling in FAR or using hyperedit.\n\n4. You may use mods, but please specify what mods. Don\u0027t use mods that change the J-33 engine or alter FAR. I can veto exceedingly overpowered mods (for example, a mod which adds massless indestructible wings or unrealistic intake air tanks).\n\n5. If you can\u0027t sustain a given speed in level flight, it doesn\u0027t count.\n\n6. Post a picture at top speed.\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**Leaderboard:**\n\n1. Pds314 in the Superion at 659.2 m/s\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nMy entry:\n\nThe Superion\n\n![w8dMSOE.png](http://i.imgur.com/w8dMSOE.png)\n\nIt has 6 basic jets and a Mach 1 drag area of 2.099. It is unstable in yaw, so SAS is important.\n\nIt was carefully area-ruled to achieve this performance, and finally reached a speed of 659.2 meters per second at 6516 meters altitude.\n\nIt is reasonably maneuverable at supersonic speeds and, somewhat surprisingly, glides fairly well too.\n\nOn the ground before flight:\n\n![VHgPhkM.png](http://i.imgur.com/VHgPhkM.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-18T22:45:12Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2015 10:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pds314**"}]}
