I don\u0027t see how I can achieve aerobrake using his own resources, and getting there, then matching velocities, before he flies past will be... hectic!

So building all of these and refueling them is going to take a while. For the record, on a lot of these missions I\u0027m going to use one transfer stage with some slight differences to the top docking port setup depending on the lander or other payload that I need to attach to it. This is the DSX deep space refueling ship and transfer vehicle. I just wanted to show here that the thing can get into a 90,000 m orbit by 1,000 m offset without having to stage any of the large engines. So from this point I\u0027ll refuel it and either launch it off to a planet depending on distance or attach payloads to the top. This is meant to be a quick and versatile system that can go to all of the planets and back.
