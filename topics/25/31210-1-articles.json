These wheels are wonderful things and I love them because they have quite a bit of grunt and they\u0027re durable. They don\u0027t blow out, nor do the ones capable of propelling themselves require a power source at the time this post was made. They\u0027re wheels you don\u0027t have to worry about one bit for your rover, hauling or general driving needs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is good. Very good, in fact, because it means I can do this incredibly frivolous challenge and share it with you all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEveryone\u0027s aware of the absolute land speed record. Currently it belongs to Thrust SSC, which used two jet engines to reach a top speed of about 763 MPH. Teams in the UK, USA and Australia are now attempting to develop and drive cars powered by thrust to be the first to break 1000 MPH. That, however, takes a lot of careful planning and the kind of resources that can earn access to jet engines and/or powerful rockets for the express purpose of going as fast as humanly possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s another kind of speed record racing that gathers a lot of entrants due to how relatively easy it is to develop cars for the job: the wheel-driven land speed record. These are cars that have to transfer their power from their engine to the wheels for forward motion-you can\u0027t do it on pure thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith Torpedo\u0027s wheels, it\u0027s possible to hit very high speeds safely, as long as you have the right car for the job. I\u0027ve experimented with numerous setups to see how fast I can go, and now it\u0027s become a research project of mine to figure out how downforce works in Kerbal Space Program when applied to cars, since it seems to alter and greatly improve their driving capabilities, and thus make driving around on Kerbin and any other bodies in the system with atmospheres much more fun and efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe challenge here is very simple: create a land speed record car driven solely by its wheels, with preference given to Torpedo\u0027s wheels to help you in this task since they\u0027re nice, big, and powerful, and drive it along the surface of Kerbin as fast as you can. Outside of using anything with thrusters or any kind of propulsive source that relies on the engines, you are allowed to use whatever mod parts you see fit to do this job, so long as you use all of them as coded. I\u0027ll say that again: nothing with thrust. If you want to put thrusters on your car, you will only be allowed to use them for the means of some sort of fancy ejection system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy add an ejection system? Your car must be manned: no land speed record anyone\u0027s willing to remember was set by something unmanned. Your whole car or at least an ejected, intact cockpit must survive the run for it to be valid. It\u0027s preferable that you have an intact car, as you shall see below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, traditional land speed record attempts here on Earth have the driver doing one run over a mile after a flying start in one direction, then a return run in the other direction and the average of that speed is taken. As we\u0027re talking about setting Kerbal wheel-driven speed records here, you can quietly forget that rule. For a run to be valid here, you simply need to make one run however long you wish, driving as fast as you possibly can before coming to a (relatively, this is KSP after all) safe stop. You must make a recording or take a screencap of your vehicle and your flight record after finishing your drive to prove you\u0027ve done a run.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo then, what will you be playing for? I have a selection of titles here, which you can put into your signatures or something...uh, well, I just thought I\u0027d share this personal quest of mine with the KSP forums on a bit of a whim, so I\u0027m kind of making it up as I go along. Still though, here\u0027s some challenge targets for you all to hit for bragging rights around these parts.
