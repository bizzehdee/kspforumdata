One thing is to re-entry with multiple crafts together. Thats what we are going to do guys ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**CHALLENGE RULES** (can be changed)\n\n1. Re-entry only Vanila Command Pods with heathshield and parachute in ONE physics bubble. Other Vanila parts for estetic purpose is your choice. \n\n[thread=117279]Heat shields can be patched in 1.0 due to pods flipping during reentry.[/thread]\n\n2. Dont use multi reentry craft. (like each pod need to be stand alone craft) \n\n (Pods seperated from single craft are wrong)\n\n3. Do it yourself not by remote-tech etc. (realy guys all you need for this is in stock ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif))\n\n4. No engines or RCS or parts generating lift (wings etc.) are allowed in atmosphere, you can use only reaction wheels to direct crafts.\n\n5. Only non destroyed Pods on ground will be count.\n\n6. Start from low circular orbit max 100km (that is time limitation.. you will find out)\n\n7. Pic or video or it didnt happen ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n **Multiple goals can be achieved.**\n\n1. Land close as possible with Pods next to each other\n\n2. Re-entry with so much Pods your PC can survive (and stay in physics bubble)\n\nList of barbecue grill chefs:\n\nTop 3 for each list.\n\nList1:\n\nList2:\n\nGood luck and come back safe ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T16:30:17Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 04:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by REMD**\n  \nPatch :)"},{"CreatedByName":"Endersmens","CreatedById":80723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T16:53:38Z","Content":"Hey, um, when you say vanilla, does that mean we can\u0027t change the heatshields to add their mass correctly so that the pods are stable on the way down?\n\nMeaning, without changing anything, heat shields won\u0027t add their weight to the bottom of the pod, meaning the pod flips around backwords and blows up. Making duel reentry impossible without flipping back and forth and correcting each one every milisecond.
