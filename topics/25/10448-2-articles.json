This will cost $1500 to research and will be available from turn 3 onwards. Does not require Salvage Tech II. \n\n-**Technologies reduced by 10% (purchased twice):** Booster Tech and Salvage Tech I\n\n-**Contract: Design contest:** Turn 002 will feature the campaign\\\u0027s first design contest. This can be undertaken in parallel to the regular mission you fly. In case of lacking funds, a choice may be made between either participating in the contract or flying a mission. \n\nThe contest is this: Design a craft that can land a crew on one of the polar ice caps, using any number of any part you like, except liquid fuel engines. The design that utilizes the least amount of Solid Fuel Boosters will be the winner. All parts are provided by the contractor, you won\\\u0027t need to pay for any them and any salvage you may recover also won\\\u0027t belong to you. \n\nThe rules for this contest are simple, and as follows:\n\n-Contract entry fee is **$1000**\n\n-Criteria for success: land a pod on polar ice\n\n-Criteria for win: do it with the least amount of boosters\n\n-Payout for success: **$2000**\n\n-Bonus for the winner: **$1000**\n\nMission and contract rewards aren\\\u0027t paid out to you untill the end of the turn, so you can\\\u0027t use rewards from a mission in turn 2 to pay the contract entry fee.\n\nI\\\u0027m putting the deadline for turn 002 at Monday 21-05-2012 23:59 (GMT\u002B2). In case I receive submissions from all active players before that, we can move faster.\n\nGood luck on your endeavours, I\\\u0027m updating the OP with the new missions and tech now\n\nCheers"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-17T11:25:38Z","Content":"I have submitted my entry for the 50km altitude mission, though I think I have acted too much like the hare and run out of funds ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"DonLorenzo","CreatedById":13642,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-17T11:40:34Z","Content":"If you want to redesign or reconsider your mission I\\\u0027ll allow that"},{"CreatedByName":"DonLorenzo","CreatedById":13642,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T12:04:42Z","Content":"Here is an updates excel file with the new tech and the landing strut added to the parts list.
