You can also get EVAs for \u0027flying low\u0027 at KSC and the flagpole.\n\nIt takes a \\*long time\\* to fly to the badlands using the basic jet engine, it also takes a while to get to the poles.\n\nThose ice flows are hazardous near the edge.

You still have to get yourself fairly close, 80km or so and actualy figure out where in space the other craft is in relation to yourself so its still trickier than being able to target from the map but it gets the job done.\n\nGood job on docking pure visual with no RCS or navball assistance. thats just hardcore. its alot easier when you can easily kill relitive velocity a few dozen meters away, poitn both ships at eachother and just give it a touch of gas to dock."}]}
