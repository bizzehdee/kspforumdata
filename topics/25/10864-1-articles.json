I launched right into Minmus\\\u0027s orbital plane in an unstable orbit. After about 3/4 of an orbit I made my burn, only made 1 small correction afterwords. Once I reached Minmus I killed my velocity so I could have a simple landing burn (burning almost last second). I also landed on the trailing side of Minmus so all I had to do was launch straight up to get back into an orbit around Kerbin. Halfway back I made a correction burn for a 19km perapsis for reentry. Could have saved more fuel by aerobraking better but oh well."},{"CreatedByName":"SeventhArchitect","CreatedById":80982,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-15T08:05:29Z","Content":"I call hacks.\n\nIt took me 61 basic parts to get a one man crew, two science modules, and 16 goo canisters to Minmus.
