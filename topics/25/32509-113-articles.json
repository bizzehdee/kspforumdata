Except for rootkiller shots which happen about 5% of the time, the ship can soak up dozens of tons of weaponry which would kill other conventional-armored\u00A0ships several times over. pretty much any part that collides with it is destroyed, no matter the mass or speed, and the armor just doesn\u0027t budge. The only things that showed some signs of success were rooter missiles specifically meant to phase through armor to hit the root part, or strapping a cargo bay to a missile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen i first started using cargo bay armor i knew its partially-indestructible hitboxes were powerful, but i haven\u0027t realised how powerful until now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seems clear that until gear weapons work (even then i doubt it\u0027ll be enough), armor has greatly surpassed weaponry here.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThats weird, ive had good success killing it with 1.2m ASMs, its just that the round needs to be AP tipped AND it needs to be relatively powerful to begin with.\u00A0 My G5 (updated G5 at least, not the one on the uploaded ship as thats the older APS tip, not new pure AP tip) will kill that ship with above 50% consistency when fired at a very specific angle at dead center of mass (itll vaporize 1-2 cargo bays and the root part).\u00A0 The new model SK-IV not so much, but if it doesnt kill it, itll remove 50% of its guns and engines on the 1st hit.\u00A0 Really, even ibeam\u002Bsepatron missiles will hurt it, albeit i will agree with your analasis that killing the core with those is basically not gonna happen (but ofc whats the point of having a strong core when everything inside the ship is gone).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybee its just my machine or something, but sofar i CAN and do kill/damage the SK-IV (even the newer updated one) using properly made 1.2m torps.\u00A0 Ill upload the new updated model when i get some time, so you guys can both try its slightly better armor (its so good that getting a rooting kill is almost never a thing), and ill also post a bit more detail with regards to how i make competitive ASMs, there are tricks that i use to make weapons stronger just like how i make the armor stronger.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also didnt really know cargo bays had indestructible colliders, but after a bit of research it appears only the \u0022door\u0022 part is indestructible, the rest takes hits like anything else.\u00A0 I think that cargo bays are fine though for use, since they actually give us the ability to make a good hull (not to mention the part count savings vs panels everywhere), and can pull us out of the dark ages where EVERY battle was basically a who shoots 1st wins (where ship armor sucked and most vessels carried enough ammo to take out 2-3 targets reliably).\u00A0 Strognest armor is according to my experience hyrbid armor (as in MK2 with structural panels), but pure MK-2 is a good alternative if weight and parts is an issue.\u00A0 Still, i think we need to ban any indestructible parts on missiles themselves (wheels are OK, since those are hard to use and i think the new physics has made them not work so great as the old days where a single wheel on any weapon would cut straight through enemy vessels), since missiles are already very effective against ALL types of armor, and its alot more fun when battles actually require tactics and strategy rather then just firing at a target\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E until it pops (which up to now has been 2-3 shots max to kill a insanely well made ship).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223300716\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002232509\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221519214265\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022174890\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ShadowGoat\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 2/21/2018 at 6:57 AM, ShadowGoat said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nARGH WHERE DID MY SHIP GO?????\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEh whatever.

the right speed, and has structural AP warhead (ibeams, girders, ect), it will kill it in 1 hit when shot at from good angle.\u00A0 Still, i intended the ship to be survivable against most conventional weapons, and most of all resist ibeam spam which has been the bane of ships everywhere (until the SK-IV every single ship ive downloaded or used was reliably killable by a single SRM-6

surprised it stood up to anything good including the dreaded fairing weapons (which are sorta banned to my knowledge since fairings have indestructible colliders), given the aurora is like over a year old and based on the old SK-III hull (with additions in the front and rear) which is completely outdated these days.\u00A0 I have a new SK-III im trying a new core layout with, but sofar its not quite up to competitive standards like the SK-V light cruiser (or even the slightly older SK-IV which was my 1st competitive ship in the last couple years) which may as well be my best ship as ive yet to find any weapon under 20t that can kill it outside of crazy luckshot to teh core which happens at best every 20-30 shots or so (really the only thing thatll consistently destroy it is fairing warheads
