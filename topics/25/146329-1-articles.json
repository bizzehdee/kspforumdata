This system was an excellent discovery, showing that even objects with extremely small amounts of gravity can still have their own Satelites. Ida measures about 23 Miles across, while Dactyl is about 1.5 miles across. Dactyl orbits at about 96 miles above Ida\u0027s surface in a Prograde orbit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow enough of the science, (Even though we all appreciate some amount of it), lets get to the Details!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour objective is to [For the Normal Difficulty] to get a class-C\u00A0to\u00A0E asteroid in orbit around Gilly, the very similiar in size hunk of Carbon. The end result of this is Gilly having a Trojan moon! [A moon of a Moon]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rules:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.The use of Hyperedit or any other mod that does things similiar is strictly prohibited. Your craft gets attacked by the Kraken? No exceptions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.The only mods that are allowed are Graphical, Shader, utility [Kerbal Alarm clock], and a small list below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. You are not allowed to mine from this asteroid, sorry, but if you feel like bringing an extra one for fuel, go right ahead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. This can be probed or manned, but if manned, you must bring the Kerbals back. [If probed, destroy the Evidence of it so Conspiracy Kerbals don\u0027t get suspicious...]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Any mode is allowed for this, but for difficulties higher than Medium, Career mode is required.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. An orbit in between 16 and 47 is required for a passing mission. This is to make it look more like the real thing. [Km is the distance]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7. If the asteroid somehow manages to crash into gilly, you gotta bring it back up and into place. No getting a new one.
