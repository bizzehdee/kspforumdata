Largest colision energy\n2. Highest colision energy/rocket launch cost\n3. \n\n**scoreboards**\n\nThe biggest bang since the big one\n\n1. wossname - 368GJ\n2. tomf - 161GJ\n3. -\n4. -\n5. \n\nBang for your Buck\n\n1. tomf - 2.46MJ/fund\n2. wossname - 1.45MJ/fund\n3. -\n4. \n\n**Rules**\n\nThe bangometer can get to the surface in any way you want, it isn\u0027t part of the challenge. (I used hyperedit)\n\nMods are permitted as long as they don\u0027t give an unbalanced advantage.\n\nFor the biggest bang a screenshot of the science report from the bangometer is prefered. \n\nOtherwise a screenshot that shows the current surface velocity and the current impactor mass will be accepted. Energy is calculated as 1/2mV^2^.\n\nFor the bang for the buch challenge a shot showing the cost in the VAB.\n\nDocking and refueling etc is permitted if but the final cost should include everything that was used in the mission, even if it is reusable.\n\nNo abusing any kind of exploit.\n\n**My attempt**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
