I might call shenanigans if half of your payload is sticking out of a fairing, but that little is perfectly acceptable. Especially if the editor let you do it without tricks of moving things around. Yes, you are allowed to refuel your ship in Kerbin orbit before leaving, as part of the assembly process. \n\nThe one refueling mission to Jool can be manned or unmanned, but you can\u0027t transfer Kerbals with your ship. Don\u0027t give your main ship only four crew members and swap out one with your fueling mission so you have enough to complete level 3.\n\nSorry Stratzenblitz75, for spelling your name wrong in the hall of fame.

Multiple biomes is the way to go for lots of science, it seems. I like the small moons lander, it has a very nice classic sci-fi look.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Also may I dispute the ruling regarding PParts in the OP? Some of us use only procedural fuel tanks and get rid of all the others in order to save RAM..\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Just a few questions. Why is KIS and KAS not allowed? Also, why is ALCOR prohibited? It\u0027s not cheaty and it looks cool.\n\nMods being allowed or disallowed is a tough issue. I think that I would like more people to submit entries, rather than impose restrictions to avoid making it easier. But these mods can do some things that I think are a bit too powerful:\n\n- PParts and Fuel Switch allow filling tanks with only LF. I\u0027ll use as an example a ship with one nuke, an orange tank, and a 5 tons of extra mass (crew quarters, reaction wheels, payload, etc). With the tank filled entirely with LF (replacing the space for the oxidizer), the ship is 12 tons dry and has 10196 dV. With stock fuel tanks, giving it the same amount of LF (That is, a second orange tank), the ship is 16 tons dry and has only 7939 dV, not to mention being bigger = harder to get into orbit, slower turning. That\u0027s a lot of difference. I used the rocket equation here, so KER or MechJeb might report slightly different numbers.\n\n- KIS could allow a lander to be basically built and unbuilt without requiring creative solutions for docking ports, staging, or multiple landers. For example, a lander can land on Laythe and then the parachutes can be taken off to save weight for later landings. Or lander legs could be added to a Tylo ascent stage after it returns from the surface, that then goes and lands on the small moons. I would like to imagine that when you attach a part in the VAB, engineers run wires and fuel pipes to the other systems to allow it to work, so slapping on a new radial engine, leg, solar panel, or chute on EVA seems a little cheaty.\n\n- Alcor used to be prohibited and I hadn\u0027t looked at it recently, but I think they actually increased the weight to a more realistic level since then. It used to be too lightweight for a two Kerbal pod. It will be allowed now.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ll go ahead and give it a shot. I\u0027m running pure vanilla, though (well... Outer Planets mod, but we\u0027re not going to Sarnus). I assume this can be run in Sandbox?\n\u003E EDIT: Scratch that about pure vanilla. Would HyperEdit be allowed just for testing rocket stages/builds without going through the full process of getting to orbit?\n\nYes, it can be run in Sandbox (but not Jeb\u0027s level since you have no science). HyperEdit is allowed for testing things, yes. Please remove it (or at least hide the H in the toolbar) when you are finished testing, for your challenge attempt.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E For design reasons only can I clip the nose cone into the fuel tank, hiding the probe core in between? What if I add 1 (or 2) batteries and SAS on top of the probe, leaving everything hidden in the nose cone?\n\u003E It won\u0027t cange the performance of the craft nor add extra fuel in very compact spaces, it will only change the craft sillouete.
