Also be very careful at the SOI transition, it\u0027s best to let go of the ladders while you change SOI otherwise Krakensbane can tear your ship apart and/or send your Kerbals flying.

If the newcomer isn\u0027t using MechJeb, then Aerospikes are just the same as any other engine for them- they have gimbals and work the same.

And the drag issue tends to make rockets with aerospikes unstable if they\u0027re placed behind the CoM (as engines usually are), although with enough winglets that can be fixed. If you\u0027re scoring on mass like this challenge, I think aerospikes are legitimate and there\u0027s no harm in allowing them, they have their uses but I don\u0027t think they are the best choice for this particular task anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-23T05:52:08Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2013 05:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by tavert\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
