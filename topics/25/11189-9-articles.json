There is no doubt it can make your fuel stretch about 100x further than it should but that requires a low throttle setting. It makes the whole challenge much easier if you can get into space, but doing that tends to require high throttle settings. So I think people who have had a go at the challenge in good faith deserve a mention on the honours list, just like those who tried and failed get a mention, especially if they show piloting skill unrelated to fuel like emkej. But I think it makes sense to keep 0.16 honours separate and also suspend fuel critical prizes like maximalist and minimalist, then start a new part of the list for 0.16.1 if it ever happens.\n\nHebdomad if you wanted to start a whole new challenge thread for 0.16.1 feel free, I have no objection.
