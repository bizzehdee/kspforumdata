Obviously, teams would be allowed to do craft work in other saves of KSP and transfer them in when they get the file. We would probably need to impose a real-time limit on holding the save file... two or three days? Two days for three person teams?

The terrain feels too flat for stock sizing, but that isn\u0027t major, though it will mean that there will never be \u0022High ground\u0022 as all of the terrain that I have seen is moderately level. Also, atmo heights need adjusting, IMO. The stratosphere starts 7Km lower than stock, at 5Km, and the Thermosphere is at 15Km, as opposed to the 32Km of stock.
