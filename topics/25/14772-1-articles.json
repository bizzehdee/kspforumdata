I had enough fuel to circularize their orbit at 6 million meters above the surface. I was going to rescue them by bringing another craft up, but I had a few problems. The game kept spawning the rescue craft with another BILL, BOB, and JEB and every time I try to empty the capsule on the launch pad, they plummet to their death with a sickening poof! Killing Bill, BOB, and JEB their would also kill the BILL, BOB, and JEB that\\\u0027s stuck in orbit. I then tried to edit my save file to right the situation as I needed. I added a new crew and placed them in the rescue capsule in place of BILL, BOB, and JEB. But when I went back in game, all my ships were gone, so I could not save BILL, BOB, and JEB.
