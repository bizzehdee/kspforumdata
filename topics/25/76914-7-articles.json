An infinitely large liquid rocket will never exceed 9:1 Md/Mw due to the tanks themselves. This translates to 21.6 * whatever Isp you throw at it. 17,244 M/sec at the absolute limit. Assuming that you hold the LV-N to .5G at Eve (injection and circularization), you\u0027re looking at 7.2MT total mass. 4.5T of this is the LV-Ns themselves, so setting aside your skipper, payload, and the fact that you\u0027re carrying largely-empty tanks, that leaves 2.7T of fuel. This yields (and I must stress that the actual value would be a lot less than this) 3,689 M/sec DV. Now remember that your Skipper is 3 tons, which means that as a practical matter you couldn\u0027t inject a skipper into orbit using 2 LV-Ns even with no fuel tanks whatsoever and infinite fuel turned on. But for the sake of argument, we\u0027ll let that go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou still have to make 4,800 m/sec from your Skipper to get the LV-Ns to the point where they can finish the job. Skipper\u0027s 3 tons. The LV-Ns are another 4.5 tons. Crunching the numbers yields 4.61 mass ratio. 42 tons of fuel, not counting the tanks themselves. This is well- over the mass a Skipper is capable of lifting at even 1G from Eve. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So even taking all those liberties, this doesn\u0027t work from either end. It\u0027s too heavy to get off the ground, doesn\u0027t account for the mass of the tanks, and if it did get far enough to kick in the LV-Ns, there\u0027d be no fuel left and the LV-Ns would be too weak to inject it into orbit anyway. This isn\u0027t counting the payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut still... you might stumble across something we\u0027ve missed and the math *could* be wrong on this.
