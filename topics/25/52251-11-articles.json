In order to keep speed I had to go full throttle, holding the pitch-down key. Which means that I couldn\u0027t have the probe body reaction wheels on, lest I pitch forward and tumble. However because I equipped my rover with only small solar panels and a total of 400 units of electric charge, it drains the battery in a matter of 10 minutes of driving. This converts to about 300 meters of distance before I have to 1. coast to a stop 2. engage the brakes 3. turn on the reaction wheels 4. lock SAS 5. wait until the batteries are charged again (with Time Warp) 6. turn off the reaction wheels again 7. quicksave 8. very timidly try to accelerate. If I go too strong, the torque of the wheels will go beyond the critical angle and the rover will pitch up and tumble, resulting in having to switch the camera to Chase, turn the reaction wheels and SAS back on, and start over-- or quickload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter doing this continuously to ascend 4 vertical kilometers, I thought it would be much easier to go back down the hill, seeing as, as you see on that map, the large plain area is 6 vertical kilometers of nothing but slightly rough downhill at 35\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0slope. Holding your attitude with the SAS and controlling your speed with the brakes is fine, but if my speed exceeds 10m/s, it\u0027s quite easy to go on half-kilometer jumps on the smallest bump on the surface. This would be fine and fun, if only it didn\u0027t mean also gaining speed up to 26m/s, which is enough to destroy the wheels and frame upon contact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA quarter-way down the mountain I gave up in frustration, and sent my Kerbals where they needed to go via jumping with jetpack assistance, a distance of 60km.
