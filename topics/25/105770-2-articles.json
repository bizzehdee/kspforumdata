Burning retrograde at apoapsis until you get a second encounter is one way to do it, though if you\u0027re lucky you can probably use Kerbin, Duna or maybe Dres. A second gravity assist from Eve should be enough to get you well beyond Jool\u0027s orbit, with a bit of luck you should be able to get an encounter with Jool\n\nThat\u0027s useful information about the 2:1 resonance to get 2 assists from the same body. At the link RIC posted above, the OP did a Munar assist to get to a trajectory that encounters Eve from the inside at around 9:30 o\u0027clock from the original position of Kerbin. This Eve encounter results in an orbit that reaches nearly out to Duna\u0027s on the major axis but has a periapsis still around Eve. The trajectory results in a Kerbin encounter that OP then used to set up a 2:1 resonance orbit with Kerbin, with apoapsis well past Duna. After the second Kerbin encounter, the apoapsis was right at Jool. OP claims it was all done with only 1000dV. In practice, I have needed around 1200dV just to get to the first Eve encounter, with or without the Munar assist, but I am doing it all manually by trial and error, not with McJeb or any online calculation tools, so there\u0027s probably considerable room for improvement. Nonetheless, I think you were right about the Munar assist not getting you much. I was mistaken about the size of the of my burn at Munar periapsis in my previous post. Anyway, I have verified that if you line up this Eve encounter correctly, you do end up with the subsequent Kerbin encounter, however I have not taken it past there yet. OP\u0027s times to each encounter appeared to be off by a factor of 2 to me for reasons I don\u0027t understand. OP said that the second Kerbin encounter was only 362 days after leaving LKO, but just one Kerbin orbit is over 400 days, so that seems plain impossible. Did they change all the orbital periods between versions somewhere? Regardless of that, my plan is to launch a fleet of 4-5 ships separated by a couple of days, in the hope that at least one of them can hit everything just right.\n\nIf I can get to Jool with under 1500dV, I\u0027m pretty sure I can get my current SSTO to Laythe and all the way back as well. My best LKO so far leaves me with just over 3900 dV on orbit if I burn it all with the nuke engine, quite more obviously if I can use the jets, and a bit less if I burn the 250 units of Ox I have left. From the right Jool encounter trajectory, I should be able to aerobrake directly into Laythe, and in theory be able to land the ship without burning much of anything, although this brick-with-winglets won\u0027t really land acceptably deadstick. IIRC flying back to orbit on Laythe is significantly easier than on Kerbin, and I should have over a third of my takeoff fuel still on board at this point. If I can make Laythe orbit again with something like 1200dV left, I should be able to boost to a very high deltaV Tylo assist with a couple hundred to spare. Again if I do everything right, I believe I can get to some sort of Kerbin encounter from there. I seem to remember that if you eject from a Laythe-Tylo transfer retrograde and outward, you can raise your apoapsis past Jool and drop your periapsis nearly all the way down to Kerbin. From the slow top of that orbit, it also doesn\u0027t take very much dV to tweak things to the point of getting some kind of encounter. We\u0027ll see. I think it will be close, but I\u0027m still a long way from really knowing. It\u0027s a fun challenge though!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-12T16:10:34Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2015 04:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by herbal space program**"},{"CreatedByName":"psyberduckling","CreatedById":145736,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T19:07:24Z","Content":"The problem I\u0027ve found with the trip back (this was in an ISRU spaceplane), is managing to get an aerocapture via Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, it cost me quite a lot of fuel to get a capture despite nearly burning most of the fittings off the ship.

I may have to give up on the return. :/\u0022\n\nYes, I feel about the same. I was able to thread the pork chops reasonably well after a couple of very time-consuming false starts, and although I never actually went past the second Kerbin encounter, it looked like my best launch was going to get to a Jool encounter for around 1400 dV all told. Starting with around 4Km/s at LKO, which was the best I could do in 1.0.3 after countless ascents and re-tweaks, it seemed like I could just maybe pull it off. Unfortunately, 1.0.3 has now broken that space plane completely, and with a redesigned plane I can\u0027t seem to hit orbit with more than 3-3.5 km/s using just RAPIERs. They\u0027re just too weak (and thirsty too!) at low speeds for me to do the sort of rapid ascent profile that I\u0027ve found key to conserving fuel. Last night I spent a fair bit of time trying with 2 RAPIERs plus 2 TJs, and that plane\u0027s initial ascent to transonic territory looked great, but it just poops out too soon at the high end. I\u0027m losing a good 100 m/s of speed and 50 m/s of ascent rate at a 29km switchover altitude vs. all RAPIERs in 1.0.2. The ideal ratio of engines for this rig seems to me to be 3 RAPIERs, 1 TJ, and 1 nuke, but building that is not so easy. My patience for this endless exercise is statting to wear thin, but I think maybe tonight I\u0027ll try putting 1 TJ, 1 nuke, and 1 RAPIER canted outwards on a tri-coupler in the middle, with 2 more RAPIERs on the outside. The resulting plane is sure to look ugly and fly even worse, but I think it might be able to find the deltaV sweet spot that way. Maybe I\u0027ll try a honking Mk3 design with 2\u002B2\u002B6 as well. At least that one won\u0027t require placing engines crookedly...\u0027\n\n...So after spending another evening learning how to fly my plane again, it looks like I can actually get the same deltaV on LKO I could before or maybe even better. It took lots of changes to both the design and the ascent profile, but now it seems to work pretty well again\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

With 5 km/s, I think you could do it going straight there, although the ejection burn with that one nuke is not going to be very efficient. One useful thing about doing the multi-assist route for a plane like this is that you can do a much smaller initial ejection burn. It was looking to cost me about 1400 dV to get to Jool that way, which is only a 600 m/s savings over a direct route nominally, but I suspect that with that long last burn a direct route will cost significantly more than 2km/s.

The ascent from Laythe should be a bit easier than Kerbin, due to better TWR from lower gravity and less mass as well as LLO speed only being ~1,880m/s. I use LFO mode on Kerbin ascent to push the Ap far enough ahead for the LV-N to have time to finish raising Ap and circularize, I\u0027m hoping that airbreathing mode alone will be sufficient on Laythe to do the same.

I went with three kicks plus ejection, similar to the precomputed ones linked in my signature but starting from a lower orbit. The transfer window I used was at Y2 D257 1:58:12, nominally 1,989m/s according to Transfer Window Planner. I got lucky with my timing, making the final burn only 4 minutes off the ideal window (lucky given that the timing is about \u002B/-15mins depending on initial orbit) and caught a small gravity assist from the Mun on the way outsystem. Final ejection burn was under 7 minutes, total dV spent for the Jool encounter was 2,037m/s.

I went with three kicks plus ejection, similar to the precomputed ones linked in my signature but starting from a lower orbit. The transfer window I used was at Y2 D257 1:58:12, nominally 1,989m/s according to Transfer Window Planner. I got lucky with my timing, making the final burn only 4 minutes off the ideal window (lucky given that the timing is about \u002B/-15mins depending on initial orbit) and caught a small gravity assist from the Mun on the way outsystem. Final ejection burn was under 7 minutes, total dV spent for the Jool encounter was 2,037m/s. Hopefully I\u0027ll have time to get down on Laythe and try the ascent this week....\n\u003E  but calculating manually gives 3,420m/s of dV remaining.\n\nLooks like you\u0027re on your way! My progress unfortunately got interrupted by the demands of real life, but I\u0027m going to go back to trying now. I got rid of those bicouplers and it really helped. With a 4-engine, 60.5 ton ship I\u0027m getting on orbit no with right around 5km/s dV in fuel now plus 250 units of oxidizer. I think I can probably improve that by adding just a bit more wing area, but the returns of hauling more fuel to LKO are starting to diminish as its own weight starts to exceed 20t. Those air brakes you have have gotten me thinking too. They might come in handy if I ever want to use Jool\u0027s atmosphere to slow down. Word on the street seems to be that aerobraking at Jool is pretty broken.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-01T16:12:02Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2015 04:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by herbal space program**"},{"CreatedByName":"Val","CreatedById":126227,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T01:14:56Z","Content":"I made a new design.

I suspected that with the new Mk1 fuselages making your plane out of only those would be the best move, and it looks like you\u0027ve proven that to be correct. It looks also like having the 2 nukes instead of 1 offsets the extra weight by giving you enough vacuum TWR to burn the RAPIERs closed only a wee bit getting to LKO. I expect the 2-nuke design will also have a much better chance of getting you off Laythe without oxidizer than only 1 nuke would. I\u0027m tempted to just scrap what I have and copy your design, but that wouldn\u0027t seem right."}]}
