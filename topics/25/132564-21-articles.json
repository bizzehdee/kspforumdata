Specialization, if done too early, breeds in weakness and can create a narrow minded approach to engineering problems. It is best to gain knowledge of many aspects of a certain discipline ...

Going below 4 ( I tried the same craft at 2.5 ) meant the pilot wasn\u0027t using the full range of the controls, so this is near my happy lower limit for this particular craft. I\u0027d spend some time carefully finding the actual lower limit I think; pulling all the ammo out of every craft gives you room to tweak if you use one of the extended time deceleration mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cc0L_u-Motw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cc0L_u-Motw\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-14T23:48:30Z\u0022 title=\u002204/14/2016 11:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Van Disaster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SuicidalInsanity","CreatedById":143878,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-14T20:55:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been told there have been a few requests for some of the BAD-T arenas.
