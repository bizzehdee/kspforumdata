Some physics glitches pushed me over the edge. I still figured I would post the attempt. Hopefully someone (with more patience than me!) can take the ideas and put together a good run. I think my setup is pretty close to capable of completing the challenge although a few of the fuel margins are a little slim.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mission plan involved a single ship traveling to Jool. Upon entering the sphere of influence, it splits into 3 parts - our Kerbal rides the Laythe lander directly to Laythe. The Vall Lander aerobrakes directly to Vall orbit while the Tylo lander, return stage (with lander can), and Bop lander go directly into Tylo orbit. After landing on Laythe, our Kerbal rides an ion powered transfer stage to Vall -\u0026gt; Pol (EVA to surface) -\u0026gt; Tylo. After landing on Tylo he rides the return stage to Bop before returning to Kerbin. The previous minimalist challenges demonstrated the importance of moving as little mass as possible between moons - an unnecessary mass being moved is wasted dV. Thus the strategy of the Laythe, Vall, and Tylo landers going directly to their moons. Also, for the return stage an ion engine makes the most sense, but I wasn\u0027t interested in the looooong burn times. Interesting note though, ion engines are getting a significant boost to their thrust in the next patch, making this much more viable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, here are some pictures. At the end of the album are VAB pictures of the individual landers for those interested. In particular I like my Tylo lander idea - for descent it uses the atomic engine that was used for the transfer and capture. I think most other attempts I saw were just throwing it away. This makes good use of it. From a low orbit, it has enough dV to come to a hover just above the ground - the upper stage then detaches and makes the actual landing thus avoiding having to make a really tall lander with the atomic engine. I gave this a few test runs and it\u0027s actually a pretty easy landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/PkY4T\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
