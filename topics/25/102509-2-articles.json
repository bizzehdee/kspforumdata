Is it educational? Would taking part of it improve my KSP skills somehow?\n\nOne of the definitions of challenge is: A test of one\u0027s abilities or resources in a demanding but stimulating undertaking. This, my dear friend, is a challenge. A really hard one.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Frankly, this seems simply like a test of endurance for...nothing. There\u0027s no real skill involved other than the ability to not get a sore butt from sitting all day and a sore index finger from holding down W.\n\nAllow me to take (light) offense on this one, I circumnavigated Kerbin by land an it was one of the most interesting and educational missions I\u0027ve ever undertaken on KSP, by far my favorite. Many people don\u0027t understand that patience and endurance are skills, not everyone is prepared to commit to large scale challenges. \n\nAnd certainly there is way more than holding down W. \n\nUnless you ask my youtube subscribers, that was one of the most repeated jokes ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nThis challenge has many hidden facets that you might not be aware of: basic planning and organizing skills, navigational skills, creative engineering, emergency management (broken parts, missing crew, power and energy failures, etc), enough to keep you busy for a couple weeks.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m sorry for being so forward, i realize you put good thought into it from how you wrote the intro, i just think this challenge is more a chore than an accomplishment.\n\u003E I\u0027d personally hate ksp after finishing that journey.\n\nDon\u0027t apologize for speaking your mind, its okay to have doubts when facing challenges that appear to be mindnumbling or unsurmountable.\n\nI did it, it IS and accomplishment, and I encourage anyone willing to commit to it to go AND DO IT.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-23T21:59:04Z\u0022 title=\u002203/23/2015 09:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wooks**"},{"CreatedByName":"DaPatman","CreatedById":105855,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T23:58:12Z","Content":"I won\u0027t be making a thread for it, since I don\u0027t feel I could adequately narrate the mission, but I do have pictures of the first part of my journey, in which I cross the Lesser Flats:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
