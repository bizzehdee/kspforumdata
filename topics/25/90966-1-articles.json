But ofcourse several further challenges will be along your way. It will be similar to the Apollo style mission (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/39630-Doing-it-Apollo-style?highlight=Apollo\u002Bstyle\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/39630-Doing-it-Apollo-style?highlight=Apollo\u002Bstyle\u003C/a\u003E) but with more design freedom. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, some basics:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- No mods are allowed except for Mechjeb and Kerbal Engineer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Use your own rocket (simply said, don\u0027t use stuff that other people built) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- One rocket and one rocket only, we don\u0027t want to overcomplicate things now do we.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScoring will be based on the following goals:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Mass of the original rocket\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Mass of the lander\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Amount of kerbals landed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Equipment you bring along\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- side goals\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now you guys have got an idea of what the plan is, if you\u0027re not interested or have any suggestion or possible improvements, either a) leave before we get more technical or \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E comment down below. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Score:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mass parameter: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth the weight of your original rocket and that of your lander will be taken into account by the means of a calculation. I\u0027d like to encourage people to take big landers (because it\u0027s a challenge you know, simpler is easier and it has to be a bit hard for sure) but lighter rockets. The calculation you need to do for your mass points is: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Mass lander/ Mass rocket)*100. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the sake of not abusing this rule, SSTO\u0027s or SSTM\u0027s in this case will be put in a different category because they have the same landing mass as their take-off mass which would give them a score of 100 on this parameter which might just be unfair in comparison to the people that use conventional staging rockets. As such the score of an SSTO will be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E (landed mass/ launched mass) * 100\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerbal parameter:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one is rather easy in comparison to the first one. One kerbal equals one point, two kerbals equal 2 points and three kerbals equal three points. After this every additional kerbal delivered to the surface has a value of 0.25 points. So say that I land a ship with 13 kerbals on the mun, then my score will be 3\u002B(0.25*10)= 5.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Equipment parameter:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to encourage you guys to take as much equipment with you as you can. So the scoring in this part will be like this: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1 for every additional unmanned way of transportation you bring along (rovers, MMU\u0027s, ...), \u002B2 if it can be driven by kerbals\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B0.25 for every sensor you take to the surface\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B0.2 for every antenna you take to the surface\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1 for every satellite you drop on your journey. The satellite ofcourse has to be in stable orbit around a body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for example I have a lander with two rovers, each equiped with 4 sensors and two antenna\u0027s and it\u0027s manned. Then my score here will be 2\u002B (0.25*8)\u002B(0.2*4)= 4.8\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditional missions: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B 1 for moving 2 kilometers away from your landing site on the surface in a transportation device.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B3 for moving 5 kilometers away from your landing site on the surface in a transportation device \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B 5 for moving 10 kilometers away from your landing site on the surface in a transportation device (the scores of distance are not cumulative)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B 2 for landing near an easter egg\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B 1 for planting a flag at the landing site\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B 2 for planting a flag over 5km away\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B 3 for planting a flag over 10km away\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B 2 for reaching a speed of more than 60m/s in a rover on the surface and surviving\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B 2 for achieving a speed of more than 200m/s in a none wheel-based transportation device and surviving\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B 3 for docking to a module of your craft that was left in lunar orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditional mission ideas? Post them in a comment! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECalculation of your final score:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one is probably the simplest of all the calculations you have to do. All you need to do is multiply all of your scores. Your score is the number before the point, so if you get 946.6173792...

However your equation doesn\u0027t seem to show that, as 376,208/246,892 suggests that the lander mass was 376,208 but the mass of the whole stack including the lander was 246,892.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe that the calculation for the Mass Parameter for a successful mission (i.e. if the LKO rescue had not been needed) would have been 28,181/537,536 = 5.24\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally I come to a different number for the Equipment Parameter which you have as 25, including the two items you weren\u0027t certain about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that the scoring for these should be as follows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7 sensors x 0.25 points = 1.75\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10 antenna x 0.2 points = 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12 satellites x 1 point = 12\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 rovers x 1 point = 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 drive-able bonus x 2 points = 4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal = 21.75\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing these figures, the total score for a successful mission I believe comes to (5.24 * 3 * 21.75 * 9) = 3077.19\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know how the cost of the rescue mission should be calculated, but my guess would have been to add the mass at launch of the rescue vehicle to that of the original vehicle at launch, as this was the additional mass at the time of its launch required to complete the mission. This would give a launch rocket mass of (537,536\u002B107,254) = 644,790 and a resulting Mass Parameter of 28,181/644,790 = 4.37\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlugging all of that into the total points calculation would give a result of 4.37 * 3 * 17.75 * 9 = 2094\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter posting this I really hope I got my figures right \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheBigFish","CreatedById":129552,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-25T20:51:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see, I think that your calculations are correct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I got wrong with the mass parameter was I was dividing (Mass lander/Mass Launch vehicle).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I got wrong in the equipment was that I am bad at math and remembering what the values were.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was quite concerned that my points were close to 40x the size of the next biggest entry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-25T20:53:15Z\u0022 title=\u002211/25/2014 08:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by TheBigFish\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzerknoef","CreatedById":90599,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-25T22:07:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust to makes things a bit clear here, the lander mass wil indeed be the mass the actually made it to the surface on the moon, the landed mass.
