I found an excellent stock craft called The Unsinkable III by Razgriz86er. It\u0027s here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/unsinkable-iii/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/unsinkable-iii/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was at the point in my campaign where I was sending probes to Laythe\u0027s surface, and wondered what it would take to get a boat safely to Laythe\u0027s ocean. I added an escape system, some more struts, and parachutes to the Unsinkable, and built a mounting beam to attach the boat to my interplanetary launch and transit vehicle, and got the ship to Laythe\u0027s orbit on the first try. (This was done with all stock parts, no plug-ins, no ad-ons, no mods, no cheats, no file edits, no debug menu, etc.) After a few attempts at de-orbit and splashdown, she was safely cruising the oceans of Laythe at 312 MPH (140 mps.) Here are some screen shots. I\u0027d like to see other people\u0027s solutions to taking a water craft to Laythe\u0027s oceans. Many thanks to Razgriz86er for his stock jet powered ocean liner!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.pixeltrope.net/greglane/KSP_Boat_Laythe_0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP_Boat_Laythe_0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.pixeltrope.net/greglane/KSP_Boat_Laythe_1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP_Boat_Laythe_1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.pixeltrope.net/greglane/KSP_Boat_Laythe_2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP_Boat_Laythe_2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.pixeltrope.net/greglane/KSP_Boat_Laythe_3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP_Boat_Laythe_3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.pixeltrope.net/greglane/KSP_Boat_Laythe_4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP_Boat_Laythe_4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.pixeltrope.net/greglane/KSP_Boat_Laythe_5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP_Boat_Laythe_5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.pixeltrope.net/greglane/KSP_Boat_Laythe_6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP_Boat_Laythe_6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"akbbbbbbadayhou","CreatedById":114319,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-06T16:29:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave a craft file we can download?
