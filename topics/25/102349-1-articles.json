All crafts used must be downloaded from external authors.\n\nNo more than one craft file can be downloaded from each author.\n\nThe only \u0027in-VAB\u0027 or \u0027in-SPH\u0027 modification of crafts allowed is to attach crafts to one another (changing root parts or converting to subassemblies is kosher).\n\nAnything used as a moon lander must not have been designed specifically to land on that moon.\n\nAny interplanetary or \u0022intermoonar\u0022 transfer stage must not have been designed specifically to be a transfer stage. Omitted because of insane difficulty.\n\nThe Kerbin launch stage must not have been designed specifically to lift a Jool-5 challenge vessel.\n\n**Submission:**\n\nPost your submission on this thread along with any images or videos you want, and for each craft file used, include a link to the page you got each from, the name of the author, what you used it for, and the original purpose.\n\nYou may also want to submit your entry to [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57197-The-Ultimate-Jool-5-Challenge-land-Kerbals-on-all-moons-and-return-in-one-big-mission](http://http//forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57197-The-Ultimate-Jool-5-Challenge-land-Kerbals-on-all-moons-and-return-in-one-big-mission)\n\n**Where can I find craft files?**\n\nKerbalTek\u0027s [Craft Kitchen](http://www.kerbaltek.com/craftkitchen)\n\n[The Spacecraft Exchange](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/20-The-Spacecraft-Exchange) on the KSP forums\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-26T01:14:17Z\u0022 title=\u002203/26/2015 01:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Thunderous Echo**"}]}
