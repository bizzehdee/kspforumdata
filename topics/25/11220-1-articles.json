But I challenge the community to provide all the modern conveniences and infrastructure a space age society should have in only 1 launch.  the least number of launches. \n\nYou will need to bring up and deploy in their right place \n\n- 1 GPS Network, all 18 sats: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS#Space_segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS#Space_segment)\n\n- 8 Sats for 8 clients (listed Below) and put them in the correct orbit to achieve their goal. \n\n-Design and deploy a sat network to provide radio contact to the fair side of the moon. I should be able to \u0027connect the dots\u0027 between kerbin, each node in your deep space network and the far side of the moon. \n\n-(New) Design and deploy a sat network to provide constant radio contact to minimus \n\n-Return your crew alive\n\nThe Broke Space Brokerage has provided me with this list of clients \n\nClients\n\n-The Organization for High Quality Ice Water wants a sat to monitor the north pole\\\u0027s ice\n\n-Kerbin International University wants a Space Telescope in LEO\n\n-The Bagel News Networks wants a Sat in GEO over the Space Center to capture stunning pictures \n\n-The Society for Awesome Tans wants a Sat in a Heliocentric orbit to monitor the sun. \n\n-\u003Cretracted\u003E wants a Sat in Sun-synchronous orbit \u003C/retracted\u003E\n\n-2 Lovers wants a sat in a Molniya orbit\n\n-The Paranoia Group wants a sat in GEO over Kerbal Space Center 2.

In fact, this is honestly one of the best challenges I\\\u0027ve seen. Should certainly be possible. \n\nI actually tried to help out a bit: GPS satellites are about 22000 km up. The ratio of this to the average distance between Earth and the Moon is .0573. Multiply this by 11400km (distance from Kerbin to the Mun), and you get 653.22 km. Maybe that could be the height to achieve for our GPS satellites?\n\nEdit: Wait. I just saw it was only to be done in one launch. Now THAT is difficult."},{"CreatedByName":"DrBurst","CreatedById":22302,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-22T22:42:26Z","Content":"Maybe the challenge could be to do it in the least number of launches?
