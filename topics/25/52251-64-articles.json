And the KSC wanted to see something for their million funds, so this was the Mission target: Explore the Joolian System. I mean fully explore it.

To prevent accidently transmitting Science i just didn\u0027t installed any Antennas on the ship \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter last checks of the ladders the mission began.

It is waay lower than the Atmosphere Border but there is a small window, and i took the opportunity. Parking in eccentric Orbit, detaching the Huayra and the Huracan. Braking close to Jool with the Huracan and drop the Huayra into the atmosphere. I tested the best way of doing this several times during planning, if interested in details ask for them. flying Suborbital in Jools atmosphere, collecting Science fast and accelerating the hell outa there again. Docking back with the Huracan in Low Jool Orbit and then returning to the Aventador. Dropping the MainSideTanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaythe:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAerobrake and again a lucky strike with upper atmo science, which actually saved me an extra flight of the Huayra. Landing on Laythe at a Coast, there was the only real minor problem during the mission: I discovered the Struts to hold the Wings were asymetrical, speaking one side was missing, i think some issue during the assembly of all the subassemblies. Result was that the Left Wing was wobbly as hell and it was really hard to fly. But it was possible so the mission could continue. Doing Science, driving into water, doing Science, back to shore and Launch back to the Aventador. Dropping the Jet and the Wings on the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETylo:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting cheap to Tylo, parking in highly eccentric orbit.

That ship might actually be able to pull of some kind of Grand Tour but that was not the Mission Target. (And with already 350 Reports i didn\u0027t wanted to calculate the differences at the end to get the Jool-SOI Science;) ) So i\u0027ve done another Pol Landing collecting more Reports. And then i setted up another close Tylo, close Jool and close Laythe flyby to get even more Reports (around 5-6 per Experiment).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeaving Jool with slingshot and 383 Reports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlying to Kerbin and spending the rest of the Fuel (over 5000m/s) to brake the Interplanetary Speed down.

Fortunately the effects are much, much smaller when firing just the nuclear engines (though I still burned through about 12t of monopropellent trying to keep it pointing in the right direction). Once the booster section has been jettisoned, the lander/Tylo-descent stage gets docked round the back in its place... which will hopefully be much more stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith all the engines firing, the fuel in the booster should have given me 2450m/s-2 worth of delta-v and a burn time of about 6 minutes.
