[https://www.facebook.com/GreyDragon70?fref=nf](https://www.facebook.com/GreyDragon70?fref=nf) I\u0027m down around 22 parts and ran a 1:49 to day at Black Krags.\n\nWell I did not technically copy your design, I merely used the same basic formula that is cockpit, fuel, engine, two repulsors somewhere, air intakes as needed, nothing else. In any case, I would not have felt comfortable entering a race in it anyway.\n\nI had some trouble balancing the intakes after I went from one to three. I had them fairly far back, which as it turns out makes them act as stabilizers due to the lift force they generate when at high speed. This was a problem with just one at the top, keeping me from turning tight. I did not realize it was the air intakes fault though, thinking it to be an inevitable result of being very fast. With 3 at 120\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 around the craft however, it kept the thing dead straight, yaw and pitch, when at speed. \n\nAs this had not been the case with just one I realized this was related to the body lift of the intakes. Moving them forward so this force has less of a lever around the CoM reduces their stabilizing effect to near zero, instead, they limit drifting, which is nice.\n\nAdditionally, if you look closely, you will notice that my intakes are placed backwards, which does limit their intake a bit, but reduces air resistance to almost nothing. If oriented this way, their air resistance is even lower then when they are closed. The limited air intake seems negligible compared to the lowered drag, at least at or near sea level.\n\nFinally, the repulsor configuration follows from the simple fact that there is no other place to stick them easily. At least not without adding extra parts which will add drag and weight.\n\nAdditionally, it seems that the wing configuration increases the shock your craft can take because it is easier to hit the ground with both at the same time. With a bicycle configuration, you will usually hit the ground back first. Also of concern is hitting a bump only with the back repulsor because this can lead to an inconvenient front flip. Objectively, between the two cardinal twin configuration, wing is just better. It might be harder to fly and balance out, but if you manage to it will be faster.\n\nIn the end, there is bound to be an optimal design and it is bound to consist of a very limited number of parts. There are only so many ways to stick them together ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nMy craft is made up from 12 parts:\n\n1 cockpit\n\n1 battery pack\n\n2 small tanks\n\n2 sas units\n\n1 whiplash turbojet\n\n2 repulsors\n\n3 structural intakes\n\nI probably could exchange the small rocket fuel tanks for one liquid only tank but it would entail a complete rebalancing so why bother..."},{"CreatedByName":"greydragon70","CreatedById":101186,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T17:58:06Z","Content":"hmmm never knew intakes had lift.
