If you arrange a slingshot around plane intersection - it\u0027s a very cheap way to make a major plane change (and in this case raise orbit as well).

There is no official reward for hard mode, but your piloting was certainly expert-level.  I can see how your decisions both in the design and the execution were focused on safety - maneuvers, parachute landing and vertical takeoff on Laythe, high delta-v on Tylo, excess battery capacity on the ion lander - to ensure confidence despite the lack of quicksaves.

Yet another well-executed Jool 5, you now have one for each of the levels 1, 2, and 3!"},{"CreatedByName":"Cpt Kerbalkrunch","CreatedById":175588,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-05T03:01:08Z","Content":"Been wanting to do a Jool 5 for a while. Had to do it my way, so it took a bit of work. Used my favorite command module, the Mk1-2. During testing I realized that, since I built a separate lander for each moon, all I would have to do is bring along a couple more Kerbals and I would technically complete a Jool 5 on level 1, 2, and 3 (as well as an extremely low-scoring Jebediah\u0027s level: grabbed soil samples at each moon, but didn\u0027t bring any science equipment). There are 5 different landers, with at least 2 Kerbals landing on each moon, and at least one Kerbal (Jeb) and one ship (the Mk1-2) landing on all 5 moons. Not sure if that counts or not, but anyway.\n\nStats are as follows:\n\n1389 parts\n\n10,446.93 tons\n\n3,382,211 bucks\n\nIf there\u0027s a *highest* cost *highest* mass award, I think I\u0027ve got it in the bag.\n\nSingle launch. No \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E or refueling. No nukes, ion, or jet engines. No command seats or part clipping of any kind. No mods (unless you count \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E).\n\n![screenshot198.png](https://s1.postimg.org/87miokt3of/screenshot198.png)\n\nFull album is below. As this was my first time using imgur, I think setting up the album took as long as the mission itself.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/Yog1d](https://imgur.com/a/Yog1d)\n\nAnyway hope you dig it. It was a lot of fun, but I\u0027m kinda glad to have it finished. I really wanna bring the Mk1-2 to Eve and back next."},{"CreatedByName":"sdj64","CreatedById":100819,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-08T01:06:37Z","Content":"[@Cpt Kerbalkrunch](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/175588-cpt-kerbalkrunch/) Congratulations, you have completed the Jool 5 Challenge on Jeb\u0027s Level!  The mission actually seems fairly efficient, given the constraints of the heavy pod and lack of nuclear propulsion.  The swappable pod was an effective strategy for this mission profile, and I don\u0027t think anyone has done 5 kerbals and 3 per landing before. Your 1510 Science points puts you in second place!  ...Jeb\u0027s level is not very popular these days.\n\nI look forward to your proposed Eve mission.
