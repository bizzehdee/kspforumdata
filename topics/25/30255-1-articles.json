It is the first place that your Kerbals step foot on besides Kerbin. It can be reached in a couple hours of game time, and you don\u0027t have to wait ages for the planets to align just right to do it. You can get there in about half an hour of real-time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is, you can get there in about half an hour of real time if you fast-forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ENonesuchplace is taken by a fey mood!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat if we didn\u0027t fast-forward through to the Mun?

During the transfer, we\u0027ll probably be playing something else (probably something turn-based, so we can put it down easily), and there will certainly be lots of people being terrible and making jokes about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy should you care?\u003C/strong\u003E You must be wondering this. Well, you should care because it might be amusing. Either that, or if you want to feel better about yourself, because we are pretty terrible.
