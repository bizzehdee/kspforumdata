The thing is, I don\u0027t actually know if it is that light or not and would like to see other peoples entries to see if I have done well or am falling short of the bar.\n\n**Rules:** Take 1 Kerbal from Kerbin to the surface of Mun and back again with the lightest vehicle. Vehicle mass is determined on the launch pad before take off. For version 1.02. Separate Leaderboard for version 1.0.\n\n1) The Kerbal must be in a command pod of some description. No use of seats!\n\n2) No debug menu cheats.\n\n3) No Ion engines! I know some of you like the old Ion landers so if you want that in a separate category then I can do that.\n\n4) No mods except things like MechJeb, Kerbal Engineer, Editor Extension etc.\n\n5) Things are allowed to blow up so you wont be disqualified if the heat Kraken decides to pay you a visit.\n\nScreenshots, videos and craft files will all be useful in determining your entry.\n\nI can\u0027t think of anything else right now but I may add things if they break the challenge.\n\n**Leaderboard v1.02:**\n\n1) Maccollo - 8.75 tons\n\n2) Kelderek - 38.75 tons\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Leaderboard v1.0:**\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T18:58:02Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 06:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Redshift OTF**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jeb Coleman","CreatedById":140612,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T16:18:21Z","Content":"I will give it a shot.

You have the same idea as me, (using jets for the lower stage), although mine weighed in at 23 tons. The biggest trick I found was getting the right launch profile through the atmosphere to maximise the rest of the ship DeltaV. I\u0027m not sure if the fairings helped though.\n\n![kxvxvUL.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/kxvxvUL.jpg)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Haha, this was a very kerbal mission... you can disqualify me if you like, but it was sooo much fun i wanted to share ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\u003E [http://imgur.com/a/de4yF](http://imgur.com/a/de4yF)\n\u003E \n\u003E Also i have modified my 1.0.2 airodynamics to the middle between 1.0.0 and 1.0.2... soooo forget it ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nWell nice try.

Other than that it\u0027s going to be pretty difficult to improve I think. With the deltaV to go down to the munar surface and back to Kerbin being as low as it is, it simply doesn\u0027t make sense to bring a dedicated lander unless you use seats.\n\nBTW, minor nitpick. A \u0022ton\u0022 can mean any of several units of measurement. A \u0022tonne\u0022 is a metric ton everywhere.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T20:04:56Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 08:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by maccollo**"}]}
