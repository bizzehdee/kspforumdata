Since we do not know of any recent flight experiments in that area, we must assume that whatever just struck our atmosphere there has come from very far away. Our trusty imaging satellite did pickup some strange sensor readings as well. It seems that the object is emitting some kind of energy.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWe are calling you for mission \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EPRELUTARI \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E- \u0022Polar Reconaissance expedition to locate the unknown thing and research it\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wBZl5BR.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022wBZl5BR.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TCED9T9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TCED9T9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, this is a \u0022story mode\u0022 challenge, which means that there will be no leaderboard or something similar. I have prepared a scenario with a mission objective which might (or might not) be entertaining to explore and play around with. You might first want to send a robotic probe or manned scout mission to get some better visuals, then come up with a plan on how to deal with what you find. Or skip the scout mission and directly bring a huge ready-for-anything construction/destruction/transportation behemoth to the site and see if it can do anything useful. How you get there (by ship/airplane/suborbital hop), and wether you decide to bring as much stuff as you can to back KSC, or just take a look inside, or use it as a military shooting target is entirely up to you. Either way, there are some challenges and surprises to be found inside the shell! I hope you enjoy this one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a stock scenario, so you wont need any mods to play.

It is possible to do a lot of stuff without mods, but mods like Infernal Robotics or KAS are obviously really good candidates for doing some advanced on-site shenanigans.
