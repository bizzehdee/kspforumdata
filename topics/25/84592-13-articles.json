I knew it would happen but I thought I could get all of them flight tested before I got busy... until the FAR vs. NEAR fiasco.

Should we call this one closed here?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d be happy to enter a third iteration of the contest, but I wouldn\u0027t complain if someone also took over the job of organising it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe to wait until January ? There is still lot of mods that were not updated and until then maybe someone still make a test for already presented crafts. However if noone provide any review until then, there is no point to keep this one open. If I have helped other people around to improve their designs, that is already sufficient reward for me, meaning all those rantling on forum is not compleatly futile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of us will chase down updates of favorite mods and update craft designs to match recent changes in parts and aerodynamics. I wold like to participate in another contest for 0.90 planes, but don\u0027t know how much time I will have for playing up to end of February (real life issues sucks when comes to gaming). So, I don\u0027t know if I have time organize contest, update post as contestants make entry, review, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor different categories, as noname117 mentioned, I think that this one is pretty well organized contest. Unfortunately, there was not enough entry for each category to make each valid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAX mod has been updatet for V0.90, so there is chance for more planes in that category too. B9 still need update, confirmation that everything works well, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe good news is that while I wait for procedural wings mod to be updated to KSP 0.90, I have made remake of Sporty MK1 and SpacePlane MK2. Almost all stock parts except landing gears.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have used adjutable landing gear mod that only bring 2 new parts and firespitter plugin that is already essential for other mods. I will put those along with already presented craft somwhere in craft exchange forum after few more testing, if anyone is interested at all to take a look.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
