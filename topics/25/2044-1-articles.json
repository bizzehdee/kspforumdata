Then I went back to the design and tried to think of something. \u0027What would Jeb do?\u0027.... hmm... \u0027Add more boosters!\u0027. Sorry, can\u0027t do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Well, then take out something that isn\u0027t needed to save weight\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried looking into a way of leaving Bill and Bob on the beach and save weight that way but KSP doesn\u0027t allow that. :-\\\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I looked at the part list, looking at each part and their weights. Nothing obvious there... Jeb wouldn\u0027t like if I left the parachute on the VAB floor and the rules of the challenge required it. \u003Cem\u003EThen I read the first post of this thread which mentions that an empty SRB weights \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eless\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/em\u003E than a radial decoupler. And this design had two of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat if I take them out? I\u0027m going to end up hauling two empty cans for the duration of stage 3 burn which is not good. Then again, doing so would allow me to leave two extra bits of metal on the VAB floor - bits that weighted more than those empty cans, and would be around for the ride for the whole first and second stage burns - and you really really really want to get off that pad and into thinner air in a hurry. I considered doing some math to figure it out but then decided that Jeb would just haul the design to the pad and light it up and see what would happen. To the VAB, then! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a quick radial de-coupler de-mounting and some SRB-to-SRB welding, off it goes... higher and faster than ever before! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESuccess!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, the firing of stage 4 is very tricky - you want every ounce of thrust out of stage 3 but you also need to blow it (and the empty cans of stage 2) off the ship. Too late and it won\u0027t overheat, too soon and precious fuel is lost in the fireworks display. After several tries that clearly showed promise (80km\u002B), I finally got the timing just right. ;D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also removed the struts between stage 3 and 4 - they were no longer needed as stage 3 now had a \u0027free\u0027 pair of heatsinks around it. Every gram counts...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could say \u0027beat this\u0027 but it is possibly beatable by split-second timing differences in staging. Stage 4 firing off by less than a second can mean 10-15m/s less speed at burnout which turns into more than 1000m in height. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I do not thing there is a build that is better. This is now optimized to death. It really has only 7 boosters, the designated cargo and a single decoupler that simply cannot be removed from the design without changing the burn sequence and I\u0027m quite convinced that 3-2-1-1 is the optimal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo says Rocket Science, according to the Way of Jeb. 8)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"andydouble07","CreatedById":5211,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-18T15:08:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E86,641 m\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyour move\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecould probably get a couple km more out of this exact model\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-18T15:29:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHuh, 2-1-1-1-1-1...
