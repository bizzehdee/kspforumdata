All types of propellant on-board have been depleted, and it seems there is no way to push the ship anywhere. The air/oxygen reserves are not great enough to consider venting air as a viable option. So you have decided there is one option left: to throw the cargo overboard. You figure if you throw individual cargo containers overboard at the right part of your orbit and in the right direction, you just might be able to push the ship out of orbit of this asteroid.\n\nNow the asteroid is itself in high orbit of a planet with a moderately thick atmosphere, and the cargo ship is fully capable of withstanding a descent from orbit to surface with no power or fuel. So all you need to do is nudge your cargo ship a little bit further than out of orbit of the asteroid. We\u0027re also going to assume patched conics are real, so you can gradually throw cargo overboard over the course of several orbits and not have to worry about gradually falling out of orbit. Specifics of the asteroid orbit are not given, as the exercise is to find how much dV you can come up with, and we\u0027ll just assume it\u0027s enough to get the job done.\n\nThe total mass of the cargo is 10 tons, and the mass of the ship minus the cargo (including you and your snacks) is 1 ton. The cargo can be launched out to space in units of any mass you choose. Your physical strength and mass, for purposes of this calculation, has not been given specific values. You may use your own strength/mass or any other standard you like.\n\nWhat is the ideal mass of each unit of cargo being thrown? How fast could you throw it?\n\nHow much dV could you muster by throwing cargo overboard?"},{"CreatedByName":"zarakon","CreatedById":5160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T21:59:17Z","Content":"Ideal mass is whatever you can throw the fastest, which would mostly be determined by the shape and size.

Given a throwing speed of v, and the rocket equation (notice that a rocket engines launch particles/gases at high speeds), DV=v\\*Ln(Initial-mass/Final-mass).\n\nGoSlash27 is also right, a mechanical artifact (like a long bow, or a ballista, or an sling, or a golf club) might achieve more throwing speed than a biological arm.\n\nI read an arrow from a long bow might be as high as 66-100 m/s.\n\nTherefore a ship of 10 tons, might accelerate in the vacuum up to 100 m/s throwing around 6.32 tons of arrows from its cargohold.\n\nAnother limiting factor is how much energy is available for the operation (stretching a bow, loading an spring, swinging a club spends so much energy). The max throw speed might not be the best energy / (speed \\* mass). In other words: If throwing at double speed consumes three times as many snacks, the best solution might depend on how many snacks you have.\n\nYour own debris might also be a concern. Since you will be ideally impulsing at a given point of the orbit (looking for gravitational slingshot), you might be performing one/few launches at the optimum spot every orbit. If you throw one object from an orbit, the resulting orbits of you and the thrown object will be different, but will coincide in the throwing spot. If the resulting periods happen to be armonic, then the object will hit you after so many orbits. Hopefully, the expelled object might collide with the surface, or you might happen to doing a few throws every orbit (not just one at the very precise instant), so you might be a bit higher every orbit at that point. In a bad scenario, the resulting orbit might be a 2:1 armonic, and although you might raise your apo several meters, the impulse spot will just stay 1 inch away, and you will have arrow striking at you at 100 m/s the orbit after (hope it is a blunt hit).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T23:26:25Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 11:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by fjarandag**\n  \nNot second orbit, projectile turns twice but vessel once"},{"CreatedByName":"gm537","CreatedById":66746,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T19:58:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Not sure if this is the right section, but I figured it\u0027s a challenge involving spaceflight...\n\nThis section seems like as good a place as any, there is definitely a type of challenge to it and it\u0027s really unique. So a lot of people have already touched on specific impulse with numbers for a biological or mechanical arm producing between 3 and maybe 20, but we haven\u0027t touch much on thrust. While the idea of continuous thrust for a the mechanisms we are talking about is kinda silly we could certainly get an average. Thrust is pretty simple and is: T = v\\*dm/dt or basically how fast you can throw stuff times how much stuff you can throw in a given time. \n\nIf we take zarakon\u0027s hunks the size of baseballs example we can say v = 27 m/s while it probably takes about 3 seconds to prep and throw a baseball sized object which weighs around 150 grams (so google has told me) thus the dm/dt term is 0.15/3 or 0.05 kg/s multiplied by the velocity of 27 m/s and we see a thrust of 1.35 Newtons... well that\u0027s basically nothing to a 10 ton ship.
