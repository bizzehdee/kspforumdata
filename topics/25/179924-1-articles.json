Appologies if it\u0027s in the wrong section as i wasn\u0027t sure if it should be in the questions sections or here as it\u0027s kind of both a challenge (as nobody seemed to have done anything like it)\u00A0and a request for guidance/advice\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EOk so i was searching for hours how to get all biomes data from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E and haven\u0027t found any help that doesn\u0027t involve mods or veeeeeeryyyy long (real life) hours of driving on the surface\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EWhat i need is a plane that will have a pilot , engineer and a scientist (for resetting the sc-9001\u00A0and goo) ,be able to cruise long distances in eve\u0027s atmosphere, have atleast 4 of each of the science instruments (except the mobile proccessing lab) , mining equipment to refuel and take off again to fly to another biome , repeat. It has to be stock if possible without any exploit (i consider stock propeller engine almost kinda an exploit so didn\u0027t want to use that) so rockets i guess\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EIt will be delivered to eve by a normal rocket and dropped with 10m heatshields . Uppon completion of the mission (sampling most or all biomes) it will call-in a (probe) lander rocket from orbit that will pick up the 3 crew and all collected data and lauch for orbit and then home , leaving the plane back on the surface for future expeditions.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EI\u0027ve tried and failed misserably at this task as i was able to get 3000-4000 delta-v out of my planes which covered a very small distance before needing to stop for a day (or more) to refuel. The distances were so small in fact i would get there faster with a rover that didn\u0027t need to stop and refuel . Something like Matt Lowne\u0027s mobile duna base looks like a good idea but it will take a loooooong time to travel somewhere as i can\u0027t seem to be able to drive anything at reasonable speeds with more than 2x warp without crashing , that\u0027s why the need for the plane\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EOk so this is my lattest attempt .. as you can see it\u0027s insanely oversized barely able to fly on Kerbin , not so bad on Eve but very small distance like i mentioned and even tho it\u0027s 3x the fuel of my last attempt it barely goes any further while needing much longer to refuel\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScreenshots \u003Cspan\u003E:\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003Ehttp://prntscr.com/lkh18j\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0,\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0https://prnt.sc/lkh26e\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EScience bay \u003Cspan\u003E:\u00A0http://prntscr.com/lkh2xk\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EMining Module \u003Cspan\u003E:\u00A0http://prntscr.com/lkh35m\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vyznev","CreatedById":90620,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-20T20:54:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHonestly, doing this in stock KSP (without stock propeller hacks) is kind of unnecessarily difficult, simply because the stock game lacks any engines that would be suitable for the conditions on Eve.
