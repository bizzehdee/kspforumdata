You must provide a pic of your craft in VAB/SPH with cost in it (no need for career howewer) and a pic of the spacecraft landed on Mun. A video is even better. NO MULTI-LAUNCHES. Cost is calculated for the whole ship, including the launcher.\n\nEXTRA CREDITS\n\n1. Traveller: as in real prize, must move 500 m away from the landing point.\n\n2. Scientist: have ALL science expiriments on board. \n\nNO BONUSES"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacePilotMax","CreatedById":139367,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T02:37:37Z","Content":"Just doing it.https://youtu.be/3ruAPFXKw4E P.S A twin landing!"},{"CreatedByName":"jerdrb","CreatedById":141908,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T02:50:36Z","Content":"This looks like a great way to start off my challenge mode career.

I did it in 3915 funds, and my original flight does not include any of the extras. The flight took a few tries to get it right, but if you time the suicide burn correctly, then you have just enough fuel to land. In my run I didnt do the burn in enough time to get exactly to safe landing, but the probe core made it and still had power production so I deemed it as a success.
