I got that to happen once with the old file and realized I was cheating because I was putting the ship under direct control before Bill was on it and that wasn\u0027t allowed, so I started over fresh wiping everything and re-getting the download (I say \u0022the\u0022 download because at the time there weren\u0027t two of them) and the darn space station never did it again on subsequent tries. Getting that capture to happen would greatly help reduce fuel usage and I can\u0027t recreate it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIronically you\u0027ve named the version where the capture is designed to never happen as \u0022easy\u0022 despite the fact that it takes more fuel that way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-17T17:42:17Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2014 05:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Steven Mading\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
