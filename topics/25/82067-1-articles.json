It doesn\u0027t have to happen every orbit, it could happen less often, say, if you have this object orbiting Duna near Ike and only every tenth orbit of Duna does it cross into Ike\u0027s SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScoring is the number of cycles your object can make before its orbit destabilizes and it is ejected from the primary SOI, crashes, or enters into an orbit around a different body. A cycle is defined as either one orbit or one transition across a SOI boundary, whichever happens less often. If your object\u0027s orbit is greatly disturbed but remains in orbit around the same body and is still able to intersect the SOI it originally was, then it may still continue cycling (though it might not last many cycles after that).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe goal here is to create a truly stable orbit that transits SOI, but I don\u0027t think this is actually possible.

Since when it changes SOI it stops getting pulled by Kerbin entirely, it basically just slingshots it away.
