To this end I have come up with a challenge to simulate a mission from Kerbal to a hypothetical \\\u0027Mars\\\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the Mars Simulation Mission (MSM) brief:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Mission Conditions--\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Leave Kerbin\\\u0027s SOI\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Increase your Apoapsis to 17,111,000 km (This represents half of the distance it would be to go to Mars if the red planet was scaled to fit in the Kerbalverse) and fly to Apoapsis\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3)Return to, and land safely on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4)Take off with the same craft and leave Kerbin\\\u0027s SOI\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5)Lower your Periapsis to 9,889,000km and fly to periapsis\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6)Return to and land on Kerbin, splashdowns are accepted, just get your Kerbals home!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Ship conditions--\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1)You can take as long as you need on this challenge, however to simulate the need to bring enough supplies with you you. The command module contains enough supplies for 50 days of spaceflight, each SAS or ASAS module you bring also contains 50 days worth of supplies. Therefore if your kerbals are in space with three SAS modules they can surive for 200 days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2)Use any mods you like but don\\\u0027t change your persistance file to cheat.
