But level flight was not all that slower. Also, once you get to a high speed its rather hard to maintain level flight because Kerbin is so small, at Mach 3.94 you cant maintain level flight since the ground curves under you so fast. You have to have constant down elevator."},{"CreatedByName":"GenJeFT","CreatedById":21208,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-23T03:14:46Z","Content":"![KSP2012-05-2223-09-43-70.jpg](http://i1165.photobucket.com/albums/q587/GenJeFT/KSP2012-05-2223-09-43-70.jpg)\n\nThe most recent tests with my Turbojet aircraft.

Take off routine: Turn on ASAS. Set throttle to about 25 percent and stage to start the engines. Start holding S and tapping the F key for the smallest possible nose-up when you reach 60 m/s, and keep very carefully tapping nose up until you have about a 20 degree pitch up on the runway. It should take off at that point. Retract gear and stage to ditch the front gear.\n\nAt this point enough up-pitch will be happening that you can tap F to nose up without hitting any other keys; do that until you\\\u0027re at 30 degrees - TAP, don\\\u0027t just hold down. A degree at a time. Climb out to about 8000 m and up throttle to 33 percent. At 12 km up throttle to 50% and start using W \u002B tapping F to angle nose back down to about 20 degrees; at 14 km go to full throttle and then just manage nose angle to level off around 17 km. Hold there until you run out of fuel; the 6 tanks draining at first will be followed by one final tank powering all 7 engines for a final speed burst."},{"CreatedByName":"cardgame","CreatedById":12317,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-24T06:12:43Z","Content":"That\\\u0027s what I\\\u0027m talking about!

It would go quite a bit faster if i were truly watching it as I lost a good bit of gas and speed at one point when I stopped paying attention to how mechjeb was flying and ended up at 20,000m.
