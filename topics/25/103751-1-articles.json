Well no, the computer will fight you on this one. This 300 part laviathan flies well at low altitudes but becomes less and less stable. Its front engines are necessary to hold the nose up and when used with FAR it rather worryingly tells me it is in a constant state of \u0027minor stalling\u0027. You should ignore this warning - it flies well enough, like a grease covered brick. \n\nHere is the craft file tucked inside a .zip folder: [http://www.gamefront.com/files/24929102/Kraken%27s\u002BBane.zip](http://www.gamefront.com/files/24929102/Kraken%27s\u002BBane.zip)\n\nHere is how my best attempts have so far gone:\n\n![8MOFKdT.png](http://i.imgur.com/8MOFKdT.png)\n\n![LMxych5.png](http://i.imgur.com/LMxych5.png)![2IlvNsi.png](http://i.imgur.com/2IlvNsi.png)\n\nAs you can see, there will be problems. Instability. A smidge of \u0027oh hell its all blowing up\u0027. Theoretically this has the delta-v and the lift to make it into orbit. Only the bestest best pilots can do it - and I am not one of them. I hand the reigns of this slippery SSTO over to you lot. \n\nCurrent Winners:\n\nStock:\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nFAR:\n\n- BenjiGH\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nYou Tried\n\n- BrainiacBlue\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-09T20:00:08Z\u0022 title=\u002204/09/2015 08:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by BrainiacBlue**"},{"CreatedByName":"BenjiGH","CreatedById":30582,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T18:11:14Z","Content":"On it\n\nwith Far it will be funnier\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-09T18:15:33Z\u0022 title=\u002204/09/2015 06:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by BenjiGH**"},{"CreatedByName":"BenjiGH","CreatedById":30582,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T19:44:41Z","Content":"Made a few try and made it to space but no orbit yet\n\nlink to the album\n\n[http://benjigh.deviantart.com/gallery/53942221/Devious-Folder](http://benjigh.deviantart.com/gallery/53942221/Devious-Folder)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nMade it :-D\n\n(updated the album)"},{"CreatedByName":"BrainiacBlue","CreatedById":118201,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T19:59:42Z","Content":"Well done, welcome to the leaderboard.
