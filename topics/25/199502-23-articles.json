I\u0027m dealing with all that, so passing \u0022simulating\u0022 as \u0022reloading\u0022 is a false equivalence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen there\u0027s \u0022\u003Cem\u003Eno simulators\u003C/em\u003E\u0022. I am making a Mun lander and want to see how it performs, i have to go to mun. Build the whole ship, go there. Do notice that there\u0027s no such thing as \u0022no simulation\u0022, because every time you launch a probe and it explodes, or every time you launch a manned rocket and it flips and you eject the manned module with the parachute to save the crew, that\u0027s basically a simulation. you were trying to launch, but you instead got a failure that taught you how to improve the design, which is basically what a simulation is. However, every time one of your rockets explodes, you have to pay the cost for it. And if you try a mun landing, you must send your rocket to mun every time. And if it\u0027s your first Mun landing, well, you can\u0027t really simulate it; if you simulate successfully, then you\u0027ve landed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe effect on gameplay is that it encourages the use of reliable, time-tested designs over more experimental ones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ENo simulators except what you could conceivably do in the game\u003C/em\u003E is a special subset of simulation. It starts from the fact that you can, indeed, test your stuff - as long as you are willing to let your rocket explode every time. So, you can test your Mun lander probe. You just have to launch the rocket, go to Mun, release the lander, see it explode; then you pick up a few more \u0022science from X\u0022 and \u0022survey\u0022 contracts to make easy money, you build a new rocket, you send it to Mun again, release the new improved lander, see if it works. No risk involved, only time. So running a simulation of that does not give you any unfair advantage you\u0027d have in a \u003Cem\u003Eno simulation\u003C/em\u003E challenge. It merely saves time of farming money and building a new rocket every time. By that metric, you can\u0027t do any test that would endanger a kerbal, and you can\u0027t do testing in places you\u0027ve not reached already.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am playing under this concept, and I\u0027m facing a lot of additional limitations. I can\u0027t test my tylo and laythe landers on their target bodies, and as a result I have no idea how my laythe rocket will perform under laythe aerodinamics. I\u0027ve been forced to make a design twice as heavy, with 4 km/s deltaV to stay safe - and I\u0027m still not 100% sure it will work. I can\u0027t test what would be the ideal altitude to start the suicide burn on tylo, and as a result I had to make - again - a heavier design to add a lot of extra deltaV. I am taking a lot of extra problems and limitations because I\u0027m only running unmanned tests around kerbin, so, again, it\u0027s a false equivalence to treat all simulations equally.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMind you,\u003Cstrong\u003E I am not saying you are wrong on the \u0022spirit of the challenge\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E. You say that part of being a caveman is not having simulators, I can accept that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut you can\u0027t say that reloading and simulating are the same thing, because they are completely different mechanisms that have very different consequences in how you approach the game. And I must point out that \u003Cstrong\u003Ethe rules of the challenge don\u0027t say \u0022no simulations\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore it is perfectly reasonable, for someone looking for a hard challenge, to read the first post, think \u0022ok, here it says I have to play with this difficulty settings, which include no reloading. But simulating is something else, and of course it would be allowed\u0022. A lot of those rules are kinda vague, and could use some clarifications. Is it so rare for others who took the caveman challenge to draw this conclusion?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, I do believe that the purpose of a challenge - any challenge - is to push the player to get creative, while forbidding simulations pushes to only use stuff you already know, it pushes against creativity, and therefore a challenge without simulations makes little sense.

Nothing i ever did there required testing. The major difficulty to me was the first unmanned landing on mun, which I achieved with a probe with no attitude control.
