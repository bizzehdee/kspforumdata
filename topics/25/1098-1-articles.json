Kerdoch denied that this contest was a disguised attempt at getting a satellite into orbit on the cheap, stating \u0027For too long, we have waited for the government to properly utilize space. The Kerbal Cup Challenge will show that private industry can do it faster and cheaper.\u0027\n\n**Contest Rules**\n\n [list type=decimal][li]Download the \u0027[Stellarcom Communications Satellite](http://www.kerbalspacerepository.com/2011/07/17/stellarcom-communications-satellite/)\u0027 from the Kerbal Space Repository.[/li]\n\n [li]Contestants may only use the \u0027vanilla\u0027 rocket parts that are included with Kerbal Space Program, aside from the satellite itself.[/li]\n\n [li]Deploy the satellite in a circular orbit 150km high.[/li]\n\n [li]Observe the satellite for at least one orbit to verify circular orbit.[/li]\n\n [li]Return the crew safely to Kearth.[/li]\n\nWinner will be determined by who gets the satellite into the prescribed orbit cheapest, with the tiebreaker being the one who is closest to 150km exactly.\n\nContest deadline is August 4, 00:01 GMT (August 3, 8:01pm EDT.) \n\nEntries should be posted in the \u0027Kerbal Cup Challenge\u0027 contest thread on the official forums. *(EDIT: Please include rocket configuration in each entry.)* In the event of multiple entries by the same person, only the latest/last entry will be considered.\n\nContestants will need to submit the following screenshots:\n\n- [li]The rocket on the launchpad[/li]  \n[li]The satellite deployed in a circular 150km orbit[/li]  \n[li]A second screenshot of the satellite 20 minutes later, showing it at same altitude[/li]  \n[li]A third screenshot of the satellite 40 minutes after the first (which will be a bit more than one orbit,) showing it at same altitude.[/li]  \n[li]A screenshot of the capsule safely landed.[/li]\n\n A margin of error \u002B/- 250m is allowed in the orbit.\n\nScreenshots should be of the entire game screen, so that time elapsed, altimeter, etc can be seen.\n\nAnd yes, I will ship a cheap plastic trophy to the winner. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-27T02:07:52Z","Content":"Not to rain on your parade here, but how will you detect photoshopped entries?\n\nSkunky"},{"CreatedByName":"GeneKerman","CreatedById":3613,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-27T02:21:46Z","Content":"I \\*was\\* going to ask for .craft files, but that seems too much trouble.
