I ended up with too much fuel at end of the mission because I had LF tanks for the nuke, but also LF/OX tanks to refuel the lander. I brought enough LF/OX to refuel the lander completely after each moon, but I didn\u0027t realize that Bop and Pol would take almost no fuel. I also was not planning to have fuel left in the transfer stage, but I did so I put that in the main ship as well during the mission. I used the procedural test weights mod and lots of subassemblies while designing my ships, so that KER would give accurate deltaV info.**\n\n| Maneuver | DeltaV | Note | Eccentricity Correction | Plane Change Estimate | Active vehicle |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Kerbin to Jool transfer, outbound | 1920 |  |  | 100 | Transfer stage |\n| Kerbin to Tylo transfer, inbound to low orbit | 1050 |  |  |  | Transfer stage |\n| Kerbin to Laythe transfer, inbound to elliptical orbit | 50 | Aerocapture |  |  | Main ship |\n| Kerbin to Laythe transfer, inbound to low orbit | 50 | Aerocapture |  |  | Laythe lander |\n| Laythe descent | Black boxed |  |  |  | Laythe lander |\n| Laythe ascent | Black boxed |  |  |  | Laythe lander |\n| High Laythe orbit | 590 |  |  |  | Lander |\n| Laythe to Vall transfer, outbound | 10 |  |  |  | Main ship |\n| Laythe to Vall transfer, inbound to low orbit | 290 |  |  |  | Main ship |\n| Vall descent | Black boxed |  |  |  | Lander |\n| Vall ascent | Black boxed |  |  |  | Lander |\n| Vall to Tylo transfer, outbound | 280 |  |  |  | Main ship |\n| Vall to Tylo transfer, inbound to elliptical orbit | 10 |  |  |  | Main ship |\n| Low Tylo orbit | 760 | After arriving in low orbit, lander must refuel at transfer stage |  |  | Lander |\n| Tylo descent | Black boxed |  |  |  | Tylo lander |\n| Tylo ascent | Black boxed | After arriving in low orbit, lander must refuel at transfer stage |  |  | Tylo lander |\n| High Tylo orbit | 760 |  |  |  | Lander |\n| Tylo to Bop transfer, outbound | 10 |  | 10 | 0 | Main ship |\n| Tylo to Bop transfer, inbound to elliptical orbit | 120 |  | 80 | 530 | Main ship |\n| Low Bop orbit | 50 |  |  |  | Lander |\n| Bop descent | 250 |  |  |  | Lander |\n| Bop ascent | 250 |  |  |  | Lander |\n| High Bop orbit | 50 |  |  |  | Lander |\n| Bop to Pol transfer, outbound | 60 |  | 60 | 0 | Main ship |\n| Bop to Pol transfer, inbound to elliptical orbit | 80 |  | 80 | 230 | Main ship |\n| Low Pol orbit | 30 |  |  |  | Lander |\n| Pol descent | 170 |  |  |  | Lander |\n| Pol ascent | 170 |  |  |  | Lander |\n| High Pol orbit | 30 |  |  |  | Lander |\n| Pol to Kerbin transfer, outbound | 1070 |  |  | 100 | Main ship |\n| Pol to Kerbin transfer, inbound to surface | 0 | Reentry direct from interplanetary transfer |  | 0 | Main ship |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Description | DeltaV | Max Eccentricity Correction | Plane change estimates | Total |  |\n| Main Ship delta v, with lander docked | 1980 | 160 | 860 | 3000 |  |\n| Transfer stage | 2970 |  | 100 | 3070 |  |\n\n- Any additional note or description? **I have some aesthetic clipping on my craft...I have angled nosecones clipped into a fuel tank to give a smooth appearance.

Just read the rules more carefully, and realized that the way I\u0027m running this mission would disqualify me, as I am not returning directly from Jool, but meeting another ship before I run Eve and Moho.  So I forked the savegame, and instead of continuing on, here\u0027s what Val does if she\u0027s trying to just complete the Jool 5 following the rules.  Instead of going to Eeloo and on to the rest of the planets, she just does a simple return to Kerbin, landing safely behind her giant heat shield and leaving the mothership in orbit for another day.  This concludes my Jool 5 entry for easy level, but the adventures will continue over in the Ultimate Challenge thread.\n\u003E \n\nCongratulations Jetski, you have completed the Jool 5 Challenge on Level 1!

Several. Here are the important ones: RCS Build Aid, Docking Port Alignment Indicator, KER, Remote Tech, SCANsat, Kerbal Alarm Clock, Transfer Window Planner. No parts mods were used for this mission although I leveraged SCANsat data for landings.  \n- How many Kerbals are on the mission? 6: Jeb, Bill, Val, Sietrix (Scientist), Madchell (Engineer), Gianna (Scientist)  \n- How many launches was needed to start your mission from Kerbin? 10 Launches to assemble vehicle, 12 total successful launches in support of mission. 4 Launch Failures.  \n- How much did your mission cost? 3,129,198  \n- Did you needed a refueling mission? No  \n- Did you bring additional stuff like satellites, rovers, etc? No, there was a SCANsat probe mapping the Jool system before Taranis got there though.  \n- Share the delta-V information too, if you tracked it! Taranis Transfer had a total of about 5km/s if all the fuel from everything was used. The only thing that I actually planned on for dV budget was Laythe and Tylo ascent/descent vehicles which turned out to be overkill.  \n- Any additional note or description? I wanted to bring the same command module to every moon and the lifter vehicles to look relatively like rockets. This required some creativity and a rather large transfer ship. Also, I wanted to bring several Kerbals around for the whole mission.

I failed...\u003C/u\u003E**\n\nHere is a brief log of my failed attempt at the Jool 5 Challenge, I had a day off and chucked this together, I didn\u0027t test anything and my Tylo lander wasn\u0027t up to task, I continued the mission anyway and went to Laythe, Vall, Bop \u0026 Pol. So with no further ado here is my Jool 5 Mission that became the \u0022Jool 4\u0022  please do learn from my mistakes.\n\nThanks for checking out my attempt, I shall have to try again soon.\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/ghVjP/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-07T22:36:20Z\u0022 title=\u002203/07/2016 10:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Amianoob**\n  \nI couldn\u0027t work Imgur..."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-07T16:23:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 22 minutes ago, Amianoob said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E For some reason it won\u0027t imbed it directly so here is a Ghetto link to Imgur itself.\n\u003E \n\nTry using the imgur button (far right of the format toolbar, looks like an \u0022i\u0022 on a black background).

The Jool 5 keeps drawing people back all in itself, with its combination of all of the skills required in KSP and a certain feel to the Jool system that you can\u0027t find anywhere else.  And it\u0027s all thanks to you for the brilliant design of the original challenge!\n\nAlso, we have some more completions!  Sorry it took so long to review, with so much going on in your missions it was a while getting through all the screenshots.\n\nCongratulations [@Racescort666](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/137852-racescort666/) and [@rudi1291](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138990-rudi1291/), you have completed the Jool 5 challenge on ISRU level!\n\nThese two entries have to be some of the most complicated yet.  I was very impressed with the diverse array of crafts you both carried to Jool, and your dedication and attention to detail were incredible.
