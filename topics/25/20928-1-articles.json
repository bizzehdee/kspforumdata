Due to a miscalculation of mine, I thought I was going a lot faster than I was, which was still pretty fast. I took these screen captures at about 3-4 second intervals. The slideshow on photobucket shows them to you at 5-second intervals. So in close to real time, you see Eve whoosh by.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s111.photobucket.com/albums/n155/Maxgrant/Eve%20Fast%20Flyby/?albumview=slideshow\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://s111.photobucket.com/albums/n155/Maxgrant/Eve%20Fast%20Flyby/?albumview=slideshow\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m positioning myself for a flyby of Duna at over 3x this speed, or just over 1/1,000th the speed of light.

Now, if the engine were realistic at all, the solar panels would stop getting a decent charge long before I could reach such a speed, as even at 1/1000th the speed of light one is far, far far out of the SOI of Kerbol very quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know I could do some cheats just to see it, and I might later, but my real goal was just to see how fast, in-system, I could get a ship going within my levels of patience.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"0jam3290","CreatedById":37975,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-02T00:27:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, 96Km/s!
