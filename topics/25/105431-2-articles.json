I did not pick night time specifically to do my runs, my save just loads in at night, but it might have an impact on temps. I am not sure.\n\nThere probably is a way to get heatsinks to work better, I *almost* had one working perfectly using heatshields but it just barely didn\u0027t last as long as I needed it to. The struts holding the shields would have the heat transferred to them and then explode but it did buy several seconds.

I think now is that aha moment where I understand the new aerodynamics system better - specifically with regard to shock waves and high speed atmospheric flight. Hey Lesbiotic, that black magic you were speaking of.... perhaps the shock wave created by the front of your craft is what distinguishes it from the others and allowed it to hit 1900 m/s and not blow apart vs the 1600 m/s of the other ones. This is the great thing about this competition from slashy, we can all learn so many things from it."},{"CreatedByName":"AngusJimiKeith","CreatedById":101138,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T05:29:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hey, not sure if you intentionally had oxidizer on board or not, but if you removed the 220 oxidizer from that bicoupler and had only liquidfuel in it, that would reduce your craft\u0027s mass by about 1.1 tons, which might be roughly 9% of your overall mass at 12k kilograms.

From what I understand, if anything is attached behind a part, it\u0027s protected from the heat. If it\u0027s attached radially, it generates drag and it\u0027own heat. Which, is why they blow up. Also, joints generate heat. One trick I\u0027ve read about is putting smaller parts inside of a cargo bay. They\u0027re protected there and don\u0027t generate drag or heat. I thot I\u0027d get smart and put air scoops in the cargo bay. Ummm no. You open the bay, they work, you close the bay, you got no air. And even if you try to offset the gear or air scoops inside another part... doesn\u0027t work, they still generate heat.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T06:27:49Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 06:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist**"},{"CreatedByName":"Lesbiotic","CreatedById":105271,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T08:21:56Z","Content":"2,000 m/s status: broken\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

In the meantime I thought it would be good to ask some technical questions relevant to the engineering of crafts specifically for the Kollier Trophy.\n\n1. Does the angle of airflow relative to the front of an air intake of any kind affect its efficiency with regard to how much air it is able to capture for the engine? If so, I may angle them down a few degrees to better process air at high altitudes where there is precious little oxygen.\n\n2. Does having objects \u0022in front\u0022 of an air intake interfere with its air capturing capacity? By in front, I mean in such a way that the physical structure of the intake is at least partially shielded from drag as opposed to hitting fresh, unbroken air.\n\n3. Is there any way to monitor the heat of external craft surfaces during flight? This would be valuable for slowly approaching temperature limits or knowing which parts are getting too hot.\n\n4. Is there indeed some kind of Shockwave effect in the aerodynamics of ksp 1.0 for supersonic aircraft? Can a part that isn\u0027t directly behind another one, but slightly off to the side and to the rear be partially protected simply by being within the shock cone of, for instance, the nose of the craft?\n\n5. What specific factors affect the heat of parts? I assume, at a minimum, the following: airspeed, angle of incidence with respect to the part in question, total surface area of the part exposed to the airstream. Is there anything I\u0027m missing, or are any of those assumptions inaccurate?\n\nThat\u0027s all I have for now.

That is; I will accept the record as valid so long as the submitted screen cap shows no destroyed parts at the time.

In the meantime I thought it would be good to ask some technical questions relevant to the engineering of crafts specifically for the Kollier Trophy.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1. Does the angle of airflow relative to the front of an air intake of any kind affect its efficiency with regard to how much air it is able to capture for the engine? If so, I may angle them down a few degrees to better process air at high altitudes where there is precious little oxygen.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2. Does having objects \u0022in front\u0022 of an air intake interfere with its air capturing capacity? By in front, I mean in such a way that the physical structure of the intake is at least partially shielded from drag as opposed to hitting fresh, unbroken air.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3. Is there any way to monitor the heat of external craft surfaces during flight? This would be valuable for slowly approaching temperature limits or knowing which parts are getting too hot.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4. Is there indeed some kind of Shockwave effect in the aerodynamics of ksp 1.0 for supersonic aircraft? Can a part that isn\u0027t directly behind another one, but slightly off to the side and to the rear be partially protected simply by being within the shock cone of, for instance, the nose of the craft?\n\u003E \n\u003E 5. What specific factors affect the heat of parts? I assume, at a minimum, the following: airspeed, angle of incidence with respect to the part in question, total surface area of the part exposed to the airstream. Is there anything I\u0027m missing, or are any of those assumptions inaccurate?\n\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s all I have for now. Thanks in advance as I\u0027m sure the knowledge will help out all the engineering efforts.\n\n1. As far as I\u0027m aware, yes, this happens in KSP. That\u0027s a good idea to mitigate it, too...\n\n2. Nope, intakes behind solid structures still get air, at least as far as I\u0027m aware.\n\n3. The thermometer part actually does this now! Slap one on critical areas like the nose. Else, there\u0027s the debug menu, but that might violate the rules.\n\n4. Not sure. Mach effects are a thing now, but I don\u0027t know how accurately they\u0027re modeled. I kind of doubt anything like this.\n\n5. Each part has a few stats related to heat now, such as \u0022thermal mass\u0022. Not entirely sure what they all do yet, but suffice to say that some parts heat up faster than others.\n\nAnd now a question of my own: anyone having issues with asymmetrical thrust/flameouts? I\u0027ve done the old place engine 1 -\u003E place intake 1 -\u003E place engine 2 -\u003E place intake 2 method and I\u0027m still having issues."},{"CreatedByName":"MunGazer","CreatedById":141954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T23:57:17Z","Content":"\u003E And now a question of my own: anyone having issues with asymmetrical thrust/flameouts?

I can\u0027t speak with a lot of authority in response to your question, but yes today I did get a glimpse of an asymmetrical flameout. I had more than one rapier mounted, but when I originally mounted them, I was not using symmetry mode. So as I edged up to a particular altitude slowly (about 10 m/s vertical speed), there suddenly wasn\u0027t enough total intake air to operate the engines. So one of the four shut down but the other 3 kept running. This was at about 26 km altitude. So in fumbling with that I eventually became quite unstable. I wonder if there is a way to tie the engines together so that if one shuts off, they all do. At least that way you could just coast until you regrouped instead of having to re do things."},{"CreatedByName":"MunGazer","CreatedById":141954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T02:04:12Z","Content":"pffffffffffffffffffff.
