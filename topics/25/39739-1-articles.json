I started a \u0022Techno Hardcore\u0022 game with the general idea of releasing the vanilla parts one or two at a time, with the exception of really simple ones that would be available immediately (most of the structural parts that aren\u0027t movable or separating.) The first part that I released in the original game was the RT-10... and shortly after the LV-1 and Oscar-B (not much choice but to release them together.) Then I discovered that the Sepratron could perform a useful maneuver for a small craft and started over with \u0022New Techno Hardcore\u0022. The progression went like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOriginal set included:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll structural parts that were not movable or separating (from Cubic Octagonal Strut to the Rockomax HubMax, very few of which I\u0027ve actually flown)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETT-18A Launch Stabilizer (which I didn\u0027t need until 0.21.1 started gluing my rockets to the pad.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETR-2V tiny stack decoupler\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbodobodyne OCTO command pod\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EVanguard\u003C/span\u003E Stayputnik Mk. 2 command pod\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll parachutes (note: this is somewhat unrealistic because irl parachutes are actually a pain to develop, often literally: before the 1960s, over 90% of parachute developers died testing their inventions. When going to Mars, the only parachute known to work is the one on Viking, and JPL is quite reluctant to test their luck as others have and have used rescaled copies on all missions since... Oh, and one of the relatively ordinary parachutes on Ares 1-A shredded.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESepratron\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI managed to get to 20km with that...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERT-10 SRM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI couldn\u0027t quite get to orbit with that kit (but I did launch a couple of 300km high shots and a range shots into Australocean.) The problem wasn\u0027t a lack of torque (I haven\u0027t noticed much difference between RW and RotForce actually, but 0.21.1 does seem to have more aberrant torques reacting on the craft.) So... the next part was...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EZ-100 Battery\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that, the command pod could now last long enough to make orbit, and soon did. This produced a craft that consisted of an OCTO, Mk16, two Z-100s and six Sepratrons, and could perform three maneuvers. Because the craft shuts down completely when it is unloaded, limited batteries restrict not how long the craft can fly, but how long you can command it. While I could get to low energy orbit with this set, the maximum size of the first stage being 9 RT-10 motors fired in four maneuvers in a 4/2/2/1 arrangement, I couldn\u0027t take the craft anywhere useful, even with three Sepratron/octagonal truss stages (a total of 30 Sepratrons including the six on the spacecraft.) So, the next part was the cruddiest separator that could be used with the RT-10\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHydraulic Detachment Manifold (HDM)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I was going places, growing the RT-10 stage to include 9 motors again, but in a cruciform rather than a Falcon-like square (Falcon being the SpaceX trademark by the way.) In 0.20.2, the RT-10 motors were burned and staged serially in a 2/2/2/2/1 arrangement, the goal being to get the core (which pegs the accelerometer at 15g shortly before burning out) to at least 25km altitude, having turned only to a 45deg angle even in an ideal, on-heading ascent (which is nearly impossible.) This was the HDM-5 in 0.20.2. 0.21.2 broke it in two ways. The first was that it glued it to the pad, requiring the TT-18A to hold it up, leading to the still unsuccessful HDM-5b. The 5b failed because a sea breeze kept blowing it west (and thus I discovered that you need at least two 500drag parachutes to land a loaded RT-10 without breaking it.) The HDM-5c simply arranged the motor staging in a four maneuver 4/2/2/1 plan and most of the original HDM-5 performance was restored.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat can you do with it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEssentially, the final RT-10 will burn out with your craft on a ballpark 3000km apoapsis if you fly it well, and your craft has three maneuvers from there, with delta-v\u0027s fixed at 201.9m/s, 254.0m/s, and 343.7m/s. Dispersions seem to be about 1% of these values per sigma. It doesn\u0027t hold a candle to even a basic LV-1 Oscar-B, but it is a heck of a lot more than I expected, and so far, I have accomplished:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- KEO satellite inclined 0.0deg to the Mun in a 2653.8 by 3074.3km orbit with a period of 5 hours, 59 minutes, and 37 seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Munar flyby and return (the theory being that radio comms and video cameras are crap and they have to return film.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Munar orbiter in 104.5 by 446.7km orbit (I could have made it more circular, but the sort of charged particle/magnetic field type of mission it would be would prefer a more eccentric orbit.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have the following in flight and hope to have them finished shortly\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Mun orbit and return\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Minmus flyby and return\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Minmus orbit and return\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOthers I think could be accomplished with this vehicle but consider not being of interest given the unmodeled technology assumptions (i.e. poor communications, cameras, and lack of transmitting power over long periods - I haven\u0027t released OX-STAT)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Mun impact\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Minmus impact\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Eve/Gilly flyby\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Duna/Ike flyby\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis are ones I think are impossible, but might just be possible:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Eve landing (if you can hit the disk of Eve, you\u0027re there)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Duna landing (I don\u0027t think it\u0027s possible with the HDM-5c as is, but with tweaks to the parachute system, it might be possible.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt looks like this...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bMbrsD6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bMbrsD6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022download\u0022 the craft here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/gMRajpeg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://pastebin.com/gMRajpeg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you think it\u0027s a little too hardcore to be flying without \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003ESAS or ASAS\u003C/span\u003E reaction wheels or avionics, go ahead.

Both. After trying hard with the design I posted, I was unable to get to Minmus orbit and back because targeting the encounter maneuver from low energy space (i.e. under 300km altitude) was too difficult. One maneuver node I set up gave me a bull\u0027s eye impact, I fired it, had just 1.9m/s residual, and missed Minmus by 5000km. After that, I released the BACC and replaced the four outboard motors (the first stage) with them... shot the core stage out of Kerbin orbit entirely, but fired the probe\u0027s Sepratron\u0027s retrograde to prevent generating a second piece of interplanetary debris. Adding a second Sepratron stage slowed it down enough to hold it to about 3000-5000km ascent apoapsis and increased the number of maneuvers to seven. Next, I\u0027m going to release the TR-18A that\u0027ll allow larger and more practical orbital payloads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I\u0027ve learned is critical is that maneuvers, especially in low energy space, require split-second timing. Another trick I\u0027ve learned (but not mastered) is that lower tick rates (adjustable in settings and can be modulated in game by reducing your frame rate... easily accomplished on a six year old laptop, lol) produce less drag loss during ascent. This can be used to control ascent performance, so your apoapsis is appropriate for KEO insertions, and higher for Munar/Minmus or interplanetary work. In practice, it means that if I want to go to a lower energy destination, I rotate the camera under the vehicle so I see easy-to-render sky. If I want to go higher, I put it above the vehicle so that I see hard-to-render Lonch and Arcifa terrain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the Kerbol impact idea? Go for it!

There are five craft aimed at Minmus, three of older HDM-5 and HDM-5c vintage (the former being 0.20.2 and latter 0.21.1 compatible versions of the same craft) and have no hope of getting into orbit around Minmus. The other two are of newer BACC-2 design and have five maneuvers each remaining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: Sepra 2b is one of the first craft, a Sepratron-only sounding rocket that topped 17km. I could get them up to about 30km before they started overflexing and dismantling themselves on lift-off. In the original Techno Hardcore, I attempted, without success, an RT-10-only SSTO booster (calculations show a maximum delta-v of the RT-10 at 4742m/s, which means it is just barely impossible... I did get it to 300km altitude on the best shot.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nmTpzmv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nmTpzmv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the new TR-18A-19 vehicle, the Film Scan Probe (FSP); now that KSP has upgraded their \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yagi-Uda\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eoriginal\u003C/a\u003E communication gear, they have a hope of getting a close-up picture of Duna back with this craft. With this craft (at least on my system), a right yaw must be commanded immediately on lift-off, or it will head into the Pan (mountains west of Lonch.)

Very likely, a major part of the problem is that the pitch and yaw MOIs of in-line boosters are much higher than the shorter parallel designs associated with HDM and non-separating RT-10 motors... combined with the fact that the OCTO is the only device I have released that offers any means of controlling an errant vehicle (fins actually make things worse by over-stabilizing the vehicle so that the OCTO can\u0027t turn it at all... and the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u201C\u00CB\u2020 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u201C\u00CB\u2020\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u201C\u00CB\u2020\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u201C\u00CB\u2020\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u201C\u00CB\u2020\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u201C\u00CB\u2020\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u201C\u00CB\u2020 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u201C\u00CB\u2020\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u201C\u00CB\u2020\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u201C\u00CB\u2020 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u201C\u00CB\u2020\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u201C\u00CB\u2020\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u201C\u00CB\u2020\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u201C\u00CB\u2020 thing turns on its own anyway, even with the fins!!
