There is also a new problem with the part supply system. There are no turbine blades to make jet engines and no extra pumps for fuel hoses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission: Put as much fuel into space as you can but using as little fuel as possible. Must have docking port and active SAS to keep it aligned for ships to dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScoring: Score is determined based on percentage of what you put in orbit (70km x 70km or better). To calculate percentage divide the amount you took to space by the total amount of fuel you started with and multiply by 100. Solid fuel counts as liquid fuel. Oxidizer is not counted at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo qualify you must post before and after pictures with resources shown in top right corner. Stock craft parts only and no jet engines or fuel lines. Autopilot mods are allowed as long as the craft performance is not affected. Any size rocket or craft is acceptable, solid fuels, Ions, RCS are OK to use if you like but not required. And of course, no cheating with debug consoles or other hacking also no infiniglide. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is mine and to serve as an example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/54171727/KSP/Screenshots/SummitChallenge/2013-08-20_00031.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-08-20_00031.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/54171727/KSP/Screenshots/SummitChallenge/2013-08-20_00030.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-08-20_00030.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2883 / (16560 \u002B 3464) X 100 = 14.4%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2883 is the liquid fuel that made it to space and is the only fuel counted, RCS, Xenon gas, Solid fuel is not counted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E16560 is how much liquid fuel that I started with\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3464 is the solid fuel started with\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EReduced Oxidizer Class\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1st place: Hejnfelt - 40.87%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2nd place: Radam - 34.72%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3rd place: Bystander - 27.5%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4th place: Bothersome - 26.4%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5th place: SirJodelstein - 26.1%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENormal Class\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1st place: Radam - 23.17%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2nd place: Jasonbail - 22.5%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3rd place: Slugy - 19.0%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4th place: eppiox - 15.9%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5th place: Bothersome - 14.4%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck to all our contestants.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-31T12:57:38Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2013 12:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Bothersome\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EUpdate score\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T19:36:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll want to add \u0027no debug console\u0027 and \u0027no infinityglider\u0027 to your rules, otherwise either will quickly be used for a 100% result. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELoading up KSP to give this a few tries.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Giggleplex777","CreatedById":29829,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T19:41:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI made this for a challenge a while ago:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ddJ3WPP.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ddJ3WPP.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe payload is the orange tank (which it puts in a 73km orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-20T19:43:45Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2013 07:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Giggleplex777\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bothersome","CreatedById":66869,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T19:43:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, just added it.

I thought of the that, where you might have people putting something up there with RCS for instance, but I don\u0027t think it will help much. If someone does manage to put some fuel in space using only RCS, then it might be ok for them to post it here just educate the rest of us that it can be done and how. Some fuel has to go up to get it in orbit. That and a docking port and something to keep the SAS activated. So I would think those things would put enough weight on the craft to overcome any useful RCS or Ion thrusting. Yeah a few percent might be gained from excessive use of RCS for instance, but those options are available to all contestants too.

The orange tank on the right is disposable and not part of the station. The two shuttles with the RCS payloads are docked on opposite sides of the hub to maintain balance.

It\u0027s not got a qualifying launch picture (on the pad) and weight has nothing to do with the calculation. Need to see starting fuels and ending fuels. Also, on your starfighter SSTO plane has fuel lines going to the other fuel tanks and I can\u0027t make out the numbers from the video. So that\u0027s not a qualifying craft either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecapi3101, good job on the attempt. You didn\u0027t add the Solid fuel, but I\u0027ll adjust for ya. 7,768/68,464 = 11.3%. The reason your 64 units of solid fuel isn\u0027t counted in your final picture, is because it can\u0027t go through the docking port for offloading if needed. I wasn\u0027t real clear on that in the instructions, but that\u0027s basically what we\u0027re after. Fuel to be transported to space for later use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh by the way capi3101, I really like all those pictures you provided for each stage. It shows a good and proper flight path to orbit which really can effect your performance in this challenge. I\u0027ve noticed it\u0027s real close to my flight path too.
