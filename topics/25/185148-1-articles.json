I replied him that many celestial bodies need trust to land on them, but said that \u0022anyway, on most airless worlds, kerbals weight like an ant\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt happens that threre exists an engine specifically made for ants, the Ant engine. The challenge is to test how much the assertion is true. The conditions are\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-A kerbal needs minimal confort, so will not tolarate anything less than mk1 lander can.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-The only propulsion allowed is a single Ant engine (and no \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E, no eva pushing).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-A single ship begins from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, with periapsis/apoapsis between 70km and 80 km. It can be hyperedited there. The ship can split, but then only one part will have the Ant engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-The mission ends when the ship (which should consist at least of the command module containing the kerbal) lands safely on Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTylo is impossible as the Ant engine is not even capable of lifting the mk1 lander can. Making history is allowed as it does not seem to allow anything useful here. For the others worlds, here are the levels of glory\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Easy: Minmus\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Medium: Gilly, Bop, Pol, Ike, Mun, and Minmus with Mk1-3 command pod\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Hard: Eeloo, and Gilly, Bop, Pol with Mk1-3 command pod\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Ant-man: Vall, Moho\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemarks: Its not clear if Vall/Moho are possible, but I cannot prove it isn\u0027t... Heavy ships are essentially useless, as their terribly low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E make orbital maneuver difficult. For Jool/Eeloo, using eve assists is very useful as it decreases necessary V infinity at Kerbin, and long trusts lowers Oberth effect. On high gravity worlds like Mun/Eeloo, an orbital rendez-vous seems necessary. I have personnaly managed to land on Minmus, Gilly, Bop, Pol with mk1 lander can, let\u0027s see your creativity!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aeroboi","CreatedById":186653,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-06T08:44:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe challenge seems restricted. I think people would still desire mission freedom, so to land at as much places as possible.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhy require a Mk1-3 command pod then? I think it\u0027s better in terms of rules to say a mk1-3 command pod is used to transfer the kerbals interplanetary but can use a command chair to land on Vall, Bop or any place.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor one thing, I don\u0027t understand how a single ant can lift a mk1 lander can from Moho, or is it the goal to get to a stable orbit?\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf this is the case then the challenge offers very little creativity, just how good one is at orbital maneuvring and packing enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDv\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheOptimizer","CreatedById":197918,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-06T22:17:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do not require the mk1-3 command pod, just no command chairs. The problem with command chairs is that they are overpowered, and even more here were mass is very important: If you can keep high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E at landing, then landing is not difficult.. I can however change the statement about the Mk1-3 command pod by requiring instaed landing more kerbals at once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLook at the numbers, an Ant can lift a mk1 lander can on Moho. And I have also managed to land such ship on Moho (but not going back to orbit, and this I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s possible, maybe using wheels?). On lower gravity worlds like the mun, it is much easier because an Ant can lift more than 1t, thus levaing much more margin for fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pds314","CreatedById":70014,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-21T04:07:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy didn\u0027t you mention Dres?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
