I\u0027ve used a variation on Scott Manley\u0027s solar powered ion-driven plane to get into a 70x70 orbit (it took fifteen (real!) hours but hey!), I wonder if anyone else can improve on time-to-orbit or come up with a better design philosophy?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/1077243_321133898022614_1852251407_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221077243_321133898022614_1852251407_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe slowest horizontal takeoff speed I\u0027ve ever achieved: 16m/s!

NO BOOSTER STAGES ALLOWED. In fact, let\u0027s make it interesting: only permitted means of propulsion is the stock ion engine. Scoring is 0 (didn\u0027t make orbit) or 1 (made orbit). You will need both solar panels and batteries because I guarantee you at least some of your ascent will take place at night. I\u0027m looking for interesting solutions, folks. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maccollo","CreatedById":72759,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-22T02:58:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEven just those 3 control surfaces probably add more acceleration those ion engines.
