But that would be too easy, so instead I want you to build it **before you unlock wings, jet engines or landing gear.**\n\nonly the first 3 tiers of tech are available, as well as \u0022Basic Control\u0022 \n\nIn other words the available technology must fall within these tech nodes:\n\nThe Tech:\n\n- Start\n- Engineering 101\n- Basic Rocketry\n- Survivability\n- Stability\n- General Rocketry\n- Basic Control\n\nObviously there are a few rules, as well as a multitude of ways to earn points:\n\nThe Rules:\n\n- No Mods (apart from Kerbal Engineer) - no MechJeb, this must be piloted all by you, and nothing that changes the physics or aerodynamics of the game (no Kerbal Joint Reinforcement and no FAR, although if enough people want to use far I\u0027ll make a separate scoreboard) (no parts mods should go without saying, but I will specify it anyway)\n- Your craft must be launched from the runway. (although not necessarily horizontally, more on that in the scores)\n- You craft must be something that could be considered an aeroplane (not just a rocket, although I understand the distinction can get quite close when you have to be using rocket engines and only have winglets to play with)\n- You must land at least in the vicinity of the Island Runway (and on land!)\n- Your kerbal must be in one peace at the end of it!\n- NO PARACHUTES (landing must be done without a parachute, or it\u0027ll mess up the scoring and make it generally less of a challenge)\n\nThe Scoring:\n\nYou will start off with 10 points, points can be scored and lost depending on certain things that are done throughout the flight and landing:\n\n- **-1 point** for every part that does not survive the landing (so survivability is key!)\n- **-1 point** for every decoupler used (real planes don\u0027t use em!)\n- **\u002B 1 point** if you make it in under 5 minutes\n- **\u002B 2 points** if you make it in under 3 minutes\n- **\u002B1 point** if you have more than 10 units of LiquidFuel left at the end of your journey\n- **\u002B1 point** for landing on the actual runway\n- **\u002B1 point** for keeping it simple (less than 20 parts)\n- **\u002B2 points** for taking off horizontally (not easy since there\u0027s no landing gear!)\n- **\u002B2 points** if you take a service bay with a Goo Experiment inside it and do the test upon landing.\n- **\u002B2 points** if you take and extra kerbal (and another 2 for each extra you take)\n\nHARD MODE: this is for people who think this challenge is too easy and want to really add some difficulty to it\n\n- **\u002B10 points** if you take off and come back again! (I don\u0027t know if this is even possible, but please don\u0027t let that stop you)\n- **\u002B 5 points** if you manage it without using anything from the \u0022basic control\u0022 tech node. (other than the inline cockpit) (that means no control surfaces or reaction wheel!)\n\n**Please provide evidence of your run, a picture of your craft in the VAB, on the Runway and on the Island Runway, as well as any other screenshots necessary to validate your score and a screenshot of the F3 window on landing when you make your post** ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nIf someone has a good idea for something that should be worth points before people submit a run then please go ahead, but I don\u0027t like the idea of adding extra scoring after submissions start because it makes it unfair for the people who have already participated.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/wQQ2g)\n\nHere is my run as an example and also to set a baseline score for people to beat.\n\nScoring:\n\n10 points to start \n\n- 0 (nothing broke!)\n\n\u002B 1 for more than 10 LiquidFuel remaining\n\n\u002B 1 for landing on the actual runway\n\n\u002B1 for keeping it simple (19 parts)\n\n**Total score = 13 points** \n\nSo there you have it, a modest score to set as a basis. This challenge was not designed to be hard in itself, however there is a lot of room to up the difficulty in order to achieve a high score, so it can be as easy or as hard as you like depending on how serious you want to get.\n\nand on that note I will leave you with one final thing:\n\nMost Importantly, have fun, and I can\u0027t wait to see your creations!\n\n(and I will put a scoreboard up once people start submitting)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-24T11:54:37Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2015 11:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Squiggsy**"},{"CreatedByName":"awesomeguy166","CreatedById":143393,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T22:45:26Z","Content":"I have almost got mine to work.
