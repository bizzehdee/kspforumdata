Figured that now that we\u0027ve done much everything of what a rocket IS supposed to do (get a boss load into orbit *looking at you, Silisko*, get in orbit with the most compact rocket, etc etc), I figured that we needed longer-lasting challenges. And what better way to do that than with score-based challenges instead of goal-based challenges? And so, I present to you...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003ERodeo Ahoy\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuite simply, make a single-staged (no decoupler) craft packing as much SRBs as you want, and take em for a ride, surviving for as long as you can.
