For those who do not know (these numbers realistically change depending on altitude) Supersonic start around 410m/s, Supersonic effects on Kerbil begin to manifest around 450m/s. \u003Cstrong\u003EHypersonic speeds begin around 1,710m/s.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E All entry\u0027s will require an image of the aircraft (because pictures are fun and your aircraft are cool) The image should include your altitude and your speed (see below) and please specify if you used mods and if the aircraft is unmanned. The challenge is specific to Aircraft, so no rockets/missiles out of the VAB please.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI chose 20,000m because that\u0027s roughly the altitude most air intakes drop off at. There will be two main brackets and two classes under those brackets. The only caveat to the modded vs. un-modded is that you can use mods so long as they do not alter the performance of the aircraft. So any parts are changes to how aircraft perform are all mods. Things that just make the game pretty or engineering details are not counted under the Mods section. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENon Air Breathing includes hybrids that use both air breathing and non air breathing engines. Finally Section 3, for the superbly insane. These are the \u0022High-hypersonic\u0022 performers with speeds in excess of 3,415m/s, modded or not, those speeds on Kerbin are just crazy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBrownie points for crazy pilots.
