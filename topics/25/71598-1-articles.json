Maybe I just found the easy way to hover using just SAS (distribute your center of mass outward from the center of the craft for the same reason tightrope walkers use poles). I will say this though, without Jeb, B9 or Firespitter, this challenge is pretty much undoable. Trying to find the exact throttle spot where you can hover at 0.1m/s and then, adapting to the mass change as fuel is consumed? Wow. I won\u0027t even try that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*** EDIT ***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, I see why this is difficult now. You might want to disallow VTOL\u0027s like the one I have above. I just fired up the Bird of Prey VTOL I did for the Star Trek challenge (pictured below). If you build your VTOL horizontally like it is, it\u0027s a pain to get it stable and get to 0 horizontal momentum. Your nav ball is pointed toward the horizon and it\u0027s a bit of a challenge to get it to stop moving forward or backward because you\u0027re pitching back and forth trying to stop that motion. But, if you build it VERTICALLY like the one above and have the navball pointing straight up. For whatever reason, it\u0027s pretty easy to sit in one spot. In hover mode, your vertical speed will still bounce around a bit (\u002B/- 1m/s) but horizontally, it\u0027s like a rock. You either crank up the thrust or let it drop like a rock in order to center the navball and then turn on the hover and it\u0027ll stay over the same spot for.... years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry ihtoit, but most all of my VTOL\u0027s are vertical VTOL\u0027s and for the life of me, I couldn\u0027t figure out why this was such a challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Bop2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Bop2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-08T08:59:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2014 08:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
