advice from what ive found to work in KSP armor wise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are 2 truly unique build styles, with some variations when it comes to armoring ships.\u00A0 The first, and the more common/conventional method is using a so called structural spine along the ship from front to back.\u00A0 This is almost always the XL girders since they are both easy to work with and are nice and strong structurally at least.\u00A0 Basically lay down as many girders in a row as you desire the ship to be lengthwise, and build outwards.\u00A0 From the spine you should have another structural piece (ibeams or more girders or even structural panels) to which you can attach an outer shell of whatever material you choose (for best armor use structural panels, but even wings work if you are building something like a carrier or its a part of the ship that is less critical).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00225SB3fQA.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://imgur.com/5SB3fQA.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you can see, there are 3 girders lengthwise, which the outer shell is attached in multiple locations (to keep one lucky shot from removing an entire side of armor), as well as to which the fuel is attached.\u00A0 Ive had mixed results with fuel directly attached to teh spine.\u00A0 On one hand, it increases protection against multiple weaker weapons (ibeam spam), but it seems to make it more vulnerable to direct hits from high powered phasing torpedoes (1.2m), so if you expect to deal with hard hitting weapons, it may be a good idea to have the fuel tank attached to another structural part that is attached to the spine instead of directly attaching fuel to the spine.\u00A0 Basically this is the more reliable build style, and if you have enough redundancy (engines in teh front, weapons in teh back, ect) you are all set in the likely event of being split in half (its almost inevitable to happen sooner or later with this design, but once split its possible to remain a threat with proper hardware placement).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other style of building is the so called \u0022all or nothing\u0022 approach, where you have one critical part that you build the entire ship up off of.\u00A0 This has its share of issues but can potentially be much harder to destroy as you have to get a direct hit to one and only one part to kill it, with shots to any other portion of the ship doing damage, but being unable to completely cripple the ship.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022TM6Puzx.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://imgur.com/TM6Puzx.png\u0022

width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIve had alot of luck with this style recently, and most of my semi competitive ships these days utilize it as ive found the older style of structural spines to be harder to completely wipe out, but easier to do critical damage to as you just aim for the midsection and it goes away.\u00A0 Its a bit of a gamble as one hit can 1 shot your ship, but ive found that risk to be worth the ability to tank insane amounts of damage to anywhere but the root part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne more somewhat unrelated tip if you like to plate your ship externally with wings, is to place the wings not direclty onto the outer hull but via a cubic strut or other small weak component, so that if the wing takes a massive impact, it just falls off and does not transfer excessive forces into the actual armor beneath it (ive had ships torn apart this way by hits to the outer wings destroying the core through force transfer).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022XCRmu51.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://imgur.com/XCRmu51.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, good luck with your design, most of my ships right now are being redesigned (as i dont quite like them atm and many are outdated) but if you want to take a look at some of my ships go to my company\u0027s craft repository and the majority of my ships that i have made that werent trash are there.\u00A0 Also, feel free to try variations of these styles, ive found something like a H spine to work well (2 spines side by side with some armor between them so that if one spine goes you still have over half a ship left), and dont forget redundancy, its better to have something left over and functional after you are split apart then relying on a single control point and or a single weapons mount/engine cluster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SG Aero","CreatedById":174890,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-08T18:26:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCool thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan

a single long ibeam propelled by 4 sepatrons (or using a modded decoupler if im desperate to save part count to propell it to ~200-250m/s).\u00A0 The idea behind these is to spam them in numbers and keep hitting the same part of a ship one shot after the next until you literally drill a hole through the entire thing.\u00A0 Since they are very small you can cram alot of them into the ship\u0027s frontal profile.\u00A0 A step up from this is the same concept, but instead of sepatrons, the ibeam has a probe core, engine, and fuel tank behind it allowing it to fly guided.\u00A0 Ive never had extremely good results using these, but you can carry alot of them for a given mass/part count, and with some luck a good hit can split the entire ship apart.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that you have your 1.25m weapons.\u00A0 The most basic weapon ive found reliably is the smallest \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E (drained to low fuel, leave ~40-60 solid fuel in there) with either 1-2 structural panels on the tip or a ibeam on the tip.\u00A0 These things are brutal against thinner more compact ships (like many of mine) but lack the firepower to truly destroy thicker more heavy ships that have alot of parts between the outer hull and the core.\u00A0 Use them when part count is the primary concern, a single one is like 3-4 parts and it can some decent damage, with the main cost being space requirement and vulnerability to enemy fire compared to 1.2m weapons.\u00A0 As for guided design, the most important thing is to utilize 80m/s or higher parts as the \u0022warhead\u0022, and push it to the optimal speed within a reasonable distance (this dictates your engine size and choice).\u00A0 Its extremely varied what works and what doesnt, but there are 2 major types of warheads that seem to be around, either armor piercing (kinda pointy with ibeams on the front) or fragmentation (lots of smaller structural \u0022shrapnel\u0022 embedded inside) where there is a weak part (like a fuel tank) holding the shrapnel parts and when it breaks apart on impact the smaller stuff flies throughout teh vessel and guts the weaker components inside.\u00A0 On the modern battlefield ive found a combo of these 2 to be the best (as in like 3-6 shrapnel parts combined with a AP tip) but it really depends on what you want to take down with it.\u00A0 There are many ships that are very good against one type or the other, and even the combos are never guaranteed to work.\u00A0 Overall, shrapnel is worse against compartmentalized ships since the shrapnel is stopped by armor or by the fact that not all the components are accessible, while AP is less damaging then shrapnel but will often do more damage against very well protected ships then a shrapnel round would.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso worth mentioning is that one way to increase your weapon\u0027s power is to up teh mass.\u00A0 Its not mass efficient to make heavier weapons, but if your current designs arent working (assuming they have some sort of structural warheads) try to add more mass to the missile for extra firepower.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022
