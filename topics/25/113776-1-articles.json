You may give it a probe core, but nothing else. It\u0027s recommended that you use bundles of full ore tanks for compactness, but this is not mandatory. \n\nYou may attach to the payload in multiple places as long as all illegal parts are detached before final payload mass is calculated. \n\nAny design or concept you can think of within the above guidelines is allowed. Shoot for something massive and inefficient or something mildly enormous with a great payload fraction - whichever you think is best. \n\nEntries must provide screenshots of mass on the pad and final mass, plus video/screenshots from in between - enough to make it clear how your craft is functioning. \n\nI will be putting together some kind of leaderboard for the best entries. Good Luck!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-23T15:54:43Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2015 03:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by 666lumberjack**"},{"CreatedByName":"Requia","CreatedById":112924,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T00:51:06Z","Content":"Is it acceptable to stick torque wheels in the payload and then subtract the weight? the lack of a 3.75m torque wheel creates some aerodynamic problems if its below the payload."},{"CreatedByName":"Requia","CreatedById":112924,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T01:32:59Z","Content":"Yeah moving to a 2.5m payload doesn\u0027t work.\n\n![UsUpbTb.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/UsUpbTb.jpg)![QmDnHj6.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/QmDnHj6.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"A_name","CreatedById":134040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T01:37:34Z","Content":"Can i use the procedural weights mod as payload?"},{"CreatedByName":"t3hJimmer","CreatedById":145943,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T09:25:22Z","Content":"Isn\u0027t this going to come down to who has the beefiest computer that can handle the biggest possible rocket?"},{"CreatedByName":"Requia","CreatedById":112924,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T17:24:44Z","Content":"I\u0027ve never seen the rocket I can\u0027t fly on my machine, and its ancient (maybe windows memory limits are a problem?).\n\nIt make take an hour or two to get to orbit, but it\u0027ll get there."},{"CreatedByName":"A_name","CreatedById":134040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T15:08:41Z","Content":"It should also be clarified whether we\u0027re allowed to use part clipping for engine clusters, which makes a huge difference."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T13:45:38Z","Content":"Here is my entry for 1.0.4 : a 600 tons payload at 75km using a recoverable SSTO heavy launcher.
