The Kerbals have decided to continue with the Aviator Challenge, which was originally inspired by a [ground based circumnavigation challenge](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113778-The-Elcano-Challenge-Ground-based-circumnavigation).\n\nThe time has come for a new revision in order to keep the spirit alive, though I do advise visiting [over here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118390-Kerbin-Circumnavigation-1-0-2-Aviator-Challenge) once in a while for inspiration, plus the historical value.\n\n**The Challenge - Circumnavigate Kerbin in a continuously moving aircraft.**\n\n**The Rules -**\n\n- Stock parts only [Mechjebs AR202 being the ONLY exception]\n- No mods that change aerodynamics are allowed.\n- Mods that allow giant bananas into the game are not allowed, but would be funny.\n- Informational mods are allowed [Mods that give you Delta-V, TWR, mass, ect.]\n- Only engines the use Intake Air as a propellant may be used.\n- If your craft has 1 or more R.A.P.I.E.R engines, as well as a tank with Oxidizer capacity, you must show your resource panel before takeoff to confirm you are not bringing any Oxidizer.\n- No physics exploits [infiniglide for example]\n- Debug menu settings that change the physics of the game will be at default. Only informal debug settings are allowed.\n- 30 Km is the ceiling. Any higher than that, and you restart. Don\u0027t worry, a 29,999 is still safe.\n- A runway takeoff is required (You may use VTOL\u0027s and STOL\u0027s.)\n- You must land back at KSC (runway landing is not required, but you must land within 1.1 Kilometers of it).\n- You must show at least one clear screenshot of your aircraft. (Preferably upon takeoff. Phoenix screenshots do not bear fruit.)\n- When your Circumnavigation is finished, show an F3 screenshot for the details of your flight.\n- No pizza allowed.\n- Do not offset parts to be separate from the craft [They must visually connect]\n- Your aircraft must stay perfectly intact the whole flight [No drop tanks, burn-offs, or otherwise lost parts]\n- Manned flights only.\n- In your submission, you must list your flight time, and the number of circumnavigations. The visual post should be able to verify this.\n- You may only do an equatorial or polar Circumnavigation only. None of that 89 degree stuff [Just kidding, but don\u0027t deviate too far]\n- One clear screenshot per Circumnavigation of your aircraft on the opposite side of the planet is required.\n- No mounting any parts on the back of an engine.\n- Anything that ruins the spirit of the challenge is also not allowed.\n\n**Re-attempts -** \n\nYou are free to attempt this challenge an infinite number of times. However, only at a time, you will be recognized under 1 class. For example, if you complete 2 circumnavigations, both in record time, you would specify whether you want the Velocity badge, or the Grand Circumnavigations badge. This applies for either 1 or multiple attempts.\n\n**Additional Challenges -**\n\n- The most continuous circumnavigations at a time will be recognized under Expedition Circumnavigators.\n- The quickest circumnavigation times will be recognized under Velocity Circumnavigators.\n\n**Badges -** \n\n- Victors of this challenge will be at full rights to use the Circumnavigator badge in his/her signature.\n- Upon being listed under a badge that tailors to a different completion condition, you are at full right to use that badge.\n\n**Expedition Circumnavigators**\n\n3\u002B Circumnavigations\n\n![circumnavigator%2Bresized%2Bexpedition.png](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-zjLJJJt6cjc/Vi1VLA-bj9I/AAAAAAAABW4/cB1Tu4lKlsU/w318-h100-no/circumnavigator%2Bresized%2Bexpedition.png)\n\nsilks - A whopping 10 whole circles using a questionably unoriginal missile design, but there\u0027s no rule for that.\n\nzolotiyeruki - ***Eight\u0022!\u0022*** circles!!

Should we have achievements?\n\nRuBisCO - 3 more circles. I think a new design for a dart has been invented; Surely this is perfect for game night.\n\nlemon1324 - 3 full circumnavigations using basics. Well, noname, you wanted it, and you got it.\n\nExaltedDuck - 5 CIRCLES! ...\\*Ahem\\* Circumnavigations! This is unheard of on every level! Someone get a medal made.\n\nMikki - 3 Turbodriven circumnavigation, 2 sets of BigS wings, and a partridge in a pear tree.\n\nnick4096 - 3 circumnavigations, all with a side of fuel efficiency. Might as well be a velocity run as well.\n\nAghanim - 3 circumnavigations with what was to be a single engine plane, but it evolved on the way up.\n\nt3hJimmer - 3 equally glorious circumnavigations all in one go.

Fairly simple beginner\u0027s velocity plane, but it works. If it ain\u0027t broken, don\u0027t fix it.\n\nDraradech - 0:56:06 - Fairly simple, and well executed, inspiring, if not uninteresting to watch. I suppose there should be no complaints though.\n\nMikki - 0:56:47 - First Mk3 plane I\u0027ve seen in this. Certainly this merits it\u0027s own reward, right?\n\nECarinea - 0:58:27 - Pretty straightforward, using the newest, most hip missile designs of the year [or 5 minutes]\n\n[ Jeremy ] - 0:59:00 - Not all crafts have to be missiles, guys.\n\nHaruspex - 0:59:13 - Using a massive aircraft of all things.

I\u0027m pretty sure that\u0027s what we\u0027ve all been doing.\n\nDfthu - 1:02:00 - First I know of to use power generation. This may spawn an interesting challenge idea!\n\nFCISuperGuy - 1:03:06 - Those orange streams really don\u0027t look healthy. They make me think of the same orange as orange juice.\n\nAetharan - 1:04:12 - If only this thing could\u0027ve started out in the water. This would\u0027ve been perfect.\n\nGraviTykillz - 1:04:35 - Same plane, a quickload, and a velocity badge later, look for the same name above!\n\nWorkable Goblin - 1:05:54 - Because of this, I\u0027m afraid to ask what the \u0022Workable\u0022 part is for.\n\nMaverick\\_aus - 1:07:23 - Another flying missile among many others. Certainly an AUSome flight!\n\nGahooligan - 1:08:09 - We got a really weird plane here, no doubt inspired from a gliding bird, but with extra intakes.\n\nPointySideUp/Fraus - 1:08:13 - We have a tie! Someone cue the duel jingle! ...Waiting...\n\nTristan2004 - 1:10:00 - 3 intakes seems like overkill, but what do I know?\n\nValcab33 - 1:13:49 - Today we\u0027ve got a simulation taken too far! What started out as a test run ended up making it around!\n\nDoctor Mandarb - 1:30:43 - Pretty shots from the mysterious spectator [probably Superman]. Someone hire this guy for cinematic shots.\n\nlemon1324 - 1:51:24 - This is pretty dang fast for a basic plane, although I\u0027m not sure \u0022supercruise\u0022 is the word that comes to mind.\n\nOxytropis - 1:18:56 - 6 TURBOJETS!? How does one manage such a task?\n\nHaruspex - 1:19:13 - This is definitely a cruise missile. No doubt about it.\n\nDeath Engineering - 1:32:12 - I read the title of that post and got genuinely scared.\n\nJoshwoo69 - 1:42:05 - Warning: Not for the feint of heart. Check this entry out, but keep all emergency lines on speed dial.\n\nAtlanticrash - 1:50:36 - Very very straightforward, albeit the staying close to land part. I\u0027m glad the name is a lie.\n\nnicky4096 - 3:23:37 - I\u0027m not sure if to call this a missile. Definitely looks like one, but no supercruising.\n\nGojira1000 - 3:58:22 - A bit more of an over complicated plane than necessary, but so are rockets, so it works.\n\nRuBisCo - 5:03:37 - Suddenly I feel the need to add a 0 altitude flight for planes like this.\n\nmacktruck6666 - 5:19:50 - This is one of those entries that gets me to question just how seriously people take this.\n\nnoname117 - 7:39:17 - I don\u0027t think there are any words to describe this ridiculousness.\n\n* * *\n\n**Hall of fame - Every victor who has completed the previous version.**\n\nThose listed here keep their badge\n\njuzeris - FOUR circumnavigations using RAPIER\u0027s!\n\nimthebait - Finally proving that 3 circumnavigations can be done.\n\nPandemic - Three circumnavigations.\n\nt3hJimmer - Three circumnavigations.\n\njuzeris - 0:41:44 - And no part clipping.

One more Jet fuselage and it should be able to make two laps. But I think I\u0027m sitting on something even better (getting about 1550 m/s at 0.45-0.50 initial cruising consumption). I noticed the leaderboard comment says my entry used a rapier. Might be worth noting it was a whiplash. That might explain some of the fuel consumption concerns. (the rest, I\u0027m sure, is a combination of big wings, low drag, and high altitude). Initial cruising consumption was was high as 0.37, and during the ascent I think I spent some time around 2.4-ish. I\u0027m totally willing to post the craft file if there\u0027s any question.
