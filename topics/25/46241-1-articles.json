(which makes docking pretty damned hard as you have to rotate and use main engine for each little correction).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou never explicitly said so but it looks like you\u0027re going for a system where low score is best. You really need to say that explicitly if that\u0027s the case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, as KOS is under development, you need to state the version the challenge uses, or reset the challenge each time a new version comes out. Each iteration of KOS makes the task easier so it\u0027s unfair to compare a score from version X to a score from version Y.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou didn\u0027t state it explicitly but are you allowed to put a KOS scs part on BOTH ships? That may make this possible, otherwise it cannot be done in the current version as there is no way to query the orientation of a vessel, but if it has its own KOS SCS part on it it can rotate itself to a known position.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Epthelyn","CreatedById":57970,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-25T15:51:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy do I get the feeling this is one of those challenges posted entirely for the benefit of the poster because they can\u0027t (or are unwilling to) do something themselves?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rhoark","CreatedById":57151,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-25T16:03:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EkOS can\u0027t fire RCS yet, so this is currently impossible.
