If you are using Apollo launchers the natural way to do it is to throw landers at Jool and then (irl after you know the landers are there...) throw 3 guys in \u0027a can\u0027 to do Moons of Jool Orbit Rendezvous - but that would fall outside the \u0027one big ship in Kerbin orbit to launch\u0027 part of this challenge.\n\nIs it an artificial constraint to impose the \u0027one launch from Kerbin\u0027? Especially since you can send a second fuel only craft... Actually at what point can the ship drop landers? I mean there is deltaV benefit in not lugging landers around so they are (may be depending on design) better off doing individual moon encounters - so they can undock in Jool SOI? out of Kerbin SOI? The \u0027one ship Jool transfer burn\u0027 thing sounds a bit artificial given you almost always at least throw parts away that are specialised for particular moons. Don\u0027t get me wrong it\u0027s a great fun classic challenge exactly as it stands - but since you invited comment this is what occurs to me.\n\nAlso do you have a separate ranking for life supported attempts?"},{"CreatedByName":"parzr","CreatedById":115059,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-07T13:26:19Z","Content":"[http://imgur.com/a/DVwPV#1](http://imgur.com/a/DVwPV#1)\n\n1480 parts at launch\n\nIf you look at pic #14 you see how I managed my nukes for my heavy lander."},{"CreatedByName":"Empyrean","CreatedById":160779,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-07T16:15:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 16 hours ago, sdj64 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Missions in the 1.1 beta are (tentatively) open!

I\u0027ve been working on a plan for what might be considered a level above Jebediah\u0027s level, whereby I have to have one Kerbal on each moon simultaneously. It requires quite a payload (because the landers can\u0027t be reused), and quite a few transfers, but I\u0027ve had great fun designing it so far. I\u0027d be glad to know if you thought it was an interesting enough constraint to include.\n\nE"}]}
