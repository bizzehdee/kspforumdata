So, he\u0027s crowd-sourcing ideas, looking for the cheapest way to get a Kerbal to Minmus!\n\n**GOAL:**\n\nIt\u0027s fairly simple: *Get Jebediah to Minmus for as CHEAP AS POSSIBLE*\n\n**RULES:**\n\n1) No mods of any kind, including Mechjeb.\n\n2) As seen from title, all stock parts\n\n3) You do not have to return from Minmus, just get Jeb on the ground. Bonus points awarded to those who bring him back alive. (Bringing him back alive rewards a 20% Discount on all part costs)\n\n4) Take lots of picture!\n\n**REWARD:**\n\nIf anyone actually does this challenge, I made a pretty (ugly) coin for your sig!
