You may rendezvous everywhere (ie, land on Mun, return to KSC, walk to new rocket, liftoff - or walk to already placed rocket on the Mun and lift off to Minmas). You may use as many ships as you like. Jeb must never die, it does not count if he respawns.

You must EVA on all other bodies except Kerbin. With Eve, it is definitely allowed to barely make orbit from the surface and rendezvous in orbit. You may strand OTHER kerbalnauts on these worlds. You must return Jeb to Kerbin. You may visit two bodies in the one craft. On the first flight, you are allowed to hack Jeb into the pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContestents will be rated on the amount of ships they use (With bonus points if they take Jeb to the easter egg locations). Mechjeb is not allowed, but Tosh\u0027s cart mod as well as the Novapunch remix pack (as well as other unaltered packs, and mods such as ZO2). All mods and packs must be listed, and the parts or mod must not be overpowered (ie, gives infinite fuel or teleportation).
