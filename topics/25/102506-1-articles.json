So, I decided to make my own. Hoping my laziness didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t overlook an already-existing KSC rover building/driving challenge (I managed to look back about 5 pages before giving up), I present to you KerbPro Track Day!\n\nI\u0027m looking for some of the best Kerbal rover designers to build and race their rovers around the KSC in the shortest time possible.\n\n**Objective**\n\nBuild a rover and drive one lap around the KSC in the shortest time possible.\n\n**The Track**\n\n![n8xaoYU.png](http://i.imgur.com/n8xaoYU.png)\n\nThe track is marked in the above picture. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be driving around most of the perimeter of the KSC, only excluding the Administration Centre. You have no save to download which features checkpoints of any sort \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 just follow the road.\n\n**The Rovers**\n\nThe rovers are split into four classes: **Tiny**, **Light**, **Medium**, and **Heavy**.\n\nThe **Tiny** class must be no bigger than 1.5/1.5/1.5m (L/W/H) and be no heavier than 3t.\n\nThe **Light** class must be no bigger than 3.0/3.0/3.0m and be no heavier than 5t.\n\nThe **Medium** class must be no bigger than 5.0/5.0/3.0m and be no heavier than 10t.\n\nThe **Heavy** class must be no bigger than 10/10/6.0m and be no heavier than 20t (I want you guys to get creative ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)).\n\nAny larger and I might have to make a HUGE rover class. I can only imagine how one can drive it around the KSC with a good lap time\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\n\nSince there are three classes, of course, there will be three separate leaderboards so as to keep things fair. The leaderboards are listed at the bottom of the page.\n\n**Building Requirements**\n\n1) Despite what the title says, KerbPro (rather, the [Hullcam VDS mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/46365-0-90-Hullcam-VDS-0-90-update-Updated-16-Dec)) **isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t necessary** to enter the challenge. I just thought it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d be cool to throw in the name as a sponsor brand or something.\n\n2) Manned/unmanned rovers don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t really make a difference as far as KSP physics is concerned. Just get them within the size limits.\n\n3) The rover must still work **after** the run. It has to still be driveable, even if what\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s left of it is half of its body and 2 wheels.\n\n4) The rover **must** have wheels.\n\n5) Boost is allowed, of course, but the rover must still be able to run without boost power.\n\n \u003E **Addendum**: Whatever propulsion method you use (F/O, MonoProp, Ion) doesn\u0027t matter.\n\n6) Mod parts **can** be used for your rover (list of confirmed \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Csafe\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 mods below). I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d really like to see variety in the competition, like rovers using Kerbal Foundries wheels, etc.\n\n7) FAR/NEAR is allowed; just don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t forget to mention it when you submit your time.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E [TweakScale](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112693) (can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t think of any way to cheat the fuel or the wheels with this mod, so it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s safe)\n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E [Hullcam VDS](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/46365-0-90-Hullcam-VDS-0-90-update-Updated-16-Dec) (I use this personally for recording purposes. Also not a cheat mod from my set rules.)\n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E [Snacks!](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90841-0-90-Snacks!-Kerbal-simplified-life-support-v0-3-3) And [Whyren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Snack Parts](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92025-Snacks-Life-Support-Parts-by-Whyren-v1) (these mods don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t affect anything, but I just thought I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d get that out of the way)\n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E B9 Aerospace, Kerbal Foundries, and other parts pack mods\n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E Stock Parts Revamp\n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E Pretty much anything that doesn\u0027t mess with fuel or crash tolerance configs\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**Building Limitations**\n\n1) Mods like MechJeb, HyperEdit, and Debug Toolbar are **not allowed**.\n\n2) Modifying part configs are also **not allowed**.\n\n3) Part altering mods are also **not allowed**.\n\n**Keeping Score**\n\nKeeping score of the rovers will use the basic mission timer at the top-left of your game screen. Keep track of the time you start driving, and when you come back to/pass the same spot. Subtract the time between the two, and you have your lap time. It is recommended to plant a flag beforehand as a start/finish line. You do **not** have to stop at the finish line; as long as you can keep the time you passed there, you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re good to go.\n\nAn easier way to keep score is to attach a launch clamp to your rover. The mission clock **won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t** move until you decouple from the clamp and start moving. The clamp pillar will also serve as a start/finish line for convenience.\n\n**Submitting Your Score**\n\nInclude at least **three pictures**:\n\n\u003E 1 at the starting line\n\n\u003E 1 somewhere in between\n\n\u003E 1 as you pass the finish line\n\nAlso include a short description of your rover, its features, et cetera.\n\nDo share extra pictures of your rover, or maybe even a craft file of the rover, although it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s obviously not required. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d also love to see a YouTube video of your run, if you recorded one!\n\n**Miscellaneous Awards**\n\n\u003E **Style Award**: There\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s no winning better than winning and looking good while you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re at it.\n\n\u003E **Wacky Award**: Kerbal designs have always been known to be crazy. So go crazy! Go Kerbal!\n\n\u003E **Purist Award**: You completed your run with an all-stock rover.\n\n\u003E **Boostless Award**: You completed your run with no boost system. \n\n\u003E **Survivor Award**: You finished the race by the skin of your teeth\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6and a driveable fraction of your rover.\n\n\u003E **Blowout Award**: Blowout your wheels at some point during the race. If you actually make it past the finish line, that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a bonus Survivor award for you as well!\n\n(I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll probably add some more awards here, but can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t think of any beyond this right now. Let me know if you have a cool award idea!)\n\nIf you have any questions, please let me know via PM or on this thread. \n\nNow, may the best man win!\n\n**My Run**\n\n**UPDATED**: So, a video of my run is up:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/n9ohOhZ2uUM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nMy time on that run is about 5:01 -- about the average I did over 3 runs. The rover I used is the Hexxagon Endeavour 3.0 (I posted a description on the Rover MegaThread [**here**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24599-Post-your-Rover-MEGATHREAD?p=1800628\u0026viewfull=1#post1800628))\n\n**UPDATE 2**: Apparently I just recently realized my rover is supposed to be a **medium** class.
