thats the exact ship you want (no idea what iteration it is), but here is what i have in my massive repository of ships ive collected over the years (pretty much everything that i was able to download or rip out of a save file that was any good competitively speaking i have a copy of).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, a bit of a question, would you be interested in something akin to battle over jool where we can each have home planets (anything in jool system is accessible) and we actually get a fuel depo to refill ships provided they managed to return to the home planet (since fuel use with interplanetary would be actually a big deal).\u00A0 Then whoever destroys/disables all ships around the enemy\u0027s home planet 1st would win the fight.\u00A0 Other then that its same rules as usual, only real complexity with this type of game is that it would be a little bit more of a strategy in ship and fleet composition, as in fuel will be a concern especially if we choose say pol and laythe which are farthest away (but you can always choose to play more defensively and win through attrition by taking down enemy.\u00A0 Finally, a bit of a rule to keep anyone from purely focusing on an enemy\u0027s ranged vessels, ships can only be engaged in order of what orbit they are in (cant attack the ships in low orbit before killing those in high orbit just so one cant just avoid the defense ships with lowish range if one ofc chooses to have defensive ships that arent quite capable of interplanetary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know such a thing would be a bit more complex then your usual battle, but it would be really neat to do something akin to between 2 planets rather then what everyone always does with the pick somewhere and just teleport ships to orbit.\u00A0 If not i can always do a normal fight too though :)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022aYosHoI.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022

HARDER to kill then my SK-IV at least based on preliminary testing.\u00A0 Its not fully done (this is just a basic skeleton, no asthetic features besides the front), and im gonna make a scaled up version to fit some RT-5s in the nose, but sofar the basic design has resulted in one of the toughest things ive ever come across when it comes to killing it.\u00A0 The new nova (once i figure out how to fit a RT-5 into that style nose) will be a perfect support vessel now that it actually comes with some real protection (and i think ill even be able to add a single kerbal in the same style as my
