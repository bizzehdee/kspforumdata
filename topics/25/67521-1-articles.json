I have a rather basic idea for one that I think would be fun. The objective is to collect as many asteroids as possible in a stable kerbin orbit. The catch is, it\u0027s not just based around the amount, its based on the mass of the asteroids that you gather. The scoring is based on who has the highest weight of all the asteroids in a stable kerbin orbit combined.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll submit my own entry soon, but wanted to post this now so people can get started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStock:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll add modded if there is enough interest.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T01:58:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny bonus credit for getting them into a show-off orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/asteroid_5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022asteroid_5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Cause I was totally showing off with this one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
