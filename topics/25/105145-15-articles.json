Flipping it does not improve a tail mounted cone\u0027s drag, because it would be treated as being in front of a stack. The flipping exploit only benefits nose cones that are at the front of the stack, so it is treated as being behind. Yakuzi showed that indirectly in his investigation.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ...

It may be connected to the changed appearance. And an argument could be made against adding a tail cone to an LV-N. In my experience, thrust is blocked on the LV-N unless you offset the cone. On the RAPIER thrust is not blocked if you leave the Small Nose Cone where it attaches to the node.\n\nOn the other hand the shroud/auto-fairing that appears on the LV-N supposedly has mass, like regular fairings, once you launch (haven\u0027t verified for sure. Not at a KSP computer either).\n\nOn an entirely different subject, even though it is allowed in the challenge rules, you will not see me making entries with command pods as part of the payload.
