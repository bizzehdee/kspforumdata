The challenge clock starts when the mission timer starts i.e. when you launch from the KSC (which is the only place you may launch from). \n\n2. The challenge clock stops when your Kerbal is ready to set foot on the surface of another planet. \n\n3. You need to provide at least a launch, two orbit and one landing screenshot, showing the mission timer in each. Along with some information on how you made the journey (bonus kudos for near-death experiences). \n\nA few rules:\n\n1. Stock only. No physics changing, part size changing or non-stock-part mods.\n\n2. Mechjeb and Engineer Redux are fine.\n\n3. No Hyperedit!\n\n4. One craft only i.e. no picking up parts or transferring to another craft along the way. \n\n5. Your Kerbal must make the whole journey in a capsule, getting out only to set foot on another world. \n\n6. Crash landings are fine, even encouraged, as long as the capsule is in one piece and your Kerbal can exit the capsule. \n\n7. No physics exploits e.g. Kraken drives, etc. \n\nThe winners:\n\nThe fastest mission for each planet where you put a living Kerbal on the surface.\n\nMake it so!\n\n======\n\n***Leader board:***\n\n**Duna**\n\nAphobius - 7d, 2:12:35 (ion)\n\npurpleivan 16d, 01:12:0 (rocket)\n\nKelderek -16d, 03:35:0 (rocket)\n\nStarhawk - 23d, 04:35:1 (rocket)\n\nFoxster - 32d, 05:27:27\n\nKuzzter - 34d, 04:46:12\n\nStarhawk - 34d, 04:51:08\n\nFoxster - 1y, 36d, 04:52:48\n\n**Eve**\n\nFoxster - 6d, 04:29:14 (nuclear)\n\npurpleivan 9d, 02:02:58 (rocket)\n\nKelderek - 9d, 04:17:56 (rocket)\n\nKuzzter - 14d, 05:47:48\n\nnoorm - 39d, 02:56:31\n\nFlipNascar - 52d, 00:23:24\n\nrudi1291 - 165d, 02:09:00\n\n**Moho**\n\nPLAD - 33d, 03:17:08 (rocket \u002B nuclear)\n\nFoxster - 39d, 02:31:33 (nuclear)\n\n**Dres**\n\nFoxster - 171d, 01:28:02 (nuclear)\n\n**Jool** (The fastest to achieve a Pe *and* Ap 200km\u002B/-50km orbit)\n\nFoxster - 45d 03:18:59 (rocket\u003Enuclear\u003Eion\u003Erocket)\n\nFoxster - 64d, 05:04:5 (nuclear)\n\nNorcalplanner - 82d, 02:07:22 (nuclear)\n\nrudi1291 - 3y, 194d, 00:12:30\n\n**Eeloo**\n\nnightingale - 294d, 00:36:22\n\n**The moons**\n\n**Mun**\n\nPLAD - 00:33:51\n\npurpleivan - 00:37:24\n\nhoiho - 00:46:53\n\nTC One - 00:58:42\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-26T16:05:28Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2015 04:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Foxster**"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T13:02:48Z","Content":"So I\u0027m guessing a direct \u0027launch to SOI intercept\u0027 route to Eve will be the winner.\n\nI use FAR and DRE so I\u0027ll not be entering as I\u0027d just burn up...\n\nI\u0027m interested in seeing the way the winners do it though."},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T13:48:32Z","Content":"Here\u0027s a Duna attempt to get things started:\n\n![2TXrDtD.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/2TXrDtD.jpg)\n\n![Vcs9cLK.png](http://i.imgur.com/Vcs9cLK.png)\n\n![GxqC77Z.png](http://i.imgur.com/GxqC77Z.png)\n\n![FwlgEMb.png](http://i.imgur.com/FwlgEMb.png)\n\n![1hPEq8N.png](http://i.imgur.com/1hPEq8N.png)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E So I\u0027m guessing a direct \u0027launch to SOI intercept\u0027 route to Eve will be the winner.\n\u003E I use FAR and DRE so I\u0027ll not be entering as I\u0027d just burn up...\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m interested in seeing the way the winners do it though.\n\nI\u0027d be happy to make a FAR leader board if you\u0027d like?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-21T13:44:07Z\u0022 title=\u002203/21/2015 01:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Foxster**"},{"CreatedByName":"rudi1291","CreatedById":138990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T15:29:39Z","Content":"So i landed on Eve...\n\n![McUBub3.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/McUBub3.jpg)\n\nRocket on launchpad.
