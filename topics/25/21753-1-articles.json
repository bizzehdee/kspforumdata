Maybe orbital view should be allowed at least for timewarping purposes, but i dont know how to switch of trajectory simluations.

I know it\u0027s not that realistic a challenge, but I want to try this. I\u0027ve done the orbit thing already (though I have no screenshots to prove it) but going for the Mun could be a nice challenge. Just a question beforehand: is the map view allowed before take-off? I was thinking I could time-warp to launch window using map view and then do the rest from IVA-view.

Even in Armstrong\u0027s famous manual landing, the LEM had radar-based SMARTASS-type automation. If I remember the paper correctly, it even outdid MechJeb by having a \u0022stop horizontal motion\u0022 button. AFAIK the LEM burns during Apollo 13 were totally manual.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I dug a little further, and NASA apparently concluded full manual control of LEM simply wasn\u0027t possible with the required safety margin. Astronauts crashed the manual Lunar Lander Research Vehicles in training, and the followup Lunar Lander Test Vehicle was semi-manual, like the LEM. Analog electronics read astronaut\u0027s joystick inputs combined with the craft\u0027s current attitude and rates-of-turn to judge what the astronaut wanted, then a rate-control autopilot actually ran the thrusters and gimbals to accomplish those wishes. Even then, it was supposedly crazy-difficult to handle, just no longer impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the paper, if anyone\u0027s interested: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.princeton.edu/~stengel/LM.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.princeton.edu/~stengel/LM.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FuryDrone","CreatedById":30132,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-18T21:13:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for info, guys.
