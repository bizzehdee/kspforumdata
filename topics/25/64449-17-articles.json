The clipped Turbojet/RAPIER engine is interesting, but makes it difficult to manage how they perform, especially given the use of only two ram intakes. Uses a standard docking port, but puts it in an odd location (which looks quite ugly if I may be brutally honest), with no illumination except from landing gears.

Uses my favorite engines (Rockomax 24-77!), dorsal-mounted air intakes, and it is one of the better-balanced RCS spaceplanes. Could use some more batteries, lights, and monopropellant though.
