said ship is the fact that it doesnt have a focused role like most of my other craft, and is more of a versatility above specialization (which lets it engage anything but keeps it from dominating any particular fight).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00228REjh9R.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/8REjh9R.png\u0022

survivability and firepower with a crazy 3150 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E at ~90t.\u00A0 Its also got a really nice fully decked out interior command deck (all ships i make that are cruiser or larger come with interiors as standard).\u00A0 The only real issue is the somewhat high part count of ~320, but considering what it has onboard (interior, tons of weapons, struts everywhere as i dont touch autostrut), its not THAT terrible in this regard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts only real issue is the fact that it is not very efficient unlike the workhorse SK-IV.\u00A0 It has the exact same weapons (4 more RT-5s, 1 less G5a torp, less and weaker aux weapons), its armor is a tad better, but it also weighs 1.5 times as much so those gains dont really help that much.\u00A0 Finally, the bridge is a massive weakspot which can cripple the ship if someone is sadistic enough to wanna target it and murder the poor exposed crew.\u00A0 It looks stellar, works nice as i can aim the guns from the 2 cockpits, but serves no real combat purpose otherwise (not to mention being a actual armor weakness) and just eats part count.\u00A0 Maybee ill make a combat version of this by replacing the upper deck with another weapons barrel giving it the equivalent firepower of 2 SK-IVs in ammo capacity, but then itd look meh.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022wPYJjw1.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/wPYJjw1.png\u0022

around conventional armor layout (its so small that there is no point of doing anything else).\u00A0 Being conventional (and not MK-2 based like all the other ships i have) makes it very weak to anything larger then a small ibeam, but considering it has a SINGLE engine which is pretty much guaranteed to go if anything hits it near the back, why bother spending mass and part count to armor the bugger, instead deploy 5 of them for every cruiser and call it a day.\u00A0 Pretty much based it around the oversized guns strapped to a single engine principle, it has the best firepower per tonnage and part count of the 3, but has no survivability to speak of and doesnt have the ammo capacity to guarantee a kill in of itself not to mention lacks any form of guided weaponry which makes it rely on getting up to the target.\u00A0 At least it also has plenty of fuel at 2800dV so i can move it around as needed.\u00A0 Prolly will arm it with at least 1 guided weapon in addition to its stack of RT-5s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso the armor makes me wanna rename it the \u0022kamikaze cannon fodder\u0022, given that thats what its used for right now in a fleet wide engagement since its armor is really really non-existent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah, i might be able to fight someone, after i finish my assault carrier (always wanted to make a good carrier, but nothing ive yet to try has really worked with that regard, too many parts, bad armor, no firepower, ect).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-03T21:58:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022

do is understand what makes armor work in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221hiRH56.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/1hiRH56.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow there are many ways to make ships, but the general consensus is that every vessel\u0027s core structure (skeleton that its built around) has to be made entirely of 80m/s impact tolerance parts, almost always your choice of girders or ibeams since those are the only stock elements that have the required impact tolerance and are long enough to make a ship out of easily.\u00A0 Then there are 2 philosophies that ive found to work, \u0022single core\u0022, and \u0022lengthwise spine\u0022.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese are both rather simple to understand, the former being a single critical component that everything your ship has branches off of (most of my ships are made using this style), so its very hard to cut the ship in half, and the critical section can be well protected inside thge ship and hard to hit in the 1st place.\u00A0 The downside of this approach is that when that part goes the entire ship is kaput, meaning you have little redundancy and if that part does indeed go you will be turned into a cloud of debris.\u00A0 I prefer this style because the odds of being split in half are very low, and 75% of the time a ship that is split in half is for all intents and purposes out of the battle even if its technically \u0022alive\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe latter style relies upon a long spine that runs down the entire ship from front to back.\u00A0 Ship components are then attached to that spine and solong as the spine remains intact, this ship can take a rather extensive beating and keep on going.\u00A0 The trick is to not loose the spine, which is obviously easier said then done.\u00A0 Another benefit of this style is that is provides much more useable surface area to attach weapons to it, and is much easier to make viable without quite as much experience as its more or less super simple, make a length of 3\u002B girders, then build out radially from those girders and place weapons and engines and fuelon the branches or directly onto the spine depending on how valuable the component is (usually command pods and probe cores get directly attached, fuel and such does not).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022cH2Bzsx.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/cH2Bzsx.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, my chibi star destroyer is an example of the first style of construction, and as you can see with most of the superficial crap removed, everything in the ship branches off of that one component and is attached to the branches.\u00A0 As long as that part doesnt get hit and explode, the ship will at worst case loose a few engines or weapons to every direct hit, but will remain combat capable to some extent (unless you manage to destroy all 7 engines or knock off like 10 different weapon hardpoints).\u00A0 Technically its a bit of a hybrid though, since it has a root part but it also has multiple spines running lengthwise so i can have something to attach the front to, but since it has 1 component that will result in loss of the entire ship, id put it into style 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022YRyTot6.png\u0022

girders one behind the other, off of which everything branches off and is attached to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for armor, the simplest solution is to use girders as branches and then attach plates to them to cover the outside (the 2nd ship is a very good example of this even if its got a few weaknesses of its own).\u00A0 anything with 80m/s impact tolerance will do for armor, but some people find it better to use fuel tanks as sacrificial armor (which works pretty well from my experience but isnt quite my style so i stay away from that).\u00A0 Then make sure to tie everything together using struts, and AVOID autostrut like the plague unless the ship is so high on parts you literally have to in order to not crash when the ship loads.\u00A0 Autostruts are super buggy, and ive had very mixed results with some use being helpful but other use breaking a otherwise solid ship and making it the equivalent of unarmored freighter in survivability.\u00A0 Finally, wings are good as low-grade armor of cosmetic filler.\u00A0 Dont underestimate wings as they can and will deflect high velocity rounds, but they offer little if any stopping power so most rounds might change direction a bit when they hit wing, but wont explode completely or stop moving and are likely to hit something behind the wing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022StohTzS.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/StohTzS.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother ship using type-2 construction with MK-2 composite armor (lighter and simpler then panels, but alot harder to get right).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00228oDuOq5.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/8oDuOq5.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow there are more advanced armor techniques that you can try, for example using MK-2/3 cargo bays which have some really funky hitboxes and tend to desintegrate some types of warheads.\u00A0 Most of my modern ships (like the above nebula class) use this armor as its alot lighter for the same protection, but if its not done perfectly it really sucks (and by perfectly i mean everything is where it needs to be, put 1 strut in the wrong spot and trhe ship goes from insanely hard to kill to 1 shottable by ibeams).\u00A0 that said, for starters i recommend sticking to the tried and true core of girders/ibeams with structural plates on the outside, but feel free to experiment with other styles to see what works for you, aslong as the core of teh ship is a ibeam or girder or some other 80m/s impact part, it should stand up to some weapons fire.\u00A0 Another tip is to have redundancy regardless of the design, always have at least 2 command modules (cockpits, seats, droid cores, ect), and always have 2-3 engines so that someone cant just gently tap the ship\u0027s arss and knock it out of the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for weapons, its remarkably simple but yet takes alot of testing to see what shapes work best.\u00A0 For unguided weapons, the best choices are RT-5\u002Bstructural part on the tip (either small structural plates, girders or ibeams), or ibeam/girder with 2-8 sepatrons pushing it depending on how far you are ok engaging at (2 will work if you are ok firing from 300-400m or so, 4 or 8 for shorter ranges).\u00A0 For guided weapons, generally you want some combination of ibeams girders and panels.\u00A0 Different people have results with different parts, but ive found the best choice for simpler weapons are AP solid shot warheads where the structureal parts are all attached to themselves.\u00A0 The other choice is some sort of shrapnel rounds where the girders or ibeams attach to a fuel tank or other soft part, it breaks, and they scatter throughout teh ship.\u00A0 Not as good with new physics as it was back in the really old days, but ist still a valid concept when targeting weaker internals after a hole has been punched through the armor itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is alot of variety, and you will need to find what impact velocity works the best for you (i like 200-300m/s relative to target but it heavily depends on the target im shooting, thick targets need more, thin need less).\u00A0 Propulsion isnt really very critical, solong as it can accelerate the round from whatever range you shoot at up to the desired velocity.\u00A0 vernors are nice to help aim it precisely, but are weight that isnt essential if you can aim without them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, GL with your shipbuilding, and if you want a example craft or 2 to play with ill upload something that doesnt actually suck.\u00A0 Dont try and replicate my chibi star destroyer, its terrible and is purely used as a carrier/flagshipy thing that looks super cool but has lousy combat ability, the other ship isnt bad, but gets split every time it gets hit by my newer G5a torp from directly below it when hitting near the back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SG Aero","CreatedById":174890,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-21T19:39:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is indeed the void.
