Bear in mind that the Oxygen recyclers in Ioncross seem to mess up at high time warps. I was carrying over 10,000 oxygen for 8 Kerbals and couldn\u0027t get them to survive the trip to Duna quite, but then I went down to 10,000 warp only and they made it fine, so warp gauging is rather necessary. Unfortunately things are messed up with more than one ship en-route as you can\u0027t keep both active so I\u0027m still trying to keep track of who needs resupply at any given point rather than letting the computer handle it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is another system out there, the WIP Tac Supply mod by Thunder that keeps track of oxygen food and water when a ship is not active, but there is no recycling yet and I did briefly check it out only to find I couldn\u0027t keep enough resources aboard my ship for the trip. It\u0027s just too heavy! Plus he has no air intake system so you\u0027d have to cannibalize something between Ioncross and Tac supply mod.
