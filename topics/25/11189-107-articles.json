However, I fly IVA and use quite some informational mods, as well as an external control panel for additional information.\n\nTwo notable incidents during the trip: A solar panel is lost to overheating, and touchdown happens a few meters before the runway, coming to a halt on the runway.

I would comment that the payload appears to be modified since the stock Rockomax Jumbo64 tank holds 6400 units split between liquid fuel and oxidizer and I know of no way to switch to all liquid fuel in stock. However because it is the payload and is enclosed and is not used in flight in apart from its mass, I think it stands to reason that this is not a just cause to disqualify the mission.\n\nThat said I ought to check that the same is not true of any of the other tanks used in the lifter section of the craft i.e. that they are stock and not modified.

I\u0027m sure you could squeeze a bit more delta-v from it if the ascent was more efficient! It seems (although hard to tell as you\u0027ve sped the video up) that after you ignite the closed cycle mode you have to pitch up quite a lot to raise the orbit AP, no?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Try burning closer to prograde and using horizontal speed to lift the AP, after 35km you won\u0027t loose so much speed to drag - the wings will provide a little bit of lift also, leaving more oxidizer for orbit ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nThanks! Yes I am still learning how to do the most efficient ascent profile. I will try to squeeze in more deltaV (maybe switching the configuration to have less liquid fuel and more oxidizer) and to try to have a high AP before making the closed cycle burn. I am planning on using it as crew transfer from a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E space station below, and work on an M model that can reach the Mun."},{"CreatedByName":"Andetch","CreatedById":173643,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-28T19:37:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 24 minutes ago, alex50caliber said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks!
