I\u0027ve been counting Kethane itself and drills, etc., as cargo if the plane can function without them, on the theory that the plane could be used to deliver Kethane to bases.

First, can the plane meet the challenge requirements on electric power alone, without burning Kethane? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan it achieve 9000m without burning kethane? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EApparently not!\u003C/strong\u003E This was an excellent question to which I did not know the answer for certain so I have flown some additional test flights (in kethane cargo delivery mode) to get the answers. It turns out that without burning kethane I can only achieve a stable cruise altitude of about 6750 m. It makes no difference if the kethane tanks are full or empty, I get the same 6750 m maximum cruising altitude. It seems that it is a limit imposed by the electric engines not providing enough power to produce a positive climb rate above 6750 m altitude. The firespitter engines may be able to hold at a slightly higher altitude but they are unable to climb there unassisted. I did not set any action groups to toggle the firespitter engines into the alternate modes (one is called \u0022cargo\u0022).

It looks like you\u0027re using the\u003Cstrong\u003E UPGRADED\u003C/strong\u003E KSP-Interstellar fusion or even antimatter reactors, based on the ISP and thrust of those thermal turbojets (fission reactors wouldn\u0027t be nearly capable of that kind of performance- especially the Molten Salt Reactors that form the first tier of KSP-Interstellar reactors, and are the only technology that is even reasonably close to becoming a reality in the next 20-30 years...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) \u003Cstrong\u003EThat\u0027s some serious intake-spam. \u003C/strong\u003E Personally, I\u0027d call it exploitative- and I\u0027m surprised FAR didn\u0027t cause the forward air intakes to shield the intakes further back, making them much less effective (then again, maybe it did- you never right-click on them to show their performance while the atmospheric pressures are high enough for and easy comparison\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(3) If you had used intake pre-coolers (either the stock or B9 ones work with KSP-Interstellar) you wouldn\u0027t have had the problems you did with engine overheating, forcing you to switch over to internal propellant quite so soon (based on the fact that you throttled down, you didn\u0027t seem to be aware that this was the source of the excess heat- as intake compression-heating is completely unaffected by engine throttle in KSP Interstellar, like in real-life...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(4) You had 3 engines, but you switched them all over to internal propellant at the same time. Generally, that\u0027s a bad idea. When you have a 1-in-2-out engine setup like that, you\u0027re better off switching the engines in sets (the inner engine vs. outer pair, respectively), starting first with just one engine to internal propellant, then two, and then all three, as you climb higher and run out of intake air for the turbojets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hybrid turbojets (which I haven\u0027t utilized for this challenge as they are unlocked by the same tech node that upgrades the fission reactors to gas/plasma-core reactors, which are far beyond the realm of current fission technology; unlike MSR\u0027s which we have had working prototypes of such the 1960\u0027s, when the US developed a working prototype of a Thorium Molten Salt Reactor at Oak Ridge National labs, and then largely abandoned the idea as it couldn\u0027t produce large quantities of plutonium for nuclear warheads like Uranium Light Water Reactors could...) work a lot like a RAPIER, in that they are a dual-mode engine that is most efficient in air-breathing mode- and you should make use of atmospheric propellant for working/reaction mass as long as possible... Perhaps if you hadn\u0027t made use of so much intake-spam, and a few precoolers, you would have actually felt some pressure to utilize a more efficient ascent path instead of just brute-forcing your way to orbit...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(5) The wing-load on that spaceplane is far too high. Put another way, the wings are far too short/thin (thicker wings generate more lift, at the cost of lift/drag ratio, both in KSP mods like B9 Aerospace and Procedural Dynamics, and in real life) for the mass of the spaceplane. A spaceplane design with lower wing-load could get by with much less thrust (say if you made use of greater realism: less intake spam and less futuristic nuclear reactors) and would have a lower (and therefore safer) liftoff/touchdown speed on Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(6) Where are the vertical stabilizers? I don\u0027t see them anywhere. Even *my* plane designs, which almost always make use of inclined winglets with multi-purpose control surfaces (an inclined control surface can provide control over pitch, roll, \u003Cstrong\u003EAND\u003C/strong\u003E yaw- for less total mass/drag than three separate control surfaces of smaller size) due to my early intuition and recent large amount of background reading into real-world plane designs (I opted for the highest-performance option, despite the stability/design problems it engenders, which I\u0027ve struggled against in my experimental designs) rather than dedicated aerlions, flaps, and rudders; ALWAYS make use of at least some form of lift surface and control surface with yaw-stabilization capabilities... I can only assume you have some seriously-exploitative reaction wheel spam built into that thing, otherwise you would most certainly lose control to sideslip that would develop into a flat spin when trying to turn, especially with FAR installed...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIn short, a not very realistic design relying heavily on of some of the most OP\u0027d and unrealistic elements in KSP (heavily OP\u0027d reaction wheels) and KSP-Interstellar.\u003C/strong\u003E I can\u0027t say I approve. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-16T17:01:51Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2014 05:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"custume","CreatedById":112591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-17T09:21:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello Northstar .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs true I use the antimatter reactors, I have made before a ship that use the lower reactors, but I needed to add more rockets ( like 2 or 4 lv-N ) or another, but don\u0027t forget (this thing have a TWR of 6 and is a solid construction so its a question of some changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThat\u0027s some serious intake-spam.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrue , but that type of reactor need that much intake, try using less and the engine power drops ( a lot).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I use less powerful reactor I don\u0027t need that many.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022If you had used intake pre-coolers\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry that before ( did not work so well )and besides I don\u0027t really need them if I change from intake to liquid fuel, and that adds more weigh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I will try to use them ( I did not know that the heat on the engines is to mush intake (thz for the info ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You had 3 engines, but you switched them all over to internal propellant at the same time\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrue , very true , but if you see better you will see that I was going a lot faster that needed ( I was like at 50 to 60 Mps of acceleration ) so I had time to make the switch .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll nuclear fission reactors (that exist today) are valid reactors, is true that we do not master the fusion reactors and we are far (really far ) from having any type of plasma reactors or even antimatter reactors ( or how to store antimatter ) so you are right about the reactors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(5) The wing-load on that spaceplane is far too high.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrue but bigger wings = more weigh and more dragg, so I made the bigger and not thicker, but that is a idea to consider.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022less intake spam and less futuristic nuclear reactors) and would have a lower (and therefore safer) liftoff/touchdown speed on Duna.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrue, I had to land like the harrier fighter jet in duna, the approach speed is to low, and the plane need to stall at 20 or 30 Mps and that is a to low speed for that plane, that thing will stall at 110 to 120Mps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere are the vertical stabilizers?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I add them, 3 of them (or I do not know what you are talking about), I did not add flaps ( don\u0027t know here to add them for them to even work), it have elevators, ailerons and rudders , I did not add the horizontal stabilizer (I was thinking that, that plane don\u0027t really need it ) side that have all the control surfaces (\u002B or -

So you rarely have to worry about it, except when you\u0027re at extremes of low wing-load or TWR... The main reason NOT to use larger wings is because craft with larger wings fly slower at low altitudes/ high atmospheric pressures (even if they can fly to a higher altitude ceiling, or with a heavier payload) past a certain point, due to declining TWR (more mass to push with the engines). At high altitudes, or in thin atmosphere like Duna\u0027s, the lower Angle of Attack you get with larger wings can actually help you fly faster though- that is, until you start flying so fast as to start going ballistic (at which point wings are just a burden on your TWR).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022custume\u0022 data-cite=\u0022custume\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u0022less intake spam and less futuristic nuclear reactors) and would have a lower (and therefore safer) liftoff/touchdown speed on Duna.\u0022\u003Cp\u003ETrue, I had to land like the harrier fighter jet in duna, the approach speed is to low, and the plane need to stall at 20 or 30 Mps and that is a to low speed for that plane, that thing will stall at 110 to 120Mps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m uber-cautious, so I would generally consider even 20-30 m/s to be a high touchdown speed.
