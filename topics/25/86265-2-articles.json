It requires way less delta-v for the ascent (I think I did it with around 9000 or so from sea level), but making a lander that doesn\u0027t try to nosedive while going down, spin out of control going up, and get torn apart when parachutes deploy is quite a challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gravaar","CreatedById":83438,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T03:06:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022gm537\u0022 data-cite=\u0022gm537\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThanks for the reminder about this rule.
