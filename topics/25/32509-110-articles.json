Any chance that we could move this to the challenges section, as the games section really doesn\u2019t fit this. It might seem like it would, but when most people think of forum games they think of don\u2019t click this or guess who will reply next. I feel like this thread is really starting to stagnate and I find it a little odd that other battle threads are put in the challenges section meanwhile we are stuck here. Please? Move it please?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SG Aero","CreatedById":174890,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-08T22:15:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFine.
