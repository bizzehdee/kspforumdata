The smaller, Avenger, is capable of reaching orbit from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E runway, re-entering and landing on the same runway, as shown in the included video. The larger Hornet has been designed to take Avenger inside its cargo bay and fly it all the way to Laythe orbit and back, where Avenger is used as an excursion vehicle to land on Laythe before returning to the Hornet and docking with it.\n\nI rather underestimated the delta-v required for an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E to go to Laythe and back, so I had to use numerous gravity assists on the way. Jool orbit was reached by means of a Tylo assist, followed by a Laythe assist to lower the resulting orbit before aerocapturing at Laythe. On the return flight two Kerbin encounters and an Eve encounter were necessary to reach Kerbin with a speed that allowed aerocapture - I would have preferred a braking burn and direct aerocapture but I was running on fumes by then. Due to my resulting Kerbin orbit being inclined about 9 degrees I was unable to land on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, opting for an inviting piece of grassland to the north of it instead.\n\nFull report here: [https://imgur.com/a/PhrEzbX](https://imgur.com/a/PhrEzbX)\n\nSome highlights:\n\n![BaD6enu.png](https://i.imgur.com/BaD6enu.png)\n\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E Hornet on the runway, with Avenger folded up inside the cargo bay.\n\n![ZGucPNE.png](https://i.imgur.com/ZGucPNE.png)\n\nHornet in Laythe orbit, with Avenger deployed and ready for landing.\n\n![2jjycFo.png](https://i.imgur.com/2jjycFo.png)\n\nAvenger landed on Laythe.

I\u0027m very proud that I succeeded in reaching the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E: my orbit had quite a high inclination, and the portion that was inside the atmosphere was quite a way north of the equator. So a standard re-entry profile would have landed a long way away from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. But I managed to find a skip re-entry profile that did reach the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\nWhile there is some room for improvement, especially the stability during high speed aerocapture and in the transonic regime, this voyage was a complete success.\n\nFull report here: [https://imgur.com/a/Obov2uf](https://imgur.com/a/Obov2uf)\n\nSome highlights:\n\n![ljOShki.png](https://i.imgur.com/ljOShki.png)\n\n*Wasp during take-off*\n\n![5PPSxDS.png](https://i.imgur.com/5PPSxDS.png)\n\n*Landed on Dres*\n\n![tlySUc0.png](https://i.imgur.com/tlySUc0.png)\n\n*Chance encounter with the Dres canyon*\n\n![iZVi8Eg.png](https://i.imgur.com/iZVi8Eg.png)\n\n*Touchdown on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E runway*"},{"CreatedByName":"QF9E","CreatedById":201203,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-05T17:52:37Z","Content":"Edit: don\u0027t ask for permission, ask for forgiveness instead.\n\nDear K-prize committee,\n\nAllow me to introduce you to project Homerun.

I tried to set a very high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E record (I tried 70 Petameters, 7 Petameters and 2 Petameters) but no luck with any of them:\n\n1. With \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E over 70 Pm, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E indicator on the map screen does not show the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E accurately. The orbital info thingie in the bottom left still does, but the map view seems capped at 70 Pm or so.\n2. With \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E of 70 Pm, orbital period is more than 2 billion years. If you advance time that far, savegames become corrupted. And if one savegame is corrupted, the loading screen does not show, meaning if you have 1 corrupted savegame you cannot load any saves anymore. And if that savegame happens to be the persistent savegame, the \u0022Resume game\u0022 from the start menu does not allow you to start any of your campaign anymore.\n3. With \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E of 2 or 7 Pm, timewarp becomes an issue. While it is possible to add insanely high multipliers in the Better Time Warp mod, the time warp mechanism in the game does not work quite so well anymore. Meaning if you timewarp to somewhere, it either overshoots (drastically) or reduces the multiplier to such an extent that the waiting time becomes insanely long.\n4. If you manage timewarp manually and very carefully, it is possible to do an orbit to 7 Pm and back. This will take 200 million years. However, afterwards a bug in the game will be triggered which stops time if timewarp is below x10.\n\nSo I decided to set a somewhat more modest goal. I succeeded in going to 10 Terameters and back and landing on Kerbin. This flight took on the order of 7000 years. See the included video for proof. Note that the video starts when I am in a solar orbit - this is from a savegame from yesterday\u0027s attempt. One anomaly occurred on this flight: the front landing gear failed to deploy. Which is strange, given that this is the exact same craft that I flew yesterday. Fortunately I succeeded in landing on the main gear only, gently lowering the nose to keep my craft intact.\n\nNow, there is some room for improvement, as there is considerable room between 10 Tm and 2 Pm, and the extra amount of delta-v required is negligible.But I am going to leave it to others to try to improve on my results.\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/6xSG8DwnDTY?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"QF9E","CreatedById":201203,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-07T19:46:25Z","Content":"Today I decided to have a break from flying SSTOs with insanely high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E in order to fulfil the criteria for some kudos that I haven\u0027t got yet.
