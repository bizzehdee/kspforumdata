Behind CoM (e.g. on the tail), positive AoA settings promote stability and reduce stalling, while negative AoA settings increase control authority. Ahead of CoM (e.g. canards), negative AoA settings promote stability/reduce stalling, while positive AoA settings increase control authority. If you run a FAR stability analysis in the SPH, you should be able to see how the control surfaces deflect in response to AoA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid you intend for me to set the canards with \u002B200% AoA? Thanks to its otherwise low pitch authority, the K-16 flies successfully with \u002B200%, but it does mean that the canards are pretty much permanently stalled until you reach supersonic speeds.

You\u0027ve got three major issues:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) You need enough turning ability to dogfight effectively, which includes the ability to pull out of dives before hitting the ground. This means high-G supersonic maneuvering in thick, low altitude air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) You need enough durability to survive the consequences of those maneuvers. Wing mass/strength left at default is more than strong enough for any sane piloting, but low-altitude supersonic dogfighting is pretty much the definition of not-sane flying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) The plane needs to be docile enough that the autopilot doesn\u0027t flip it out of control, particularly while subsonic (once you\u0027ve gone supersonic, it becomes much harder to stall). Ideally, you want the autopilot to hold it just at the edge of stall without falling all the way into it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first issue calls for as much control authority as possible, and as low a wing loading (mass divided by lift, basically) as possible. OTOH, the second issue demands strong wings, which adds mass, which increases wing loading. And the third issue calls for as \u003Cem\u003Elittle\u003C/em\u003E control authority as possible, directly conflicting with the first point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWatch the video of the MiKs; they\u0027re also pulling highish G and momentarily entering a minor stall [1] on takeoff. It\u0027s normal for fighters to do that in KSP/FAR. You\u0027ll also see that the MiK-5 tends to stall a little itself when turning hard at subsonic speeds; it\u0027s not necessarily a major problem, although it is best avoided when possible (because even a minor stall adds drag and reduces lift, reducing acceleration, climb rate and turning ability)..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe change to the AoA settings on the canards has already fixed most of your stalling problem; toughen up the airframe a bit and gain just a bit more turning ability and you\u0027ll have a seriously effective fighter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[1] The information around the navball comes from \u003Cem\u003EKerbal Flight Data\u003C/em\u003E; the stall warning turns yellow during a minor stall, red in a major stall. Right-click on parts during flight to check if they\u0027re stalled and how much; this will let you know which bits of the wings need tuning. To reduce the stalling tendency of a control surface, either reduce its max deflection or increase its AoA setting (negative if in front of CoM, positive if behind CoM). If the main wing is stalling, either increase the chord of that wing or shift it rearwards a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust realised that I never posted here the MiK-5 video that I refer to above.

Too fast makes for very dull video and inconclusive fights, because the autopilots aren\u0027t smart enough to throttle down when they need a tight turn. Mismatched speeds ruin gunfights; if the tailing plane is slower, it almost never gets within gun range; if it\u0027s faster, it tends to overshoot the target before having enough time to knock it down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven at 399m/s, close-matched fights run long enough that fuel consumption becomes an issue.

I didn\u0027t mandate disabling of capsule torque because I wanted to keep it accessible to relatively novice builders who will already be having enough trouble making something that the autopilot can fly smoothly.

The AI does seem smart enough to use speedbrakes to try avoid overshooting even though it doesn\u0027t have throttle control (hence the massive split brakes on the Pidgeys wings), if another aircraft has issues with maneuvering at those speeds due to failure to set good dynamic deflection settings or being too fragile, that\u0027s their problem.

You need to be consistent. If you do want to keep cockpit reaction wheels allowed: You need to say so, none of the other FAR challenges currently running (5th gen fighter design thread, WWII dogfighting AI thread) allow them, I assumed no reaction wheels meant none. If you do want to keep cockpit reaction wheels as something that is allowed, I will design an aircraft around that (likely a small 2seater) to take full advantage of it, and it will indeed influence the later stages of this challenge to be biased heavily toward small aircraft that get the most out of the cockpit torque.
