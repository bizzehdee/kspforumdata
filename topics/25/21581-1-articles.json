They can be done by putting a ship into a very high orbit around Kerbol (or Jool) and killing the horizontal velocity. The ship is now on a collision course with either body, as if left alone it would fall into the star or planet. Getting back up to speed is a bit of a challenge, but it\u0027s not so bad now that we have nuke engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAround Jool it\u0027s very easy, since you only need to come to rest relative to Jool, not Kerbol. In a high enough orbit (relatively easy to achieve for Jool) the maneuver barely requires any delta v.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kahlzun","CreatedById":39989,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-08T10:09:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou also need to define what \u0027too far\u0027 is in relation to Jool..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SunJumper","CreatedById":27062,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-08T11:08:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECollision course, a stage of your craft is jetissoned in an orbit that intersects the atmosphere/kill zone of the target body.
