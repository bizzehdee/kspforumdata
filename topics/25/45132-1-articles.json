The United Kations has approved the creation and indefinite funding of the Kerbin Rocketry and Aeronautics Komission(KRAK). Kaelen Kerman, the newly appointed Komissioner of KRAK had this to say. \u0022As a species we have chosen space. We have chosen to go forth from Kerbin and learn all we can about this great solar system of ours. We will also seek to establish a permanent presence on suitable worlds we find.

(If you already know what that is you are an awesome person.) The way this will work is that I will collect sign ups on this forum and make a list of all participants. Then I will start a new game and send it to the first person on the list along with a mission. When their mission has ended (in either success or failure) they will post a mission report(probably in a different thread) and put the save file up for download. We pass it to the next person on the list along with a new mission and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Each mission will be based on what happened in the previous missions. For example, say mission 4 involves landing a science station in a specific location on Duna. Mission 5 or 6 may then involve retrieval of the samples collected during mission 4. Or, maybe mission 3 did not go so well and there are now 3 Kerbals stranded in orbit around the Mun. Mission 4 will likely be a rescue mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The overall goal of this campaign will be a grand tour of all the worlds of the Kerbol system. At least 1 mission will be sent to every planetary body. Right now I am going to restrict this to stock parts just to keep it simple.

Just PM me a list of who is leaving so I know who to remove from the roster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those who do stick around here is how it is going to continue. I will work on pre-planning all of the missions(I already have a couple done). Keeping in mind any special requests people made on their applications, I will assign them via PM to each person. The missions aren\u0027t secret or anything. I just don\u0027t want to clutter up the mission report thread too much. Your missions will have 2 sets of objectives: Primary and Secondary. The primary objectives are fixed and will not change between when I assign you the mission and when you actually get to run it. The secondary objective will be fluid and may change depending on what happens during the missions that come before yours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen your turn comes up, I will post your mission objective and parameters on the mission report thread.

At that point you have 48 hours to post a reply on that thread letting everyone know that you accept and are working on your mission. If you don\u0027t post a reply within 48 hours then we will move on to the next commanders mission instead. You won\u0027t be out of the game or anything but you will be moved down a slot. At the end of the next mission your mission will be assigned again.

Part of what made Boatmurdered fun was the spiral out of control as each new overseer had to try to correct for the mistakes of his predecessors.\u003Cp\u003EGiven that you are banning quick-saving for this game, we can expect to see quite a bit of the same thing: Kerbals stranded due to insufficient fuel, crash landings, highly-energetic docking maneuvers, etc. Therefore, one of the major draws for this kind of a game (and a large part of the reason I signed up) is running missions to correct for these types of mistakes. However, by its nature, this makes pre-planning extremely difficult - how do you fit in a rescue mission to the Mun when the next seven people have independent targets?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne way would be to create a flexible group of \u0022quick response pilots\u0022 whose jobs would be to run rescue missions in between the primary missions, but that would mean that everyone in the main queue could expect to have an essentially clean save file to work with: no mishaps, no need to alter plans from \u0022simulation,\u0022 etc. It would be as if Boatmurdered had had a couple of ringers come in and take control of the fortress every time the elephants started getting out of hand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, you could just ignore failed missions: leave Jeb stranded on the Mun while Bill heads for Minmus and Bob to Duna. This seems a little contrary to the spirit, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only other way I can see for handling things is that you just have to treat the entire structure as flexible, but this means you\u0027d have to give up on being able to give pilots advanced knowledge of their mission objectives. Personally, this would be my choice - keep the order structure as it is, but just base every mission on the outcome of the previous missions. If a pilot gets assigned a mission they\u0027ve never done before and aren\u0027t sure how to accomplish, then it\u0027s a learning experience (for them, and for the next pilot in line who gets to figure out how to rescue them). This type of thing would hold my interest in a way that pre-assigned missions wouldn\u0027t, because I\u0027ve already been everywhere in the game. I know how to get to Moho, how to return from Eve, how to dock, etc., and I\u0027ve done all of them do death. What would be more interesting would be needing a targeted landing on Tylo to retrieve a stranded pilot, or docking with a derelict ship in Eeloo orbit and pushing it home, or any of ten thousand other possibilities that arise organically in a succession game like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESadly, this wasn\u0027t one of the options in your poll; hence, why I didn\u0027t vote. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand my response\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EStochasty I totally agree with everything you are saying. That is exactly the experience I am trying to create. That is why I split the missions into primary and secondary objectives. The primary objectives are the planned goals of KRAK. The \u0022five year plan\u0022 if you will. The secondary objectives are exactly what you describe. The \u0022Oh ****!\u0022 rescue missions and corrections of previous failures. I think we are definitely on the same page as far as what we want to see happen here. I know I said that I would assign everyone\u0027s missions early but practically I think I am really only going to be able to come up with a mission 2-3 missions in advance. Any further and the missions just start becoming general long term goals rather than clear and specific objectives. With this setup I think it will definitely organically develop to a point where there are missions that are purely for rescue. I can also conceive of situations where someone\u0027s Primary objectives may have to be postponed due to a previous mission failure. At that point their primary objective will become fixing the problem that is holding their mission up. I hope that people can remain flexible on these missions as I am hoping that complete chaos will develop over time. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre there any lingering concerns or people who decided to leave?
