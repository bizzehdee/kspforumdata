Either use a life support mod, like Snacks!, or assume each colonist will need 0.04 units of ore per person per day. Ore that\u0027s already been eaten can be flushed. Colonists with no food for 30 days starve and die.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Unlike the brave, bold explorers, colonists need space. Each colonist needs either a full Mk1 passenger cabin,\u00A0half a HitchHiker, or 1/6th of a mk3 passenger module to themselves. Colonists without sufficient space become krazy kolonists\u00A0after 30 days and are worth zero habitation\u00A0points, but are still worth recovering. Command modules and science labs do not prevent colonists from becoming krazy, but science labs still score Because SCIENCE! points for research done. Explorers still ignore this requirement.
