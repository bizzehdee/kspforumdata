Laythe hates me. My lander is a adapter cone plus short rockomax tank, 2 small solid boosters with winglets, powered by an aerospike and 2 twitches. Getting up through the atmosphere is terrible, usually between 6-8km it tries to flip and spiral. I\u0027ve gotten out of the atmosphere by maintaining a lower thrust/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E until reaching 25km, but then I can\u0027t really gain much from the gravity turn. I feel like the atmosphere is soupier than kerbin even though it\u0027s supposed to be thinner. What\u0027s the secret to getting off of laythe?\n\nEdit - Nvm, I did it. I had to reload and perform more precise aerobraking and a final tumbling, Bob-toasting entry. It saved enough fuel to squeak back into orbit.\n\nNow Vall will require the carrier to burn down into a much lower orbit. Cutting ever closer fuel margins...\n\nUpdate - Vall complete after multiple terribly close calls (4dv left in lander upon rendezvous), many reloads, and a Rapid Planned Deconstruction - I had to intentionally smash off a part of the lander via lithobraking to lighten it for the return to orbit (and reduce the fuel needed to land). This game really teaches some creativity... \n\n2nd to last update - all moons complete, crew rendezvoused in Jool orbit and ready to burn home.

The vacuum lander starts off with an additional 4,000 m/s booster for Tylo. The mothership has enough fuel to refill the vacuum lander three times; the booster brings it (full) to Tylo\u0027s surface. 4,200 m/s is enough to take it back to the mothership. It refuels, flies to Vall and back, refuels, flies to Bop and back, refuels, flies to Pol and back. In between moon visits, Bob resets the science experiments for maximum science yield.\n\nAll in all it could probably have been a bit more efficient still - my transfers from Laythe to Bop and to Pol were a bit sloppy, and the return from Laythe to Kerbin was horrible.

Since I started a new job and moved to live on my own, I have much less time for KSP and I think that it would be best for someone with more time to take over the Jool 5 Challenge.  **I\u0027m officially closing for new entries on the release day of the Making History expansion (March 13).**  With all of the new features I think the Jool 5 will need some significant updates, and could even have a mission from the mission builder!  Thanks everyone for the continued support and ongoing entries to the challenge.  You all have pushed the boundaries and delivered with creativity and quality.\n\nIf you are interested in taking over or contributing in the future, please let me know."},{"CreatedByName":"foobar","CreatedById":175397,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-10T16:38:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 54 minutes ago, sdj64 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@foobar](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/175397-foobar/) Congratulations, you have completed the Jool 5 Challenge on Level 1!
