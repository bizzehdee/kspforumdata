The experiment seemed to implode, severely damaging the laboratory. It was sheer luck that none of my science team were close enough to be harmed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoon afterwards, the Quartermaster came rushing in, obviously upset. He reported that a whole 2.5m orange fuel tank, which had been leaning against the wall in the stores adjacent to the lab, had simply vanished. Completely disappeared!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was able to offer him no explanation. But later this afternoon, we realised that the tank had a probe core attached. So, in hope more than expectation, we sent it a message, and incredibly, it responded. And even more incredibly, it reported its location as being on the surface of the planet Eve!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat has happened today is entirely inexplicable, based on how we currently understand the universe to work, and we desperately need to examine this in great detail. To that end, I need you to go to Eve, pick up that tank, and bring it back to KSC. I need it back intact; completely undamaged, and completely full of the same fuel it currently contains. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realise these tanks are heavy when full, and that Eve has a punishing atmosphere and gravity, but I have every confidence in your ability to complete this task. The whole of Kerbalkind is relying on you.

But you must show evidence that you landed any craft which you used to lift the tank or fly it into LEO (including any surface refuelers). This challenge requires heavy ships, and landing those safely and accurately can be almost as hard as getting them off the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Mechjeb/KER etc are fine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Pretty much any parts mods are fine (within reason) but will affect your scoring, as detailed in the section below, which is entitled \u0027Scoring\u0027....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScoring:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStart with 10,000 points\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 1 point for every metre of altitude shown on your main screen altimeter just before launch\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 1 point for every tonne of mass just before launch (not including the mass of the orange tank)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B 1500 points if you do not use any modded parts (this challenge is way harder - maybe even impossible - without KAS/IR/5m tanks etc)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor \u002B2500 points, if you use stock only, and you do not use the claw\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere will be separate leaderboards for rockets and planes.
