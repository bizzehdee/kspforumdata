My own entry, I\u0027ll naturally be voting in last place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAeries 4a will be the starting point, ie. I\u0027m expecting every plane here to be able to replicate it\u0027s functionality of getting a single kerbal to LKO, docking, and returning. Anything that can\u0027t do that will very likely see itself at the bottom of my rankings - sorry if I\u0027m being a bit harsh here on the handful of entries which don\u0027t include docking but I see that as core functionality of the Aeries; I can\u0027t see the loss of docking as a positive virtue for stock replacement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAtmospheric qualities:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan it fly better than the Aeries? \u002B1, \u002B2, or \u002B3 (encompasses general flight, takeoff, landing, CoM movement with varying fuel etc)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAsymmetric flameout? -2 - \u003Cem\u003Eunless multiple jets allow for additional functionality beyond that achievable with a single jet\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I don\u0027t see asymmetric flameout as a positive learning experience to be taught, rather a means to an end - asymmetric flameout is the penalty for multiple jets but multiple jets allow for greater payload or faster travel; faced with two planes, both of which can get a single kerbal to orbit and back in similar time but only one of which has asymmetric flameout then I see the single jet design as inherently better)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDocking qualities:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENavball changes orientation when controlling from docking port? -0.5 (I believe this slightly hinders ease of use and intuition of RCS control)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJunior sized docking port? -1 (sorry, know it\u0027s been used quite widely, but I see this as too small for a craft this size - I envisage kerbal IVA transit through docking ports in future \u0026amp; can\u0027t see that possible through junior ports)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERCS unbalanced? -1, or -2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPotential docking obstruction? -1, or -2 (general feel on overall size of craft and likelihood of parts taking out space station solar panels on way in)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEnergy generation:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould it / will it run out of energy? -1, or -2 (general feel of energy generation and battery storage)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExpanded functionality:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan it carry more than the Aeries? \u002B1, or \u002B2 (eg. more kerbals, science, some cargo)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan it go further than the Aeries? \u002B1, or \u002B2 (don\u0027t necessarily see interplanetary travel as requirement for this craft, but Mun/Minmus travel a bonus)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDesign qualities:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToo clippy? -1, -2, or -3 (I\u0027m fairly pragmatic here, alt-f12 clipping is likely too much for me, as could be some standard clipping, it\u0027s a gut feeling around how easy it is to see how the craft is put together and whether or not it feels a bit cheaty)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAction group simplicity? -1, 0, or \u002B1 (remembering multiple action groups is hard, there is great potential in this challenge to simplify the process of going to space today)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAesthetic? \u002B1, or \u002B2 (good looks only achieved by clipping won\u0027t get top marks however)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdequate description field? \u002B1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGeneral faults? -1, or -2 (could be things like missing ladders, obstructed entry/egress, etc)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbort group? \u002B1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAnd finally?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMatt\u0027s special \u0022oooh, this one made me go \u0027oooh\u0027\u0022 bonus point? \u002B1\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T12:16:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MiniMatt\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MiniMatt\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExpanded functionality:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan it carry more than the Aeries? \u002B1, or \u002B2 (eg. more kerbals, science, some cargo)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeeing this, I added a mission I flew just yesterday, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/uF7ts\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Etaking Bob along to Mun\u003C/a\u003E to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71015-BSC-Aeris-4a-Yes-it-s-spaceplane-time%21?p=996373\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post996373\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emy entry\u003C/a\u003E.
