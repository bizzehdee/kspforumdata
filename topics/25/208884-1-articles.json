It has to be able to carry a minimum of 5 10t asteroid mining craft, each with enough Delta V to escape Earth orbit and have plenty to spare to perform course corrections to intercept light to medium asteroids. The design of the craft that it is equipped with is down to you. For a bonus in your paycheck, you can choose to build this station in a position where it can easily get a Moon intercept, as this would serve in our best interests. Another bonus would be getting the space station to be capable of housing at least 5 tourists for extra income!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe will pay for 20% of all costs relative to the mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe will pay you 6 million credits for the space station meeting minimum requirements, an extra 1 million for each bonus. If the contract is not finished 15 years from now, 1 million credits will be subtracted for every 6 months delay. We will use the asteroid mining craft ourselves, but you will receive 25% of all profits generated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe very much hope you shall be interested and hope to hear your reply soon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYours,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChairman of Acorn Aeronautics, Second Hand Rocket Science\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-27T23:35:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThread closed by \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.
