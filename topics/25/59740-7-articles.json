Few times i managed to bring the aircraft to full stop but never it was standing on the 3 wheels and always there was at least one bit missing.

This is however fully conscious as flying it from a chase perspective gave me very little visual input regarding the position of the plane - i.e. the direction of thrust - in relation to its prograde vector.

But it also requires more air. I tried several designs featuring 2 radial intakes on the sides of the craft, but they generated so much drag that achieving \u002B1200 m/s was a challenge. The centered radial intake in the front took many tries to perfect. Just a few steps up or down in the SPH and the intake would generate drag either pulling the plane towards the ground or towards the sky, making it impossible to fly above 500 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere has been talk about engines in this thread and the fact is that the stock TurboJet is the best for \u0026gt; 1000 m/s flight. The B9 engines all cut out between 1100 - 1430 m/s meaning at 1000 m/s they are at 1 thrust multiplier and at 1430 they are at 0. The stock Turbojets however 0 out at 2400 m/s and achieve multiplier 1 at 1000 m/s. This means that when the B9 engines cut out, the TurboJet still enjoys around 75% of its thrust capacity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you wanna go fast you must use the stock TurboJet.

As explained in my flight note, simply deviating outside the green prograde vector on the navball at speed will end in complete disintegration due to drag forces applied to the craft parts. Some parts even explode due to the impact with the air. My design features control surfaces for the purpose of stabilizing the craft at speed. These also help move the center of lift back slightly which helps tremendously in landing the craft and flying it at slower speeds. Stability is even more of an issue on the return flight as this design is very rear heavy. This is also why I drop the engines - or at least tried to \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E with the reduced weight, it is easier to fly and land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may think putting rudder(s) on your craft will achieve stability and you\u0027d be right, but it puts unnecessary drag on your craft and your top speed will likely be \u0026lt; 1300 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECraft shape\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried long thin and circular designs and none of them match up to the wide and flat design initially shown by \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/%252%24s\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESevant\u003C/a\u003E. I have also experimented with different fairing shapes and while the length of the procedural fairings do not seem to matter for speed, the longer fairings can help move the center of mass forward.

I\u0027m still trying to determine the appropriate craft shape that can net me Mach 2, while still looking like a reasonable plane. Eventually, I\u0027ll try to run the numbers on thrust efficiency at these altitudes, because the given engines seem to make a remarkable difference in performance (so far the F119s seem to be the best).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe F119 is most efficient and seems good, but the TurboJet is king above 1000 m/s. The F119 won\u0027t even reach 1200 m/s as it cuts off before then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheHengeProphet\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TheHengeProphet\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethat causes the stock engines to have a peak velocity of 41800 m/s?
