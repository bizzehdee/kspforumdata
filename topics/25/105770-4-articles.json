I didn\u0027t think a Rapier could push that much mass to orbit.\n\nThanks. Took me every evening since my failed Laythe attempt to work out that design. Went trough a lot of iterations to figure out especially:\n\n- Optimal placement of each component, to keep thrust through CoM and keep the CoM from moving too much when fuel is drained\n- How much wing is needed and at what angle to the body, to keep drag as small as possible while passing through the Mach barrier.\n\nWould probably have saved a lot of time doing this with a 2:2 engine layout. Would have been so much easier to get thrust through CoM. A 1:1 layout is much like a rocket with boosters only on one side. Kinda like the Space Shuttle.\n\n[Some concepts I tried](https://plus.google.com/\u002BValDraaken/posts/YE8NKgXgJyX).\n\nActually. I may give some new 2:2 or 3:3 designs a go.

One trick I\u0027ve learned for VTOL Rapier-powered craft if you want to lift a bit more with them is to burn in closed cycle mode off the pad, this gives a higher TWR until you accumulate enough speed to switch back to air-breathing mode and keep climbing (Not my trick, someone used it in the payload fraction challenge).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m half way through my SSTL mission now.\n\u003E [http://imgur.com/a/PT7J7](http://imgur.com/a/PT7J7)\n\nYou are a more patient player than me, that escape from Kerbin took some time.

Point at the node and you risk grazing the atmo and losing precious speed, point prograde and Pe gets raised too high, wasting Oberth effect. Cool that we arrived at the same solution independently.\n\nWell done with your Laythe ascent, clever move to make the mode switch when you did to minimize excess LF or O.

By getting flung outward after the Tylo flyby you can tune your Jool apoapsis and thereby your arrival time at Laythe\u0027s orbit to whenever Laythe will be there. It\u0027s pretty universal as long as your Jool approach isn\u0027t too far out of Tylo\u0027s orbital plane. I tried paths that get flung inward but they make getting a future encounter much harder. I\u0027m also going to try your suggestion of taking off with the Rapier in closed mode, in open cycle it sits there for about 10 seconds spooling up before it even moves.\n\nNefrums- Very nice mission so far, that is a lot of dV still in the tank after returning to orbit from Laythe. It\u0027ll be interesting to see what you do with it.\n\nselfish\\_meme- I\u0027ll try that too. I want to find the limit of the dV I can get to orbit with a single Rapier using a vertical ascent, I suspect the maximum possible is around 1600m/s but it would take about 2300m/s to do a Laythe-and-return. \n\n It looks to me like the fastest you can get in air-breathing mode with the Rapier is about 1500m/s on Kerbal (without exploding, anyway).
