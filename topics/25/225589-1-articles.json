However, Wernher von Kerman only designed the plane to have enough fuel for half the trip, because the space program was on a tight budget. The plane can do seriously sharp turns and transfer fuel to identical planes while flying though. Luckily for Jeb, Gene managed to rope Bob and Bill in as \u0022willing\u0022 helpers to fly two identical copies of the plane. How can Jeb fly around Kerbin without him or his helpers crashing or landing halfway through?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
