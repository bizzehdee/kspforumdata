Of course, Moho gets the best solar panel power of all the planets, but a Moho day is longer than a Moho year so unless you\u0027re at the poles or constantly moving east, you\u0027ll still need lots of batteries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJool requires lots of delta-V to brake straight into orbit, but you can aerobrake in its upper atmosphere to save fuel and/or use gravity assists from its moons to get where you want to go using less fuel. Of course, said moons can also throw you out of the solar system entirely if you get it wrong!
