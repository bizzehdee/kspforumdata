But in general those planes can\u0027t carry as much mass into orbit as some guy who slapped some stuff on top of a Mammoth, for various reasons. This leads to a lot of \u0022put an orange tank into orbit\u0022 challenges and the like. I\u0027m tired of them...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo here\u0027s a challenge to build spaceplanes that can carry the biggest, heaviest payloads into orbit.

Payloads must be a single unit that doesn\u0027t contribute to the vehicle\u0027s flight (i.e. no thrust or fuel can be consumed from it; electricity and reaction wheels are acceptable);\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. The craft must be able to land, intact, on Kerbin after payload deployment (landing at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E not required, landing need not be horizontal);\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. The payload must be deployed into at least a 100x100km orbit around Kerbin;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. Payloads cannot include ore (empty ore tanks are acceptable, but not ones with anything in them);\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7. For purposes of fairness, only stock craft are legal, but flight info and autopilots (e.g. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E, MechJeb) are fair game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8.

I was toying with the idea of creating a similar challenge myself. I would like to make an argument for ore as cargo\u00A0though. Many people raise objections regarding\u00A0the utility of lifting ore to orbit, and while I tend to agree in most circumstances, I think cargo spaceplanes present one scenario where lifting ore could have merits. If you have a craft using cargo bays, and said craft is capable of lifting more mass than the amount of\u00A0fuel that can be crammed into\u00A0the\u00A0bays, then it makes sense to use ore lifted to an orbital refinery when\u00A0using the craft as a tanker. This allows for the maximum amount of fuel to be lifted in a single flight. There is also something to be said for the versatility of using ore as a storage medium in an orbital refueling station. Raw ore can be converted to varying combinations of fuel, allowing for different types of craft to be refueled at the same station without any of the storage space having been wasted. In truth, I\u0027m only making these arguments to benefit my own entries, which weren\u0027t\u00A0designed for this challenge, but were\u00A0the inspiration for my intended challenge. They also have multiple cargo bays, which means that the cargo is carried up in 2 pieces (not sure if this is rule breaking), but I dock them together for deployment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSubmission the first:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCzar Galactica Mk4\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/NoobTool/Czar-Galactica-Mk-4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://kerbalx.com/NoobTool/Czar-Galactica-Mk-4\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/5fKEk\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/5fKEk\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00220o7uO6u.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0o7uO6u.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCapable of lifting 301.8 tons to the required 100km orbit, then returning to land at the runway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second submission I will add later.
