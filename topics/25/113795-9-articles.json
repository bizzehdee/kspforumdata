I\u0027m not very familiar with those terms. (Cd, cross section (that one\u0027s fairly self explanatory though)... etc.)\n\nCd is drag coefficient or something like that. The higher, the more drag (note that it is not drag, and flying at higher speed with lower Cd usually still means higher drag - it is merely something along the lines of \u0022drag, with speed and alt not taken into consideration\u0022).\n\nShockwaves, etc. are most likely explained in the vids, but can\u0027t currently watch them, due to bad internet connection."},{"CreatedByName":"Halsfury","CreatedById":54576,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T21:47:17Z","Content":"@ Darth\n\nThis is how I finally found an aesthetically pleasing solution, it does make the wingtips more pointed so lower speed turns can result in wingtip drops.\n\n![oC5bvp4.png](http://i.imgur.com/oC5bvp4.png)\n\nIt\u0027s been area ruled to .89m^2 wave drag area and has a pretty nice flying character overall"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T21:54:10Z","Content":"\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/atItRcfFwgw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nLets see if this works"},{"CreatedByName":"Halsfury","CreatedById":54576,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T22:08:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E realy those little wingsection? wow ... very strange.
