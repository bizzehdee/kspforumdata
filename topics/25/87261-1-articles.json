Inspired when doing just simple contract and accidently landing on top of the VAB. What was planed for was to land close to the centre of KSC and complete some easy science. The second time around the craft looked like it would catch the edge of the VAB and the chute would cut causing it to fall from the top. But came very close, just skimming it, that side of the building needed to be wiped, and landing right beside the VAB West doors. Now kerbals and buildings are both in peril, ahmmm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this a worthy challenge? So how to make this into a challenge? How to keep track other than screen capture? There has to be some sort of risk and more risk more points.
