I always leave the altitudes set to whatever the builder had them. There are advantages and disadvantages to setting high or low preferred altitudes. High altitudes have the advantage of being able to dive on their opponent, and low altitudes can get into position faster. I think it should be left up to the builder.\n\u003E Anyways, I arranged a bout between your Helion III-B and the F-4 Destroyer Mk3. It went similar to the fight with the Vulture. The Helion ate missiles early, but was a beast once it got up to altitude and started dive bombing.\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://youtu.be/1bGVpS5nZqo](https://youtu.be/1bGVpS5nZqo)\n\u003E \n\u003E F-4 Destroyer Mk3 available here: [http://pastebin.com/XEDbqyXj](http://pastebin.com/XEDbqyXj)\n\nThis is what I wanted - a fantastic showdown at the end, one plane left on each team and fuel was starting to run low in a prolonged fight which tested both planes and produced a decisive result.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Well, I will keep an eye on this, it seems very cool.\n\u003E By the way, how do you plan to match fights, everybody x everybody?\n\u003E \n\u003E Also, 3 best out of 5 seems a bit more reliable, at least a bit less random.\n\u003E \n\u003E Everybody should tweak their own AI and weapons managers, but there should be limits for things like range and angle.\n\u003E \n\u003E About mods, I would love to have it on FAR, but stock is not bad and on FAR the AI can suicide if you tweak it to be too close to it\u0027s limits, something an human pilot would handle much better.\n\nThe original format plan is a knockout tournament, so 16 or 32 designs in a cup format, conducted by multiple streamers over a few days or weeks. I\u0027ve also now proposed a King of the Hill format, where you start a thread, post a craft file and let challengers take it on, making videos of the contests.\n\nBest of 5/ first to 3 seems reasonable, and in one-sided contests they\u0027ll be over in under 15 minutes (I find they tend to take 5 minutes a round), running to about 20-25 for longer. That\u0027s about right for a YouTube video.\n\nAngle has to be 360 otherwise they fly off and never see each other, starting back-to-back as we do by convention. Range will always by 5km, setting it shorter makes no sense. AI settings are up to the user, but altitude of 5km max seems likely.
