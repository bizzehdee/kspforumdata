The two nearly empty tanks have exactly the same amount of fuel.

So far, my own mission is the only one to utilize a serious degree of orbital docking, refueling and the likes. Norcalplanner at least refueled in space, anyone else just went with a single launch. That was not what I had in mind, but that\u0027s how it worked out. And I\u0027m not gonna change the rules with a dozen-odd missions already done. Besides, I\u0027m trying to not make people play in a certain way (the stockish lifter requirement is already a big demand); as it seems, hardly anyone will bother with docking and refueling if they don\u0027t have to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, several of these entries can still serve as inspiration if you\u0027re looking for low part count.

I\u0027m sure one could make do with a much simpler throw-away rocket. I\u0027d also recommend to split the mission: one launch for the Eve lifter only, the other is bringing the crew, return vessel, and any rovers, gliders and whatnot you may want to use. And of course, refueling in orbit rather than taking it all up in one go.

My approach was to have a common core using the fat/flat tank with 8x Jr docking port in symetery mode \u002B 8x 48-7s \u002B 1 centrally mounted 48-7s, but each core section already end up having a partcount of 18.... using that for asparagus staging and that quickly bog down the system (vs 3 with the FT400\u002BFT800\u002BAerospike).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I went back to the drawing board and after some research and turn out the Aerospike build is the best compromise between DV, TWR and parts count for my rig (I5-2500k \u002B 8GB \u002B GTX660 TI)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eas the the DV being tight... well this thing still seem plenty of leg left to it, the TWR creeps up with each stage while the DV boost get lower, so it seems I can actually add at least another 7x stages (each stage being FT400\u002BFT800\u002BAerospike x2) before adding more stage add little if any DV... 8x stages would have been another 2 full onion rings and probably still fit within the VAB circle rule so If i end up having to do a sloppy ineffeicient manual eve ascent that\u0027s a brute force approach that would add at least another 1000 atmosphere DV. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact let me toy with that tonight to see what\u0027s the break even point.... but that\u0027s definitely kind of the asparagus ad infinium thing.....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly what did you meant by being able to edit node while fully zoomed in?
