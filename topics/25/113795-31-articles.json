A lot has changed since this thread started!\n\nI no longer use infernal robotics since BahamutoD created a missile rack. I\u0027ve also cut down on related mods, and changed the way that I shape wings to work with FAR\u0027s new calculations.\n\nHere\u0027s my Lockheed Martin F-X design. Internal weapons, supermaneuverable, supercruises, the works. It\u0027s also built to scale, so it\u0027s larger than most KSP planes. LM borrowed the V tail and shielded engine design from Northrop. Ideally I\u0027d have V-shaped intakes on the side.\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/F1KG0/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nLockheed F-23. I rebuilt this one using MK2 parts and built it to scale. [The original](http://imgur.com/a/n5lAt#0)used procedural parts. Supermaneuverable, supercruises, slightly heavier due to the empty weight of the mk2 parts and the huge wings. I think this would have been an amazing air superiority fighter if the air force had just given it a chance. C\u0027est la vie.\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/kyWkf/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nMikoyan MiG-35. This is Mikoyan\u0027s attempt to stay relevant in a 5th generation world that\u0027s about to move on to the 6th generation. It\u0027s a MiG-29 with the best electroincs that Mikoyan and Sukhoi have available. Its reedeeming value is that it\u0027s inexpensive at less than half the price of a western fighter, and it can operate from carriers. Its downside is that it has no stealth, no sensor fusion, comparatively limited maneuverability, and a poor reliability record. But it looks cool!\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/4H4bC/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nBoeing\u0027s F/A-XX design has changed a couple of times. I\u0027d say they have a snowball\u0027s chance in hell of actually winning the F/A-XX contract over Northrop or Lockheed, but at least they\u0027re trying! This semi-flying-wing design is supermaneuverable, highly stable, and sports 6 internal missiles.\n\nHere\u0027s the painted black version I posted a couple of pages ago. Here\u0027s one painted in the grey that Boeing uses:\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/j9hmB/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nFinally, my favorite, the Northrop Grumman FA-XX design. I think that this has the best chance of being selected by the navy for the FA-XX program, but less of a chance of being selected for the air force\u0027s F-X program. My replica\u0027s not perfect: I added tail feathers underneath the engine, whereas the original design has a perfectly flat underside. I tried to use a flat design, but I wasn\u0027t able to without resizing the panther engines so I compromised.\n\nHighly maneuverable, but not supermaneuverable. 4 internal missiles. Arguably the stealthiest design, and the by far the most ambitious. It\u0027d be awesome to see a flying wing fighter in service.\n\nThis design is very difficult to build in KSP with FAR because of the high sweep, high wing loading, and general flying wing instability.\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/aQU7X/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nThe V-tailed fighters are the easiest to fly and most fun to dogfight in. The Boeing design is competitive with them. The MiG and Grumman are simply not as good in a dogfight with the AI piloting. The Grumman can be competitive if piloted by a human."},{"CreatedByName":"theend3r","CreatedById":97560,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-19T14:35:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 20. \u00FAnor 2016 at 6:31 PM, CrisK said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I updated my fighters today for the latest version of BDArmory.

It passes Mach 1 at 2.5km at only 1/3 throttle as well, but I didn\u0027t actually test maximum non-afterburning speed below 5km.\n\n![Feh4hAm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Feh4hAm.jpg)\n\nWith afterburners, it limps to just about Mach 2.9, which is above flameout speed when not afterburning. However, this was with a rather huge amount of fuel, as you can see in the first screen it has a whopping 3,200km range on the fuel load at 7 minutes in. I believe the PAK-FA has a range of 1,500km with a combat load (Or is projected to), so it is a bit excessive. It can easily pull the necessary Gs as well, though I again did not capture those. My favorite part of the design is that it can near-instantly recover from even massive stalls, including a flatspin at 50m/s induced by an overly aggressive snap roll. Just need to knock the kinks out and get it supermaneuverable, then the airframe is complete and I can get to weapons. Thankfully a small shift in wing area can probably give me the mostly neutral stability I need.\n\nEDIT: Well it has \u003E1.0 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. And absolutely silly amounts of post stall maneuvering. If I weren\u0027t so twitchy with the throttle I could\u0027ve landed it on its tail! Still no cobras unfortunately.\n\nEDIT2: Well I\u0027ll be damned. Due to a botched takeoff (Me yanking on the stick too hard), I lost an engine.

At such low speed it\u0027s basically able to helicopter across the terrain.\n\nEDIT3: Aha! Finally got a Cobra. Well, I think it was.

Also did some somersaults. I believe I have demonstrable supermaneuverability.\n\nEDIT4: Well, it can invert its orientation near-instantly at low speeds, and very quickly at high speeds. Easily capable of Gs, can be broken up at above M0.9 with a max-pitch control applied without leading into it. Supermaneuverable, not sure how to screenshot that however. Adding supermaneuverability reduced supercruise to Mach 1.9 and top speed with afterburners to Mach 2.85-ish. Speeds shown here, links only for brevity: Supercruise: [http://i.imgur.com/PqnGeN9.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/PqnGeN9.jpg) With Afterburners (Maximum Speed): [http://i.imgur.com/f7kL690.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/f7kL690.jpg)\n\nDoes BDArmory work in 1.1.3? At least, enough to put the weapons on?\n\nEDIT5: Well it would seem scooting the intakes back about a meter HALVED my wave-drag area. Unfortunately it means the intake\u0027s model clips into the engine... Aside from looking weird, is that a problem?\n\nEDIT6: Alright some new pics for proof. Supercruise is back to Mach 2, have a pic of sustained tailslide for proof of supermaneuverability, supercruise below 5km, and \u003E1TWR.\n\nSpoiler\n\n![pnUWcWD.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/pnUWcWD.jpg)\n\nSupercruising below 5km. Easily making the minimum sub-5km max speed.\n\n![GnFJDFN.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/GnFJDFN.jpg)\n\nJust barely a Mach 2 supercruise at 10km. Thank you area rule tweaking.\n\n![Ijybq35.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Ijybq35.jpg)\n\nAlmost Mach 2.9 top speed in general. Extremely touchy, and almost no maneuvering can be done for fear of aerodynamic failure at such speeds.\n\n![f9aevvo.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/f9aevvo.jpg)\n\nEasily climbing vertically, can do so until about 5km.\n\n![YPtBvA8.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/YPtBvA8.jpg)\n\nA sustained tailslide, can be done indefinitely given careful throttle management. Punching the throttle allows it to pull out without an attitude change, as can be seen by the above shot. Proof of supermaneuverability, if I\u0027m not mistaken.\n\n![HRLf9yd.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/HRLf9yd.jpg)\n\nIt can very easily pull in excess of 6 Gees above Mach 1. If the airframe could actually survive turns above 10 Gees at this speed it could even pull that off. As can be seen by the miniscule pitch control, I was using a joystick. Considering the tiny pitch needed at this speed, I assume I don\u0027t need a specific 9 Gees subsonic picture?
