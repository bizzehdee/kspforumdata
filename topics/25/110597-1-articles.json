Sorry, but I just don\u0027t really have anything to offer. \n\nThat being said, if anybody else is willing to offer a reward, then that would be great.\n\n---\n\nHave fun! This is meant to be a challenge to get everybody to try out new things in KSP. Too often do we get stuck in a single mindset, focused on a singular task like finding a way to slingshot around every planet and into the sun. There is a lot of fun stuff that you can do in this game, and it would be a real shame to miss out on any of it.\n\nI don\u0027t really use these forums, so if you want to make a comment that you wish for me to see, please make it here: [http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/3724di/the_kerbal_joint_strike_fighter_xplane_challenge/](http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/3724di/the_kerbal_joint_strike_fighter_xplane_challenge/)"}]}
