The craft features a drone core so it can fly unmanned, and has a set of RTGs in the aft cargo compartment which can keep the reaction wheels going at night. The aft cargo compartment also has a docking port to detach or secure any payloads.\n\nMost of the development costs were a single sub-orbital flight which I intended to fly all the way back to the KSC, but I got fed up flying a straight-and-level cruise for 20 minutes and ditched my test craft into the sea. (Note to self, engines are expensive to replace.)\n\nIn case of a catastrophic emergency or loss of control, the craft has an abort system which shuts down all of the engines, deploys the airbrakes, and arms the parachutes for deployment under 8,000m. This can also be useful in case of a missed approach.\n\nTakeoff procedure:\n\nSAS on, full thrust. Release brakes, and rotate off the runway to 5 degree pitch up.\n\nLet aircraft gain speed up to 250m/s, climb at 20 degree pitch angle until 8,000m.\n\nAt 8,000m, switch SAS to prograde and allow it to pitch down to 5-10 degrees over the horizon.\n\nEngage LV-T45\u0027s at 18km by staging. They will work together with the jets until they flame out at 23km, after which, slowly pitch up to 20km and burn towards 75km apoapsis.\n\nFrom there, coast to Ap and circularize.\n\nRe-entry is gentle: Shoot for a Pe between 50km and 30km, and keep a 5 to 10 degree nose up angle. You can engage the jets below 20km to re-estabilish high altitude cruise at Mach 3.5 and fly to your intended landing site.\n\nAction groups:\n\n1 - Toggle solar panels\n\n2 - Swap engines (shut down jets, engage LV-T45\u0027s and vice versa).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-01T21:11:54Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2015 09:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Stoney3K**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-01T21:19:01Z","Content":"All right. I think I\u0027m ready to try the Haste-Long Range SSTO.\n\nI hope SpaceplaneAddict doesn\u0027t mind, but I\u0027ve made a few modifications.\n\nRemoved radiators.\n\nRemoved fuel lines.\n\nDisabled all control for vertical stabilizers.\n\nDisabled yaw and roll for canards.\n\nDisabled all control for outer two sets of trailing edge control surfaces.\n\nDisabled yaw and roll for inner set of trailing edge control surfaces.\n\nDisabled yaw and pitch for second set of trailing edge control surfaces.\n\nChanged Rapiers to Manual Switching.\n\nChanged rear brake torque to 24. (Just a hunch.)\n\n**Update**:\n\nMade orbit. She flew quite well so far, but I lost the solar panels due to overheating.\n\nOn only the nuke, she has a TWR of about .26 but 3335 m/s.\n\nNo docking equipment on the craft, so I\u0027ll do a rendezvous and the two kerbals can EVA over to the station for crew rotation.\n\nNo solar panels, so I\u0027ll have to land with whatever is left in the Cockpit.\n\nOK. Rendezvous at 100x100 went fine. Only 91.38 power left for reentry though. Here we go.\n\nGot interrupted by RL. Finally starting descent. Rapier fully charged the battery during the deorbit burn, so power is good.\n\nSuccess! Deadstick landed safely at KSC with 1483 LF and 129 Ox onboard. Maybe the fuel and oxidizer could be counted as cargo? (still well over 7 tonnes of fuel onboard at rendezvous).\n\nHandled fine, but heavy with so much fuel still on board. Ran out of power, but had plenty of control authority. Had to push her down pretty hard to not overshoot, and she responded very nicely.\n\nNo need to worry about fuelling the Rapiers. They draw from all tanks regardless of which mode they are in. And I figured I could just pump from radial tanks if I needed any more liquid fuel for the Nerv**a.** Which, of course, I wouldn\u0027t unless I was going to Duna or something. Lots of long range potential here. I would recommend all the changes I made, and to add a couple of solar panels on the top of the fuselage or wings.\n\nMy ascent was probably too aggressive leading to the loss of the solar panels. I wasn\u0027t sure if I was supposed to keep the pitch at 10 degrees or allow it rise.\n\nSpaceplaneAddict, you now qualify for your Builder\u0027s badge.\n\nCraft cost as outfitted was 56100 funds and recovery value was 48475. The loss of the Gigantor solar panels hurts quite a bit.\n\n![WCgY5os.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/WCgY5os.jpg)\n\nHappy landings!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-02T02:47:25Z\u0022 title=\u002209/02/2015 02:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Starhawk**"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceplaneAddict","CreatedById":149322,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-01T22:35:11Z","Content":"Pefectly fine with that, I encourage you as well to do so.

Toggle all Whiplashs\n\n2. Toggle all Whiplashs and all Intakes\n\n3. Toggle all RAPIERs\n\n4. Switch all RAPIER modes\n\n5. Toggle all NERVs\n\n6. Don\u0027t touch I just remembered it\u0027s broken (was supposed to set elevons to deployment for aerobraking but it\u0027s only set up correctly on one side)\n\nAlso, Brakes will deploy AIRBRAKES as well as wheelbrakes as per normal.\n\nAscent Flightplan:\n\nPre-flight: Disable LF feed from X200-32 tanks (one each side).\n\n1. Activate Whiplashs and RAPIERs (airbreathing)\n\n2. Full throttle. Rotate at 110m/s (near the bottom of the runway, if you run off the end don\u0027t panic), pitch up to 25 degrees.\n\n3. At 7500m alt, reduce pitch to 10 degrees\n\n4. Maintain attitude between 10 - 15 degrees until surface speed approaches 1100m/s (around 21000m altitude). Use action group 3 to activate closed cycle RAPIERs and action group 5 to activate NERVs. Then enable X200-32 LF feeds.\n\n5. When Whiplash thrust drops below 15 per engine (check one), use action group 2 to shut off Whiplashs and close intakes (reduces drag).\n\n6. Allow SAS to hold attitude fixed until Apoapsis exceeds 50,000m, then switch to track prograde.\n\n7. Circularise at approx 72000m. You should be almost out of oxidiser by this time. Shut off RAPIERs and use NERVs only for further manoeuvres.\n\nRe-entry Flightplan:\n\n1. If airbraking from high eccentricity orbit, don\u0027t drop periapsis much below 40,000m or you\u0027ll probably make something blow up. USE THE AIRBRAKES.\n\n2. If you have LF left over, transfer the bulk to the X200-32 tanks for best weight distribution. Use action group 2 to re-enable Whiplashs and Intakes (you won\u0027t need the RAPIERs now).\n\n3. Final re-entry profile should be nice and shallow. Make retro burn from below 90km, set periapsis around 10,000m and expect to land about 1/8th of an orbit short of periapsis.\n\n4. USE THE AIRBRAKES.\n\n5. Don\u0027t steer too hard or you\u0027ll tear the wings off.\n\n6. Take care to touch down gently in a pitch-up attitude greater than 10 degrees. This avoids landing on the nosewheel and minimises airspeed at touchdown.\n\nFinal notes:\n\nThe plane is very responsive to steering once it\u0027s shed its wet weight, and it\u0027s got a heck of a lot of lift. Despite its size, you should be able to land safely at 50-60m/s without fearing a stall.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-02T13:47:08Z\u0022 title=\u002209/02/2015 01:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by The\\_Rocketeer**\n  \nwrong engine name (Wheesley)"},{"CreatedByName":"Vegetal","CreatedById":147251,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-02T06:08:14Z","Content":"Well, here goes mine without any testing.\n\nCraft File: [http://1drv.ms/1ihpsyv](http://1drv.ms/1ihpsyv)\n\n![low9GGF.png](http://i.imgur.com/low9GGF.png)\n\nThe Space Whale 1. With a wide landing gear base, tail-strike protection wheel and simple control surfaces, it is (hopefully) easy to manage.\n\nInstructions: Action 0 is Rapier Switch.\n\nOn take off, it should rotate easily, and the tail should be safe. It is a little underpowered, so I recommend staying shallow right after take off, otherwise, it\u0027s probably a normal SSTO ascent. Once in LKO it should have enough fuel to rendezvous with a station on pretty much any orbit, maybe it can even orbit the Mun.\n\nOn reentry, I recommend keeping the airbrakes open and prograde hold, avoid trying to correct the trajectory above 500 m/s, just let it glide until it\u0027s a safe speed to maneuver. It has plenty of LF, so even if you end up far from KSC, it will probably have enough fuel to get there.

Flying in sandbox so I can\u0027t just subtract recovery..)\n\nNo deaths or damage.\n\nI called this the Space Whale 1a because I topped up the monoprop tank. In the event I didn\u0027t need the extra dV, but it also helped with the CoM/CoL gap. That\u0027s all.\n\nAscent was straightforward, I adopted a 20 degree pitch from rotation, dropping to 15 degrees at 5000m and 10 degrees at 10000m to gain thrust. Slight underspeed caused an engine flameout. Consequently had to switch modes at suboptimal velocity, but completed ascent safely.\n\nOrbited once to phase for station encounter. Docked and stayed so for another 6 or so orbits because the sun had set at KSC and I prefer to land in daylight.\n\nReentry was fine except the cockpit nearly blew up. I tried to keep the prograde tracking on for as long as possible, but lost faith at 20,000m with the heat bar nearly full (check the pics) and pulled up slightly. I think I must\u0027ve had a better glide profile last time, because I also seemed to descend and slow much more quickly, and consequently had to spend an extra 400 LF or so cruising to the runway. In true Kerbal style, I had a horrible moment where I thought I was going to overshoot the runway or break off a wing, but managed to get the plane down intact.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

The plane wants to roll off vertical when gliding, nearly ruined our day on final approach. I guess its because the CoM is higher than the CoL. Might be an idea to put the wings above the windows rather than below.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-02T19:59:35Z\u0022 title=\u002209/02/2015 07:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by The\\_Rocketeer**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-02T20:15:45Z","Content":"I like that docking technique I will have to try that sometime.

From your album, it still has plenty of fuel for a higher orbit rendezsvous.\n\nAs for the notes, 1 - That\u0027s why I put extra LF there. Better waste some fuel than having dead kerbals! And 2 - If I did that, I would have to change the landing gear setup, and that would be another plane completely. If I design something now, it will be a more ambitious project ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\nWhen I gave my instructions for reentry, they were more like guidelines. I usually pitch up a little from prograde myself with most of my designs, so you did the right thing. I will tell you one thing though: You are a monoprop guzzler! You used half of it, I\u0027m impressed ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nAnyway, congrats on the flight man, I\u0027ll have a try later in your design if the framerates allow.\n\nAnd Nich....what technique?"}]}
