Problem is, the oil companies have rights to all the ore on Kerbin, and the KSC doesn\u0027t want to risk a lawsuit. So they have to find sources of ore in space to meet demand.\n\nThis is a challenge with a simple goal: return as much fuel to Kerbin as possible while using as little as possible.\n\nRules:\n\nNo cheating (infinite fuel, Hyperedit, config file editing, etc.)\n\nYou can use any fuel type in your mission.\n\nMods are allowed as long as they are not more efficient than stock parts. Informational and decorative mods are allowed. Mechjeb is allowed.\n\nYou may not make use of any existing craft in your save file, all crafts used in this challenge must be launched new.\n\nYou may use any number of craft, but you must total the fuel in all of your crafts.\n\nYou do not have to return all of your fuel all at once.\n\nYou cannot mine for ore on Kerbin\u0027s surface. Any other ore source is allowed, including asteroids.\n\nScore:\n\nMass of resources returned to Kerbin / Mass of resources used\n\nMass of fuels in tons per unit, for scoring purposes:\n\nLiquid Fuel: .005\n\nOxidizer: .005\n\nMonopropellent: .004\n\nXenon Gas: .0001\n\nSolid Fuel: .0075\n\nOre: .01\n\nClarification: You can start with Xenon and Solid Fuel in your ship, even though you can\u0027t refine them, they count against \u0022Mass of fuel used\u0022. You can just return raw ore if you want, or you can convert it.\n\nAnyone who completes this challenge gets the wonderful badge below.\n\n![aSFpK0L.png](http://i.imgur.com/aSFpK0L.png)\n\n[noparse][![aSFpK0L.png](http://i.imgur.com/aSFpK0L.png)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119293-Fuel-Return-Challenge?p=1903042#post1903042)[/noparse]\n\nHigh Scores:\n\n1. sdj64 - 0.282\n\nMy attempt, as an example:\n\nResources used: 162.23 tons\n\nResources returned: 45.7 tons\n\nScore = 0.282\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Also the scoring is really confusing. Oxidizer weighs more then Liquid Fuel, so there should be more points for oxidizer returns. You might get submits if it\u0027s harder and you have a badge."},{"CreatedByName":"SanderB","CreatedById":83050,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T20:28:51Z","Content":"Have you thought about making an attempt yourself first? Getting back and forth to the mun\u0027s surface isn\u0027t easy. Why would anyone take the challenge serious if you haven\u0027t attempted it yourself? And obviously xenon and solid-fuel can\u0027t be produced on the mun."},{"CreatedByName":"sdj64","CreatedById":100819,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T00:31:50Z","Content":"The other fuels are there because you can start with them, but I didn\u0027t want them to be free. If they were, then someone would just use an all solid fuel rocket pushing an ion probe that grabs an A-class asteroid and ruins the scoring system. So their weight counts against your starting fuel mass, even though you can\u0027t refine them from ore.\n\nI got the masses of fuel units from the wiki. If they changed them in 1.0 I must not have noticed, what do they weight per unit now?\n\nMy attempt is in progress."},{"CreatedByName":"MunGazer","CreatedById":141954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T01:25:52Z","Content":"It\u0027s a decent challenge. I\u0027d disagree with people that say that it needs to be more difficult to attract entrants. If they want difficulty from this challenge, they need only to seek first place and attempt to hold it. I would agree, however, that there seems to be a correlation between cool looking badge awards and challenge popularity. When people see the 1800\u002B replies for K-Prize, and everyone jumping around in the forums with that badge, they think \u0022oh that\u0027s where all the action is!\u0022. And yeah K-Prize is a fun challenge I intend to achieve somewhere in my long sequence of tinkering with ksp. But I feel like I want to make an entry on every challenge, even if I\u0027m ranked last place. So just like I assured John FX of my future participation in his challenge, I assure you you\u0027ll also have mine.\n\nLike the K-Prize, you could have different levels of achievement, and then a badge that is awarded for a minimum specified performance. Some people just like to earn that badge for a quick sense of achievement, and to have that notion that \u0022hey, I did something. See look\u0022. 1st class miner badge for doing such and such tier of difficult tasks, etc. Your challenge sounds very scientific and Joe average often runs the other way when confronted with big words haha. I like the sciency-ness of it, however.\n\nSome people might be more inclined to check into it if it was called something like \u0022Expert Miner Challenge\u0022 or \u0022The Harvester Trophy\u0022. Just ideas for ya bro, take it with a grain of salt. Wish all those kids out there playing CoD would come play this instead."},{"CreatedByName":"Tangle","CreatedById":66808,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T22:27:15Z","Content":"Does a tweakscaled ISRU unit count as cheating?
