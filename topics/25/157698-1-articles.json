However, we\u0027ve never once flown a fully-reusable human-rated shuttle, and there\u0027s no obvious configuration for a fully-reusable shuttle that uses staging.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn particular, I like the idea of a parallel-stage-to-orbit design, where all the launch engines fire on the pad together, with the orbiter engines continuing to fire through stage separation (think Space Shuttle).

The orbiter can have wings and landing gear, or it can come back and land vertically with landing legs. However, if it is going to land on its tail, then the crew cabin probably needs to be ejectable using landing-abort solids and chutes, since a tail-first vertical landing is a high-risk maneuver. The ideal solution is to have landing engines which (somehow) can vector or change orientation to allow a vertical landing in horizontal attitude, like sci-fi spaceships. This allows minimal-risk landing and immediate egress.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ELifeboat.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EIf the cabin is ejectable, then it makes sense to allow it to act as an orbital lifeboat in the case of orbiter damage a la \u003Cem\u003EColumbia\u003C/em\u003E. However, this means it either needs its own \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and TPS. It may be possible to integrate its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and TPS for use within the orbiter.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAirbreathing.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EShould you use a rocket-combined-cycle airbreathing engine on either stage? It\u0027s a good question. On the one hand, having airbreathing engines on the booster reduces the weight penalty (since they don\u0027t have to go to orbit) and can assist in recovery. Having an airbreathing engine on the orbiter increases weight penalty, but could be helpful for landing since airbreathing engines are more readily vectorable than rocket engines, which must be gimballed. It\u0027s also possible to conceive a partial airbreathing engine, like an air augmentation shroud on the booster which wraps around the orbiter\u0027s launch engine.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAltitude compensation.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EIf the orbiter engine doesn\u0027t have altitude compensation, it will incur a specific impulse penalty. However, aerospike engines are heavy. An SSME pressure-compensated engine is one possibility. Another possibility is to have the orbiter engine interface with the booster body in such a way as to allow a higher expansion ratio after separation. Keep in mind, however, that you may be using the launch engine for recovery as well.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ECargo.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EA cargo bay is not necessarily a requirement, but it definitely adds versatility.

At the risk of succumbing to rule of cool, this really is a lot better than the alternatives. You eliminate the dead weight of landing gear and you have no risk of tip-over. Egress is feasible as well (something that seems ridiculously difficult for a proposal like ITS).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI see three ways of doing this. The first is to have fully rotating engine nacelles like a V22\u00A0Osprey or\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EFirefly\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s ship \u003Cem\u003ESerenity\u003C/em\u003E. Drawback here is additional\u00A0dry mass for the rotation mechanism, as well as moving parts that can fail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother approach is to use an airbreathing engine (turbojet or turborocket) for launch assist and for landing, since turbine exhaust can be easily vectored to 90 degrees or more (think F35B) and rocket exhaust cannot. The drawback here is increased dry mass to orbit; it would be better to use the turbines on the booster than to carry them into orbit every time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe final, and perhaps most interesting approach, is to have altitude-compensated OMS engines for orbital insertion/maneuvering which are aligned perpendicular to the launch thrust axis. These engines wouldn\u0027t fire during launch, but once out of the atmosphere, they could circularize or change orbit without aerodynamic drag. During landing, they would be able to lower the orbiter straight down to the tarmac.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andetch","CreatedById":173643,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-14T18:31:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo a bit unsure of whether we\u0027re talking vert or horizontal launch here, and I made a design.
